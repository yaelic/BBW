          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Caterpillar third quarter 2008 earnings results. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations and I'm very pleased to have our Chairman and CEO Jim Owens, group president Ed Rapp and our CFO Dave Burritt with me on the call.</p>
          <p>This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited.  If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, you can go to the SEC filings area of the investor section of our cat.com website or to the SEC's website, where it will be filed as an 8-K. In addition, certain</p>
          <p>information relating to projections of our results that we'll be discussing today is forward looking and involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that, individually or in the</p>
          <p>aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from our projections discussed here can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1-A, business risk factors of our form 10Q filed with the SEC on August 1, 2008, and also in our safe harbor language contained in today's release.</p>
          <p>Okay, earlier this morning we reported results for the third quarter of 2008. We reaffirmed our outlook for 2008 sales and revenues and profit. And we provided a preliminary outlook for sales and revenues for 2009. In addition, we will be updating the investor section of the cat.com website at the conclusion of this call with dealer sales to end-users. A quick preview of that update is that the three-month moving average of dealer machine sales to users improve in September.</p>
          <p>The last three-month moving average from August was actually down 3% compared with 2007. And the September three-month moving average was actually 1% better than the same three months of</p>
          <p>2007.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let me start this morning's review with third quarter results. Then I'll talk a few minutes about the 2008 outlook, which is, again, essentially the outlook for the fourth quarter. And I'll finish with a few comments about the recent turmoil in the financial markets and how it's affected Caterpillar, and in particular, our captive finance company Cat Financial Services. Then I'm turn the floor over to Jim Owens, and he'll talk about 2009 and our prospects for the future.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's start with the third quarter. Sales and revenues were 13 billion and were up 1.5 billion or about 13% from last year. Profit per share at $1.39 was down a penny from the third quarter of 2007. Of that 1.5 billion increase in sales and revenues, machinery volume was up 591 million. And that volume increase was in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East portion of our EAME, Europe, Africa, Middle East region. Machinery volume in North America and Europe declined. Engine volume was up 242 million and increased in all regions.</p>
          <p>Price realization was 385 million and was up for both machinery and engines in all four geographic regions. Price realization on machinery was positive 164 million. And it was 221 million for</p>
          <p>engines. Another great quarter for engines in particular.</p>
          <p>Currency had a 262 million, positive impact on sales. Now, given that the dollar has strengthened quite a bit over the past couple of months, you may be wondering how or why we're still talking about a weaker dollar versus last year. And the answer is that the average exchange rates for the third quarter of this year still reflect a weaker dollar than the average of the third quarter last</p>
          <p>year. However, based on where the dollar is today, that may not be the case for the fourth quarter, but it still was in Q3.  Finally, rounding out sales and revenues, financial products revenues were up 59 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The profit per share at $1.39, again, was down a penny from last year. The major factors affecting profit were on the positive side, price realization at 385 million. The impact of sales volume net of mix was favorable 153 million. But the price and volume impacts were more than offset by higher costs. Manufacturing costs were up 442 million, most of which was related to higher material and freight costs. We expected material costs would be up, and they were.</p>
          <p>Machinery and engines, SG&amp;A, and R&amp;D costs were up 158 million from the third quarter last year. As a percent of sales, SG&amp;A costs were actually .20% lower and R&amp;D costs were .30% higher. The</p>
          <p>increase in R&amp;D was primarily related to work on tier 4 products. While SG&amp;A and R&amp;D costs were up in dollars from the third quarter of last year, sequentially spending was about flat with the second quarter. Financial products' operating income was down 34 million. And currency impacts on operating income were negative 65 million, but were more than offset by currency exchange gains in the other income line below operating profit.</p>
          <p>One last comment on the third quarter. As has been the pattern for really the entire year, our sales growth has largely come outside of North America. In the third quarter, sales and revenues in North America were up just 3% compared with Asia Pacific at 38%, Latin America at 32, and EAME -- that's Europe, Africa, Middle East -- at 11%. In fact, sales and revenues in North America were just a little under 40% in total.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's a quick summary of the quarter. Let me move on to the full year outlook. We expect sales and revenues, again, to be over 50 billion in 2008 and profit per share to be about $6.</p>
          <p>That's unchanged for 2008. We have three quarters behind us, which means that essentially we're expecting fourth quarter profit to be about $1.43, or at a level close to what we reported in the</p>
          <p>third quarter. Now, as you look forward, remember we continue to have a very strong order board. Dealer sales to end users actually improved in September, and for many products, particularly large machines, large reciprocating engines and turbines, demand is still high, and we're producing as much as we can.</p>
          <p>One more point, we will be consolidating Cat Japan sales and operating profits beginning in the fourth quarter. That will be positive for sales but will be roughly neutral to profit. Remember, Cat Japan was formerly known as SCM, or Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's the outlook for 2008. Before I turn the floor over to Jim to talk about 2009, I'll just take a couple of minutes to talk about liquidity and financial strength in these challenging times for</p>
          <p>financial markets. The first point that I'd like to make is that throughout the past six weeks, really during the most severe disruption in credit markets, we have been in the commercial paper market. We have issued five and ten-year notes, and we have been able to fund our business in a reasonably normal fashion. Our machinery and engines business is A-rated with a debt-to-capital</p>
          <p>ratio in the middle of our target range of 35% to 45%. And we had a little more cash on hand at the end of the quarter than normal.</p>
          <p>Cat Financial is also in very good shape, and has maintained access to commercial paper markets throughout the recent credit market disruption to fund its ongoing operations. At the end of the</p>
          <p>quarter, Cat Financial had $5 billion in commercial paper outstanding, of which about 86% had maturities beyond a week.  In terms of cover for the commercial paper, Cat Financial shares a</p>
          <p>$6.85 billion dollar revolving credit facility with Cat Inc., with about 5.85 billion of that revolver allocated to Cat Financial. It's a 100% backup for their commercial paper.</p>
          <p>In terms of corporate bond markets, in September Cat Financial successfully demonstrated access to term debt during a period of highly volatile market conditions. They originally targeted a</p>
          <p>size range of about 500 million but upsized it to 1.3 billion given strong investor interest that totaled nearly 3 billion. This happened on September 23rd and was the first investment grade transaction, at that time, in the bond market in nearly two weeks. Credit spreads and all-in coupon rates for this</p>
          <p>five and ten-year fixed rate MTN were higher than historic levels and reflected the broader market conditions. However, subsequent U.S. corporate investment grade MTN issuances by other companies later in September and early October have had even wider credit spreads. So in terms of funding, Cat Financial has done pretty well. They have access to commercial paper. They have commercial paper backed up with bank lines, and they've been able to issue bonds.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you an update on the quality of Cat Financial's assets, a topic I'm sure you're interested in. At the end of the third quarter, 30 day past dues were 3.64%, and that's up from</p>
          <p>2.52 a year ago and 3.35% at the end of the second quarter. The increase in past dues really began with the downturn in the U.S. housing market and has spread recently to Europe as global credit challenges continue. Bad debt write-offs, net of recoveries, were 22 million in the third quarter of 2008, and that compares with 15 million for the third quarter a year ago. And that increase</p>
          <p>has been driven by two things, economic conditions in North America and a 17% growth in Cat Financial's retail portfolio. They're a bigger company.</p>
          <p>For the first nine months of 2008, bad debt write-offs, net of recoveries, were 61 million, and that compares with 41 million for the first nine months of 2007. As a percentage of Cat Financial's</p>
          <p>retail portfolio, we expected bad debt write-offs through the remainder of 2008 will continue to be higher than 2007 but at near historic averages. At the end of the third quarter, Cat Financial's allowance for credit loss was 390 million. An increase of 52 million from the third quarter a year ago. We are confident in the adequacy of their reserves, and what they have on the books today reflects a reserve-to-annual loss ratio of well over four.</p>
          <p>As a historical comparison on the past dues, Cat Financial's peaked at 4.78% in the last recession and that was at the end of the first quarter of 2002. So, in summary on Cat Financial, their asset portfolio is performing pretty well. Past dues and write-offs are up from the lows of the past couple of years, but at levels consistent with historical averages and at levels that are better than the last recession.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's the third quarter, a little bit on the 2008 outlook, and a quick review of Cat Financial. I'd like to turn the floor over now to Jim Owens, our Chairman and CEO.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about next year, let me add a little bit more to Mike's review of 2008. Overall, 2008 has been a very solid year for us, especially when you consider the economic environment. We're likely to end the year with sales and revenues over $50 billion in sales, which is an increase of over $5 billion from last year, and it means we'll have hit our original top line target for 2010 two years early. It's even more remarkable when you consider that the U.S. machinery industry is very depressed and will likely end the year down over 20% from 2007. And remember, 2007 was down double digits from 2006. Europe has been declining sharply since the end of the first quarter. Japan is down significantly and has been off sharply all year. And our on highway truck sales are very low. And we've been supply constrained on many of our large machine and engine products.</p>
          <p>From a profit standpoint, we're expecting to deliver about $6 per share this year, another record year for Caterpillar and up from 5.37 last year. In fact, this will be our fifth consecutive record year, and, again, that's at a time when the U.S., Europe, and Japan are in very poor economic health and have, in fact, experienced recessionary conditions in the markets we serve. That's an indication of just how much we've changed as a company over the last 25 years. We're more diverse geographically. Less than 40% of our sales and revenues were in North America this quarter, and if you were just looking at the sales of new machines and engines, it's even lower. In fact, only about 25% of our new machine and engine sales were in the United States.</p>
          <p>Another fact is that we're at a point now where the collective size of the machine industry in the developing world is greater than all of the more developed countries combined. In addition to</p>
          <p>geography, we have a much broader product line serving a broader range of industries more deeply than ever before. And we have a large and growing array of integrated service businesses that are much less cyclical than the new machine and engines business. Today they represent about 35% of our top line revenues.</p>
          <p>Well, enough about 2008. I suspect what you really want to hear today is about the future, about what we think of 2009. Without a doubt, we face uncertain times ahead. And I certainly don't need</p>
          <p>to explain the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets that all of you have been watching and living with for some time now. I think there are really three big questions about next year and</p>
          <p>beyond. First, how will the financial crisis impact global growth, and in particular, the industries that Caterpillar serves? Second, is Caterpillar positioned to deal with 2009? And, third, what are the prospects for Caterpillar when this world recovers again? And it will.</p>
          <p>Let me give you our view of these three questions. With respect to world economic growth, the developed economies of North America, Europe, and Japan are already struggling in many of</p>
          <p>the industries we serve in these regions, as indicated before, have been weak for some time. In fact, we expect that next year will be the third year of significant decline in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>The severe tightening of credit conditions over the last six weeks means that these economies will likely get worse before they get better. That said, we are pleased by the coordinated interest</p>
          <p>rate cuts in both North America and Europe. Governments and central banks are replacing anti-inflation policies with actions to address financial turmoil and slowing economies. We expect</p>
          <p>central banks will continue to cut interest rates, and in the U.S., the federal funds rate should drop to or maybe even below 1% yet this year. We believe the actions they've taken to inject liquidity into the banking system along with lower interest rates will work, but it will probably take another three to four quarters before we see meaningful improvement in the overall economy.</p>
          <p>For North American economies, we're expecting growth under 1% in 2009. A very, very weak first half. But with an improving prospect as the year unfolds, and certainly towards the latter</p>
          <p>part of the year. Economic growth in Europe should slow to near 1% growth in 2009. They are behind the U.S. in cutting interest rates, and we see little prospect for better growth in Europe</p>
          <p>until after 2009, and we're forecasting also anemic growth for Japan next year at about 1/2 of 1%.</p>
          <p>Switching to the developing world, their economies have been largely immune to the financial crisis over the past year.  But problems are emerging.  Financing difficulties are likely to delay some major infrastructure projects, and banking problems, particularly in Russia and Eastern Europe, are notable and will cause problems for their economy.</p>
          <p>Up until very recently, most of the developing countries have been concerned with inflation and had tight monetary policy in place.  However, some countries like China have recently reversed that direction, and we believe the ongoing financial crisis will cause others to follow suit.</p>
          <p>In past cycles, many developing economies have problems paying for imports because they ran deficits with the developing countries.  This isn't the case for the coming year since these countries have been running large surpluses with developed countries and have accumulated significant cash reserves.  We estimate that cash reserve to be on the order of 1.5 trillion.  We expect that many of these countries will respond to the economic troubles by using their reserves to stimulate economic growth, and overall we think that their domestic economies will hold up much better with strength in their domestic economies at least partially offsetting weakness in their exports. Economic growth in the developing economies should average about 6% in 2008 and then slow to about 5.5% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Commodity prices have been a big positive for many developing economies and for Caterpillar.  Prices for most commodities have declined sharply since the end of the second quarter.  That said, they are down from historically very high levels, and are today still at levels that not long ago would have been considered lofty.  Our expectations for 2009 do assume that commodity prices will ease further, but not so low that producers will sharply cut investment.  In other words, we expect oil prices to hold north of $50 per barrel and copper prices to hold north of $1.30 per pound.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect world economic growth will continue to slow in 2009 to about 2.5%.  That would be the slowest year for world economic growth since 2003.</p>
          <p>The next question is how do we expect this environment to affect Caterpillar?  In the developed world we expect the volume of new machine and engine sales to decline.  North America, Europe, and Japan are expected to decline sharply again.  In North America we expect the industry for new machines to decline in double digits again in 2008.  But, keep in mind, we're declining from a much smaller base.  At the end of 2008, new machine sales to end users will already be down about 50% from the 2006 peak.</p>
          <p>In Europe and Japan, we also expect continued double-digit declines in the machinery industry.  However, in total we expect that full year sales and revenues in 2009 will be about flat with 2008.  There are several positive factors that we expect to help offset lower new machine sales in the developed world.  First, the rapid growth in the developing economies over the past seven years means that the new machine industry in the developing world is actually greater than in the developed economy, and we expect modest sales growth in the developing world again in 2009,  well below growth rates in the past years, but still in positive territory.</p>
          <p>Another positive for 2009 sales is Caterpillar Japan.  The country of Japan is weak, but in 2009 we will have four quarters of Japan's domestic sales in our numbers versus just the fourth quarter in 2008.  Next, our integrated service businesses represent about 35% of our top line, and they have been growing rapidly, and we expect continued modest growth in those service businesses in 2009.</p>
          <p>Next, we announced price increases a few months ago for 2009, and that should be a positive for our sales next year.  We expect continued growth in sales related to mining and energy overall on a global scale.  We feel very good about mining and energy for several reasons.  First, for several years now, customers have been demanding more big machine engines and turbines than we or the industry could supply.  That means two things have happened.  One, demand has been higher than our sales levels would indicate, and, two, that equipment fleets have aged and aged significantly.  There's a need for customers to replace machines, but we've been unable to supply enough to do so.</p>
          <p>Commodity prices are down for the most part.  But they are still at levels that are attractive for investment by our customers.  Mining and energy companies were doing very well at prices well below where they are today, and they have very strong capital positions to facilitate their investments.  Another consideration, roughly half of our mining sales are to coal mines, and coal prices are, relative to other commodities, in very good shape and well above levels that support continued investment.  Further, we have a very long backlog of orders for mining machines.  This would be large track-type tractors, large wheel loaders, and mining trucks -- larger than 100 tons.  And we have a very strong backlog of demand for large engines and turbines.</p>
          <p>To summarize our outlook for sales and revenues, a good business for mining and energy supported by a long order board, stable service-related businesses that we think will continue to grow in '09 and lower growth in the developing world, but it all nets up to being in positive territory at close to $50 billion in 2008, or about flat -- in 2009, excuse me &#x2013; about flat with our revenues in 2008.</p>
          <p>Next year no doubt will be a challenge.  We have some products and geographies that will be depressed and some, like large mining trucks, that we can't make enough of.  We'll need to carefully balance short term risk with our need to be prepared for an upturn that we think could start in the United States in the latter part of 2009.</p>
          <p>I know the current financial troubles and looming recession are weighing on all of us, and believe me, the Caterpillar team is working hard to be prepared.  Planning for trough conditions since we've been talking about for some time is a key component of our strategy.  We've been talking about this with you, in fact, in the analyst community, for several years.  We have detailed and executable plans for each of our business units, and it's not just a theoretical exercise.  Some of our businesses, like our building construction projects division, for example, which makes small machines, are in trough conditions now and are executing their plans very effectively.</p>
          <p>We take it very seriously, and we're prepared to act in each of our businesses, and I believe we have substantially more volume flexibility in terms of sustaining earnings than we've had to start with.  We're in a tough spot.  We're facing what will probably be a tough year in 2009, but prospects for 2010 and beyond look very good, and we need to be ready.</p>
          <p>Growth will hit a bump as a result of the recession, but it's not going to stop the world's need for better infrastructure.  Economic growth in Asia, Latin America, the CIF, Africa and the Middle East, should continue at a high level for years to come.  And when the U.S., Europe, and Japan start growing again, the demand for oil, coal, metals and other resources will be intense.  And we think there's inadequate capacity to supply a normal growth rate for the global economy in these key resource industries.</p>
          <p>The U.S. machine industry is on its back, and it has been, as we indicated earlier, declining for three years.  It's cyclical, and when it recovers, it usually comes back fast.  U.S. housing starts are at a 60-year low, and 2009 will likely be another down year.  It's hard to imagine at this juncture, but it will recover.  And we look for the opportunity for a 60 to 80% recovery in the North American machinery market as you move out into the late '09, 2010, 2011 timeframe.  Very substantial, and we'll be prepared to serve that.</p>
          <p>In addition to robust infrastructure growth in the developing world, there's a serious need for investment to refresh and improve the infrastructure in the United States and Europe, and many of the stimulus packages that are currently being considered could be directed our way.  When the world economy picks back up, Caterpillar will need to hit the ground running.  And the actions we've been taking should be very good for our customers, our employees, and certainly our stockholders.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we're adding to our product range, and we're adding production capability.  We're adding service capability with our dealers too, and they're growing and investing with us.  We're hard at work at streamlining our factories and supply chains with the Cat production system.  It's an investment, and I know that many of you are frustrated that it's taking longer than you'd like, but we are driving a big ship, and I am confident we're getting substantial traction that will pay off in '09 and the years immediately ahead.</p>
          <p>We're adding capacity, particularly for big machines and engines that support mining, energy, and big infrastructure development.  All areas that are in very high demand, and for the next ten years, looks very promising.  We have a new products coming that will be very good for customers, things like our new electric drive tractor, which we showed this year at the CONEXPO, a new line of electric drive mining trucks, and the C-175 engine family.  We are preparing for tier 4, the next level of off highway engines regulation.  This will drive significant product change, and given our size, ought to be -- we ought to be able to leverage that tier 4 investment better than our competitors.  Size and vertical integration are key advantages for us.</p>
          <p>We've got a captive finance company, which Mike talked about quite a bit, Cat Financial, that I believe is second to none and a real competitive advantage for us, particularly in these challenging times, when many banks won't have the understanding of our business and the residual values that our products command.</p>
          <p>Further, we've got a dealer organization that's the absolute envy of our industry and an order of magnitude stronger than any competitor's.  We're the world leader in our space.  We've been in this business for 80-plus years.  We've paid dividends every single quarter for the past 75 years, and we're prepared to deal with a tough trough year in 2009.  In fact, we intend to capture more of the share of market in our industries in down markets.  Most importantly, we're excited about prospects for the future when this world economy gets back on track and continues with the kind of growth we experienced in the middle of this decade.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, we're reaffirming our outlook for 2008.  We expect flat sales and revenues for 2009 in what's shaping up to be a tough year.  But I like our prospects for the future.  With that, we'll stop and be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  Just a question on mining and oil and gas.  In two months we went from BHP Billiton talking about a very significant CapEx increase to Rio and Alcoa talking about cutting CapEx.  And I was wondering if you could give us any color in terms of what are you hearing about from customers?  And what gives you certainty that there won't be significant cancellations or delays from your key customers going into '09 as they're reevaluating their CapEx plans?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim Owens, Andrew.  Let me just comment briefly on that and maybe Mike may want to add something to it.  I've been around a lot of our oil, gas, and mining customers just around the last month or so.  No doubt the sharp drop in many commodities has caused some, particularly Greenfield, lower grade sites to be put on the shelf again.  But I think the large mining industry -- the global mining industry, and our key alliance customers have a very strong cash position.  They are looking at commodity prices that they expect to be prevalent over the next five to ten years as they expand their mining operations.</p>
          <p>Their order backlog on us has been substantially higher than we've been able to build.  In fact, we have on the order of three years worth of orders on the books for 100-plus -- 100-ton plus mining trucks today.  So there may be some reslotting of the timing of when they want the trucks, but we just are confident we basically will be pretty close to capacity for all of 2009 in the large truck, large tractor segments of our business.  Again, coal mining is very strong, and that's a significant factor for both large track-type tractors and wheel loaders as well as for the smaller end of the mining truck range.  And the large mines that, I think, will go forward, I think, will accommodate and take care of all the capacity we'd have in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, Andrew, this is Ed Rapp.  The only other thing I'd add to that is in addition we've been unable to provide all the volume the mining companies have been looking for over the last three or four years.  The age of the fleets has grown.  So, even without new mining expansion, there's still a big replacement demand that's out there, and we think that will hold over in this period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the number is somewhere 56% of the trucks operating in the mining world today, large trucks, are over ten years old, which would be their natural life span.  So they've been -- we've been working with them to keep product running that should have been retired, and I think that's an opportunity that's still out there for us.  I didn't touch on oil and gas, but, you know, we think, as long as current prices hold north of $50 per barrel, they'll continue to be pretty good investment in energy space.  And, again, even though there's some slowing, and oil prices well outran their headlights, most of the major oil companies never planned investments extrapolating off of $150 a barrel.  Maybe some of the financial community did, but most of them expected oil to come back in the 75 to $100 range and to grow in real terms from there primarily again driven by growth in the emerging markets.  And I think there looked at the fundamentals of this industry and conclude with the very long cycle times, they continue to need to develop a capacity for future growth.  And hopefully, the markets will encourage that to happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark Koznarek with Cleveland Research.  Good morning.  First question on the cyclicality of the developed country markets.  It was mentioned that North America will likely be down 50% or is down 50% now.  I couldn't quite catch whether that's now or by the end of '09.  But, the question is how far down is the European market?  Could that also fall 50%?  And how many steps along that path are we?  And then same question for Japan.  Just trying to understand where the downside is here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mike, Mark.  I'll give it to you from a historic perspective.  Normally in the developed world, Europe and North America, they do act similar.  They have sort of a similar cycle.  The cycle in Europe historically has not been quite as positive on the upside or quite as negative on the downside as North America.  So historically it's not been quite as volatile, but trust me, there's still a good upside and good downside.  So far this year, we've been going down.  I don't -- off the top of my head, I don't remember what the total number is going to be, but likely double digits down this year and probably double digits next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at EAME as the whole -- if you just took the core of all of western Europe, the OECD part of western Europe, it's been pretty much in freefall.  That's probably as sharp a correction as we've seen in a long time, since the end of the first quarter.  East Europe, Russia, Middle East, and Africa Middle East regions of EAME have been stronger and have offset a lot of that decline, but I'd say we are clearly in the recessionary territory in Western Europe now.  So it will go down a little more from a smaller base in 2009.  But as Mike said, it's a similar cyclical pattern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the same would apply to Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Japan the same way.  Japan went off at the beginning of this year and it's been down pretty sharply.  If you look at all of the kind of old OECD, the line's pretty sharply down all year, being offset by a sharply rising demand throughout the emerging markets.  Which, by the way, we still have a relatively low share of the total industry opportunity in the emerging market theater compared to the share we have in the OECD world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just one clarification if I could ask this.  With regard to the Cat Japan, the fact that you're going to have that in the fourth quarter and then a full year in 2009, what kind of contribution to revenues would you expect that to be next year?  You did say that it's pretty irrelevant to earnings this fourth quarter.  Is it likely to also be de minimis with regard to earnings next year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, you know, if you have -- we have talked a little bit about this in the past, and if you look at our Qs, the total numbers for SCM, or now Cat Japan, would give you something around 3 billion a year in sales.  But, a lot of that is product that SCM would have sold to Caterpillar and would have been in our sales in other regions where they've been the source.  And quite a bit of the sales would have been already in our numbers for big products that we sold to SCM, that SCM then marketed in Japan.  The real add here is Japan domestically produced and domestically sold an order of magnitude that's somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 million a quarter.  So, that will be the ballpark add to the fourth quarter of this year.  We'll have one quarter of that in this year.  Next year we'll have four quarters.  So order of magnitude, it probably adds to next year's sales in the ballpark of a billion.  And on profit -- remember, we had 50% of the profit of SCM in our affiliate's line before, and our shareholding has gone up from 50 to 67.  We're consolidating, but we're not adding that much more of the business to our bottom line because, again, we already had 50% in our bottom line.  So, it will have a bit of an impact on sales but not much impact on profit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Barry Bannister, Stifel Nicolaus.  Before I ask a question, to clarify what you said to Mark.  SCM effect on revenue is about 400 million in Asia Pacific in Q4, but then you said 1 billion in 2009.  Why the big drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not talking about dropping.  We'll have 400 this year, next year it'll be about four times that.  So, we're comparing one quarter with four quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha, okay.  If I look at full years 2007, dealers reduced their reported inventory by 1.1 billion.  2006, they increased it by 300 million.  Could you give us what the figure is likely to be for 2008 and break it down a little bit geographically with particular emphasis on North America in the quarter and the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll talk generally about dealer inventory.  Actually, it was fairly neutral going from the second quarter to the third quarter.  So there wasn't a big impact on the quarter.  In fact, dealer inventories in North America actually declined coming off of the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>If we look at dealer inventories year-over-year, where we ended the third quarter versus where we were a year ago, it's roughly up in line with sales overall.  So, kind of inventory on a selling rate basis is roughly about the same as it was a year ago.  Geographically, if we look at dealer inventory versus a year ago, it's not much different in North America.  It's within probably two or three percentage points the same.  Most all of the growth in dealer inventory, again, which is in line with sales, has come outside the U.S. where we've had big sales growth.  Africa, Middle East, LACD, Asia Pacific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>North American dealers reduced their inventories in 2007.  What was the full year you gave for 2008 though?  You didn't state.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't give a number.  We said it would be largely unchanged.  I mean, that means it could be up a little bit.  It could be down a little bit.  Kind of within the scope of our ability to predict.  But about unchanged.  It's not far from that right now actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, the year-to-date margin in just machinery is 7.5% and a year ago in the nine months it was 10.2.  So that's a very large drop.  Just given that these are fairly extraordinary times, would you give us color on the impact of margins just in machines of the growing service component because it probably increases asset turns and dilutes margins, but we need to get a handle on what its effect would be, all else being equal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the service businesses overall, I would say they're not negative to machinery margins.  I would say they're probably slightly positive.  I think what we've got this year in terms of machinery margins is much more growth in material costs than we have actual pricing on machines.  That equation is a little different for engines.  We've got more pricing than we have material costs on engines, and as a result, you see engine margins up.  On machines, it's the other way.  We have had more material costs here, particularly in this third quarter, than we had price increase, by a pretty good margin.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eli Lustgarten, Longbow Securities. Can we talk a little bit in regard to margin and the material cost in machinery is still trailing and as you indicated, still pressured.  Can you talk about the fourth quarter and whether you expect to reach parity next year in materials costs?  And the same thing.  Do you think you can hold the margins in the engine business that you're showing, the 15% you're holding so far not only in the fourth quarter but also in 2009, or is that going to be affected by mix being negative next year too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at material costs in the fourth quarter, I think there's still quite a bit of pressure out there on material costs.  If you look at the numbers that we put up in the first and second quarter, it was not too bad.  We were able to kind of keep a lid on material costs and push the increases out, delay.  Part of our tactic was hold and delay.  And I think what we're seeing right now is material cost increases that we didn't experience earlier in the year that maybe some other companies did, and we're starting to see them now.</p>
          <p>If you look at a lot of our supplier agreements, they adjust after the fact.  I think there's still going to be some pretty good pressure on material costs in the fourth quarter.  As it goes into next year, we don't have a profit outlook out there for next year, and we've not really talked about any of the details of profit.  And the reason for that is it is a pretty changing environment now.  Our view of the material cost environment, as an example, has changed fairly dramatically over the past month.  I'll beg off on talking about 2009 for now.  I think that's still a developing situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just going to add to that.  I think, Mike, you described it well.  It's a developing situation.  We had expectations for pretty significant increases in steel costs, for example, and commodity prices in general and energy prices in general.  We're putting a lot of pressure on our suppliers, which caused them to want to push those prices through to us.  So we'll be working with them very closely as we look at moves in currency, moves in commodity prices, moves in energy prices.  In some cases, transportation costs.  And look very hard at our cost management and our strategies for that in 2009. That, of course, may also have some impact on our machine pricing next year.  But we're trying to balance that equation pretty carefully and stay on top of the changing dynamics in the marketplace right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you address the same issues on engine with the ability to hold profitability if the mix is negative next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had of course a very sharp downturn in the on highway truck engine sales this year.  That will continue to trail off next year.  But the strength of the market for oil and gas, marine, power generation have all been very encouraging in the gas turbine business.  So we think that the margins there will hold pretty well next year.  The strength in those sectors looks pretty sustainable, and it's been a little bit supply constrained pretty much on a global scale.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  JP Morgan.  I had to think there for a moment who I work for today.  Can you talk a little bit, guys, about your outlook for CapEx spending for next year?  In the context of the $1 billion of capacity expansion that you'd announced earlier in the year.  Do you still feel as confident today about committing capital to capacity expansion in any of your businesses right now?  Are you relooking at any of those plans or considering postponing any of that investment as you look into 2009 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment on that one.  We have a fairly high appetite at the moment for capital as we are needing to expand capacity for the larger end of our product line, mining trucks.  And we're in the throes of doing some of that as we speak, large engines, and mining trucks in particular.  And our footprint in the Asia Pacific theater.  Having said that, as we work on our business plan, one of the things we're very focused on is managing earnings per share.  And we're going to look at affordability next year as well as, of course, our long-term growth opportunity will get careful scrutiny and how we pace ourself with the capital and capacity expansions that we're making.  But that's a big part of our business planning process we're going through now, and we're working the -- through a base case and trough scenarios and looking at the affordability of capital next year.  And no doubt there will be some dampening of the appetite.  But I think it will still be a fairly significant capital number because we, quite frankly, had very solid growth opportunities, and we need to expand capacity to meet those.  We'll give you that specific guidance in January, when we give you the business plan for the year and our earnings guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I can appreciate that things have changed a lot in the last quarter or two. As a follow-up then, my other question is just around your other income line item.  That was the biggest swing versus, at least my forecast, or our forecast.  You noted in your press release that that was driven primarily by currency.  Is that primarily the pound-Euro swing, or can you explain a little bit more what happened there and then what your outlook is for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  That's mostly pound-Euro.  We have a relatively large net liability position in Europe.  So when you get a quarter where the currency moves from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, in this particular case, the strengthening dollar or net liability positions denominated in a foreign currency in dollar terms drops, and we record an exchange gain, a translation gain.  And the lion's share of that move that you noted in other income was translation gain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't know what exchange rates are going to be at the end of Q4.  Our planning process doesn't really forecast future exchange rates.  We tend to base our short-term planning on rates as they are.  Tough for us to predict.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to come back to the machinery margins.  On the one hand, you've issued a macro economic forecast that's pretty grim and certainly could be even worse than you describe, and I think conventional wisdom would be machinery margins probably can't recover next year compared to this year.  On the other hand, you pointed to a set of puts and takes, quite clearly the Cat production systems.  Second, the potentially declining input costs.  You have significant price increases rolling through the system that may or may not be capturable.  Can you talk about whether or not it is reasonable to expect machinery margins to recover from current levels next year, or is it really going to have to more likely wait until 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is -- that's a question I can't actually answer directly because we don't have any profit guidance for next year.  But all the things that you mentioned are essentially in flux right now, and that's part of the reason we don't have profit guidance.  The picture on material cost is changing.  Our view of volume next year, if you would have asked us six weeks ago, would have been different than what we included in this outlook.  How much capital we're going to spend, what depreciation will be, how much of the price increase that we announced that we're going to get.  They're all things that our view has changed, and we need to go back out to the individual units and marketing companies and factories and redo because of the changes that have occurred.  So I think you've pretty clearly highlighted all of the -- or many of the factors that are going to play into the numbers next year.  I guess I would say that machinery margins are very low, and it would certainly be our expectation over time that they improve.  But we don't really have an outlook that we can talk to for next year yet.  Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Let me turn to one other issue then.  In light of everyone's concern about the macro conditions, do you have any plans for a major cost-cutting exercise to -- that would likely yield benefits in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say we don't really have anything that we're ready to announce.  Again, it depends upon what happens.  Our current best-case outlook for next year is flat sales.  But I think, as Jim sort of mentioned in the discussion before we started, we do have trough-planning scenarios for each of the businesses.  BCP, building construction products, has been shedding costs already.  So I think in all the trough plans that we have, the answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Let me maybe just add to that slightly.  The exercise that we're going to go through with all of our businesses -- we have 24 business units.  Very different businesses.  Some in core products.  Some in service-related businesses, scattered geographies, different industries.  We're going to work with those vice presidents and their leadership teams to put together a business plan that essentially is calling for about flat sales, which quite frankly, is below their most recent expectations.  So we've already kind of feathered that down with our core economics group to something we think is realistic given the trauma the world markets have experienced in the last six weeks.</p>
          <p>We will also then look at a very Draconian worst-case, deep worldwide recession, commodity prices falling through the floor scenario.  Which we think is not likely to occur.  Nevertheless, we want to be sure they're in the blocks in position to keep us profitable through all scenarios.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, this is what the trough planning exercise is about.  We will be ready to execute that at the division level, and as indicated, we've already had several divisions.  We've had lay-offs in Lester, in Sanford, in Vernoble.  We've pulled the trigger on these things &#x2013; and in our Moscow machine group.  We're working very hard to meet customer expectations and in most cases, demand is still very strong.  I just walked through two plants this week that can't build enough.  So, we're watching the market very closely, developing plans for next year that I think will fully encompass the range of possibilities, and we'll be prepared to act and be sure our company stays financially strong through whatever cycle we need to manage through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  It's Bank of America.  First, just a clarification.  Did I hear you say that you think the on highway truck market next year will be down?  And was that just -- is that a comment on the market or just anticipated reaction to your exit announcement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's -- let's just say it's been less and less significant to us as time has gone on.  It's not a very big piece anymore of our overall engine business.  I don't think we were trying to make a commentary on where it's going next year, although we're not overly optimistic about a big pre-buy given the current economic conditions.  It was more, I think, a comment of it's a pretty smaller piece of our business today.  And when it goes away it certainly won't be missed as it would have been five years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand.  Okay.  So my question is on the pricing environment, Mike.  Can you give us a little bit of color, I guess, on the relative strength in North America?  Surprising to see pricing realization was stronger there relative to some of the other markets.  If there's any color on what's going on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think the biggest issue with pricing had really more to do with last year than this year.  Remember last year we were busy trying to take inventory out of North America and to help drive that along, there was, I think, a higher level of merchandising program activity last year to drive down North American dealer inventory.  So, I think part of what appears like a good pricing environment is probably more an absence of programs from last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just as a follow-up, would you characterize -- are you guys -- are you comfortable with where dealer inventories are at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think overall -- I mean if you pick any one dealer or one region, I'm sure you could find an issue where somebody has too little and somebody has too much.  But I think on balance, if you look at every territory, it's pretty consistent with current selling levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just add one thought to that.  We're working very closely with all of our marketing companies and dealers, trying to be sure we don't get excess inventory at a dealer.  In fact, we've told dealers, if you don't have a lot of site customer demand, we'd rather you cancel the order.  That's fine with us.  We want to ship it to the right dealer to get it in the right customer's hands and have as little value chain inventory as we can have.  Right now our dealers are still, in most cases, quite optimistic.  Demand is still strong from the dealer level.  But I'm pushing our marketing companies to work hard with them to be sure we don't put excess inventory in the field.  I'd rather take it out of schedules or hold the inventory ourself if need be.  So this is something that's getting a lot of management attention right now.</p>
