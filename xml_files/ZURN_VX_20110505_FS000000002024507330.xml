          <p>Good morning or good afternoon. I am Dino (00:01), the Chorus Call operator for this conference. Welcome to the Zurich Financial Services reporting for the three months to March 31st, 2011 Analyst and Media Conference Call. Please note that for the duration of the conference call all participants will be in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the introduction there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This call must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Debra Broek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome everyone to Zurich's first quarter Q&amp;A conference call. Pleased that you could all join us. We have number of people on the line. So thank you very much. Dieter will begin with a few opening remarks and then we will open up the phone lines for questions. So I will turn it over to our Group CFO, Dieter Wemmer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Debra, and good afternoon or good morning to everyone on the call. I will only give you a very few brief remarks. I know it is a busy insurance reporting day for you and I assume that most of you have watched at least some of the prepared videos, so you know the number. I think overall we have made really good progress in executing on our strategy, both the operational changes on our existing business as well as by signing key agreement to strengthen our emerging market and bank distribution platform.</p>
          <p>We are on track to finalize a agreement with Banco Santander and today we could announce that we have signed also a Memorandum of Understanding with Deutsche Bank to extend our existing exclusive distribution agreement for life and general insurance product in Germany and to the end of 2022 and both of these agreements confirm our positioning as a leading bank distribution partner globally.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter results were heavily impacted by natural disasters and were about 7 percentage points above our multi-year average experience for major catastrophes and large losses in the quarter. However, very important, our underlying loss ratio continues to improve. We continue to be focused on our pricing and portfolio discipline as evidenced in both General Insurance and Global Life and our margin in Farmers continues to be solid.</p>
          <p>Our capital position is clearly strong with a shareholders' equity above $30 billion and while the reported business operating profit after tax return on equity was only 8.4%, when we exclude the mentioned disasters, the ROE equivalent would be 15%.</p>
          <p>As we said at the December Investor Day, we are conditioning to report one economic solvency based measure. And so I'm pleased to be reporting for the first time our solvency ratio and as a new Solvency Test, which was at year-end 223%, a very strong ratio.</p>
          <p>And we have a balance sheet and cash flow strength together also the short-term challenges from the recent disasters and we remain committed to our long-term strategy, targets and dividend policy.</p>
          <p>So with this, I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you very much. And just a couple of points, one on the Solvency Test. So you've moved to this new number. Previously, we had the number on a quarterly basis, so I guess now you've given us year-end number, so I don't quite know what this means, but maybe you could give us a feel or actually the number for Q1 Solvency Test.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the cash flow normally stocks was traded at a dividend yield of 7% in the UK and this is not Switzerland. This translates into expectation that there will be a dividend cut.</p>
          <p>And if I look at the numbers in terms of earnings, I understand the underlying is improving etcetera, but it's not immediately apparent from the numbers that were published this morning. So I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit of a feel from the cash flow. If you remember in December you gave us a figure net of expenses of $3.1 billion to $2.9 billion. I just wondered if &#x2013; what this would feel like, if you looked at it again.</p>
          <p>And then the final question is, Farmers' combined ratio in Q1 of 94.9%; if I add to that your 6% kind of profit margin or extra cost that you charge on top; that's 101%. Is this the level where the regulator would say, oh, you are either charging too much or whatever, but Farmers is no longer balanced? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael, that's a long list of questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but probably I think these are really key questions, and probably some of your colleagues have similar questions on mind, so I will take my time to answer all four of them. The Swiss Solvency Test number, yes, it is for <mark type="ph" /> pool (06:17), it's for year-end. We have just filed this year-end number a few weeks ago because the process to calculate it is very elaborated as we are filing at actually not only for the consolidated Group, also for all major business units of the Group and in all places around the globe individually. So, therefore, it's really a heavy workload.</p>
          <p>So how would this number look like a quarter later? It will be slightly up because the movement of the input rate curve and the most relevant input rate curve to look at for European Life businesses is clearly the one-year forward swap curve, and when you compare this to year-end that moved in the long-tail <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:12) area up, that improved certainly as a fee ratio and then also the FX movement is another positive contributor.</p>
          <p>So that would be my judgment on it. The number how you should look at, we put the old internal economic model of 100% is roughly equivalent to 180% of the asset fee. It's not, obviously, a linear recalculation, as you could see from the complex way you come from one to the other, but I think that gives a very good guidance in particular for our management decision process, I think that is a really good tool to use.</p>
          <p>We are still producing internally our economic solvency ratio, but we are also working internally on a way how we can combine all these different models, because in the end we use the models to come to the right management decisions, and if both models would be ready for purpose then, I think one model is enough.</p>
          <p>The dividend, we just paid out a few weeks ago last year's dividend, I think the cash flow at year-end beginning of the year continue to be at the levels we have presented to you.</p>
          <p>I think the large catastrophes have certainly not created any drain yet on the cash flow because we are just in the process to find out what are the claims. And in Japan, for example, we are still not able to enter most of the regions so that will take actually quite a long time before the claims are being settled; that means hitting the cash flow.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, it's certainly not the reason to discuss the size of next year's dividend. I think, we feel, as I said in my introduction, very much on track with our day-to-day strategy and its implementation, and that is what we manage. We are not controlling Mother Earth, when a specific incident and event happens in a specific quarter, I think our business, and we have shown this over the last seven years, is very well diversified, and even a bad quarter with some large catastrophes has not changed the profit track record of the company.</p>
          <p>The exchanges combined ratio had a start above 100%, you mentioned it's 101.8%, and that is correct. That is not the number we would like to see in the long run. Actually, on my pre recorded slides there is a very detailed explanation on what's derived exactly, almost half point to half point the change in loss ratio and expense ratio at the exchanges.</p>
          <p>I think we have seen at Farmers quite often volatility in the combined ratio. I think we always publish a slide in the appendix; it's actually 39, where you see over the quarter the volatility of the combined ratio. And we manage Farmers' exchanges for the surplus level. We are still at 41-plus-percent in the surplus ratio, which is historically still a very strong number for the Farmers' exchanges and I think the regulator, if at all, is concerned about the surplus ratio and not the specific combined ratio of a quarter.</p>
          <p>And with this surplus ratio, which has actually a lot a load in it due to the decrease in the quota share because that means an increase for Farmers retention so their retention moves substantially, after that has to be covered within the surplus ratio. So 41% is really a good number and allows them still a lot of operational flexibility.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Marc Thiele, UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. My first question is related to the General Insurance business outlook, a lot of the reinsurers are talking about price increases across the board, not just under loss impacted areas, how do you think about your ability to hand over potential squeeze or margins to the clients in a weak macroenvironment?</p>
          <p>My second question is related then &#x2013; or more of a clarification regarding the Deutsche Bank contract. This extension of the contract only refers to the Deutsche network; is that excluding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:04), presumably it is, but could you clarify? And what happens to the other networks that Deutsche has in Spain and Italy, would they still be distributing Zurich policies or not?</p>
          <p>And then related to that, may be you could give us little flavor in terms of the contribution from Deutsche on slide 11 in terms of APE and new business value, presumably I take the bank distribution line and half it, half Deutsche Bank and half <mark type="ph" /> Santander (13:39), but may be you can give us a bit of insight here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mark, thanks very much. So first of all, yes, we have also to face that when we renew on July 1 our international cap cover that we will have to pay more for it that is our expectation. In general as a large risk taker, we view that overall the pricing pressure from the reinsurance sector should be positive for us.</p>
          <p>We're assuming that this will support our drive for rate increases and as we are keeping more of the risk than the average participant in the markets, we should actually be able to keep more of it for ourselves compared to what we have to pass on to reinsurer.</p>
          <p>So now the Deutsche Bank agreement, you are right that it's first of all an extension of the existing scope, and that means that Deutsche Bank and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:57) Bank and Berlin Bank about some years ago <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:03) Bank is still locked in another agreement therefore that was also not up for discussion.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Bank makes in the last year and also in this year about 50% of our APE was in Germany and that was roughly $120 million APE in Germany and so it's $60 million APE coming from Deutsche Bank and the profit margin is more or less in line with our average, which we publish overall.</p>
          <p>So now to Spain and Italy, actually maybe we have not communicated this a lot. Two or three years ago, we extended the Spanish and Italian distribution agreement already to 2015/16 when we bought a small Italian life insurance company from Deutsche Bank. And we will then also in the next couple of quarters work on to align the stage for the Spanish and Italian distribution agreement, which extended German transaction. So, I think, we are renewing a very successful agreement, which is, over the last 12 years, actually very successful for both parties and that is I think the main reason that we want to go for another ten years.</p>

          <p>Super. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Just two quick questions. You talked about the loss ratio continuing to improve in the P&amp;C business, and we can see that on the slide. Can you just give us some sense going forward, I can see that you're obviously still achieving rate increases. Can you give us a sense of the level of those rate increases versus what you're seeing on the claims side, I'm not talking about large claims just the underlying claims inflation environment and your confidence with which we will be able to see further improvements in that loss ratio?</p>
          <p>Second question, more a general question, obviously there has been a lot of focus on the strength of the Swiss franc now, obviously, due the translation effect, which we can all workout. Just in your considerations what potential issues are there for Zurich from the strength of the Swiss franc?</p>
          <p>Would that start to govern your dividend considerations given obviously your dividend is a Swiss Franc dividend but your earnings to a large extent are dollar sourced. Besides translation issues, what transaction issues or others issue should we think about from the implications of such a strong Swiss franc?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I think the underlying loss ratio movement in the first quarter actually includes already the combined effect of the rate increases and some higher claims inflation or claims load in some markets and countries like I think what we have already discussed at year end as the U.S. workers' comp part for example.</p>
          <p>So I think what we should expect going forward, we had announced in December at Investor Day that we have a very ambitious combined ratio improvement target over the period from now until end of 2013.</p>
          <p>And Mario and all his colleagues are really very actively working on the execution of this; therefore, we are very positive that we will see the trends you have seen in Q1 from this perspective.</p>
          <p>The Swiss franc FX, yes for sure, as it creates some burden, but I don't think that it's really a material burden. As we have outsourced, for example, all of our IT and that is based on U.S. dollar contract. So that is less Swiss franc driven, yes, the salary of corporate center employees have taken Swiss franc, where obviously only 10%, 11% of our total operating income is generated in Swiss franc, but our Swiss business unit continues to be very successful and has also a growing profit line.</p>
          <p>We have actually reduced a bit the dependence of the Group on the U.S. dollar area. And actually the arrangement with Santander will further move us out of the dollar zone and other currencies to our currency basket and that gives us more independence.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter actually, yes, the dollar weakened a lot, but also the euro strengthened a little bit against the Swiss franc. So it certainly reduced the impact of the dollar movement. So at the moment, we are not yet concerned about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Brian Shea, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two points from me. A question, the second one is more of a statement. The question really is to large losses shown on slide eight, not CATs but the large losses. Maybe the first question I'm going to ask you asked them up in previous conference calls, it doesn't seem that the incidence of large claims is random, but it does seem there is a trend here of large claims getting bigger and bigger, can you just explain to us why are you confident that this is random, and should be stripped out when you look at the underlying loss ratio rather than being the result of perhaps weakening terms and conditions or something else that's systematic?</p>
          <p>Tied in with that, on the webcast, Dieter, if I wrote this down correctly, you explained &#x2013; the $588 million, you explained what $130 million of that was. If there's any more color you could give around other items in here that might be helpful to provide comfort on this issue?</p>
          <p>And then the second point, just in your disclosure in your capital position, you guys have been very clear in setting out what your targets are, your internal model having a buffer of 10% to 20%, and then every quarter in a real time telling us where that capital position stood. And I think, I'm a little bit loss now, I know you said you guys are in transition now and you want to get this fixed, a statement from me if you could have a marrying up again of very clearly expressed targets, whether you stick with targets in your internal model or you re-base them to SST and showing us in real time what the capital position is in the same basis really is necessary? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. Well, I think, obviously, it's a large loss traction and is it trend or is it random is a very natural traction and you can be assured that we are asking this question internally after each and every large loss and always trying to find if there is any trend than we would really like to discover it first and work against it. But all analysis we have done so far confirms that it's random. What we have done with large reinsurance companies actually an analysis how is our market share in large losses versus our overall premium market share for large customers, and is there any deviation, anything what you would call a trend. And it is absolutely all in a neutral zone, so the answers are no answers.</p>
          <p>And that is for us a confirmation that it is random, and when you look at the Aon Benfield report, which says that the first quarter 2011 for the industry created $52 billion of special losses, compared to $40 billion for the whole year 2010, I think that is a impressive number.</p>
          <p>Well, for sure we have also long lived, how the $588 million of large losses are building up, but first of all I think from a commercial sensitivity we would not say, which customer had a big loss, but would also then &#x2013; many of them are also listed companies, I think that could create conflict with their communication policy, which we don't want to cause. So that's why we cannot go now to every large customer, who had a loss.</p>
          <p>What we are also including in this one here and that are the numbers we can talk about are weather related events, which are above $10 million, but below our $100 million level and for example, the cyclone in Australia and Victoria storm, also Australia, were included in this so it's a bit more than $40 million. So that these are two of the large losses I can mention. And then we had in February also a number of weather related losses in the U.S., which are included in here.</p>
          <p>So your last point Brian on the disclosure SST and being in sync with the quarterly announcement, I think our economic solvency compared to year-end is a few percentage points up. So it moved in a positive direction. And I think we have also to see going forward that we get something, which is more comparable and more meaningful for you.</p>
          <p>The economic solvency ratio of Zurich is in the end an in-house made model. We think of high quality, but it is, in the end, not comparable with anybody else. And by moving to more standardized ratio like the Swiss Solvency Test, I know that we are also pioneering here now because nobody else will give you this number. And for the time being I think the recalculation as I said before of the 180% to 100% is a very good rule of thumb to compare the two figures.</p>
          <p>And I think it should give you sufficient insight into the status of &#x2013; the quality of our balance sheet and flexibility. To be very honest, yes, we have said it's 110% to 120% range, but also since the crisis actually we were several times clearly above the 120% level and we kept the buffer, because we did not trust the economic environment fully.</p>
          <p>And we would probably still gets the same answer today. And so therefore, I think from a decision point of view and information point of view, you have not really lost anything. But maybe we have more discussion about it later on and you convince us to do something else in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Vinit Malhotra, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Just looking on the reserve movement and one thing I picked up is that the $60 million seems to be mostly for winter in December. So workers' comp additions in the slowdown a very little amount. Is that just because of frequency continuing to go down or is it the medical claims severity also going down and why I'm asking this is because we can also see the reserve releases internal liability in medical malpractice in the U.S. And so that will be helpful if you could comment on that.</p>
          <p>And second question again on the P&amp;C side, on the commercial market trend. So the 2% was a fairly good number, but equally last night we saw from CIAB, a strong improvement from minus 5.4% to minus 3.9%. And then I also noted that you mentioned that the market is still very, very competitive. So if you can just highlight or just share your thoughts on how the commercial market pricing is shaping up. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first of all, I think, it's true that in negative reserve movement there was, in particular, in the UK but also Ireland and Germany there was the best winter weather in the last days of the year. And we had not fully accounted for all claims when we closed the 2010 books that was more overhang coming than we assumed in our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:42) that created the 60 million.</p>
          <p>We have a small addition to workers' comp only, also I can confirm this for the whole book. But please remember that we took actually quite a big number in 2010. And therefore, I think, we should not expect that you see a big number, again, that would be actually very disappointing. And we have taken what we could see in the trends very early, and you know that we always try to be early in recognizing trends and booking it.</p>
          <p>Our 2% plus in rate increases was the U.S., well that in the end reflects the type of business we have renewed in the first quarter. It is a question of mix. And the mix is not only by line of business and category, it is also the mix whether this were customers, which were already priced at the right level or customers which weren't and that influenced in the end our actual number. Therefore to compare it with a movement in an industry statistic is always very difficult. So it's great to hear that actually the industry statistic number is improving quite a bit. Actually I think that this is the biggest jump for many quarters, but it is still <mark type="ph" /> showing (31:21) that it is negative number.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Paul Goodhind, Redburn Partners. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions please; on the Deutsche Bank distribution agreement, could you say whether there has been any change in the terms of the agreement. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:01) say mix of business on the new agreement. Do we see any change in the IRR or all the new business <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:08) of that agreement?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I look at the U.S.-North American commercial business in Q1 in terms of volumes, backing out the pricing effect, it looks as though you were down about 5% perhaps in terms of underlying volumes versus about flat in the fourth quarter. Was there anything unusual going on there? You mentioned that you've withdrawn from certain segments of the business, but you haven't given any figures on the scale of that. Does that explain that sort of deterioration or was there something else going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Paul, thanks very much. I think, let's start with the Deutsche Bank distribution agreement; the margins are to be expected in future are roughly equivalent. I think we have adjusted the overall commission schedule a bit to reflect actually for each product its genuine and inherent profitability.</p>
          <p>So therefore I think we get to a more economic driven product mix and also commission payment, and we will be above our internal and capital hurdles with this agreement.</p>
          <p>The U.S. volume, well, we have actually &#x2013; you're right, we have said that we want to withdraw from certain businesses as the mix is not what will help us &#x2013; the current mix or the old mix is not helping us to keep up with profitability of the best performing companies in the U.S. market and to move in this direction, we have to take also some bigger actions on this and without the rate increase, you're right, that would have been &#x2013; that is roughly a 5% reduction in volume where it is still &#x2013; as you see also new business coming in and the new business growth is positive, I think that is after transition period, we will get this in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you quantify the size of those segments that you've withdrawn from? My question was really whether that explains the 5% or whether there has actually been a market drop in volumes as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Actually, I think the drop caused by the economy that we have seen more in the last two years. I think that debt reductions are over but that employment is increasing that you are making more workers' comp premium per customer, that is also not yet visible. I think that the rate movements are probably still for the rest of the year in the commercial sector the main driver for volume adjustments.</p>
          <p>We are not giving every detail of what market we are withdrawing. We have only, I think, conceptually explained it at our Investor Day that we look at the business really sub portfolio by sub portfolio, and we have put some of the portfolios on growth. And others on strongly reduce to get profitability right, and that is what we're doing and that is what you see in the total numbers.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have just one question on SST and a small one on the Life side, on SST the ratio you calculate, can you give us an indication if you use <mark type="ph" /> stock rates (36:22) or government bond yields? And on the Life side <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:25) administration and other costs went up quite a bit, is there any one-off in here or is that just a trend or can you give us some more feel on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The SST, the rule is that we have to use government bond rates. But actually when you do the calculation for year-end, the number is only different by 0.5%, which is almost nothing on 223. So therefore, I can say that year the admin expenses are up because we are heavily investing in our regional infrastructure for the Life strategy.</p>
          <p>So that means building up <mark type="ph" /> a new hub (37:26) out of Ireland, building up a Latin American hub and having the opportunity to integrate the business, which is at the moment very much country-driven to a regional platform then also investing in our expansion in Asia and besides Hong Kong and Singapore, we are heavily investing organically into Indonesia.</p>
          <p>And then we have also the U.S. business, which we are building up because that is also an organic start. And then as one usual accounting effect insurance without a special accounting item would be impossible, so we had last year in 2010 a curtailment gain under this line admin expenses, which is therefore not being repeated this year. And explains also a reason why the number went up. And I think it now has went hopefully down to the $1 million in my explanation.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Andrew Broadfield of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just wanted to return very quickly to the large loss question because it's so important in understanding the underlying trends; given it's a big number you take off in the adjustment. And not to repeat or go over your answers to Brian's questions but I'm just wondering when you instituted this process, was it back in 2008 or '07.</p>
          <p>And I'm just wondering the underlying process, has it changed at all, was it evolving when you instituted or was there something that was already embedded at the time and you just chose to present it. The reason I ask, I just wonder whether at an underlying level you are perhaps capturing more things than you did before, or whether it does &#x2013; I know you've done the investigation it does from the outside look slightly trendy, what we are seeing there. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, just on the asset mix. You made some comments I think, on your presentation this morning, recorded one, about a bit of a change in the asset mix and a move towards some Spanish government debt.</p>
          <p>I was just wondering whether you can give us a little bit more color about your thoughts on that process and we are seeing some quite different structures being adopted across the insurance market. So I just want to understand a little bit more, your developing thoughts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, the large loss reporting is something we have used internally before we went out &#x2013; this is the first time reporting, there might be some small changes as not all of our countries had the same hurdle what is a large loss and what is not.</p>
          <p>So therefore there were some changes in it but I would not consider this material. What also has probably a little bit changed over this time is that we're keeping in some areas higher net retentions than before. And that might influence the average size of the large loss as such. But as we are also saving the reinsurance premium on this one so that should have a positive effect overall on our loss ratio and not a negative, so I think that are the two changes I can immediately think of.</p>
          <p>The asset mix traction, well, that it's in the end a correction in where do you take your credit risk. And in our analysis, so not speaking for anybody else in the Zurich investment area, the Spanish government bonds, we see here a more attractive return on a risk adjusted basis compared to some European financial and that is the trade-off we are taking. We are keeping our overall risk taking at the same level, but we use certain unsecured and subordinated euros on financial and take more of Spanish government bonds. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:05) opposite view that we will see in a year or two years from now what was the better bet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Just how does that &#x2013; I'm just wondering how Spanish government debt doesn't take any capital &#x2013; doesn't require any capital, I don't think so. So how does that mean that you could end up with a sort of neutral market risk adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in our internal model we see it as a corporate credit risk, it is a large corporation, I agree, but we are taking it not <mark type="ph" /> for risk free (42:40).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I just wanted to go back on this earlier question about underlying loss ratio and your plan to improve the combined ratio by three to four points over time versus competitors. I mean, could you talk through what the milestones will be in there? So in terms of sort of you're starting to reshape the portfolio, you're probably starting to look at the cost base. I mean, when are we going to see the benefits of this coming through in the underlying ratio, is question number one?</p>
          <p>Question number two is, can you talk about your plan for reinsurance given your commentary on large losses going forward, I mean, do you have any plans for change, retention and what do you think of the pricing environment there? Those are my questions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have committed ourselves to achieve the target by end of 2013, and that means you need to see an improvement of the loss ratio on combined ratio over this time because this will be not be a 3% expansion in the last quarter 2013. It is a continuous and big operational effort. Therefore also the fruits of it has to come through quarter-after-quarter, and that is how it should build up. I cannot give you now immediately the milestones, how many base points it will be in every quarter, but it should be visible every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, so, sorry just to return on that. So basically, we should start to see perhaps by the end of this year your underlying combined ratio in terms of comparison with peers, maybe some movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, peers might also work in this direction, and then it will be a race and then we have also to see every quarter when we compare our numbers with our peers, are we doing enough to achieve it or not, and then we might need to adjust our plans to work on it. But I think that is normal on all relative targets with your peers that you have also to see what they are doing and you need to react to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; yeah...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On pricing, I think the reinsurance retention will be the same this year compared to last year. We had changes in our reinsurance over a period of years. But since I think, actually more 2009, we are now very stable in our risk taking. We have still some small adjustment on specific lines where we might change our net retention. But in principle, I'm not expecting any very visible changes in the risk taking. And we are a gross underwriter and therefore when the reinsurance market has rate increases, that should actually support also the prices we write with our customers and allow us to benefit from it.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask one thing on Farmers and then on the Q2. The CEO of Farmers, I think, said in December that the business is well positioned to accelerate growth. It seems that Q1 was quite disappointing in that context. So I was just wondering if you could give us some feel for how you expected the year to develop. And maybe you could also comment on the margin in Farmers Management Services and whether we should be taking Q1 as a run rate going forward? And the second thing I wanted to ask was just given the U.S. bad weather in Q2, the tornadoes and such like, do you think that is going to have any kind of notable impact on Farmers or on the U.S. P&amp;C business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks so much. Actually, when you go through the details of our Farmers segment reporting in Q3, Q4 and now Q1 2011, you'll see that we had actually probably the peak in volume production in the third quarter 2010, and that Q4 was already an improvement over Q3, and Q1 is an improvement over the last previous quarter. Probably because we still had the first time consolidation effect of 21st Century, it was a bit masked in the overall top-line figure, but we disclosed also details, which allow to follow that we actually had a reduction, I think at the peak we lost 4% in the quarter. So therefore the 1.7% is from this perspective a very good step in the right direction, and when we are now going into deeper details, 21st Century, which was after we bought it, actually in a difficult transition. There was the fate over the AIG brand name, there was the integration process between the old AIG Direct and 21st Century.</p>
          <p>So a company, which had actually operationally a lot of trouble and we have now turned it into a positive picture after 18 months. That means the first quarter premium growth 21st Century was 3.4% and March at 5%, I think that are the direction and numbers we'd like to see. Also the Farmers Asian channel has started to turn in a way that March standalone was now the first positive premium month and actually that goes compared to 2008 where we have seen the last positive premium month for the Asian channel in Farmers, so it was actually quite a long period where we had to struggle in the economic environment.</p>
          <p>You have always to remember that Farmers' Asian customers represents the lower middle-class in the U.S. and that is the part of the population, which is probably most hit by the unemployment situation in the U.S. market. And only when this really recovers, you will see that then from a customer perspective we have an easier life in the economic environment. So that Farmers is moving it to the positive. It's really all a management and operational success of the team and Jeff Dailey, who is our designated new CEO, after Bob Woudstra's retirement is really doing a great job with this new product, the new pricing technologies and all the marketing efforts.</p>
          <p>The margin of Farmers, I think, they range between 7.1% we have seen this quarter and the 20, 30 basis points more is probably the number you should expect every quarter in this range that is not really something where I would expect any big change. Your observation on the tornadoes in April that was first, it's two or three days where there were almost 200 tornadoes in the Midwest and then just last week the big one in Alabama and Carolina.</p>
          <p>They will certainly not help the cat loss ratio in the exchanges and I would expect that Q2's loss ratio will be substantially higher than in the first quarter. Of course, there is still a May and June to come but April was certainly not a great start. But Farmers, as I said before, has quite often this very volatile cat losses; actually in the second quarter in 2010 we lost about $400 million on tornadoes only and some hailstorms. Therefore, that is probably still part of doing business in the Midwest and that is also calculated in the model and in the reinsurance protection Farmers is buying so that will not disturb our growth in revenues and our fee income margins.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. A number of leading, I guess, U.S. auto insurers are at different stages or appear to be at different stages with regards to addressing the rampant personal injury fraud in states like Florida and New York. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where the various Farmers companies are in terms of addressing that through rates through underwriting, through claims etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think you're referring mainly to the experience on sub-standard business which did increase actually personal injury and we have seen this mainly affecting our sub-standard business in Florida and Michigan, and we have established a pricing action from this, and also higher rates on this. It's actually affecting the first quarter loss ratio of the exchanges by almost one percentage point, half of it in the current year and half of it through addition to prior year results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. In terms of, I think if it's a fraud problem, several companies are responding by bulking up their special investigation, and seeing that translate into maybe more success in commenting fraud.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have tightened our underwriting standards to a direct what you have mentioned. The claims department is also following up on potential fraud cases, but I think, the best way to address it is to really tighten your underwriting standards to avoid the customers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that is fairly straightforward to answer, that is almost all driven by the <mark type="ph" /> voucher (55:58) business where we increase rate for some of the customer segments.
