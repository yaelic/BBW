        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first quarter results conference call. Before I take you through the financial results, let me give you a summary of the main highlights of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P, we are continuing to strengthen our long-term growth prospects. Our exploration continues to deliver exceptional results. In the first three months of the year, we added around 1 billion BOE of new exploration resources through Mamba North 1 in Mozambique, Havis in the Barents Sea, which together with Skrugard has recoverable resources of 500 millions of barrels and other discoveries in proven near field areas.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, you will have seen that we had signed a strategic agreement with Rosneft to gain access to very promising exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and in the Black Sea, increasing the potential of our portfolio and providing support to long-term growth prospects.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, in March we completed the renegotiation of power gas supply contracts with Gazprom. The recognition of the associated economic assets was redirected to the beginning of 2011 and is included in our Q1 marketing results.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are progressing on our strategic objective of unlocking value from our non-core leased assets. Regarding Galp for March 29, we signed an agreement to sell 5% of the company to Amorim for &#x20AC;14.25 per share. Once this sale is completed, we will have significant optionality on the disposal of our stake.</p>
          <p>With regard to Snam, I would like to remind you that the Italian government has passed legislation envisaging the completion of our exit by September 2013. The method by which the separation will occur will be defined by a governmental degree to be issued at the latest by the end of May.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our results. In the first quarter of 2012, the market environment was broadly positive. This was mainly driven by the Brent price, which averaged $118 a barrel, up 13% compared to the first quarter of 2011. The euro-dollar exchange rate was also supportive at $1.31 per euro, with an appreciation of the dollar of 4.1%. However, the European refining margin Brent/Ural was $3.30 a barrel, in line with the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2012, adjusted operating profit was &#x20AC;6.45 billion, up 26.5% from the first quarter of 2011. This was due to the better operating performance reported by the Exploration &amp; Production division, up 24%, and to the increased results of the Gas &amp; Power division, up 57%, driven by stronger profits from the marketing segment. This was partially offset by weaker results in R&amp;M and Chemicals.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2012, adjusted net profit was &#x20AC;2.48 billion, up 13% compared with a year ago, as a result of better operating performance. This positive effect was partially offset by higher financial charges, which increased by &#x20AC;207 million, and a higher consolidated tax rate up approximately 6 percentage points. The fiscal impact was the result of a higher tax rate in E&amp;P and to the revision of the so-called Robin Tax enacted in August of 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking in more detail at the Exploration &amp; Production, in the first quarter of 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production of 1,674,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day, representing a small decrease from the first quarter of 2011, down by 10,000 BOE per day or 0.6%. Excluding price effects, which reduced Q1 production by 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to the year-earlier quarter, the production of the first quarter was marginally higher, up by 0.2%, driven by the ongoing recovery in Libyan production and the start-up ramp up of new fields in Australia, Egypt and the United States. These positives offset negatives from the sale of minor assets and some minor unplanned production losses.</p>
          <p>The Exploration &amp; Production division reported an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;5.1 billion, increasing by &#x20AC;980 million or 24% on the back of stronger oil and gas prices and the recovery in Libyan activities.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, overall volumes sold, including consolidated and associated companies, fell by 5.4% to 29.9 Bcf. The decline is mainly due to weak demand and higher competitive pressure in Europe. In Italy, overall sales rose by 1.4%, with higher demand from residential users and higher sales to the network balancing market more than compensating decline in volumes sold to power generation and wholesalers. The Gas &amp; Power division reported an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, increasing by &#x20AC;546 million or 57% from the first quarter of 2011. It is worth reminding you that the first quarter marketing results reflect the benefits of the finalized renegotiation with Gazprom retroactive for the whole of 2011.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the first quarter of 2012 was &#x20AC;1.641 billion, up by &#x20AC;587 million or 56% compared to the same quarter of 2011. The increase is attributable to the marketing business, which more than doubled the result of the year earlier quarter. Excluding the portion of benefit from the Gazprom renegotiation associated with previous quarters, the marketing segments reported a stronger results driven by improved supply costs associated with the revision of long-term gas supply contracts and the recovery of Libyan imports and the stronger seasonal sales owing to the particular record with us is positive or was partially offset by a slowdown in demand across Italy and Europe and the rising competitive pressures.</p>
          <p>The regulated businesses in Italy recorded a 4.3% increase in results, while the international transport activities reported a lower operating performance, reflecting the assets they've estimated, which accrued at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2012, the refining marketing business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;258 million. The deterioration compared to the first quarter 2011, reflected the weak industry fundamentals across Europe.</p>
          <p>In addition, refinery results continue to be adversely impacted by rising costs of energy utilities indexed to oil prices and shrinking price differentials between light and heavy crudes.</p>
          <p>Our initiatives to counteract this very weak trading environment included efficiency announcement, the optimization of supply activities and lower throughputs at the weakest refineries, including temporary shutdown. As a result, the utilization index of our refineries fell to 63% compared to 82% in the first quarter of 2011. Marketing results were negatively affected by a decline in retail and wholesale demand for gasoline and gasoil dampened by a cyclical downturn and competitive pressures, while selling margins repaid and wholesale markets were squeezed by a rapidly rising commodity cost that were only partially transferred to prices at the pump and carriers.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2011, the chemical deviation reported substantial operating losses of minus &#x20AC;162 million. The negative performance was driven by higher cost for oil feedstock, which impacted the unit margins as product demand suffered in a recessionary environment. This was particularly true for the chemical commodities with a benchmark record margin falling in negative territory.</p>
          <p>Engineering &amp; Construction business reported a strong operating performance, which was up by &#x20AC;32 million or 9.4% to &#x20AC;374 million from Q1 2011. Other activities in corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;127 million, in line with &#x20AC;129 million in the first quarter of 2011. Net cash generated by operating activities amounted to &#x20AC;4.2 billion. Capital expenditure for the quarter has been &#x20AC;2.9 billion, mainly related to continued development of oil and gas reserves, the upgrading of rigs and offshore vessels belonging to Saipem and the upgrading of gas infrastructures.</p>
          <p>The Group also incurred expenditures of &#x20AC;500 million related to the financing of the Nuon Belgium acquisition and joint venture projects. Net financial debts at 31st of March 2012 was down by &#x20AC;600 million from December 31, 2011, improving our leverage from 46 to 43.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now with my colleagues I'll be pleased to answer to your question.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&amp;A session is now open. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Thank you. This question comes from Theepan Jothilingam from Nomura International. Mr. Jothilingam, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Alessandro. Three questions, please. Firstly, just on Snam, I know we're waiting for a government to creep. I was wondering whether you had any increased visibility on when you &#x2013; whether you think a disposal would be for cash or whether you think a spin-out is a more likely outcome?</p>
          <p>Secondly on Galp, the second process, I guess &#x2013; or second part of the process on a divestment is to sell the 18%. Again, do you have any view on timing, whether you believe those shares will be drip-fed into the market, or is there a strategic investor that you'll be discussing a disposal with?</p>
          <p>And then the third question just on the exploration. It's a very exciting agreement you've made with Rosneft. I was just wondering, do you have any color on the timeline of work play there, when you expect to drill the first well. And then secondly, just is there any commitment of capital as part of that deal? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the agreement recently signed with Gazprom &#x2013; with Rosneft, I'll leave that &#x2013; I'll pass the table to my friend Claudio Descalzi, who is with me now.</p>
          <p>But just starting to answer to your question, as far as Snam and Galp. Snam, as you have already anticipated, it's still too early to make any assumption about how the separation will take place. And for sure, it is, I believe, not correct to speculate about what could be the potential transaction which will be realized. But however, you know quite well that our suggestion, our strategy, which of course we are suggesting, supporting to the government, is a strategy whereby the famous three pillars of our strategy must be satisfied, which means that the transaction to be realized must be satisfactory, must be good for our shareholders and the shareholders of Snam as well. But in particular, at the end of the transaction, Eni must be stronger than before, which means that Eni can be stronger only to the extent a cash transaction will take place. So for sure, we are supporting a strategy whereby a cash consideration will be recognized to Eni. We are discussing with the government, and I can say that so far we are a little bit positive in this respect.</p>
          <p>As far as Galp, as you correctly stated, after having sold the first 5% to Amorim at an agreed-upon price of &#x20AC;14.25 per share, then we will be free to sell in the market the 18% or 20% depending on the possibility to place also a convertible bond. As far as the type of transaction which can be applied in order to dispose the 18%, we can either refer to, like you say, a market type of transaction accelerated building private placement, an OPV, or we can have access also to a strategic buyer. In this latest situation, we have still to agree the identity of the potential buyer with Amorim. But based on the approach, the unsolicited offer which we have received so far either from financial institutions and the strategic investor, I do not expect to face any major problem in finding an agreement with our former partner Amorim. So I am pretty confident that already in 2012 we will be in a position to dispose a significant stake &#x2013; or a significant portion of our stake in Galp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. For Recchi, the agreement we signed with Rosneft is a strategic agreement that include the Russian activities and will be followed by activity and an alliance also abroad, outside Russia. Talking about Russia, the scope of this agreement as you know is the inspiration development of three licenses, two in the Barents Sea and one in the Black Sea. We have a commitment to acquire seismic data 2D and 3D in the Barents Sea and Rosneft already acquired 2D and 3D seismic in the Black Sea. So internal commitment talking about figures, we have a sequence of three to four wells for a expenditure around $800 million and additional two contingent appraisal wells in the balances for an additional $200 million. So that is the main commitment.</p>
          <p>Internal programs, now we analyze agreements. We have to pass through the shareholder agreements and the GOA and I think that will be done in the next four or five months. And then we start immediately our activity and we start in February in the Barents Sea and the Black Sea. I think the first wells will be drilled about the end of the full year plan, so 2014, 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just follow-up coming back to your statement, Alessandro, one on Galp? Should one see the &#x20AC;14.25 as a slow price for you to sell on any further stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course of the environment compared to the timing when we have agreed the &#x20AC;14.25 per share with Amorim, the environment has been a little bit changed. So I don't want to fix any floor or cap for &#x2013; to target &#x2013; as a target for our future sales. But what I can say is that for sure the present, the prevailing market prices do not meet our minimal expectation. So for sure, it must be significantly higher compared to what is today the stock price of Galp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Iain Reid from Jeffries. Mr. Reid, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I guess, well sorry. Good afternoon. Can I ask you two questions? Firstly, is it possible you can tell us in the Gas &amp; Power division of your marketing segments the amount of the 2011 contribution which was made? Obviously, we want to forecast the numbers going forward and for the full year. So we really need to know what that element was because obviously it's not repeatable.</p>
          <p>And secondly for Claudio, is it possible you can update us on what's happening on the utilization on the Mozambique blocks and what the program is for 2012 and maybe 2013 in terms of the exploration targets, the appraisal targets which you've got in mind following a completion of the current &#x2013; I think it's called Cardon where you're doing the amendment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, I guess on power, unfortunately we have to repeat that we can't make comment on this because this is sensitive element of our negotiation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so. The E&amp;P, Mozambique. The unitization we set up a program with Anadarko and for the unitization between the two joint ventures. So we start not only the discussion, but we have a program. I cannot tell you exactly now when we finish this issue of the unitization. I just can say that is not very complicated issue. We are in agreement. We already worked together in another unitization. So I think that there won't be a question that we'll solve by the end of year. We know that the unitization passed through different gauged. But we designed at the very beginning and track participation and that is an initial one and then we start working, so that's started. That is something that we started positively with Anadarko.</p>
          <p>Then for the work program, as you said correctly, we are drilling Cardon and I think we will get results from this well, from this appraisal well at the end of May, by the end of May. And then we'll continue back to back until the end of the year. I think that we will be in the position to finalize our exploration activity by February, March, 2013. So that is the program. And meanwhile we are working also on the development program and on LNG, on infrastructure. So we are in parallel working also on the next steps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could just come back on the development program? Are you working together with Anadarko even for development of prospects which lie entirely on area four or is it going to be like one facility rather than two or three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, that as internal <mark type="ph" /> in PLD (24:33), you were interested in appraisal of the wells and I think that the priority as we said is a unitization and the plan of development of the unitized area. So that means that we absolutely work together with Anadarko in term of development wells, facilities that treating all these kind of stuff. So we work with them. Now, we got a new big discovery entirely in the area of four more than 8 Tcf and we are working on that. But it's really in an early stage and we'll see if we'll have the capacity in the first developments or otherwise we go ahead with an additional development. But our priority is work with Anadarko on the unitized area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for your help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Clint Oswald from Sanford Bernstein. Mr. Oswald, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. Just thinking about the Russian gas field that you started up recently, selling the gas to Gazprom, can I just confirm that that is the kind of regulated Russian gas price that you will be receiving or if there is any disconnect to that? And I note that you retained the buyback and marketing rights. Do you expect to use those rights with any sales or is that just a separate clause? Secondly, I'm just wondering about your U.S. volumes, oil and gas. There seems to be a kind of large step, a decrease in the U.S. gas production. Is that just a function of the gas price and should we expect to see those volumes decrease further? And just finally quickly, just back on the balance sheet, maybe a question for Claudio, I'm just wondering have you looked at these estimates of 36 billion barrels of oil equivalent? Are you comfortable with that resource number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, you talked about the Yamal area and the question on the gas price. As you say, the gas price come from the form of our Yamal field. It has always leaned to the domestic and it's leaned closer to the export. And so as you know, the domestic that is regulating the update every year. So that is for the other gas producers in Russia.</p>
          <p>For the U.S., we still will reduce our gas production, which is not viewed a surprise. We reduced gas production in some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:19) for maintenance program and also from some technical reasons. So our aim is to increase or restore this production in the next month and recover the U.S. production average rate for fiscal 2012. Other resources for Rosneft, that is a preliminary figure coming from data, normally to the data in the Barents Sea, and 2D and 3D data, new data, in the Black Sea. So that is &#x2013; we work with Rosneft, that is mainly Rosneft evaluation. Now we are going to a new process of that acquisition in terms of structures, volume, and number of structures. I think that these figures are quite accurate, from a volume point of view. Then we have to see from a petrophysical point of view, thickness, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:30) of the system, because you are talking about <mark type="ph" /> soil in these figures, or we can calculate these figures in yourselves. (28:31)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Mark Bloomfield from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Bloomfield, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yes, two questions, please. Firstly, coming back to gas marketing, just wondered if you could help us get a better sense of the sustainable profit improvement. I mean, specifically, if we set aside the debate around the retroactive element. To what extent do you think that you can enjoy kind of ongoing benefits from the reduced cost of gas and actually retain those benefits, as opposed to simply passing them on to your customers when we come to the start of the next gas year?</p>
          <p>And the second question, I just wondered if you could remind us of your exploration and appraisal activity plans for the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea, and also in Indonesia for the remainder of 2012? I'm thinking, there, about the number of wells, timing, targets, etc.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question about gas. We can today confirm on our guidance for 2012 that we gave after Q4 results. And this means a higher EBIT and higher EBITDA, which are the elements supporting this, that make our estimate a sustainable estimate. First, we have the project of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:15) that these positively impact retroactively, but of course, also in the volume that we are selling and will continue to sell. We have the benefit of the production of Libya that it is back to normal, and that is something that should continue. We have partially captured this year the negative impact of the sale of the international pipeline.</p>
          <p>On top of that, of course, we have to consider that the size of these special effects, there is our underlying marketing situation. Our business will be more impacted in the remaining part of the year by the continuing increase in oil price and the reduced demand of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:02) as well. So the mechanism that's really used to protect our results is again realigning of our cost of supply to the market through the renegotiation. We have a number of them in front of us, of which two important ones this year. So these are the keys of maintaining the sustainable &#x2013; our results at a time of continuing marketing weakness.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you know, Norway and Indonesia are two of our best hubs in terms of exploration potential. We forecast to drill two wells in Norway on new prospects. We have additionally 11 prospects in Norway that we plan to drill the next three years. So this year we'll explore two new prospects that are not very far from Skrugard; they are south of Skrugard.</p>
          <p>And for Indonesia we start also this year, we have to appraise. We have an appraisal campaign in the <mark type="ph" /> John Creek Northeast, (32:05) and we also, in this case, we're drilling the next couple of years additional five, six wells &#x2013; seven wells, sorry. So <mark type="ph" /> when these two offset (32:20) in the next three years, it will increase our source base. And meanwhile, we are also developing different fields in the area, where we can get the FID in the next couple of years. So they are not just exploration ops but also very important development and production ops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could follow on from that, I know you talk about 11 follow-on prospects in the Barents Sea. I mean, can you give us any sense of the average size of those prospects, perhaps relative to the size of the existing discoveries that you've have made there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that you know that we are in Barents Sea, so we need reasonable resources to drill exploration wells for future development. So we can say that we are more or less in terms of potential targets in the same size or volume of what we've drilled until now. That the range is between 200 million and 250 million barrels in terms of resource. So that is our target in these kinds of prospects.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. The first on the Galp, and specifically, I just wanted to ask about your thoughts on the exchangeable, whether you decided if this should be mandatory or not. And any color that you could give us there, that would be appreciated. And then second, on Snam, maybe you could just give us an update, Alessandro, on the discussions that you're having with the banks in terms of the bridge financing for Snam, how that's progressing, and if there's anything that we should be aware of there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Galp. Yes, sorry. For Galp, of course, we are starting the project including evaluating what could be the most appropriate strategies to be applied in order to monetize at least a portion of our stake. But, I repeat, starting from the situation whereby today the present market prices do not meet our minimal expectation, first. Second, in terms of convertible, we do not exclude the possibility to apply for a convertible, deflation convertible bond. But it's not mandatory to record to a convertible bond, it's just one of the strategies which we can apply in monetizing our stake, but so far, is not in our radar screen, the placement of a convertible with the Galp shares.</p>
          <p>Then, as far as Snam. The Snam, your question, I can understand your question, of course. But we are not the appropriate entity to whom you can place your question &#x2013; you can raise your question, because of course, we are cooperating with Snam, but the entity, the company who is presently engaged in setting up their appropriate bridge financing is Snam itself. As you know, Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Marcavle (36:26) just, if I will remember, yesterday has already disclosed that they are working in order to get an autonomous rating very soon. And then, as soon as the rating will be obtained, they will start actively in placing their debt in the market. As far as we know, as per our knowledge, since, I repeat, we participate with them in the meetings with the banks, they are progressing extremely well. Of course, the reputation of the company and the solidity of their balance sheet support extremely well the possibility to obtain an appropriate and reach financing at the very interesting price, very, very short.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you for the presentation. I'd like to ask two questions, if possible. The first one, could you update us on the Kashagan and development and what you think will be the key milestone to achieve the stable production rate of 70,000 to 80,000 bars per day by the end of the year? And the second question really is for Alessandro, in this Q1 results, the only disappointment was R&amp;M and chemicals, who have been a very good set of results. I was wondering, now that we're about one month into Q2, do you see an improvement in those areas, or the situations are to remain as challenging? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we start from Kashagan. Kashagan is a &#x2013; can give very positive news. I mean that, one of the main milestones was the Kashagan is practically finished where we contribute 95% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:54). So the project's completely finished. We already started testing all the lines with gas, so the gas is from the E&amp;P. We can also practically say that the commissioning is going very well. So without any big issue, one possible issue was the actual integrity of the package of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:23) 2008. And we can say now that there is no problem, as the integrity has been passed positively just last week. So again, I think that we clearly are in good shape, and good shape means that to reach the commercial production of 75, thereby December we have to start production throughout the first week of November and round it off. All the team, all the management is really focused and pulling out these last steps on a daily basis. And over <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:11) every two weeks from quarter, so there's a very full support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as the refining, marketing and the petrochemical, as you correctly stated, we have experienced a quarter of quite disappointing results. But for sure, not due to our performance. The performance, the industrial performance in both the segments have been extremely satisfactory. Unfortunately, both of them have not been assisted by the scenario, the market scenario, which both for refining and for petrochemical, the scenario which consists predominantly in the high-cost of the oil, which represents the cost of the raw material for both of them, have negatively more than in the past affected their results.</p>
          <p>Then, what we are assisting now, in particular immediately after the closing of the quarter, is our sign of the first improvement both in refining margins and in the chemical market. So all in all, we'll remain a little bit pessimistic for the entire 2012, but not for sure in the same magnitude that we experienced in the first quarter. So, the first sign of recovery, which we are looking at in particular in April, we hope that this situation will continue all over the rest of the year allowing the possibility to recover a little bit of the very negative situation we have experienced in the first quarter of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. First, you signed an MOU with PetroChina last year, and if I'm not mistaken, the objective was to look at unconventional blocks in China of PetroChina projects in Africa, any progress on this front? Second, recent event in Argentina's nationalization and all, does it have any impact on either the timeline or the scale of investment plans that you have for your projects in Venezuela in terms of your risk perception? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So E&amp;P, both questions for E&amp;P. PetroChina, I think that we are progressing [indiscernible (43:13) was to have an exchange of blocks of data, and when you're analyzing E&amp;P data it is a question of valuation. We are working positively. I think that, I hope very soon we can find a good result for other programs. So we are watching. I remember you that we have also [indiscernible] (43:41), because that is more or less on the same line. So we are working, we are watching well, so we are quite confident that we can have access also to the shale gas in China.</p>
          <p>For Venezuela, I don't think that we'll have any impact also. If you &#x2013; from the press, I think that you read the declaration and announcement of the Minister and of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:11) said that they confirm that they won't change to any terms and conditions. And they did that immediately after they knew that results from Argentina. So that means that it is a very sensitive problem for everybody. They want to have the international company working with them. We are working quite well with them; we are progressing and working very well on all our projects. So I don't have any negative perception on selling as far as Venezuela is concerned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Iraq. Yes. Iraq has, when we talk during the strategy presentation we didn't talk a lot, so we are not very happy about the slowdown and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:16) our presence in Iraq, especially because of bureaucracy. In the last month, I think that things are quite better, we are progressing, they approved some very important contracts for us in terms of building and early facilities for production for oil treatment. So we are moving on. And I think that we are in position to confirm our target, production target for Iraq in 2012, that considering the price effect is about 17,000 and 18,000 barrels per day equity production.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Two questions, please. The first, I guess it's Alessandro. Can you explain to me how it will work once the split with Snam takes place with the debt that you have, that you've lent onto them? Will you go to the markets and retire that debt or will you keep it? Can you make some money actually on retiring it, I guess, given where the markets are? Can you just explain to me a little bit about the mechanism of that? The second is on Kashagan, follow-up on that. Could you explain how many people or just confirm how many people you have working on that at the moment? And so to contrast that with how many people you would normally expect to be working on an operated JV? And just maybe sort of contextualize it by where those people are likely to go, and how quickly once those productions are reached? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So starting from your first question. With reference to the repayment of the loans we have granted to Snam, as you know, all the loans that we have released to Snam includes, have a close whereby as soon as the company will not be considered a subsidiary of Eni anymore; the company has a maximum time of six months in order to repay entirely the existing debt, okay; and of course, the company is actively and efficiently and positively working in order to be ready to satisfy the contractual provision. Then, as soon as Eni will have been paid back the entire amount, what we will do with this amount? For sure, as a first step, we will repay those loans granted by banks, which carry the higher financial costs. And then for the rest, we will increase our liquidity. As many other energy companies, oil companies, our peers group, the liquidity that they have, and it is useful to have, is an amount which should be enough to cover at least one year of spending. Today, we have a much lower situation, but for sure, as soon as we have the cash coming from the repayment of the loans from Snam, our strategy is to increase significantly our liquidity in order to be able to face any potential change in the market, even when in case of very negative, when the financial market should move or can move in a very difficult situation. Because we are convinced that the troubles, which affected the financial market recently, the troubles are not over. We are still in a quite difficult financial environment. So it is better to face the future with a strong shoulder. So for sure, we will keep on board most of the cash coming from the repayment of the loan, increasing the liquidity of our profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kashagan. Now that considering Eni staff and the right contracted staff, we're about 2,000 people. Direct Eni is about between 600 and 700. Until June I think &#x2013; June next year, we will have this, start mobilizing and I think in January, February next year, because we have all the 2013 in one path. So we have to leave some people of our team over letting with Shell and KMG people, that will take over in January. The team of Shell and KMG has been in place for some years, so they are working with us. So we have these people, we reached production, the full production in January, they're on path. And we start mobilizing and so again it's 2014 and we start the mobilization in January 2013. In one year we are going to mobilize all our people. We need these people because you know that we are in lots of different hubs in operation and development and production, starting from Mozambique and Barents Sea. So that I think a lot of people that now are working in Kashagan that will work in Russia, in Barents Sea and also somebody in Mozambique. So that are the three main hubs where we use our people in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I had two questions on Mozambique, please. Shell were quite clear yesterday in saying that their bit for Cove was a sort of opening gambit in terms of increasing their stake in the future. And you previously said that you would like to be operator of the combined development. I just wondered what your thoughts are of a big LNG company moving in next door. And then just secondly, clarification on the Cove deal. They recently got a ruling regarding the capital gains tax of 13%. I just wondered as far are you're aware, is that an ad hoc ruling with regards to Cove or would that also apply to Eni if you were to sell down your 70% stake in that Area 4? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First in talking about the government, we say that we'd like to develop our resources and that is clear for our experience and for our knowledge of Africa and knowledge of Wilshire. We don't mine &#x2013; also with Anadarko a joint operatorship and that is for the upstream. And for the midstream, as you know, worldwide that normally there is a continual client venture, now normally a company with &#x2013; through which we develop the LNG like we did in Angola or Nigeria or Egypt. So that will be the way through which we are going to develop the LNG. So I think that, if Shell <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:06) is welcome, we work with Shell and we start working with Shell. We named the LNG big project in Nigeria in 1992, 1993, so some 20 years ago. So it's a good and knowledge and reputable partners that we know very well and I think that is one of the first companies for LNG. So I think that is a good &#x2013; it's a good point for the joint venture for everybody if they join us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the taxation, I think that's &#x2013; I don't think that there is low &#x2013; a deal that I'd opt for a company in that a deal is a deal. So I think that it will be valid for everybody. And if we're going to reduce our share, we have to pay these tax that at the moment that is repeated several times. Now we are focused on what we are to do not on selling. We don't want to sell. We don't want to reduce our share. We want to keep a strong position in Mozambique.</p>
