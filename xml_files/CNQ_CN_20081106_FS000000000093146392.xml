          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice-Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Thank you for attending this conference call. We will discuss our third quarter results, the progress on completion of our Horizon Project and our budget for the year 2009. These topics were covered in three separate press releases issued today. I'd also refer you to slides posted on our website, which we will be referring to in this call.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President and Chief Operating Officer; R&#xE9;al Doucet, our Senior Vice-President of Oil Sands; and Doug Proll, our Senior Vice-President of Finance.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press releases and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars and production and reserves are both expressed as before royalties unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>I would like to take a couple of the initial comments before I turn the call over to the other participants. Firstly, our third quarter operating results were excellent with production volumes meeting or exceeding our targeted guidance levels. This contributed to us achieving a very strong cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion which was well in excess of our CapEx requirements. The Company's ongoing growth and earnings has further resulted in a much stronger balance sheet.</p>
          <p>However, the business world is going through some unprecedented times and events with all of those events as a backdrop we have adopted a budget for 2009 that will serve us very well. You will see this morning the flexibility we have to ensure matching of cash flows with necessary CapEx requirements and our ability to remain nimble in changing times.</p>
          <p>As importantly, we know how to be a low cost producer. This has been a major plank in our strategy for many, many years. This means being low cost in all aspects from finding costs, to operating costs, to administrative costs and finally to financing costs. This measure will serve us very, very well over the next year.</p>
          <p>With that Allan, would you like to make a couple of comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. Canadian Natural's third quarter results and our 2009 budget reflect our continued drive towards developing our low-risk, exploitation and expiration based assets while creating value for our shareholders. They also are an example of how our fundamental approach to business serves us well in both good times and bad. One of our greatest strengths as a Company is our flexibility and in light of recent times flexibility has become even more important. The key focus as always is to create value and again our project portfolio affords us this flexibility to allocate our capital towards those areas where we will get the best returns.</p>
          <p>Spending where we need to, maintaining balance in our portfolio and low costs has led us to strong quarterly production numbers, and as John mentioned, a strong balance sheet. This base is further built upon in our realistic and very fluid budget and flexible budget for 2009. Our Conventional operations have positioned us well as we work towards completing our major projects: the Primrose East expansion already on stream in October; Phase I of the Horizon Project; and our two projects in Offshore West Africa, Baobab and Olowi. We look forward to the volumes and the cash flow these projects will provide. Steve will provide further detail on these projects along with an outline of the 2009 budget.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is committed to doing it right together for all stakeholders. We remain active participants in the communities in which we operate to ensure that the way we conduct our business not only maximizes economic returns but also encourages participation within communities while minimizing the impact on the environment. We have the land, the people and the balance sheet to excel and take advantage of the current market volatility. We believe that adhering to our core principles does result in creating value for our shareholders with some fun and integrity in these difficult times. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Al, thank you for those comments and good morning everyone. Steve Laut here. I'll be speaking to slides this morning that are available on our website, as John mentioned, at cnrl.com. I'll make a few comments on Q3 but spend most of my time on our strategy and the 2009 budget.</p>
          <p>As John and Al stated, our Q3 was a strong quarter. Primrose East came on stream early, on budget, now flowing back at 1100 barrels a day roughly per well, right on target. Primary heavy oil program continues to deliver creating significant value in this oil price environment.</p>
          <p>We are also making good progress at Olowi, the CSP deck has just been installed and the jack-up is scheduled to complete the tie back of the deck and then start drilling towards the end of November.</p>
          <p>At Baobab, two wells are completed. The first is flowing at 2800 barrels a day, less than expected as a horizontal section is about half the length planned and we are choking the well back as we are being cautious in the early stages of the well's life.</p>
          <p>At Horizon, we're making steady progress and we have encountered, as you read in the press release, many challenges associated with the commissioning and start up of the more complex components of the plant. That being said, we expect start up in Q4 '09 but to achieve this we cannot experience any further issues that will cause delays to our schedule. And we'll talk in more detail, R&#xE9;al Doucet will, where we are today at Horizon.</p>
          <p>Probably the most important event in Q3 as we all know, the world is changed. It's had a broad impact on global economies and creating tremendous volatility. The dramatic drop in oil and gas prices will make a significant impact in the oil and gas industry and the credit crunch will bring its own challenges.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, I'm going to turn to our strategy and 2009 budget. As you can see from this slide, Canadian Natural's purpose, as it should be for every oil and gas company, is to create value for our shareholders on a per share basis through all phases of the commodity price cycle. It's easy to say, but not every company has the ability to deliver. And as this slide shows Canadian Natural has succeeded and will continue to succeed because we have an effective proven strategy, a balanced and strong asset base, our expertise is broad and deep, technically, operationally and financially and importantly we deliver disciplined execution. We are a low cost producer and with high levels of management ownership, we have significant wealth at stake and are more clearly aligned with shareholders than any of our peers.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural has many advantages, some of which are the same as why we succeed. Our management business philosophy and practice is focused on putting the right people in the right place and ensures high levels of accountability and is focused on delivery of results. Our assets are strong with vast development opportunities and upside. Our strategy, as I said earlier, is proven and effective. Importantly, we have control over capital allocation. We are nimble so we can capture opportunities and we make the hard decisions, some of which you will see in the 2009 budget. We have significant free cash flow from our assets, which speaks to the strength of our assets. The Canadian culture, although it's tough to define, is critical to our success as we are low cost and focused on execution.</p>
          <p>Our strategy, as shown on the next slide, as many of you know is to optimize capital allocation to maximize value. We do this with a defined plan and large inventories of locations and projects in every place and product we're in. We're balanced between gas and oil, light, heavy and SCO, near, mid and long-term. We're balanced in our methodology through the drill bit and acquisitions, and we have a strong balance sheet which is balanced our debt in terms of time and sources of debt. Opportunistic acquisitions has always been a key part of our strategy. And as you'll see and as you've seen many times before, that has taken the Company to a stronger and higher level. Controlling costs is the critical plank in the platform. We do that by dominating the area of knowledge, infrastructure and land base in which we operate in core areas. Our strategy reflects Canadian Natural's belief that ultimately all the assets end up in the hands of the low cost producer and in tough times, the low cost producer has the advantage.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is a low cost producer in terms of F&amp;D costs, operating, G&amp;A, acquisition and interest costs. Balance and choice are an important part to being successful and a successful execution of our strategy and is the key to optimal allocation of capital. We have balanced assets, time lines and methodology that is soundly backed by strong and deep expertise in every area.</p>
          <p>We have had great success as you could see in this slide with mature basin gain, not only in Canada in Conventional gas, light and primary heavy oil, but also in the North Sea. The Non-Conventional business have created tremendous value for shareholders as we have the expertise to deliver in all these areas including: Horizon, our world class oil sands project; our vast thermal heavy oil assets, the hidden gem in our portfolio; Offshore West Africa; Unconventional gas and deep foothills gas. All these areas are important components of our growth and value platform and to a lesser degree we are exploration component or exploration driven in our business in Offshore West Africa, South Africa and in Unconventional gas.</p>
          <p>Of course acquisitions have always been an important part of our platform and we believe that the best explorers/exploiters are the best acquirers. Canadian National utilizes our strong expertise to recognize and capture opportunities. A good example of this would be the 2006 acquisition of Anadarko Canadian Co-op properties. Because we recognize the value in the Deep Basin and that of the emerging shale gas plays we are able to successfully acquire Anadarko Canada at attractive pricing. Today this acquisition looks very good even in the face of low gas prices. In all these components of our platform execution is critical in all areas. With our continued low F&amp;D, operating, G&amp;A costs it is obvious we execute our base businesses well.</p>
          <p>Our major projects as shown on the next slide, shows our track record is also good. At Espoir, Primrose North, Baobab and Primrose East, we have been on time and on budget. At Horizon, it's been a different story. We are not on time and we are not on budget. Now we have heard from many of you and I've heard directly from many of you probably that are on the phone, that this is understandable considering the highly inflationary environment, the demands for labor, the work ceding construction, contractors' capability, et cetera, et cetera and we have done a good job or better than others. However for Canadian Natural, Horizon does not meet our criteria for success. We continue to set the bar higher. That being said Horizon will still create tremendous value for all stakeholders and is a world-class asset.</p>
          <p>Our ability to execute and execute to the cycle is shown on slide 15 which shows our quarterly production growth since 1989. The message in this slide is Canadian Natural's ability to add value through each low price cycle. In 1994 when gas prices dropped 29%, in '98 when oil prices dropped 48% and 2001 when oil prices dropped 35%, in each and every case Canadian Natural added value and in most cases significant value as the industry has come out of this <mark type="audio gap" /> by capturing significant value-adding opportunities. We've now experienced a 48% drop in oil price so far and Canadian Natural is prepared for the cycle. Although this environment feels scary, Canadian Natural is well positioned and prepared as we have in the past and probably better than we ever have in the past to be -- weather this cycle and capture those opportunities that will exist.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean for the 2009 budget? On the next slide our overall plan is to execute the capital budget in a low price, tight and costly credit environment, to pay down debt, re-profile major capital spending were appropriate, ramp up our Horizon production and ensure capital flexibility for possibly even tougher times. We'll conserve our land base from expiries and drainage and we'll keep our thermal program on track and prepare for the future with cost reductions and acquisition opportunities. And most importantly focus on value growth, not production growth.</p>
          <p>That being said on the next slide in 2009 our production will grow 10 to 12% year-over-year, that's 16 to 18% entry-to-exit generating significant free cash flow of between 2.8 and $3.2 billion allowing the equivalent debt repayment. We have significant liquidity with $2.4 billion of bank lines available and our cash flow was 6.8 to $7.2 billion with a capital program of four billion. In that capital program we have flexibility to ramp up spending quickly or defer spending, if necessary. Our balance sheet is robust and it will strengthen through the year.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will reap the rewards of significant pre-2009 capital spending. At the strip, we'll have 2.8 to 3.2 billion of free cash flow; at $50 and $4 AECO we will have 2.1 to $2.5 billion. Even at $40 WTI and $3 AECO gas, we have free cash flow of 1.1 to $1.5 billion. This speaks to the strength of our assets and also our ability to hedge. And Doug, will talk a little bit more about our 2009 hedge program which includes a significant amount of $100 WTI puts. Further details of the hedge program are on our website.</p>
          <p>As you see Canadian Natural has significant free cash flow but is also free cash flowing from each of our businesses. And this slide shows, from Conventional Canada providing the largest amount of free cash flow, followed by Horizon, the North Sea and Offshore West Africa. As you can see in Offshore West Africa, we have a significant capital spend in 2009, allowing Baobab are still completing in 2009.</p>
          <p>Of course this type of free cash flow allows significant debt repayment at the strip and we are below our debt-to-book window as shown in this slide, even at $50 WTI and $4 AECO and we are comfortably within our debt-to-book range.</p>
          <p>Debt repayment is our first priority in the allocation of our free cash flow as shown on this slide. The second priority will be to allocate it to asset development, acquisitions or share buybacks with the highest return on capital areas being allocated to capital. Our third priority would be dividends in 2009.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, we show the 2009 budget. We've talked before we'll produce between 600 and 651,000 BOEs a day, at a midpoint that's 11% increase and entry-to-exit 16 to 18% increase. Our cash flow to strip as I said before is 6.8 to $7.2 billion and the capital budget is 4 billion, down 50% from 2008. Horizon, the North Sea and Offshore West Africa, all see a reduction in capital spending. Our 2009 capital budget has significant flexibility as shown on the next slide. Our 2009 inventory of projects and their locations are shown here total up to $7 billion. We will exceed only $4 billion, leaving roughly three billion of projects in inventory. Of the four billion in 2009 capital program, two billion is committed capital and two billion roughly is flexible capital that can be deferred on short notice. We also have the ability to bring back roughly 30% of that three billion of inventory projects in three to four months likely after breakup and that depends on the market. As you can see we have tremendous capital flexibility. The next slide just illustrates how the capital allocation in 2009 is shifted from Horizon as complete the major construction in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now turning briefly to each asset, I will hit the highlights of each product, starting with gas on slide 26. Our gas assets are strong and low cost. We have a deep inventory of 8,000 wells and the second largest land base in Western Canada. And we have meaningful exposure to conventional, unconventional, resource and exploration play types. In 2009, we will drill to minimize land expiries and drainage. And we will also drill our strategic gas plays that have exposure to shale gas, the Deep Basin and Foothills gas. And of course, focus on cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Alberta natural gas will receive the lowest priority due to punitive royalties. And production will decline 12% on gas for the Company as we drilled only 224 net gas wells down from 269 a 25% reduction in 2008. And it's important to note here, in that 224 gas wells 65% of those will happen after break up and give us additional capital flexibility should gas prices soften further.</p>
          <p>Our thermal assets are very strong and are probably the most underappreciated and least understood assets in our portfolio. In our defined plan alone, we have 33 billion barrels in oil in place with 5.5 billion recoverable. We have and will have 300,000 barrels a day of incremental heavy oil production from our defined plan from this asset in a very step-wise cost-controlled manner shown in slide 29.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we'll enter into the lower part of the base production cycle in thermal but we'll ramp up Primrose East to 40,000 barrels a day and you'll see thermal production up 23% year-over-year. We'll complete the EDS part of the engineering cycle at Kirby and obtain Kirby regulatory approval and sanction Kirby in 2009. There's significant technology upside in all our heavy oil which adds additional value.</p>
          <p>If you go to our next slide, it will show our primary heavy oil. Program continues to generate robust economics. We will drill 485 wells in 2009 and at Pelican Lake we will drill 107 wells and continue to roll out our highly successful polymer waterflood or polymer flood. As you know Pelican is a world-class pool with four billion barrels in place and between 350 and 475 million barrels recoverable with polymer flood, a low cost development.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, we have significant platform maintenance, we'll build drilling inventory and focus on capital cost reduction and offering cost reduction. We expect that we have potential acquisition opportunities in this environment in the North Sea.</p>
          <p>In Offshore West Africa, we'll complete the Espoir FPSO upgrade and get two more wells drilled and completed at Baobab. We'll continue with the Olowi development in Gabon with production coming on stream early 2009 in the first quarter and ramp up to 20,000 barrels a day by year-end. We also progress the exciting exploration prospect in South Africa and drive on from there.</p>
          <p>At Horizon, our world call oil sands project, with six to eight billion barrels recoverable we are very close to start up in Phase 1 at 110,000 barrels a day. Phases 2 through 5 will take us to 500,000 barrels a day or 0.5 million barrels a day with a 40-year reserve life and no decline with virtually no reserve replacement cost with added potential for technology upside. There is absolutely no question that Horizon is a world-class project and will add tremendous value for Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>2009, we'll ramp up Phase 1 production, focus on reliability, focus on reducing operating costs and reducing capital costs in our future expansions. Our business rationale here at Horizon is we are not going to build in a high cost environment for a moderate priced world. So the budget shown on the next slide for Horizon will include re-profiling a significant portion of Phase 2, Tranche 2 spending. We'll re-profile the Tranche 3 spending as well before we sanction and we'll only spend $574 million in Horizon in 2009.</p>
          <p>Before I continue on with the rest of the talk on the slides, I'll turn it over to R&#xE9;al Doucet at this time for a more detailed update on the current status of Horizon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Steve. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And just like Steve said we have implemented a strategy here to start up our plan in a very systematic way. Even though it will take us more time, we want to make sure that we're doing it safely and we're doing it also with reliability. So I will go over these plans one by one to tell you where we're at right now as we stand here today.</p>
          <p>First of all on a Mining area, the mining is completed; the equipment are all on site. We have been running now for quite some times in the overburden. Then we have run also about 300,000 bank to meter of ore into the crusher as a test. And it's been done quite successfully. So we're ready for the mining. And we have all the operators as well, all trained. We have our five shovels, 23 trucks and all the support equipment to carry us through.</p>
          <p>On the Ore Preparation Plant, the plant is completed. Also has been tested and we're ready for operation.</p>
          <p>On the Hydrotransport lines, it's been completed also and it's been tested and ready for operation.</p>
          <p>The Piperack, same way too; it's been completed. It is in fact live and operational right now. So the steam, the natural gas, the water, the nitrogen, all the commodities needed for the plant as whole, everywhere in each area is accessible and it's operational.</p>
          <p>On the Extraction Plant, it has been completed also, it's been tested. We have produced 160,000 barrel of bitumen for testing so far and the plant is ready for operation.</p>
          <p>On the Froth Treatment Plant, we had one setback on this plant. It's been fixed now. We had a bit of a design issue and the plant is completed now and we are finalizing the commissioning and as a matter of fact we're going to do the final testing and make it ready for operation here next week.</p>
          <p>In Delayed Coker and Diluent Recovery Unit the plant has been completed. It's on circulation right now with diesel. All the pumps, pipes and so on have been all tested. The coking, decoking mechanism has been tested as well. The furnace has been heated and the refractory has been tested and the plant is ready for operation.</p>
          <p>On the Co-generation Plant, same thing, it's been completed. We are producing steam for all the other commodities at plant requirement. We are also producing power. We have tested our turbo generator. And we know that it's producing 110% of designed capacity so far. So we are ready also on a co-generation side.</p>
          <p>On the Sulfur Plant, the plant's been completed. It's been turnover to operation and we are right now on the final stage of commissioning and testing.</p>
          <p>On the Tankage side, all the tanks are completed. They're all ready for operation. We're finalizing right now the installation on them. And we have already put the diluted material or the diluents for naptha, for the operation is already there. That diesel is there; also inventory for the circulations and so on. So the tankage is all ready. And that include also the final Tankage; the blending area, the truck loading area for the sulfur and also the pipeline to send the material down south.</p>
          <p>On the Main Control Room, all the plants right now are run by the control room. It's been fully operational for quite some time now and is working remarkably well. On the Utilities &amp; Services all the water, all the natural gas, all the commodities required to operate the plants are fully functional, fully operational and also the systems, instrumentations and so on is all operational as well.</p>
          <p>I guess that the SCO Pipeline is ready and the Hydrogen Plant also to supply the hydrogen to the Hydrotreater is also completed. It has been turnover to operation and as of yesterday we are producing hydrogen.</p>
          <p>On the Hydrotreater, which is the critical part right now and the most difficult plant to commission. There is three Hydrotreater plants: Naphtha Hydrotreater which is Plant 41, a Gas Oil which is Plant 43, and a Diesel which is Plant 42.</p>
          <p>So the strategy for us right now is to bring Plant 41 which by the way right now is in the hands of operation. So the project has been completed there and operations are doing the commissioning as we speak. On the Gas Oil Hydrotreater at Plant 43, we still have some electrical heat tracings to complete and we want to make sure that all the electrical heat tracing and insulations are completed before start up so that the winter start up will not influence the integrity of the plant. This will be completed shortly also and the Plant 43 is expected to be started and produce first oil here before year-end.</p>
          <p>As for the Distillate Hydrotreating Plant, right now we have completed the mechanical on it. We have completed all the hydro tests and so on. We are also again into heat tracing and insulation, making sure that we are completing all these heat tracing and insulation before start up so that winter also has no influence on our start up. This plant should be started in the first quarter of '09. It is not needed for first oil.</p>
          <p>So with Plant 41 the Naptha and Plant 42 the Gas Oil, we will be able to produce about 50 to 60% of our total capacity for the start up here and then during the first quarter we'll bring the Distillate Hydrotreating Plant into operation also for full capacity here by the end of the first quarter. Of course, there's a ramp up and looking at fine tuning, tweaking all these equipment for us that later on in 2009 we will be in full capacity production.</p>
          <p>We have accomplished also over 15 million man-hours on site so far in a very safely manner. We have, of course, substantial reduction on our manpower on site now; we're down to 2,500 which is essentially more than half of them in the Hydrotreater right now completing the heat tracing and the insulation. We have our operational personnel all in place; we have supplemented them also with some contractors right now, the licensors to help us also tweaking and fine tuning all the equipment that we have to produce the production reliably and constantly.</p>
          <p>So on this Steve, get back to you?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks R&#xE9;al. As you can see we're very close on Horizon, although close is not good enough. In summary of the overall picture our gas assets are very strong. We have 8,000 wells in inventory. We have a strong exposure to shale gas and the largest land-base in Western Canada. Our heavy crude program and assets are very, very strong with over 300,000 barrels a day of incremental oil to come on stream over the next 10 to 15 years. Internationally, we continue with the Baobab drilling, Olowi development and in the future exploration potential at South Africa.</p>
          <p>As we heard R&#xE9;al talk about Horizon, we will be on stream here in Phase 1; we have Phase 2 through 5 to take us to just under 500,000 barrels a day. This is significant value for all Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's advantage is clear and I'll repeat it again, we have the management business philosophy in practice. Our balanced assets are strong with vast opportunities. We have a balanced and proven effective strategy and importantly control over capital allocation. And we're nimble, we'll capture opportunities, we'll make tough decisions with we have significant free cash flow from our assets. That sets us apart. Our culture is important, its low cost and execution focused. And as you see on this last slide, I believe we are today better prepared then ever before to survive and thrive in this environment and capitalize on those opportunities that may occur in this environment. We are in great shape and with that I'll turn it over to Doug to give you more information on our financials.</p>

          <p>Thank you Steve and good morning. In the third quarter of 2008, in the nine months ended September 30 cash flow and capital expenditures were in balance and the increase in our long-term debt is mostly attributable to a weakening Canadian dollar over the periods. Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30 was $9.09 per share up from 8.74 in the comparable period in 2007. We have experienced large swings in quarterly net income moving from net earnings to loss to net earnings attributable to mark-to-market accounting of our commodity hedge program and certain other unrealized items. However, our non-GAAP measure of adjusted net earnings from operations which excludes unrealized gains and losses was relatively stable through this period. Adjusted net earnings from operations were 2.8 billion or $5.17 per share for the nine months ended September the 30th.</p>
          <p>Adding to our operational strength is our balance sheet strength. Our debt-to-book capitalization was 41% at the end of Q3, compared to 45% at the end of 2007 and June 30. Further, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7 times at September 30, slightly below our targeted range of 1.8 to 2.2 times and well below our debt agreement financial covenant of 3.5 times.</p>
          <p>Resulting from the worldwide credit disruption and as discussed in our MD&amp;A in the Liquidity and Capital Resource, section the Company has undertaken a thorough review of its liquidity sources as well as its exposure to counterparties and has concluded that its capital resources are sufficient to meet ongoing short, medium and long-term commitments. Further the Company believes that its counterparties currently have the financial capacity to settle outstanding obligations in the normal course of business.</p>
          <p>I would also like to touch on our hedge book for a moment. Our hedge policy is undertaken for the purposes of underpinning commodity prices to support cash flow from operations so that we can carry out our capital expenditure program. For 2009 we have roughly 30% of our oil and liquids production with 25,000 barrels in collars with a floor of $70 and a ceiling of 111 and we also have 92,000 barrels a day with a floor of $100 a barrel.</p>
          <p>In addition we have 500,000 GJs of AECO natural gas collars with a floor of $6 and a ceiling of 8.60 for the period through the first quarter of 2009. All positions for the remainder of 2008 and 2009 are provided on our website and we will be watching for opportunities to add more to support our cash flows.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to our 2009 budget, our guidance is posted on the website and is detailed in the budget release. We believe this budget and the underlying strategy is right for the times. It is prepared conservatively and with maximum flexibility. It underpins Canadian Natural's commitment to maintaining a strong financial position. It addresses our intent to retire the Anadarko Canada acquisition financing loan with free cash flow in 2009. And it provides free cash flow from each of our four business segments, thereby allowing for a full and complete process of allocation of capital.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I will return you to John for some closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. I appreciate all of the details that you have given us on cash flows and liquidity. And just had a question, so is it fair to say that you will try to maintain going forward your capital spending within -- in terms of debt paydown plus CapEx spending, within generated cash flow? And how much assuming -- you have a lot of room on your credit facilities as well, given opportunities, is there any willingness to dip into credit facilities as well? Or is it going to be simply focused on maintaining within your cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we're going to do here is pretty clear; we have a lot of flexibility in our capital budget. We have no intention at this point in time to dip into the bank lines. There will be opportunities but I don't expect them to be showing up here any time soon. I think it's going to take some time for this whole thing to unwind. So we'll live within our capital budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I appreciate it. And you have a quite a bit of flexible capital spend there in the budget; it looks like about half of the budget next year is relatively flexible. Where does most of that flexibility and then again as you look at a lower oil price environment, if you look at the $60, $50 level, and you've said that your focus is on generating not production growth but on generating value, how does the capital allocation change within your flexible assets in terms of &#x2013; at a $60 or $50 environment, does more of that money go into heavy oil versus conventional and nat gas or vice versa? How would you prioritize your spending on your assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The best way to look at that is obviously, addressing the flexibility, the most flexibility in our capital program is obviously in Canada in the Conventional assets. And we look at what gives us the highest return over the long-term and also in the short-term to capture any price spikes we may see. So right now obviously oil is still quite a bit better than gas. And we are always monitoring the relative economics between oil and gas and heavy and light and our other projects as well. We obviously have waterflood optimization, other enhanced recovery projects we all have to balance the near, mid and long-term aspects of our all programs. So we do have tremendous flexibility. Depending where -- gas prices aren't that great right now; oil is much better. So as you could see in 2009 most of our capital is directed towards oil and heavy oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I appreciate that. And you've often stressed how the market doesn't get very well the value of good thermal oil properties. Can you just discuss this -- I wanted the -- what type of cash flow do the thermal oil properties have at a $60 or at $50 WTI price? I assume still fairly robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very robust; our operating costs are probably about $15 to $16 on thermal heavy oil depending on the gas price. Obviously, right now the differentials are narrow. So if you get a $60 WTI take off say at the max $20. So your $40 WTI, convert that to Canadian, so you're at 50 and your operating costs are 16. So very high margins. Then you have to take off the F&amp;D costs which probably are around the -- now I'd say, nine to $10 range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I appreciate that gentlemen. Finally on -- you've obviously delayed, you've pushed back as lot of people have, some capital spend there at Horizon. As you look across the space and most of your competitors as well have deferred quite a bit of capital at Horizon, what -- not at Horizon but sorry in the oil sands, what effect do you see that having in the next 12 months on costs. I know it's very difficult to gauge and if everybody pushes back, and you have probably more capital flexibility than some of your competitors, is there any opportunity if costs come down quick enough to re-accelerate some of that or is it going to be conservatism for the next 12 to 18 months and we'll just stick with the deferral?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not really a deferral of capital; it's a re-profiling of capital and how we'll spend that capital. So the projects aren't really deferred, it's how we re-profile the capital and obviously we think it'll take some time here before we see some kind of normalization of costs. And quite frankly we've got to see how prices shake out. We don't want to build in a high cost environment and have a low price environment for a while.</p>
          <p>And let me give you an example that really captures what we mean by re-profiling. This year we had to do some civil work in our diversion dike around our dam for the Tar River. Our estimate to do that work was $20 million. We went out to bid to do that work in May-June time. The range of bids from a number of bidders came in at 40 to $75 million, and again our estimate was $20 million. So we re-profiled that work and that what really what that means is we didn't do it, and we tried to find different ways to do it.</p>
          <p>We've recently this fall had a contractor who happened to be between jobs, did not have work lined up immediately which was unusual. He put a bid in to do that work for $14 million. That work is now being completed; the quality work is good. He's on time and he's not going over budget. So two issues here: one, work that we estimated at $20 million, we would get bids between 40 and $76 million or $75 million that tells you the amount of froth in the market. The second thing is, we had an estimate of $20 million and we got it done for 14, so in a way we're actually affected by the market as well by our estimate being higher than what it can actually get it done in a normal market.</p>
          <p>So those are some of the things that we need to capture and get adjusted to here, not only at Horizon but throughout the oil sands business in Fort McMurray. It's just &#x2013; these re-profiling and deferring of other projects will bring back hopefully some normalcy and how long that'll take, I'm not sure. But I think it will be more -- longer than a year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I'm very pleased to see the $100 puts that you put in place in the quarter. I was just curious, wanted to gauge your interest in additional hedging as you look at 2009 or potentially even longer. And just I guess more broadly, how do you strategically balance upside price potential versus the potential for additional acquisitions in a downside price environment? You're giving up something on either side of the hedging decision and I'm just curious as your thought process as how you go through that at CNQ, which tends to win out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will be looking at hedging opportunities and the opportunities to place both collars and puts as move forward into 2009 and beyond. I think that where we are right now or I believe where we are right now is we're in this $60 environment having come from $147 environment. We're trying to protect from the downside but as the economy does pick up over the next period of time I think the consensus is the prices will go up. Having said that, we have work to do in the near-term and mid-term and we have to make sure that those capital expenditures are undertaken, that our balance sheet is protected and so we'll be cautious but we will be putting on more hedges as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how have you found the liquidity in the market? Is there still as much put and collar capacity out there as a year ago or is the composition changing back to the old days of futures liquidity and that's it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as financial institutions as their balance sheets have tightened and they look at better ways of doing business, the market has got a lot tighter and the spreads between the bid and ask, no different than they have on our bonds, have widened. And so we have to take that into consideration. Having said that, we still have very strong counterparties; all of our counterparties have been affected but at the same time are strong. And we've discussed this with them and at no time do we have any concerns with those counterparties.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Steve. We're having a little bit of difficulty hearing you on the call but I think you started getting into the topic here of re-profiling. Could you give us what exactly you mean about re-profiling here, Tranches 2 and 3 at Horizon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really mean, Brian is that we're going to adjust how we spend the capital over time and take those opportunities to get costs in line. Obviously, we're not in the make-a-project mode anymore. And we can do this bit by bit and get better costs and better control on our costs and we'll take the time and do it right. As you know we are value creators not value destroyers, so we're out there to get the best cost and get our production on at lowest cost. That's what we really mean by re-profiling. It's not that the &#x2013; we're deferring the project; it's just that we're going to take our time and do it right and spend the capital in a more prudent manner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Second question, and I think I've asked this before in previous conference calls, and again you were starting to get into it in terms of some of the returns you're looking at in your businesses. So could you compare today the net backs you're seeing for your conventional heavy oil, your thermal heavy oil versus the opportunities that you're seeing on natural gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the best way for me to answer that would be just on the recycle ratios which is really the net backs divided by the F&amp;D costs. And I will say that earlier in the year, back in May and June, the recycle ratios were six to seven on the oil projects and maybe two on gas. Today, obviously the recycle ratios have contracted. We see recycle ratios in thermal about two -- 2.2 on some of the primary heavy oil and on gas, we're about 1.5 or 1.4. So the relative economics have moved closer but everything has really shifted downward.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from Amir Arif from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. I had a couple of questions. First of all, just on your '09 outlook, your capital spending on the Conventional side is staying the same, yet your Conventional production's going to drop about 4%. Can you just shed some light on that? Is it -- because if anything I thought it'd be the other way around with the Primrose East CapEx spend in '08 and production coming in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you're seeing here Amir is what we've done in Primrose as you know is a cyclic operation, and we have a large base production and that will cycle. So it actually masks the effect of bringing Primrose East totally on; that's something we've alluded to before. So what we see here is that the production is up thermal year-over-year by 23%, but that is not as much as it would be had we not been in the low part of the cycle for the base production throughout the year.</p>
          <p>As far as gas, obviously, we're spending very little on gas. We have &#x2013; we're drilling more wells -- less wells but they're deeper and take longer to get on and we're giving ourselves a lot of flexibility whether we complete that or not. So and the North Sea is declining; we're not spending -- are not drilling any wells there really and it's going to take us some time for Olowi to get on, as we had anticipated, but we will ramp it up to 20,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>I don't know if that answers your question but really we're not spending enough capital on the gas side to maintain production. And on the oil side, it's really the cycling at Primrose that affects it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Steve, so if we were to take out the impact of the cycling from Primrose, what would you say is your maintenance capital or capital you need to keep production flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, well in today's cost environment we probably need 1.4 to $1.6 billion capital just to keep gas flat. And taking out the cyclic nature of oil we probably need, I would say close to $1 billion really to stay flat there. And then that's just -- that would mean we would not do any of the longer-term projects, the waterfloods, the enhanced recoveries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sounds good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's sort of a bare minimum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That answers it. The second question, in terms of the supply agreement with the US refiner for 100,000 barrels a day for a 20-year contract on the volumetric side, can you just shed some color in terms of why you left it at market price? Is it just the volatility? Is it your view on heavy oil differentials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've done here is that the contract is at market price...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...and so what we've done is, we believe that the mine differential is always a bit lower than the Western Canadian Select differential in Chicago. So by having that pipeline and the contract we're able to grow our heavy oil production and meet the demand on our side to have more markets to put that heavy oil without widening the differential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also need to get there for our market production. To get the market -- you can't have too much oil flooded into Pad Two or the Midwest; it'll just widen the differential. So it's critical not only for us but really for the whole Canadian industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to your capital question, Amir, one of the things that we do have on the oil side this year is a very large strap well program that is defining our future thermal program in more detail. So we can execute that as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sounds good and just one final question. On your thermal oil sands growth strategy, at what point on the volume side do you start getting concerned about too much heavy oil production or is it with your oil sands production growing and your take a look capacity to the refinery you're not concerned about needing an additional coker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time we have a fairly well defined program so we know when our oil is coming. So we don't believe pipeline capacity would be an issue.  The pipeline to the Gulf Coast will be ready in theory for Q4 2011, so likely 2012 some time we will be able to flow oil. And the way our program is set, we don't see any real tough restrictions or market crunches coming. If we did, we would probably slow down the thermal program but at this point we don't see any reason to do that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, completely switching gears here, you mentioned the first well at Baobab was drilled and on at something like 2800 barrels a day. Can you just kind of give us a bit more definition of what the program that lies ahead is and roughly what we should be expecting in terms of timing and what your thoughts are in terms of productivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Martin, as you know this is a deepwater development subsea, so it takes some time. The first well is done; it's a gravel pack and flowing at 2800 barrels a day. It has more capacity. Our expectations were to be about 4,000 barrels a day, but we didn't get the whole length drilled in the reservoir.</p>
          <p>The second well is now drilled and completed, and it will come on here, probably in December. We're going to try and test the well through the rig just to make sure the gravel pack is in good shape. But then the rig will move off onto the next well and at some point in time here in the next month or so we'll move the vessel in to connect it to the subsea pipeline system.</p>
          <p>We'll then move to our next well, which is what we call P12 and we will drill that and depending on the time it takes to get that, that'll be our third well, we will try to get to the fourth well. So the third well will be done in 2009 here and expect it will come on probably late-2008, early-2009. But we're trying to see if we can get another well in, in our contract period and we do have this thing for roughly a year, so it will be due to give back in May.</p>

          <p>So, that's the program. We'll see what we get for results. We're being very, very cautious. So, these are expensive wells and we want to make sure we don't cause some completion damage by opening them up too quickly.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I noticed on the sustained capital for Horizon in your budget that's a bit &#x2013; is that a long-term run rate too, or is that just in the short-term here?</p>

          <p>Gordon, that's probably a short-term or is a short-term issue. We will have sustaining capital every year. I would think it'll be more in the 80 to $100 million range. In the sustaining capital, we have given ourselves an allowance. In the first year of operation, we quite often see new pumps or new motors that fail on you and we have to give ourselves a capital allowance to replace some of those components. If we're lucky we won't have to spend all that money.</p>
