          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.</p>
          <p>Schlumberger fourth quarter income from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $1.03 per share, down $0.22 sequentially and down $0.08 compared to the same quarter of last year. As announced, we are taking actions to reduce our global workforce as a result of the recent decline in activity in the Oilfield Services sector. We therefore recorded an exceptional charge of $0.08 per share during the quarter primarily to reflect these actions and create a provision relating to a client with liquidity issues. Depending how the market situation evolves, further actions may be necessary.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue fell by 2% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue dropped 33% sequentially. Oilfield Services generated $1.6 billion in pre-tax operating income, down 100 million sequentially, with margin slipping by 117 basis points to 25.6%.</p>
          <p>By area, Oilfield Services pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows, my comments are on a sequential basis. North America pre-tax margin improved by 115 basis points to 22.3% with a strong offshore recovery in the Gulf of Mexico after the hurricane impaired third quarter and strong activity in U.S. land West and in Alaska. These increases were partially offset by the impact of pricing pressure in the U.S. land Central and U.S. land North GeoMarkets.</p>
          <p>Latin America pre-tax margin declined 211 basis points to 18% with lower activity levels in the Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago GeoMarket, and unfavorable activity mix in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Mexico Central GeoMarket.</p>
          <p>In Europe/CIS/Africa, pre-tax margin reduced 295 basis points to 26.1%, as Russia experienced a seasonal decline in activity offshore in Sakhalin, combined with significant reductions in activity in other areas due to lower customer spendings. Less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and Nigeria &amp; Gulf of Guinea GeoMarkets also reduced area margin.</p>
          <p>Finally, Middle East, Asia pre-tax margin declined 199 basis points to 33.5% on lower overall activity and less favorable technology mix in the Arabian and India GeoMarkets.</p>
          <p>WesternGeco pre-tax income of $88 million reflected a decline in pre-tax margins of 25.1 percentage points to 14.7%.</p>
          <p>Marine decreased from the record third quarter results through lower vessel utilization and a high number of transits, while the low level of multiclient sales depressed margins significantly.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate before the impact of the exceptional charges was 21.5%, which was in line with last quarter. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for 2009.</p>
          <p>Net debt was $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, representing a sequential improvement of $600 million. Further, we ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments on hand.</p>
          <p>In addition, $1.8 billion of committed debt facilities and commercial bank &#x2013; with commercial banks remain unused and were available at the end of December. This compares to short-term debt of only $1.6 billion, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements.</p>
          <p>Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $154 million of the stock buyback program, $234 million of pension funding and $1.25 billion of CapEx including 83 million multiclient surveys capitalized. During the quarter we bought back 2.7 million shares for 154 million at an average price of $57.05.</p>
          <p>Given the current credit and economic environment, we anticipate that the total dollar amount of stock repurchases in 2009 to be significantly less than the 1.8 billion spent during 2008. This anticipated reduction will serve to increase Schlumberger's financial flexibility during these uncertain times.</p>
          <p>Our stock buyback activity during 2009 will continue to be targeted to offset any dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs. Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to approach $2.2 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco CapEx is expected to reach $800 million in 2009. This includes $385 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels.</p>
          <p>And now, I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good morning everybody. Oilfield Services full-year 2008 revenue of 24.28 billion increased 20% versus 2007, driven by area growth of 28% in Latin America, 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa, 18% in Middle East, Asia and 11% in North America. All technologies experienced double-digit growth most notably in Well Services, Drilling &amp; Measurements and Wireline.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, however, Oilfield Service revenue declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the weakening of many local currencies against the U.S. dollar, as well as the lower activity in Russia, and with the exception of North America, generally weaker activity around the globe.</p>
          <p>This general weakness was partly due to seasonal weather effects and partly to initial client curtailment of spending. As a consequence, with the exception of North America, pre-tax operating margins declined.</p>
          <p>Looking at the areas in more detail, sequential performance in North America was led by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket, as activity recovered from the slowdown of the hurricane season in the third quarter and as higher ultra deep-water rig count led to strong demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Well Services technologies.</p>
          <p>On land, revenue in the U.S. land West GeoMarket increased on demand for Well Services and Drilling &amp; Measurements services and Artificial Lift products while the Alaska GeoMarket saw a seasonal buildup in activity that resulted in robust demand for Well Services and Drilling &amp; Measurements technologies.</p>
          <p>Also on the positive side, Schlumberger Information Solutions experienced growth from seasonally strong year-end software and hardware sales. These increases, however, were partially offset by the U.S. land Central and Northern GeoMarkets, where the reducing rig count that accelerated at quarter end resulted in lower revenue. In Canada, revenue was lower primarily due to the weakening Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>Sequential revenue in Latin America fell with activity for Wireline and Well Services technologies and completions products in the Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago GeoMarket decreased, and as the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket suffered lower activity in Integrated Project Management operations. These decreases however were partially offset by strength in the Brazil GeoMarket from higher offshore exploration-related demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Drilling &amp; Measurements services, and in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket from strong demand for Artificial Lift and Information Solutions products.</p>
          <p>Overall, area revenue was reduced by an estimated 4% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. In Europe, CIS and Africa, sequential revenue declined by 5% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in the North Sea, Continental Europe and Russia.</p>
          <p>Russia also saw significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending in addition to the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin. Activity however increased in the Libya GeoMarket with strong demand for Artificial Lift products and for Drilling &amp; Measurements, Well Testing and Wireline services. The Continental Europe GeoMarket also grew with higher demand for Wireline and Drilling &amp; Measurements technologies.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East &amp; Asia area revenue decreased as a result of seasonal weather-related effects in the Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand and in the China/Japan/Korea GeoMarkets, lower activity in Qatar as projects were completed, a less favorable activity mix in Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines and reduced customer spending in the China/Japan/Korea and Arabian GeoMarkets all affected revenue.</p>
          <p>While these declines primarily affected Wireline, Drilling &amp; Measurements and Well Services activity, they were partially offset by growth in the Gulf GeoMarket for Artificial Lift products, Well Services and Drilling &amp; Measurements technologies.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, the sequential 33% decline in quarterly revenue was largely due to increases in Marine &#x2013; excuse me, decreases in Marine, which was affected by vessel transit, dry docks and project startups.</p>
          <p>Multiclient revenue also decreased significantly as customers reduced discretionary spending. Margins suffered in consequence. At the end of the year however, WesternGeco benefited from an all-time record backlog of $1.8 billion underpinned by a number of long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>The sharp drop in oil and gas prices due to lower demand, higher inventories and the belief that demand will erode further in 2009 as a result of reduced economic activity is leading to rapid and substantial reductions in exploration and production expenditure. At current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources are not economic to develop. It will also take time for inflation to be removed from the system and to bring finding and development costs more in line with lower oil and gas prices.</p>
          <p>We therefore expect 2009 activity to weaken across the board, with the most significant declines occurring in North American natural gas drilling, Russian oil production enhancement and in mature offshore basins. Exploration offshore will be somewhat curtailed, but commitments already planned are likely to be honored.</p>
          <p>Seismic expenditures, particularly for multiclient data are likely to decrease from last year, and pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue. In this market we are taking the necessary actions to adjust our operating cost base, while preserving our long-term commitment to technology development, key skill sets and service and product quality.</p>
          <p>The key indicator of a future recovery in Oilfield Services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil. The recent years of increased exploration and production spending have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation. The age of the production base, accelerating decline rates, the smaller size of recently developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will sow the seeds of a strong rebound.</p>
          <p>We have no doubt that Schlumberger will emerge from the current downturn a stronger company, better positioned to participate in the subsequent upturn.</p>
          <p>And I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I was wondering in your view how do you &#x2013; how does this cycle compare to other cycles you've experienced in your career? Would you put this closely, more closely aligned with the '97 to '99 period or more like the '80 to '86 period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; actually, I think it's a bit different from both because the precipitous drop in the oil price is combined with the contraction of the general economy. So actually, the biggest difference I see from both sort of the mid-80s and as well as '97-'98 is the speed with which everybody is reacting. Our customers are reacting at a much faster pace than they probably did even in '97-'98, which was a very sharp cycle. I mean, my general comment is, these cycles as I experienced them are getting much sharper in their amplitude and shorter in their duration. Now of course, that depends on the general economy. But I would say that the big difference I see so far is the speed with which everyone is reacting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And I -- if I could follow up, just in the prior periods it always had taken longer for the international markets to adjust to the changes relative to North America, and a lot of that has to do with long-term contracts. Predicated on what you just said about your customers acting more quickly, do these contracts still provide that chance that the international markets could bleed lower and extend out into 2010? I don't want you to get specific, but just trying to get a general &#x2013; I'm trying to handicap it myself. I don't know if we were going to bleed lower like we did in the last couple of cycles, or if you think '09 is really the ultimate trough here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The simple answer is, I don't know. I think the &#x2013; that our customers, they are not going to break contracts, but they are going to pressure us to swap price for volume or price for duration, or things like that. So, where they have an opportunity, they are definitely going to act on price. But I don't think that they are going to break contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go on to the line of Charles Minervino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Andrew, I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about your conversations with the national oil companies. I know they all have probably different goals and breakeven points on various projects. But if you could generally just talk about what you're seeing from them? They've obviously accumulated a lot of cash over the last few years. How are you seeing them spending through this cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is &#x2013; it's very difficult to generalize on them like that. But the ones that are mixed, in other words they have some private ownership, I think they will react very much as private industry does. The ones that are entirely state-owned, if they have cash I think they will spread out their programs. But I doubt they will cancel them because they don't want to really compromise their long-term position in this industry. So I think there is a very mixed reaction. But if I had to generalize it, if they can spread their programs over a longer period of time, they are likely to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you just give us a sense of globally or internationally, can you talk about a little bit at the markets that you see? You mentioned earlier Russia slowing down. Can you touch a little bit on Latin America and the different parts of Europe where you see maybe holding up a little bit better versus slowing down a little bit more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Latin America will be a mixture. There are at least two GeoMarkets in Latin America that will remain very healthy, and two that will probably weaken fairly dramatically. So I think overall, there is a good chance that Latin America will be flat -- flattish over the whole year. But it's very early for me to commit to that. But that's the way we would see it today. If you look at Europe, then parts of Central Europe will hold up. The North Sea will weaken. A lot of the weakness -- actually almost all our weakness this quarter in the North Sea came from the devaluation of the pound against the U.S. dollar. But it will weaken over the year.</p>
          <p>If you look at Africa, we see some &#x2013; the Libya, Algeria and North Africa axis will hold up pretty well. And offshore West Africa, the big guys will hold up really well. But some of the small independents who were doing exploration will probably drop off. So there is a reasonable &#x2013; I think overall I have to &#x2013; I hate to go on being negative. But overall, I suspect Europe, Africa, CIS will be down and there will be pockets of strengths with the big customers offshore Algeria, Libya, but the rest will be fairly weak.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, if I could ask you to clarify your comment on the inflation and the unwinding of it, particularly, I think when we think F&amp;D Inflation we tend to think oilfield pricing and clearly the biggest components there were rigs and steel, two businesses you're not in. So first, I guess to clarify that with respect to oilfield pricing? And then secondly, how you could be actually benefiting from inflation unwinding in terms of your own P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually my remark was you don't drill without a rig and you don't build a platform without steel.  So the really high inflation ticket items in projects are undoubtedly what our customers are going to want to come down. They &#x2013; traditional arm wrestling with the contractors, and having run one, I know what's that like.  It will take some time to work itself through the system. That's what I meant Michael, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The steel stuff, the input to our manufacturing, be it steel, Inconel, chrome, copper, the pricing effect is fairly immediate.  As soon as we through our inventory we see the pricing effect come in very quickly.  In fact you know we have some of our IPM contracts where the tubular element whose price has been dropping by very a substantial amount on a monthly basis. So I think &#x2013; but for it to really work its way through our system in terms of material cost you're probably looking at a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think it's &#x2013; I'm not putting words in your mouth then to say that this was not a statement about your own pricing structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Our pricing structure will be negotiated, renegotiated, as I explained in an answer to an earlier question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But for my customers, really it's getting the cost of the really big ticket items down that's going to make projects become economic again or not.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>In a slowdown, the next kind of focus usually moves to your receivables. I'm wanted to know if you can comment on recent press reports of PDVSA owing somewhere over 8 billion -- somewhere near $8 billion and they stopped paying. Are there other areas in the world where you're seeing this type of pressure from your customers where they're running out of money and extending you on receivable side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not significantly. I think there is a bigger risk from some of the smaller independents than there is from the other national oil companies. I mean terms will undoubtedly extend, they always do in a downturn. But you know since I've been in this business we have never not been paid by an NOC.</p>

          <p>Well, I mean you never say never, but when I first joined Schlumberger one of the NOCs didn't pay us and they paid us seven years later. But, Simon, we have never not been paid, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I confirm, as a matter of fact in Q4 we improved our receivable situation. That's part of the improvement in the net debt that I spoke about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there &#x2013; your expectations are that most will stay current right now or are there like I said before, there are areas in the world where you're worried about this happening as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not &#x2013; we haven't seen any. We've seen an improvement as Simon said but if we look at specific companies, I don't think we've seen any significant deterioration yet that leads us to worry. I have to say that we put our field people on credit watch back in September. So they have been doing a lot of quality upgrading of the customer exposure since last September.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Kind of unrelated follow-up, but given the changes in the dynamics of demand out there, are you changing your marketing or pricing strategies at all in any particular markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't want to say that over the phone. My competitors are undoubtedly listening, but yes, everybody has to adapt to the current market circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's good. I'll leave it at that, thanks Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Andrew, if we can just come back to what you said about coming out of this downturn a stronger company. Was this just your reflections of how the whole cycle is playing out or was it any specific Schlumberger there relative to competitors and should there be a consolidation or market share gains into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's much easier for companies with very strong balance sheets to operate in this environment, because we don't &#x2013; we can still make investments that we think are going to pay off for the long term. As I said last October, we will be more opportunistic in acquisitions than we have been perhaps during the period when we felt that valuations were out of hand.</p>
          <p>And generally, we will not &#x2013; we never adjust our R&amp;D in any significant way during these downturns, which means that when you turn up again, you have been able to renew a considerable part of your product and service portfolio. So if that recipe still works, that's what I meant, Ole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what you do think are the chances that when we eventually come out of this downturn that the competitive landscape will have meaningfully changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I mean I think that there are going to be &#x2013; you can see already that some of the smaller companies that went with private equity are struggling, so they may get snapped up. Whether there will be a larger consolidation, I don't know, Ole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just move on to Block 31, it was kind of buried in the middle of the press release. And by the way, your press release seems to be particularly aggressively sprinkled with the contract awards on technology this time around. So I just wonder whether we should read anything into that specifically? But particularly on Block 31, could you talk a little bit about just &#x2013; you seem to have won sort of full house there on the service side and what part of that was incumbent and what was new awards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually don't know off the top of my head. Certainly you know that Wireline was incumbent. I'm not sure about Drilling &amp; Measurements and Well Services, we were partly incumbent. So I would say we were incumbent on quite a lot of it. But don't forget, this is moving to the development stage, so the scope is very different.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you've been successful on the completion in deep-water in West Africa versus some of your previous strong competitors, has completion been awarded yet on Block 31?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks for that, Andrew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question from the line of David Anderson with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew, getting back to some of the past downturns. I just wonder if you could just kind of elaborate a little bit on applying some of the lessons you learned during the last downturns to now? I'm just curious if that was a factor in the timing of your decision to cut your workforce? I guess my question is: did you move the timing up because your outlook is really becoming incrementally more negative and you're looking in the past and you decided to make a decision here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, when I compare the way we are managing that to '97, '98, we actually today have much, much better data. That's the first difference. The second difference &#x2013; and data about our own workforce, I mean: where it is, who it is, what the loading is, all the rest of it.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that in previous cycles, including '97, '98 we used to listen to our customers about what we thought was going to happen in the market. And since then, where we suffered really badly from listening, we make up our own minds. So I will say that the decision that we had to make a workforce cut was probably made in November. And we &#x2013; the actual &#x2013; we didn't, we don't make press releases about these things, but the cut actually concerns about 5,000 people worldwide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, have you become incrementally more negative over the last two months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You also talked about the speed of spending cuts being faster than expected in past downturns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see much of a difference between the IOCs and the NOCs reacting right now? And is this more of a credit issue. I mean, I'm hearing &#x2013; it seems like credit will be more than an issue than commodities, but I don't know if there's any way you can comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think credit is an issue for the sort of ecosystems that grew up particularly in the London AIM market, maybe in Russia a bit and also in the U.S., where people spend &#x2013; either don't have any cash flow like the exploration companies in London or spend, traditionally spent 125% or 150% of their cash flow as the case in North America. So obviously, the credit crunch has had an effect on the speed of the contraction, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one more question if I may. With regard to the offshore sector, you talked about a lot of contracts in place should keep that work out there. Just wondering, if the customers have the rig rates locked in already, and they're looking to cut costs another way, does that mean it comes down to you guys? Are you guys starting to get a lot of push-back on the pricing right now and how does &#x2013; your pricing structure offshore, I mean how flexible is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, of course we're going to get push-back on the pricing. But the factor in the pricing of an offshore development is tiny compared to some of the other ones. And what they will do is some of the big new expensive rigs that were slated for exploration will be moved to development if they can't get out of their contract. Because an exploration rig doesn't develop -- does not produce cash flow, a development rig does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Andrew.</p>

          <p>Hi, Bill.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Russia, not getting a whole lot of attention with regard to the potential, I guess production response to the implosion in drilling activity that we're seeing real time. Can you comment on that in terms of what you're seeing ground level and what your expectations are, as the year unfolds with the continued collapse in rig activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that from the reports, the production is dropping now. I think that were drilling activity to remain as low as it's coming for a year or so, that would be a very significant decline in production, I don't want to give a number. But a very significant decline, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Could you again, a difficult question to answer, because it's about depth and duration, but, as you look out into 2009, what are your expectations with regard to a year-over-year decline in the E&amp;P capital spending in Russia on a percentage basis, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we haven't looked &#x2013; we don't &#x2013; so you have to divide the Russian market into three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The IOCs, particularly in Sakhalin, there will be no decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The small Russian companies that depended on credit markets will probably just not drill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what we are looking at at the moment, the hypothesis we are working on is that there will &#x2013; not in &#x2013; I can't give you this in money. But in the total meters drilled we're looking at somewhere &#x2013; a drop of somewhere between 10 and 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Total meters drilled.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's for the whole market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the &#x2013; essentially for the Western Siberian, Southern Russia market. Put it this way Bill, the mature market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Down 10 to 20% year-over-year. And I would suspect that the pricing pressure that the service industry is encountering in Russia is fairly acute, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So capital spending by down, who knows, 20 to 30 or 40%, we'll see. Second question, Andrew: we have a decent slug of new built seismic vessels coming into the market this year, the Eastern Echo boats. What is the plan with regard to your existing fleet, some of your older vessels? Do you plan on stacking those or mothballing, or do you not know at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually when we bought Eastern Echo --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We made a contingency plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't think we'd have to use it, but we may have to use it. And if we do have to use it, the first thing is, we still have some leased vessels. And luckily a lot of those leased vessels we can release in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You say a lot...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will leave us with an almost 100% owned fleet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in that case if we have to stack, we will park them in a fjord somewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll talk to Malcolm off-line as &#x2013; with regard to how many vessels that encompasses in terms of your leased fleet. Lastly, with regard to you our receivable policy, I hear you with regard to national oil companies eventually making you whole. But what is the policy with regard to the carrying value of these receivables on the balance sheet? Is there a certain threshold at which you have to start writing them down, call it six months to a year or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Simon comment, but we have a policy, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically we have a policy where we look on an item-by-item basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't take general provisions. We do analyze our receivable divided by areas. People &#x2013; and GeoMarkets, they have very good visibility. And we look at our receivables item-by-item basis. So we don't take a general provision. Like we announced now, we took a particular provision that related to a specific client and this is how we look at it. So we don't have a general policy that is based on aging. It is more particular to the client and the &#x2013; what we know from the client and the discussion with them and the timing to be paid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So last question. So, for example, if you were to have some vulnerabilities attendant to an NOC, yet they historically have made you whole with regard to receivables. How would you &#x2013; I mean how would the carrying value of those receivables adjust if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we will look at our experience with the NOC. The discussion that's ongoing with them...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will make the decision on those basis. Now if it goes beyond a certain timeframe, yes I mean in a prudent accounting approach we might take a provision, but this would be again dependent on the circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Traditionally, Bill, historically, the payment patterns of our NOC customers tend to get reflected in the pricing we practice.</p>

          <p>In the prepared comments, Andrew you speak to pricing erosion in your U.S. land Central and North GeoMarkets. Assuming that applied primarily or refers primarily to well stimulation, are you also starting to see it in some of your other products and service lines in those specific GeoMarkets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with regard to your Oilfield Services CapEx being down at roughly 28% year-over-year, historically your CapEx spend has been fairly consistent with kind of your revenue mix. As we think about kind of that decline year-over-year, is it fair to think about North America bearing more the brunt of the reductions or is that not a fair characterization?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's probably a fair characterization, yes. The brunt, no, but proportionally more, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One I understand that PEMEX intends to move forward with as many as eight 500-well packages at Chicontepec in 2009. Could you comment on that, and also talk about when your contracts expire? When you end your current stage of work at Chicontepec?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the only core ones I'm prepared to comment on are the ATG III and IV, which have been announced. Beyond that, I'm not prepared to speculate on what PEMEX might or mightn't do. And we have &#x2013; our current contracts are actually &#x2013; we have been awarded some extensions to make up for some of the shortage of wells that PEMEX feel they have. And therefore, I think our contract with its extensions will carry us through most of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, I was even given all of your explanations, I was still surprised over the magnitude of the drop in seismic profitability relative to the revenue. Could you perhaps expand on that, and given where you were in the fourth quarter, where would you see the overall direction of profit margins from the fourth quarter levels in your seismic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you have to remember that the third quarter is the strong quarter in the North Sea, and the North Sea has the highest seismic pricing in the world. So you've got a compounded effect of the boats moving to lower price contracts outside the North Sea, transit times and you also got, we had a number of boats in dry dock during the fourth quarter. So the magnitude is surprising, I agree with you, but it's quite logical. There's nothing particularly startling. I mean, obviously in a quarter where you have transits and dry docks, you can't reduce your fixed costs very much in Marine. And the other portion of it was the &#x2013; which we had somewhat anticipated was the absence of multiclient both in North America and overseas during the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So some this, at least going forward, at least should lessen. So would you expect overall your relative profitability in that business in terms of margin should improve over the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean I'm not sure &#x2013; Q1 is not a good proxy, because it's a bit like Q4. But certainly in the second quarter, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Presumably the cuts that you put in place in terms of head count, expenses, CapEx stem from your planning process. At that level of employment and spend, I mean what does that imply or what are you planning on in terms of activity levels, just trying to get a sense for where your heads at. Are you staffed for that expected level or is there kind of a Part B, if things deteriorate further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So while we obviously have an overall plan at the level of Schlumberger Limited, as our field people's visibility beyond Q2 is still very poor, we've asked them to make a plan in two parts. So, first half-year plan, second half-year plan. And we will revisit the second half-year plan in April-May.</p>
          <p>The head count adjustment we made now, which as I pointed out in earlier question was planned in November, was to adjust to what we felt activity levels were likely to be in the first quarter, if not half-year. Now in fact, we're seeing &#x2013; the situation is so dynamic that I cannot rule out that we would not make another head count adjustment in the first half-year. And secondly, depending on what comes in as the plan, in April-May for the second half-year we will probably have to look at it again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's so dynamic that I can't &#x2013; I'm not going to say that an adjustment we made is for anything beyond the visibility we have over the next three to six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And shifting back to the seismic business, at least one good data point there, the backlog up again. How &#x2013; roughly how long does that carry you? Does that get you halfway through '09, through three quarters, what...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually what happened is Dalton and I agreed earlier last year that the time was to go long. And so roughly half of that backlog will be executed in -- no, slightly more than that sorry. North of $1 billion is in the next 12 months, and the balance would be in the following year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And, you feel like once they start they're going to complete the program as originally conceived?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; well, I mean, we are talking about very reputable companies breaking contracts. They might shorten the program, but I don't see them breaking contracts, Geoff.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.

        <plist>
          <p>There is a very good graph, Geoff in the International Energy Agency's 2008 outlook that shows the cost as of the time they did it in November, at which each of these categories can be developed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then kind of as a follow-on actually. The deepwater market, what are you expecting? You've made a couple of comments already this morning. There are a lot of new rigs coming out. Do you expect that deep water activity, defined however you want to, will in fact increase in '09 versus '08 with these -- new rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, definitely. I think some of the rigs, as I said in an earlier question, will be pushed. Instead of doing the exploration they planned for will be pushed for development. Because development brings cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't see any huge reduction in the deepwater commitments that people have already undertaken. I think it's far more a question for 2010, Geoff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the combination of volume increase, but a mix shift toward development translates to an impact on Schlumberger, how?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't make as much money in development as we do in exploration as you know. So to the extent, there is a shift -- let me say it another way, the service intensity in development is much less than in exploration. So it actually reduces our scope to sell to a certain extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I guess first question, if I come back to the U.S. market can you give us an update on kind of the contract renegotiation status? A year ago, we heard a lot about the process of negotiating pricing, particularly in pumping but I think it was broader than that for the U.S. market for the coming year, and it sounds like that has been delayed to some degree. Can you update us on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that customers knowing they were going to lay down rigs, and therefore would have more bargaining power pushed out the contract renegotiation into &#x2013; much later than they would normally have done. And I would think that we are probably about 70% through it now for the key product lines here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to key on that. So the point is we will start to see the impact of those because of those discussions in Q1 or is it more of a Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think you would see them in Q1. But you're going to -- sorting out the effect of the new contracts from the drop in rigs and all the rest of it's going to be quite complicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It makes sense. On a relative basis versus the prior year, sort of percentage of work, and again, your comment makes it more complicated to answer this. But sort of percentage of work that you expect will prove to be under some form of contract versus the spot market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it will change very much, no. So, 60, 70% will be under contract. Now what the scope of those contracts is going to be, I don't know. Because rigs are dropping so fast, it's difficult to tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question for Simon. There was a decent sized jump in the post-retirement benefits line. I wondered &#x2013; I guess I hadn't really looked at it, and so maybe it has been moving up through the year. But wondered if what the explanation for that is in &#x2013; is that a number that goes higher in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is two explanations as a matter of fact. One big part of the increase was related to a decision we made in the fourth quarter to convert a pension scheme we have for our international mobile staff from a defined contribution to a defined benefit. In other words, we &#x2013; given the market condition, we felt that we will take the risk and convert it to a defined benefit with a target benefit associated with their average career.</p>
          <p>Now the other part is no secret, it's the value of the assets due to the market condition dropped. Now overall, including the international mobile pension plan, we are about 70% funded. So this is why you see this big shift between the two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then, obviously, ex-stock market conditions that &#x2013; the number now, the 2.37 billion is representative of where we are going to be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, this would be dependent on the: first, as you said, the value of the assets, the market condition. But we also plan to fund some of these shortfalls. In Q4, we put some money, $230 million. And we have spare money to fund the different plans during 2009. So it will be hopefully less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then is the aim going &#x2013; obviously, huge uncertainty here in terms of how far down, but pretty &#x2013; still lower, but fairly robust CapEx program. Is the aim to be cash neutral this year or is that possible I guess in the current environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment on that Kevin. We planned to be cash neutral, but we have a lot of options to stay very cash positive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

If you could talk about sort of the difference in &#x2013; you commented about a rapid decline in library demand, but yet the increase in the backlog.

          <p>282. And we &#x2013; the multiclient that we are going to shoot through the first two thirds of this year is already very adequately pre-funded. Because one of the dangers of the seismic business is everyone goes off and starts shooting multiclient without funding. I think this time around, most of the seismic companies' balance sheets are such that they won't do that unless they have pre-funding.</p>

          <p>My follow-on to it, relates to the margins. I imagine just from the magnitude of the revenue contribution from the Marine versus the library. But the margins in the library are significantly better because of the depreciation &#x2013; just as you point out. Is that &#x2013; was that a large contribution to the decline, the decrement because of less library, or really all driven mostly by the dry docks and transit times.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marine is a fixed structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's far more driven by the choppy quarter in Marine. You know the fact we had dry docks and transits. And you can't cut the fixed costs when you're just moving boats around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As pointed out earlier, that's the biggest driver depending on the utilizations.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, as you plan for the North American, continued drop in North American activity. You've mentioned that this downturn is different from previous ones in several respects. Do you expect a kind of a V-shaped bottom to the North American drilling decline as we've seen in the last two downturns or is this something in your mind possibly very different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; the answer, Robin, is I don't know yet. I mean because so much of what happens in North America is going to depend on a recovery in industrial demand for gas. And there are some things out there that could make it very positive. For example, if the new administration decommissions some coal-fired generating plants that could increase gas demand fairly dramatically. The other unknown is what is the true decline rate of some of these new shale gas horizontal wells? So, the answer is I don't know at this point in time. But I would say the key factor is when demand starts to recover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. One follow up on &#x2013; in all the various currency impacts that you've mentioned and I assume some of the big ones are the pound, Canadian dollar, the Russian currency. Do you have an aggregate impact of &#x2013; based on various markets of what that was in the negative sense in the most recent quarter?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Simon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, we highlighted the impact of the currency on the top line. And the fact is we don't have impact of those currencies on our profitability. The &#x2013; our, as a matter of fact the stronger dollar overall is a slightly positive for us. But definitely on the top line as you highlighted, certain countries like Canada, North Sea, we have a high portion in the local currency and in some other markets it's much lower. But overall we are quite balanced between the income, between these currencies and our cost. And on a profitability basis there is no impact.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>And the last question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I appreciate the opportunity to follow-up and it's related to CapEx. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the priorities of the 2.2 billion in Oilfield with respect to replacement capital, new technology deployments, project related, etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is an awful lot of project related deep-water CapEx. There is a lot of CapEx related to gas overseas and after that, I would say those are probably, if you like, the new categories, Michael, then I would say it's replacement and new technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so if I think about a Plan B on the CapEx side in the second half, it would really be subject to potential deferrals on gas and deep-water, probably the biggest area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably yes. Or the fact that there had been some idling in the offshore market that allows us to take CapEx from other offshore rigs and put them on new ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
