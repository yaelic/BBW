          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Michelle, and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. John Colglazier.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Michelle. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Anadarko's Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call. Joining me today on the call today are Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO and other executives who will be available to answer your questions later in the call. As a reminder we've also posted additional information in our third quarter operations report available on our website at www.anadarko.com</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Jim, I do need to remind you; this presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business. In addition, we'll reference non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release. We encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. As stated in last night's earnings release our quarterly performance was very strong and we thank our employees who achieved remarkable results in the midst of some very turbulent weather and market conditions. Some highlights from the news release were significant under normal circumstances and even more so considering the hurricanes and recent market volatility. At one point during the quarter we achieved a company record of 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of reported sales. And overall for the quarter, we reported sales volumes of 51 million barrels of oil equivalent. This represents an increase from retained properties of about 9% over third quarter 2007, while overcoming the effects of major back to back hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Our operated facilities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico weathered both storms with only minor localized damage, a real testament to the design and construction of our producing platforms. As stated earlier, our employees and contractors did a great job by quickly and safely restoring production while protecting the environment. In fact Anadarko was among the first deepwater operators to restore production following Hurricane Ike. Our Independence Hub platform was producing at pre-shut-in levels of about 900 million cubic feet per day within 72 hours of Hurricane Ike. During the week after Ike, Independence Hub accounted for about half of all production from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Our capital efficient portfolio continues to demonstrate depth and balance. In the Rockies, we recognized nearly 20% sales growth year-over-year through the third quarter. We also achieved new daily gross operated production records of about 330 million cubic feet per day in the Greater Natural Buttes area and about 430 million cubic feet per day in the Powder River Basin.</p>
          <p>Third quarter 2008 sales volumes in the Greater Natural Buttes were almost 40% higher than last year's third quarter. And utilizing the same year-over-year comparison, we were about 55% higher in the Powder River Basin. Improved drilling and completion efficiencies and significant midstream expansions enabled this growth.</p>
          <p>In addition to the strong operating performance, we have also delivered outstanding exploration and drilling success internationally and domestically. We are very excited about our presalt program in Brazil, especially the recently announced Wahoo discovery on block BM-C-30 in the Campos Basin, which is similar in many respects to the nearby giant Jubarte field. Wahoo was Anadarko's first operated presalt test in Brazil and we have a 30% working interest in the block.</p>
          <p>Since announcing the discovery, we've drilled down to total depth, encountering a potentially significant additional oil accumulation at a deeper zone, while also confirming the quality of the previously announced reservoir, with more than 200 feet of net pay containing a high-quality light crude oil.</p>
          <p>Our internal pre-drill estimated resource range for the Wahoo prospect was 150 million to 700 million plus BOE. Based upon on our internal technical evaluation, we believe the upper zone alone puts us well within this initial range. We are eager to further evaluate these multiple hydrocarbon-bearing zones through drill stem testing and appraisal drilling to assess the ultimate size of the reservoirs as we work toward declaring commerciality. We are also planning additional exploration drilling on the block in 2009.</p>
          <p>On the adjacent block, BM-C-32, we have identified strong prospectivity as well, which we and our partners plan to test in 2009. Having controlled the Transocean Deepwater Millennium drillship has enabled us to execute upon our presalt program in Brazil, and in order to fulfill our Brazilian lease obligations, we plan to move the drillship to the Espirito Santo Basin. Currently we expect to drill five to seven additional presalt tests in Brazil, each with minimum estimated resources of 150 million barrels of recoverable oil. Our first planned activity is to reenter the circle well, where we previously encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands in a secondary objective. We look forward to drilling on to targeted depth to reach and evaluate our primary objective, which was not achieved previously due to rig limitations.</p>
          <p>Another international area that continues to generate a lot of enthusiasm within Anadarko is West Africa. In Ghana, Anadarko and our partners will have four rigs operating in the Jubilee area, with exploration, appraisal and development drilling activities ongoing in 2009. We spud the Hyedua-2 appraisal well in the deepwater Tano license in October. We also anticipate having a second rig in the fourth quarter to drill the Mahogany #3 appraisal well, followed by the Tweneboa exploration prospect, which is very similar in size and geology to our Jubilee field. Jubilee, which the partnership expects to sanction this year, is estimated to hold between 500 million and 1.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Gulf of Mexico, we just finished successfully drilling an appraisal well approximately 3000 feet to the south and up div from our Tonga West discovery well. This appraisal well in Green Canyon Block 770 encountered approximately 700 feet of high-quality TVD net pay in dipping formations. This is better sand thickness and quality than we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>The MMS has approved the unitization agreement for the complex, which includes Tonga West and the Caesar Discovery approximately three miles to the north. Anadarko expects to sanction this exceptional project by year-end, and have our first significant volumes from this development in 2011, via a tie-back to our 100% owned Constitution spar.</p>
          <p>In our Gulf of Mexico exploration program we are currently drilling a lower tertiary test at the Shenandoah prospect in the Walker Ridge area and expect to reach total depth in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate fourth quarter spuds at both the Vito prospect in Mississippi Canyon, and the Heidelberg prospect, which is near the Tonga West Discovery in Green Canyon, testing similar Miocene objectives.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. onshore, we've complete a number of wells with very encouraging results in the Maverick Basin and in the Haynesville and Marcellus Shales. We hold extensive acreage position in these plays and expect to continue an active exploration program in all three. We have provided additional information on each of these areas and other global operations and exploration activity in our third quarter 2008 operations report, which is available on our website.</p>
          <p>It's evident that the previous two years' restructuring of our portfolio has resulted in capital-efficient assets with strong economics, even in lower price environments. In addition, Anadarko's capital structure and liquidity position remain very strong, which is increasingly important in these challenging times. We've provided updates on our financial status through the capital markets release last month, and in the third quarter earnings release yesterday. I'll highlight a few of the items that are of particular importance to our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we continued to execute upon our base capital program of approximately $5 billion for the year, completed an accelerated repurchase of a little more than 10 million of our shares for $600 million and repurchased approximately $350 million of debt. All this was accomplished while also increasing our cash balance from 650 million at the end of the second quarter to nearly $2 billion at the end of the third quarter. Since that time, we've repurchased an additional $130 million of floating-rate notes at $0.94 on the dollar.</p>
          <p>We also expect to close the previously announced divestiture of the Peregrino heavy oil asset in Brazil by year-end 2008, which will generate significantly more than $1 billion in additional cash. Certain of the net proceeds will go toward debt reduction and by year-end 2008, we expect to be within our debt-to-cap target range of 25 to 35%, without issuing equity. In addition to these cash reserves and improving balance sheet metrics, we continue to maintain additional financial flexibility and liquidity through our undrawn $1.3 billion committed revolving credit facility that doesn't mature until 2013.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, we've more clearly defined our production guidance range of 50 to 53 million barrels of oil equivalent. Approximately 75% of our Gulf of Mexico volumes are back on line and all of our operated facilities are operational. However, we anticipate delays in third party facilities and infrastructure returning to service, which will reduce our volumes by 3 to 5 million barrels of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter. These additional volumes are not lost, but will be partially deferred into 2009 as these non-operated production facilities and infrastructure recover. Based upon the most current information we've received from third parties we expect the remainder of our shut-in Gulf of Mexico production to come back on line, equally split between the fourth quarter 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>You will find our fully updated guidance in the supplemental pages attached to last night's earning result. While we mentioned in our second quarter call, it's worth reiterating that even at today's service costs, each of our core natural gas projects in the U.S. onshore is capable of generating at least a 10% rate of return at approximately a NYMEX $5 flat gas price deck. Also the current service cost in the flat price case of NYMEX $30 per barrel our major deepwater projects such as Caesar, Tonga and Ghana are each capable of generating greater than 10% rates of return.</p>
          <p>Our risk management strategy in the Rockies also continues to be a competitive advantage for us. We have firm transportation commitments and attractive basis hedges in place, covering approximately 95% of our production in 2008 and 2009 and about 70% of our production in 2010. As we have commented previously, we have no material counterparty risk with the derivatives supporting our basis management. We've locked in differentials in the majority of our Rockies production with pricing of Henry Hub less $1.47 per MMBTU for this year, Henry Hub less $1.25 per MMBTU in 2009 and Henry Hub less $1.28 per million BTUs in 2010. We have also committed to an incremental 450 million cubic per day of firm transportation to underpin substantial additional takeaway capacity in the region for the 2010 to 2011 time period.</p>
          <p>I'll close by again stating how pleased we were the third quarter performance. We overcame tremendous weather challenges and met our production commitments, while building above the average liquidity and improving further upon a strong balance sheet. Operationally Anadarko's capital efficient assets are performing well. We remain confident that we will continue to deliver upon our commitments to 5 to 9% compound annual production growth rate, better than 120% annual production replacement at a competitive replacement cost, and at least 200 million barrels of oil equivalent of net annual resource additions from our exploration program.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it over to the operator and open it up for questions. Michelle, if you could take that from me.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gardner of Simmons &amp; Company. Please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Tom.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on taxes, can you walk us through the drivers behind that unexpectedly lower tax rate in the quarter and to what degree the same factors are in play fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Tom, this is Colglazier. A couple of things are driving out. One is with the TPE that's in effect in Algeria; it has the effect of actually raising our taxes, but with the vast amounts of mark-to-market gains that we've recognized in the quarter, it diluted that effect, so that had a dampening impact on our taxes, as well as in our net effective tax rate that we use for the year; also Brazil, the gain on &#x2013; the anticipated gain on sale is embedded in that number as well, and it's pretty darn efficient &#x2013; tax efficient transaction, so it had a dampening effect also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thank you. And I just have a couple of play specific questions. First, with respect to the Maverick basin, can you walk us through the range of resource potential, I suppose surmising an upside case? And to what degree that play is oil versus gas on your acreage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom, this is Bob Daniels.  We're pretty encouraged by what we are seeing in the Maverick. We've got two horizontal wells now in the Eagleford that are online, one horizontal in Pearsall that we are just testing right now. And the area that we got into we really wanted to look at both of those shales until we got to where they overlaid and potential, and so we're actually testing both and think that both have lot of opportunities for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have got 350,000 acres out there, all fairly continuous in this and we think that the resource potential is on the average is going to be about a Bcf, maybe a Bcf and a half per well, but we are in much shallower areas and we see an awful lot of drilling out here if this all works out, and right now we are encouraged with what we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. And then jumping over to Haley, rumors out there that some partner is going non-consent. Is that true and what are the implications for Anadarko?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom this is Chuck. Right now at Haley, we have about five rigs running between us and our partners, and we scaled it down a little bit to &#x2013; in consideration of the gas prices and the cost of services out there. Through the course of time we've had wells that were drilling in an around the Haley proper and what we have been recently is go back for the core where we've seen our best production and best economics, and the partnerships are satisfied with that strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If partners were to go non-consent in that area would you continue to drill?  Are the &#x2013; I guess the &#x2013; is the penalty clause I guess about 300% or is it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Tom, through time, partners have gone non-consent, is that we own some individual wells but in general the program has been pulled back to the core and all the parties are comfortable with that strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I got you. Okay, well thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question or comment comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just had a question thinking about your efficiency that you've shown in the ops report on drilling activity and kind of the implications for number of rigs that you're going to run. What can you talk about as far as sustained rig count and just kind of the continued efficiency and what does to your rig count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're really excited about how well our drilling group has done in conjunction with our operating team to wring more and more efficiency out of our programs and drilling parameters we use. The mobilization times have all come down. We've through time we've upgraded our fleet to more efficient rig fleets that are capable of pad drilling. All those kind of things have delivered better and better efficiency through time. What we've seen is particularly as you look forward and just in generality we could probably drill a similar number of wells with 20% less rigs than we could two years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's really helped us with our permitting and all of that type of that thing and so we're &#x2013; particularly in the Rockies, we're going almost exclusively to pad drilling and trying to continue to wring more and more efficiency out of it and I think that will reduce our rig count over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I think about the data that you had in your ops report of third quarter versus third quarter and looked regionally at rig count, could I just assume the spud to spud percentage would be an increase in well count per rig, is that the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a reasonable assumption in probably half the cases. The other side of it is we just wouldn't hire incremental rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we continue to see this type of efficiency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then during the prepared remarks, you talked about buying in some of the floating rate notes and where they are trading on a relative basis. Can you talk about intentions and thoughts of share repurchases and buying in debt and increasing capital budgets or maintaining capital budgets, just kind of the thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey David good morning, this is Alan. There is a number of questions clustered in there, I'll try to take them one by one.</p>
          <p>On the floating rate note, I think as we have mentioned we have been buying those in. We bought some in through the quarter. We have bought a few more in during this quarter. Currently, those floating rate notes at trading at a price of 94. We'll continue to watch that. We are developing an asset and liability management plan right now, where we are trying to look at the liabilities that we have out and where the most attractive liabilities to call in as we start to use some of this cash that we currently have and we will prospectively build through the sale of Peregrino to get within that 25 or 35% debt to cap range that we've previously communicated. Right now, there is not a targeted liability or security from our perspective. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages when you look at them on a yield to maturity as well as maturity schedule. So, those all look pretty interesting and I think we'll continue to evaluate what is best done with respect to those securities.</p>
          <p>On the stock buyback, I think as we communicated in August, our plans are to buyback stock with free cash flow. I think as we move into '09 we watched the commodity price environment. We are still committed to spending we think a fairly healthy amount on our plant, property and equipment and look at into early next year when we finalize our cap plan in and around something that's similar to where we will probably finish out this year. I think the details of that we just really want to finalize as we better understand the commodities and what they look like for '09. So as you think about us buying back at the company stock I think I would still about it as a free cash flow over and above what we think we need to feed the asset base with capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Al, just kind of thoughts along A&amp;D markets and kind of current thoughts there? Any big deals or small deals that you are looking at or what do you think about on the acquisition side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think given where we currently trade on an implied barrel equivalent basis right now if we were thinking about doing anything as far as it relates to an acquisition it would be more likely than not we would want to buy back into stock rather making an asset acquisition or a company acquisition where the price per barrel looks like a significant premium to where we trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just following up on that, when you think about next year's spending how do you prioritize developing deepwater discoveries versus Rockies gas drilling versus southern region drilling in broad terms and how do you think about the relationship between spending and growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian if I can take a first stab at that and I might ask any of the other operating guys to weigh in as well, is that we have already in terms of our thinking changed our plans relative to what's happened in the commodity markets. We had kind of announced in August where we were going to have a much more aggressive capital program that what Al just indicated. When we &#x2013; as we started to go down that curve of reacting to commodity prices, there are things that our investors will want us to drill, and should want us to drill because they are longer dated projects. We have flexibility to not fund things if we need to and there is a very strong good creative tension right now occurring between that very subject of offshore longer dated activity versus shorter-term onshore activity and then the question between oil and gas and the question between the Rockies differential issue. The good news is that, I think we can still get the growth and still be capital disciplined, as well as to execute on the tremendous inventory of opportunities we have.</p>
          <p>And so, we &#x2013; in cutting back to the levels that Al spoke to, we've made some of those hard decisions, if you will, putting projects off that we would otherwise like to drill and that will be a dynamic process. We will continue to watch commodity prices every month, every quarter and get our best sense of where things are headed. And, we may end up making tougher decisions if the commodity curve stays down for an extended period of time.</p>
          <p>Our personal view is that it's an issue that's largely driven by the overall economy in the world and if we &#x2013; if we all feel that economy won't recover for a year, it will be a different decision, if that economy won't recover for a couple of years. But, we feel that when it starts that we are in a great place with a lot of inventory and lot of opportunities to really spent money wisely. The good news is we've got balance sheet to handle some temporary fluctuations in spot prices without sacrificing our ability to finance our future. And I know that's broad generalizations but others can add anything they want.</p>

          <p>The only thing I would add &#x2013; Brian this is Karl. The only thing I would add is that even within a disciplined financial model that we are exercising under right now and planning around, we still are very excited about being able to meet our long-term strategic objectives of the 5 to 9% production growth, the greater than 120% reserve replacement and adding 200 million barrels of resources every year to our pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then secondly on Jubilee, how much of the steel-heavy items have already been contracted and are you seeing any downward pressure on pricing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are in throes of contracting the FPSO. We are also looking at the subsea umbilical risers and flow lines. And all that is in the midst of the contracting activity right now. Very little long-term steel has actually been purchased at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which I presume is good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you seeing I guess willingness for maybe softer pricing or the impact of softer pricing than maybe where you were in negotiations a few months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's clear that as steel prices have fallen that will be &#x2013; that we would want to capture some of those gains and through the course of the contracting activity and negotiations we will hopefully do that.</p>
          <p>Brian, I'd like to add one other point to your last question. I think it's really important as a company when we're doing the prioritization on our capital budget, that economics are there and we have to have the economics and we stated earlier all our programs that we have that we're currently doing clear those hurdles by a substantial margin even at lower prices than we are today. But maintaining the gains that we've achieved in our efficiency on our drilling programs and then our installation programs and that type of thing is so huge to us. So having that momentum particularly even going into a lower price cycle gives us such an advantage that we certainly want to hold on to that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I had quick question around year end F&amp;D. Obviously it sounds like you are going to be booking a reasonable amount of reserves from the developments you have coming through. Can you give us some guidance on how low that will be or how big the bookings will be from Ghana and Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chuck and I &#x2013; or Karl and Chuck and I will try and handle all of this together, Ben &#x2013; this is Al. I think we are still expecting to move forward this year in Ghana with the sanctioning. If that occurs there is probably not much this year that we would anticipate. As it relates to Caesar/Tonga again I think we've mentioned that we expect to sanction that as well. So, we do believe you will see some barrels there. In the aggregate, I think the guidance we have given you historically is one that today would just affirm; that we think it's in and around that amount or north of it. We feel pretty good about our ability to deliver a fairly competitive F&amp;D relative to others this year. Good news is with all of the hurricane and related weather issues this year I don't think that's put a gulf in the drilling plans in a way that blows any F&amp;D number up today. Chuck or Karl, what would you like to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Al I think you said it well. I think we are on path to deliver at least or more than what we guided to on reserves. Obviously with prices being down we will see some price impacts as everybody else will, but as far as our core base program, we are very pleased how it's working on delivering the reserves we built it around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if I could just ask one exploration question; on Sierra Leone, can you just tell me when in '09 you are planning on drilling that and does your activity and will your activity in Liberia change any of that or do you &#x2013; or when do you expect to drill that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Ben, Bob Daniels here. On Sierra Leone, I can't give you an exact timing on when we're going to drill it, because we are still trying to figure out the rig schedule of which rig we are going to use. The prospect is ready to drill. It is 3D-defined. It's the same play that we have there at Jubilee. So, we are very excited about getting up there and drilling it, but at this point we don't have it firmly on our rig schedule, which rig is going to get over there, but it will be drilled in 2009.</p>
          <p>On Liberia, that does not have 3D over it yet. It's a 2D program that they have. So we've contracted a 3D vessel which should be in Liberia, shooting the three Northern blocks &#x2013; or the three I guess Western blocks, starting at the end of this month, or mid this month, and will continue on into 2009. Then once we get that data in we'll interpret it and then decide where we need to drill there. We don't have any drilling commitments in Liberia; right now it's a seismic commitment. So we want to get the 3D and identify the potential there; what we saw on 2D, very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you think you could have a drillable prospect there by the end of '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could probably have a drillable prospect by the end of '09 helped but we may not have a rig to drill it right then, unless we go back to back with Sierra Leone and that would be at pretty tight timing to make all that happen. So we are probably going to drill Sierra Leone, take the rig elsewhere, maybe down to JDZ or something like that and meanwhile interpret the Liberia data with the Sierra Leone well results, and then decide where we want to drill over there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you guys talk about &#x2013; when you ran your 2008 capital program, and looking forward to 2009, what was the cut off for your 2008 on a price sensitivity basis? Where did you draw that line as far as developmental projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, let me step back and clarify and understand your question; you mean, from a price deck perspective or internal rate of return perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I am sorry. From a price deck perspective when you drew that line and said you were going to spend this much in CapEx and these projects are going to get deferred until later. What was that price threshold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again this is as we were looking for deploying capital in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I am trying to figure out where that &#x2013; or better yet you can tell me where it's going to be for 2009, but I'm trying to get a read through on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As it relate to gas we were probably a year ago looking at a gas market that is not too dissimilar from the gas market we are looking at right now, if you think about a year end gas price. So as we were looking at the forward curve, I don't think our views were a whole lot different than they were a year ago as we were thinking about how we would deploy capital and get a good rate of return. And we used a number of different price points in order to evaluate that &#x2013; not one in particular.</p>
          <p>So I know I sound like I'm avoiding your question, but there isn't like one price out there that we would have pegged. As a result I just would encourage you to look at where gas prices ended up the end of the year last year and you will see its pretty much where we are right now, and know that felt like as we deployed capital onshore, that was a good barometer. Obviously oil finished the year a lot higher last year, something just under a hundred, maybe 96; so that's probably the one area as we think about planning for capital spending in '09 that's a delta from a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I might add, when we look at our capital budgeting our capital investment portfolio is not driven by a price forecast; it's really driven by an opportunity dataset. Our opportunity set that we have to invest in is very resilient as Jim mentioned in the opening comments down to a $5 NYMEX and a $30 price oil. So we have got projects that are very economical down to those type of levels. What we drive it around is the ability to fund out of cash flow and maintain a financial discipline around a target gearing ratio we have talked around of 25 to 35%. So we are really restricted on the capital side, not on the project side. So price isn't what cuts off our funding of projects; it's really our financial discipline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Al, another question if you would, 25 to 35% and maybe you mentioned this and I missed it, but where do you want to be long term on debt to cap; what's your target, or what's your ideal level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that 25% to 35% debt to book cap is definitely the range that we see ourselves wanting to maintain the balance sheet or the leverage associated with our operations. There could be times that we might be modestly willing to be outside of that to either end of it, but I think for relevance sake, that 25 to 35% is definitely where we see ourselves both in the near-term and what we would like to achieve longer term, and the reason for that is we have talked about this many, many times, is that we feel like it's important to have a very strong balance sheet be able to afford the development that comes from the exploration that we are able to generate.</p>
          <p>And I think the exploration success Bob Daniels and our exploration people have been able to demonstrate here in last couple of years whether it was West Africa, now in offshore Brazil and consistently before that in the Gulf of Mexico; it's just real important that we have the balance sheet to be able maintain that investment rate characteristic to be able to enjoy all of development that comes with that exploration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then one more question on Wahoo, can you just talk a little bit about what exactly you saw in the deeper zone, where you found the new accumulation and what the plans are as far as development and when you anticipate putting this online, et cetera. That'd give you the next couple of year snapshot on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, David, yeah. We announced that we had a shallower zone when we stopped and logged. And then we drilled on down, we drilled to 6030 meters. In the course of drilling we had excellent mud log shows. We actually had oil on the pits as we were drilling in the lower section. And then when we got our logs we saw some zones of interest down there which we have attempted to then do the full evaluation on; we think we've got about a 300 foot gross section that is hydrocarbon saturated. We were unable to get MDTs over because we couldn't get a seal on the MDTs. We think that's because there is either a fracture or very coarse grained. But we did recover sidewall cores which did have oil in the cores.</p>
          <p>So we are very confident that we've got an accumulation there. What we need to do then is get some sort of a flow rate out of it to see what kind of reservoir characteristics it has. So what we did was we set casing to TD and we are planning on doing several DSTs in the well now. We will do the lower zone first, when we come back next year to the well and then we'll come up and test the upper zone which we have a lot of confidence in the upper zone given that we have all of the data there now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right and Jim did you say 700 million barrels and &#x2013; did I hear that number right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that was in the resource &#x2013; the pre-drill estimates it was 150 to 700 million plus, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then final &#x2013; go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just going to say in terms of the length of development of these to the extent you've cared about that is once you get the definition around them, what do you carry as a total development cycle time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We usually -I mean pre-drilling, when we are doing our international assessments we plan on a seven year cycle from first discovery to first production and as we've seen an example is Ghana. Once we figure out what we have, then we can pull that forward if it's called for. So right now that would be where we have carried, is the seven year cycle.</p>
          <p>Now there is a lot of things that can happen in Brazil and with this type of a development we may want to do an extended test, very similar to what they are doing at Jubarte where they are flowing the 18,000 barrels of day from one well from the same upper zone that we have here. So we are in the process of thinking about all of those options but we need to get back next year, do the BFTs and drill an appraisal well to this and meanwhile we have a lot of exploration work to do on this block too.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one final question when you say high quality, high gravity can you put a number on that?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Okay great. Then my final question on the Marcellus Shale, a lot of discrepancy between what various operators reported, sort of the &#x2013; I guess you might call the leader in the play saying up to 3.5, 4 Bcf wells. One of your competitors just said that it gets potentially a vast overstatement in the 2 Bcf. Do you have an opinion on that range or any comments?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eric, this is Bob Daniels. I'd say that we're too early to say on that. We think the potential is there for those types of recoveries, but we've only got four wells down. We're testing those wells now and we've got a lot more work to do to get the ultimate recovery. And in all of these shale plays you're going to be experimenting as you go, not only in the zones that you're targeting, but the completion technology. And as you learn typically they've gotten better but right now it's still very early in the Marcellus.</p>

          <p>Good morning. On Caesar/Tonga, any rough parameters around what the development would look like, how many wells, what rates could we expect in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rehan, this is Chuck. What we're seeing there is anticipation that we'll have four development wells in what we call Phase I, stretching in the north from the old Caesar well down to the well we just drilled, which is an area probably six miles long or thereabouts. We anticipate putting those four wells online through subsea systems back to our Constitution spar which we own 100%.</p>
          <p>Now the partnership has agreed to unit; it has been approved by the MMS and the production handling routing back to Constitution is in final throes of that. We &#x2013; at Constitution we should have, at the time of first production at Caesar/Tonga, 40 to 50,000 barrels of space available. For our first production, the four wells that we have, or will have, can easily accommodate that production level. And, we should see first significant production early first &#x2013; during the first quarter of 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So staying with the same topic, in terms of if you did not have this Constitution platform, how much longer would it have taken, and how much more extra CapEx would have been needed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have done a bit of a study on that as part of the partnership work we are doing on the development plan. It appears by doing it this way, we'll avoid nearly $1 billion of extra CapEx for the partnership. So it's a very substantial advantage to take it back to our infrastructure we have in place, particularly when it has this kind of capacity now available, or it will have in 2011. So it's a very substantial advantage. And in the construction market today, particularly with the steel deliveries and that type of thing that we've seen recently, we're saving at least a year, and probably more like two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you price this to your partnership based on your infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a negotiation, as you would imagine. There is alternatives out there and we work closely with them and have come to an agreement that we're all comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>We make sure we don't give it away though, Rehan.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I guess this is one of the reasons why you're &#x2013; it's very economic even down to $30 oil, because you essentially won't have any LOE net to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's because we have avoided a substantial amount of CapEx, so our amortization is considerably lower than it would have been. The time is substantially better than what it could have been, and that the LOE is shared among several fields as opposed to just one, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. Going back to your efficiencies of drilling, any thoughts in terms of putting some numbers around there, how much capital have you saved, and how much NPV have you improved, any thoughts on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've done some work in that regard, and in this certainly helped the economics. I think the thing that &#x2013; if you look at the numbers we pitched out in the operation reports, we believe that through the course of 2008 we essentially defeated what was a fairly significant inflationary market for services. We drilled our program from what we anticipated it drilling, and defeated the inflation that occurred during the year. And for that we are very, very proud of our drilling group, and they've just done a spectacular job this past year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But no particular numbers around that -- 15% means what, 100 million, $200 million worth of capital not spent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we rate it &#x2013; on those wells, we were able to drill additional wells too, because of the time element. So we invested our programs and defeated inflation at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Going back to deepwater -- last question here. Heidelberg and Mission Deep, Heidelberg just &#x2013; it is closer to Tonga, it looks like. Does it tie geologically, are you looking for the same stuff? And on Mission Deep, a quick update on that front please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rehan, on the Heidelberg, we're looking for the exact same thing we've got at Caesar-Tonga. It's the same sand objective. We're syncline separated. You're in the same mini basin, so you come off of a structure at Caesar-Tonga, through a syncline, back up on another salt-supported structure there at Heidelberg, and it looks very, very good. So we are planning to spud that well here, probably in the next couple of weeks, and we are really looking forward to seeing that well down. I'll let Chuck give you the results on the Mission Deep well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Mission Deep, we found two pays that both had significant oil columns that were an appraisal well to a well that we had drilled several years ago. The program that we went out to test was to see the commerciality of that field and it's &#x2013; at these prices, it's right on the margin and so we are going to evaluate all our options there. There is not infrastructure immediately available. If there were a subsea tie-back, it would be certainly be economical, but we are evaluating all our options at this point and we will try to drive some value out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies, one more question. Globally speaking, Sierra Leone, Liberia countries, not only you, some of the other operators are also that -- personally, I would have never thought that we would be going there from a broad, by the technology, or just better geological understanding standpoint, what changed that &#x2013; globally speaking, we are as an industry doing more of these explorations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's changed is the deepwater technology, which allowed us to see and then drill and evaluate wells in 10,000 feet of water. That's given us access, to not just the shelf of Africa, but also into the deeper waters. And then, I would say what changed in that margin, specifically, is the Jubilee discovery. That is a play that had not been pursued in either the Iborian or the Liberian Basin. There was discoveries in pretty marginal reservoirs up on the shelf, so you knew you had the hydrocarbon system there. But that is a play opener, and so we have actively pursued that play up and down the margin, and we think that what we have in Sierra Leone is very, very similar to what we've already discovered in Ghana. And so, we're going to up there and test that idea.</p>
          <p>We think the petroleum system in both of those basins is active. As I've mentioned, there is good shows and seeps along the margin and up on the shelf. So, the ability to access the deepwater and the play opener there, Jubilee, has given us a lot of confidence that there is a lot more opportunities all the way from Niger Delta, up into about mid-Sierra Leone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rehan this Jim. Having it offshore obviously helps, as we've seen in Nigeria, that it only helps to a certain extent. We are not onshore. The other thing is that the politics have obviously changed in a great way there, in that part of the world, and we have involvement of international groups that protect the political system. To the extent you can actually find oil wealth that ensures that it stays there longer, but then over time there, of course, is the opposite effect of others wanting to get access to that and to manage it for their own interest. And we remain alert, if you will, to that dynamic, particularly with what happened to us in Venezuela. So, we are very excited to be in Sierra Leone and Liberia today, and we will continue to watch that over time. It's up to them whether people stay there over a very long period of time.</p>

          <p>And your next question or comment comes from the line of Gil Yang of Citibank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you &#x2013; for Wahoo, what is left to be done in the sense of evaluating the size of that prospect? Is it &#x2013; you said that it's close to the high end of the range, I think you said that for just the first horizon. Does that suggest that the thickness of the pay and the quality of the pay was better than you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gil, this is Bob Daniels. I'd say that there were some components of it that were dead-on what we expected, and then some that were better than we expected. Nothing was worse than what we had prognosed, just our mid range. In just that upper drill. We also had the deeper objective. We carried it at a higher risk. We certainly thought that it had the potential to be there, and that's why we took the well down.</p>
          <p>To talk about the overall what we need to do, right now we've got a lowest known in the upper zone. We don't have any water contact, so we've got lot of structure still below us, so we need to get down and test. So we've got to get an appraisal well down dip, and see how far this oil accumulation extends. That will give us a bigger aerial extent, of course, which will then push us toward the high end of the range. And then, we've got to get a DST on the lower zone and find out what kind of flow characteristics it has. Right now, we're not attributing, really, the resource numbers into it until after we get a DST on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, a lot of it is the aerial, so you need to poke holes to extend the area, get an idea of where you go there, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. We think with the lowest known and the reservoir characteristics on just the upper zone, we're well within that resource range that we had pre-drill, and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there, what would be at the top of the reservoir, is there a gas cap or is there &#x2013; do you know if it's liquid-filled all the way to the top or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, all indications we have is that it's liquid all the way to the top. So we do not have a gas cap. Now we didn't drill on top of the structure, either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you know where the highest known oil would be or you don't &#x2013; you can't know that until you drill the well there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We know where highest-known is with this well, but we don't know whether there is a gas cap on the top of the structure. We would have to drill right on the crest to get that information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And presumably, you would do that at some point to test that area &#x2013; to test that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At some point, we would get up and see whether we had a gas cap. I think it's more important to find out where the down dip limits of the accumulation would be. And that would make it bigger than what we think right now, which is just taking it &#x2013; we're taking it conservatively, to the lowest known that we saw in this well before. And that gives us well within the range that Jim was mentioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the focus is on aerial extent Gil, but the other I might mention is that, this is the start, along with Serpa, of a library we're building of that regional geological play type. And it's very exciting with regard to the other exploration opportunities we have, both in that block where Wahoo is located, as well as the other blocks that we're active in. So this is a &#x2013; we've got a lot of fun stuff in front of us, hopefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any chance that the aerial extent of this reservoir extends beyond the boundaries of your leasehold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be an outside possibility, but we would not know that at all until we're able to drill more wells. Right now it's clearly syncline-separated from the Jubarte complex to the north. Now whether or not that means that the oil accumulation is clearly separated, it will take a well down in the syncline to know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the bottom of the syncline on your side of the leased line, or the other side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on our side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the last question is, you guys scheduled in a lot of rigs &#x2013; locked in lot of rigs three, four years ago or so. At this point in time, do you wish that you had been more aggressive on that, or are you okay with what you've got?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gil, I might try to give a shot at that. Anybody else can add anything. I think we're comfortable with what we did, and I think at varying times, at $145 oil, we certainly wished we'd had one more, because we didn't see any loosening in the market. We are in the market trading rigs all the time, so it's not just our own sense of our own rigs, but we're actually getting a sense of other people's rigs. It's still very tight. It could loosen a bit in a couple years, if prices stay down. And so it's a theoretical issue that it's hard to get your hands around whether you should have done something differently. A year ago I would have said to you we wish we had another spec rig. Today I'm not sure I'd say the same thing.</p>
          <p>What it was when we originally did, we did it with the notion that we can underpin it with our own exploration and development activities. And obviously, as Bob Daniels' Exploration Group has added to the opportunity set that we have in the exploration side, we even feel better about our rig position and in some cases might wish we could augment it kind of tactically, if you will, but, we think there maybe opportunities to get those rigs lined up down the road here if prices stay weak. If they get strong again we're going to wish we had even one more and maybe two more but, we've got a really great position and we still feel very good about being able to execute our program and that's in a lot, that's in a very different place than most of our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And that does conclude the question and answer session. I'll now turn it back to management for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I just want to thank everybody for being on the call and we certainly feel we're well positioned for this kind of environment that we're heading into, both from a balance sheet perspective as well as from the standpoint of being able to deliver growth at a reasonable capital level and to continue to give you confidence in the exploration program and the ability to add additional resources for the future.</p>
          <p>So, I want to thank you and it will be a very interesting day with the election obviously. Have a good day.</p>
