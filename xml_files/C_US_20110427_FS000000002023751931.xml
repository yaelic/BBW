        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first, then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2010 Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to be hosting our Fixed Income Investor Review this quarter. Last quarter we discussed some of our key accomplishments, particularly, our strong capital position, robust structural liquidity and disciplined balance sheet management. Today we're going to update you on our continued progress in those areas. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to take you through some specifics on credit fundamentals, our capital position and liquidity profile, as well as review our recent issuance activity and current funding plans for the coming year.</p>
          <p>Many of you may have joined us on our April 18th Earnings Call, and there are some key points from that call that I would like to re-emphasize to start us off here on slide 1. Before I do, I just want to note that we took into consideration the views of many of you who expressed your preference to host our call this quarter once the domestic earnings season was largely over and after the spring holidays. I understand that there are those who would prefer we sequence things a little differently and, within reason, we will continue to do our best to accommodate both points of view.</p>
          <p>Now we continue to make progress in 2011. We earned $3 billion in the first quarter, more than double what we earned in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenues were up 7% and expenses were down 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our core businesses performed well with Citicorp earning $4.1 billion for the quarter. Citicorp Consumer and Corporate Loans grew on a combined basis by 10% year-over-year. And pre-tax earnings in Citicorp were almost evenly split between the emerging and developed markets, reflecting our presence in the 160 countries where we do business.</p>
          <p>On the Institutional side, our client business in Securities &amp; Banking was strong, although down from one year ago, revenues in Lending, Equities, and Fixed Income rebounded strongly from the fourth quarter of 2010. Client activity in our Global Transactions Services business was also strong. We had higher deposits and higher trade financed loans.</p>
          <p>In both U.S. and international consumer banking, net income was up from the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2010. Internationally, average deposit s and loans increased 13% and 14% respectively from a year ago and credit trends continued to improve.</p>
          <p>Throughout our franchise, we are focused on adding high performance assets, and we remain very selective about the assets we put on our books. We continue to divest non-core assets in Citi Holdings with a $22 billion decrease in the first quarter. Total Citi Holdings assets stand at $337 billion, down 33% from one year ago. As such, Citi Holdings assets are 17% of our balance sheet. And losses in Citi Holdings in the first quarter were down 31% from the prior year. These results helped improve our financial strength. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased to 11.3%.</p>
          <p>We are also building for the future. We're making substantial investments in our businesses in Citicorp. In the first quarter, we made increased investments in technology, branches, marketing and new corporate and investment banking hires. In addition, we're building our commercial banking business. We will continue to execute our strategy with discipline, reducing assets and holdings and investing in key markets in our core businesses. We've demonstrated that we are consistently profitable and we're now focused on responsible growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 2, I'd like to highlight some of our key earnings results from the first quarter. As I just mentioned, Citigroup reported first quarter net income of $3 billion or $0.10 per diluted share versus $0.15 in the first quarter of 2010. This quarter's results included a $709 million net pre-tax loss on the transfer of certain securities in the special asset pool from held to maturity to trading assets.</p>
          <p>We also saw a negative CVA of $256 million from Citi spreads tightening compared to a positive $308 million last year. Revenues of $19.7 billion were down 22% versus the first quarter of 2010 due primarily to lower Securities &amp; Banking revenues, declining assets in Citi holdings, and the loss on the asset transfer. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year to 12.3 billion, driven by higher investment spending, volume-related costs, the impact of foreign exchange and higher legal and related costs, all of which were partially offset by continued productivity savings and declining expenses in Citi holdings.</p>
          <p>Net credit losses declined for the seventh consecutive quarter to $6.3 billion, 25% lower than the first quarter of 2010. We also released $3.3 billion of net loan loss reserves compared to a $53 million net release last year.</p>
          <p>And now let me turn it over to Eric and we'll come back and answer questions at the end.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. As you know, last year was our first full year of profitability since the financial crisis and we continue to make substantial progress in 2011. This progress gives us a strong foundation for sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>Our results demonstrate this clearly, as you can see here on page 3. Both our capital and liquidity are robust, no matter which measure you use. We continue to make progress in de-risking the balance sheet through asset disposition, which provides us with ample capital and liquidity to strategically invest in the future. Holdings assets have declined by more than half from their peak in 2008 to $337 billion and now stand at 17% of our balance sheet. We are seeing continued improvement in credit trends with net credit losses in the first quarter down 25% from a year ago and non-accrual assets down 46% year-over-year. We are well reserved with loan loss reserves of approximately $37 billion.</p>
          <p>With this strong balance sheet, we are well positioned in the industry to capitalize on our strong presence in emerging markets and our global capabilities. As an example, for the third consecutive quarter, we grew both consumer and corporate loans in Citicorp. And with this foundation, we believe we can now deliver sustained growth in our three core businesses: Securities &amp; Banking, Global Transaction Services and Regional Consumer Banking.</p>
          <p>Let me start out by taking you through our credit trends, which showed continued improvement for the seventh consecutive quarter. Slide 4 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the first quarter, down 9% sequentially to $6.3 billion with an LLR release of $3.3 billion. Let me describe our credit trends in two broad buckets; corporate and consumer. The first major area, corporate credit, which is at the top right, had a benefit of $520 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a benefit of $256 million last quarter. Corporate net credit losses increased 28% sequentially to $849 million driven by charge offs for loans for which we previously established specific reserves, which were then released during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In total, we released $1.4 billion of net corporate loan loss reserves in the first quarter up from $920 million in the fourth quarter. Corporate non-accrual loans of $5.5 billion were down 36% versus the prior quarter, the majority of which was attributable to EMI.</p>
          <p>At the bottom right of the page, you can see the second major area, consumer credit. Consumer NCLs declined 12% sequentially to $5.4 billion and we released $2 billion in net loan loss reserves. At the bottom of the slide, you can see that we ended the quarter with approximately $37 billion of total loan loss reserves, which is 5.8% of loans.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5 and 6, you will see more detail on our improving consumer credit trends. On the top half of page 5 you see that NCLs continued to improve on both a dollar and a rate basis in the first quarter, while dollar delinquencies increased slightly in some markets as we continued to grow our international loans. More specifically, in our international regional consumer banking businesses and Citicorp, end of period loans were up 4% quarter-over-quarter, whereas delinquencies were up less than 2%. International local consumer lending delinquencies and NCLs continued to come down as we continued to reduce the balance sheet of Holdings.</p>
          <p>The bottom half of slide 5 shows North American cards. Credit trends in both our Citi branded cards in Citicorp and retail partner cards in Citi Holdings continue to improve. In Citi branded cards, NCLs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 19% sequentially to $1.4 billion and 90 plus delinquencies were down 10% to $1.4 billion. In retail partner cards, NCLs were down for the seventh consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 18% sequentially to $1.1 billion and 90 plus delinquencies declined by 19% to $1.3 billion. For both portfolios, early-stage delinquencies also showed improvement on both a dollar and a rate basis.</p>
          <p>On slide 6, we show the North American mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Ninety-day delinquencies in both portfolios improved again this quarter. In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with $76 billion of loans, down 21% from a year ago. Ninety-plus delinquencies were down more than 50% from last year. Net credit losses increased slightly from the fourth quarter due to lower recoveries, but were down 26% versus a year ago. The sequential decline in first mortgage delinquencies was mostly due to asset sales and trial mods converting to permanent modifications.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that one of the best ways to manage the severity risk in this business is by selling delinquent mortgages. To that end, during the first quarter, we sold $1.1 billion in delinquent mortgages and we have sold approximately $6 billion of delinquent mortgages over the last five quarters. As our economic assumptions for the rest of the year include continued slight downward pressure on HPI, we intend to remain active sellers of delinquent mortgages, as long as market conditions remain favorable.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, in yellow, we have had double-digit percentage reductions in our first mortgage and home equity balances. That leaves us with an overall mortgage exposure that is underweight relative to most large U.S. banks.</p>
          <p>Now that I have covered our improving credit trends in both corporate and consumer, let me describe our progress in reducing the amount of higher risk assets in general. Slide 7 shows the asset trends in Citi Holdings. This quarter, we reduced Citi Holdings' assets by $22 billion. We ended the quarter with $337 billion of assets, which represents a reduction of $262 billion or approximately 44% from the first quarter of 2009 and down $166 billion year-over-year. As John mentioned, Citi Holdings now represents 17% of our total assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 8, we have a breakdown of the three segments of Citi Holdings: Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending and the Special Asset Pool. As you just saw in the previous slide, we've brought Citi Holdings' assets down by approximately $22 billion in the first quarter of 2011 and by $166 billion year-over-year. This slide shows you the key businesses within Citi Holdings where those reductions occurred.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the two largest components of Citi Holding, the Special Asset Pool and Local Consumer Lending, are down 42% and 32% respectively from the first quarter of 2010. As John mentioned, the Special Asset Pool also reflects the transfer of nearly $13 billion of securities from held to maturity into trading at the end of the quarter. To date, we have sold nearly 80% of those assets at prices generally at or above our marks.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we are continuing to make significant progress executing on our Citi Holdings asset reduction strategy, although as we have stated, we believe that the pace of the reductions will moderate.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9 now, we often talk about de-risking Citi Holdings, but I wanted to put that in the context of investing to grow the Citicorp businesses. This is especially pertinent now that Citicorp and Corp other represent 83% of our balance sheet. On the right, you see Citi Holdings assets which are down 33% year-over-year. On the left, you see Citicorp, which is up 8% year-over-year as we continue to reinvest in the franchise.</p>
          <p>While John described some of our investment spend in the first quarter, here you can see how we have deployed our balance sheet to support our customers over the past year. For example, loans, which are our largest asset category, is up $42 billion year-over-year as we lend to both consumer and corporate clients. The combination of trading assets and secured lending is roughly flat as we have ample market making capacity to facilitate transactions to support both our investor and corporate clients. Our Citicorp, Citi Holdings strategy provides us the flexibility to redeploy capital and take advantage of growth opportunities around the world.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, given our healthier balance sheet, as I just explained, we have already been deploying capital in our Citicorp businesses. Let me take a moment to describe what we are seeing in loan volumes. You can see that in Citicorp, loans grew to $418 billion, up 10% year-over-year including 6% growth in consumer and 16% growth in corporate. This quarter's results represented the third consecutive quarter of loan growth.</p>
          <p>In our institutional businesses, lending increased 55% in Global Transaction Services from the prior year driven by trade finance lending in Asia, Latin America and EMEA and we saw 7% growth in our Securities &amp; Banking corporate loan book where large corporations and multinationals are beginning to borrow again. We're optimistic that if general economic conditions continue to improve and corporate clients pursue capital expenditure and expansion plans, demand for loans will continue to increase.</p>
          <p>International consumer banking loan volumes increased 15% year-over-year, led by Asia and Latin America. In these markets, we've seen increased purchase volume in average loans for more than six quarters. These trends reflect the economic growth in these regions as well as the results of our investment spending. North American consumer loan volumes are down year-over-year as the cards market continues to adapt to CARD Act and other regulatory changes, but we have increased our marketing investments and we're beginning to see total accounts and purchase sales starting to stabilize.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, let me talk about capital, which continues to be an area of significant strength for us and supports the lending growth that I just described. This slide reflects our strong capital levels at the end of the first quarter with approximately $137 billion in tangible common equity and $131 billion in Tier I capital. Compared to the pre-crisis era of 2006, our capital measures are up between approximately $33 billion and $57 billion across these four major capital measures. Our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry and provides us the ability to expand our lending to our customers as I just described.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, at the end of the first quarter, our Tier I and Tier I common ratios were 13.3% and 11.3% respectively, up from a year ago and also from the fourth quarter. Our GAAP assets declined 3% year-over-year. Our risk-weighted assets stand at $990 billion and Citi Holdings now represent roughly 31% of that amount.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 13, the components of capital, including stockholders' equity and various other types of securities that comprise it, will be important in the future as well. You can see in the bar chart on the left side of the page how this breaks out by capital instrument, with qualifying tier 1 common of $112 billion, preferred stock of $0.3 billion and trust preferred securities of $17.8 billion. As we have discussed in previous quarters, the Collins Amendment under the Dodd-Frank Act generally eliminates trust preferred securities as Tier I capital with a three-year phase out period commencing in January of 2013. Basel III eliminates trust preferred starting in January 2013 with a ten-year phase out.</p>
          <p>Many of you have asked about our current strategy with regards to our trust preferred securities given the regulatory changes I just mentioned. As you can see on the right side of the page, we have 10 issues that are currently contractually callable. We also have six that are not callable today but would be at the time of regulatory event, such as the expected forthcoming NPR or on their optional call dates prior to 2013. And we have four other securities that will be callable on their call dates after 2013, or at the time of a regulatory event like the NPR.</p>
          <p>We also have outstanding securities that were previously held by the U.S. Treasury which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 capital under Dodd-Frank. In order to maximize our financing flexibility, we recently completed a successful consent solicitation to eliminate the replacement capital covenant applicable to eight enhanced trust preferred securities and two series of our preferred stock, Series AA and C. We believe the elimination of this covenant gives us more flexibility in optimizing our capital structure and enables us to take advantage of a variety of options at the appropriate time. In general, we will consider various factors when evaluating each of our trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred securities, including aspects such as coupon, currency and the optional and regulatory call features of the securities I just reviewed and the timing of such options.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 14, given our healthier balance sheet and strong capital position, let me describe for you the current status of our ratings, a topic that we have discussed quite a bit over the last year. On the top half of the chart, you see our senior debt and commercial paper ratings for Citigroup, and on the bottom half, are the senior and short-term ratings for Citibank. As you are aware, the rating agencies are reconsidering their rating methodologies following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly, their assumption of government support. Of course, we're following it, as well, and will continue to do so as things develop.</p>
          <p>You will also recall that since late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and early in the first quarter of 2009, our supported ratings at the Citigroup level have been unchanged at A3 for Moody's, A for S&amp;P and A+ for Fitch. In 2010, however, in recognition of our progress, our unsupported ratings have improved at two of the three major agencies, thereby narrowing the gap between our supported and unsupported ratings. Most recently, on January 26, 2011, as well in the fourth quarter of 2011, Fitch upgraded Citi's unsupported long-term and short-term ratings by one notch. Our unsupported long- and short-term Fitch ratings is A- and F1, respectively. Twice in 2010, in the first quarter and then again in the fourth quarter, S&amp;P upgraded our standalone credit profile or our unsupported rating by a notch. And as you may have seen yesterday S&amp;P upgraded our U.S. broker dealer, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., to A+, A1, citing their view that this subsidiary is an integral component of our intermediate term operating strategy.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 15, having discussed capital and our current ratings, now let's review Citi's liquidity and funding strategy. Our current strategy is designed to provide ample high-quality liquidity to make sure that we are well positioned to grow our core businesses and navigate various market conditions. In both the bank and non-bank, we carry a healthy liquidity buffer which is generally held in cash and highly liquid securities, such as Treasuries and agencies, and other G7 instruments. We execute on this funding strategy in both our bank and non-bank businesses by accessing a spectrum of appropriate funding sources. In our bank businesses, our funding is primarily in the form of stable, globally diversified deposits. In our non-bank businesses, we use a modest amount of short-term funding, such as commercial paper and repo, to finance liquid assets. We then use a range of long-term debt instruments to cover our broader business needs.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, you see our aggregate liquidity resources or our liquidity buffer, defined as cash and highly liquid securities. It stood at approximately $348 billion at the end of the first quarter. We have maintained these resources at similar levels over the past year in both the bank and the non-bank and currently believe that this range is proportionally calibrated to the size of our balance sheet and current market conditions.</p>
          <p>In addition to the high levels of liquidity, let me take a minute to talk about fungibility of our liquidity at Citi. In general, Citigroup can freely fund legal entities within our bank vehicles, and Citigroup non-bank vehicles can fund our bank vehicles. In addition, under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, as of the end of the first quarter, our bank can fund our non-bank entities with as much as $25 billion as long as it is collateralized appropriately.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 17, to create the liquidity buffer that I just reviewed, we have funding strategies tailored to the bank and the non-bank. Within our bank, as I said earlier, we view our deposit base as our most stable and lowest cost funding source. As you can see that is approximately 75% of our bank is funded with deposits. In addition, long-term debt, including securitizations, comprise about 10% of the bank's funding. In the non-bank, long-term debt represents the most significant component of our funding profile. The vast majority of this funding is comprised of senior term debt which is both fixed and floating along with subordinated instruments and trust preferred securities.</p>
          <p>A little over a quarter of our non-bank liabilities are secured financing, often referred to as repos, which provide funding in a carefully calibrated manner. As you may have heard me say before, the majority of this secured financing is collateralized by highly liquid government and government backed and government agency securities. The minority of the secured financing is collateralized by less liquid collateral and supports both our trading assets as well as the business of secured lending to customers which is also part of our client matchbook activity. The secured funding is carefully calibrated by asset quality, tenor and counterparty exposure in order to increase the reliability of the funding and supplement our other sources of funding. And finally, our large base of book equity supports both the bank and the non-bank entities.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 18, deposits are our primary source of funding in the bank. Firm-wide deposits were up approximately 3%, or $21 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 to $866 billion at the end of the first quarter. As I have said before, deposits are one of our lowest cost sources of funds and you can see that while deposits have grown, the overall cost of funds on deposits is down slightly year-over-year and significantly lower than prior periods. This reflects both the low-rate environment and our ability to lower price points which widens our margins given abundant customer liquidity while still remaining competitive and attracting deposits. As interest rates increase we would expect to see some pressure on rates, however.</p>
          <p>Part of the way that we have managed to lower the cost of funds is to have a healthy amount of balances in non-interest bearing accounts which you can see has increased from $112 billion to $144 billion over the last year. And even more importantly, within our interest bearing deposits we continually seek out pockets of balances that provide us with lower cost funding. In summary, we continue to have a high quality, diversified and stable deposit base across our businesses and across the globe.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 19 for long-term debt, you can see our actual maturities for the first quarter and expected maturities of long-term debt over the next three years. This chart clearly shows that maturities peak in 2012 and come down in 2013 and 2014. As we see in light blue atop each column, TLGP debt represents a significant amount of maturities in 2011 and 2012. Many industry observers have noted that this wave of maturities is an industry-wide situation which came about as many banks issued TLGP and other government guaranteed debt in 2008 and 2009. As I have said before, for us at Citi we do not expect to replace TLGP maturities. The reason is clear. As we continue to reduce and de-risk our Citi Holdings balance sheet in both our bank and non-bank entities, our need for long-term debt is coming down.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter we issued approximately $6 billion of long-term debt. We issued across multiple tenors and currencies in both benchmark and structured notes. Our full year forecast currently remains unchanged at approximately $20 billion. This leaves approximately $14 billion of issuance left for the rest of 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 20, I'd like to give you some additional texture about our recent issuance activity for our benchmark debt. On the top of the page, you can see our issuance mix. We have shifted from predominantly fixed rate towards floating rate during the first quarter in response to market demand. On the bottom of the page, you see our tenor profile over the past five quarters with most issuances concentrated in the five-year bucket.</p>
          <p>That said, we have issued more two and three-year floating rate notes recently to position ourselves to capture more favorable cost of funds assuming credit spreads continue to normalize in the future.</p>
          <p>Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, our capital base continues to be one of the strongest in the industry and this is reflected across every one of our significant capital ratios. As we have stated, we currently expect to begin returning capital to shareholders in 2012.</p>
          <p>Second, we have significantly improved our structural liquidity by increasing our capital base and deposits and reducing assets. We believe we have ample liquidity, and as you saw, our lending activity to clients has increased.</p>
          <p>Third, we'll have a significant proportion of wholesale funding going forward. We currently expect modest re-issuance needs and we do not expect to replace TLGP debt that is coming due.</p>
          <p>And fourth, we see continued credit improvement across both corporate and consumer. We believe these trends position us for sustained growth in our three core businesses, Securities &amp; Banking, Global Transaction Services and Regional Consumer Banking.</p>
          <p>That concludes our fixed income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. Bank of America frequently releases to the market an indicator called "time to required funding" as an indication of &#x2013; just another indication of the robustness of their balance sheet liquidity. Do you folks have an estimate as to what that would be for Citigroup?</p>

          <p>Michael, it's Eric Aboaf. I'm not familiar with the specific metric that you're referring to, to be honest. What I can tell you is that as we issue long-term debt, we're very thoughtful about the maturity ladder, and in particular, have ensured that we have a nice balanced profile so that we don't have lumpy re-issuance needs that wouldn't be appropriate.</p>

          <p>Okay, and a follow up. Could you talk a little bit about the practical business implications and maybe funding implications going forward of the S&amp;P upgrade, apparently, of the broker-dealer rating within the last 24 hours?</p>

          <p>Michael, it's Eric again. It's a little, I think, premature for us to speculate on that. Clearly it's a real positive for us. Clearly the broker-dealers are a very important subsidiary and always have been and it's nice to see it recognized. I don't know that it will change our funding strategy, but obviously if it does, we'll certainly communicate that to all of you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. Could you talk around your intentions or what you perceive to be the intentions of the FDIC, but around the $3 billion of TruPS [Trust Preferred Securities] and whether there's anything preventing you from calling some of the your TruPS in the existence of this FDIC TruP?</p>

There is &#x2013; that debt is currently not callable. All right? So it's not that we can call the debt. And it's a &#x2013; so it's a &#x2013; it's something we'd have to work out with the FDIC. And then, quite frankly, I know you had a couple of other things that you were looking for in that question, but you want to phrase any follow-up?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just on the call-in slide again. I just wanted to clarify how you think about the securities. When you consider a call, would you be thinking about them relative to where your ability to issue subordinated or existing outstanding subordinated coupon might be? Or would you be comparing it to senior coupons as an opportunity to reduce interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's Eric. It's actually hard to answer your question completely because the regulatory guidance is still ambiguous. It's not perfectly clear yet what counts as Tier 1. It's not been restated recently what counts and will count as sub-debt. Right? So Tier 2 capital, and so it's actually &#x2013; we're trying to work through that. That said, we'll certainly compare the cost of those existing TruPS and E-TruPS to preferred issuance cost, to senior a bit and to sub-debt a bit. So it's certainly going to be across those three instruments. And I think as we get more regulatory clarity and in particular as the NPR gets written by the U.S. agencies, we'll be able to better answer that and ascertain that for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on that NPR can you give me any more detail around when you think that might be coming out? And how I should be looking for just to follow that so I could &#x2013; that appears to be a trigger in your mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's really hard to tell. I think you honestly have to check with the U.S. agencies. We've heard maybe this summer. But you really need to check with them to find out what that timing is likely to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on Basel III, I was wondering if you could &#x2013; I know I guess the way I would say it is that you have not quite provided as much detail around the expected changes as your peers. We see $990 billion of risk-weighted assets and $112 billion of Tier 1 common today. Can you talk about the expected increase to risk-weighted assets and your expected mitigation or passive or active that you think you could achieve from that? And also clarify what deductions you would expect to incur as you transition to Basel III so we could get a sense of how you look on an apples-to-apples basis versus your peers who have given that kind of data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's John, John. The guidance that we've given is that we're still on track to operate at an 8% to 9% Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III in 2012. And we reiterated that when we did our earnings call last week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no. I'm aware of that. I'm just interested in the path to get there so I could do sensitization around the expected earnings retention that will occur over the period and trust but verify the data you're putting out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, the other piece of data that we have provided is that our view is that for Citicorp, post-mitigation, we would anticipate the increase in risk-weighted assets, Basel III versus Basel I, to be about an increase of somewhere in the 30% to 35% range. And that is still holding as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the slide 38 from Q3 last year, where you talk about the potential deductions to capital that come from Basel III can you provide any detail about how to interpret that slide? Because there's a lot of information on there but I don't really know what to do with it in terms of what it really means for deductions.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have slide 38 from the third quarter in front of me. But what I would suggest that you do is maybe is give Ilene a call and maybe she can, with the slide in front of her, she may be able to help you with some of that interpretive guidance.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Good morning, John and Eric. A couple of questions, I guess. And they really have to do with Citi Holdings and the ongoing plans for disposals. First of all, just what is your current thinking in terms of the partner cards? Because the &#x2013; this is something that's been talked about from time to time, but the improvement does seem to be ongoing. So I guess the first question is what is your current thinking about retaining the partner card portfolio or perhaps eventually disposing of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ryan. That's a good question. This is John again. When it comes to partner cards, there's a couple of things. One is we have done an awful lot of work to re-underwrite the portfolio and really improve the underlying credit characteristics of the portfolio. So &#x2013; and I think you see that in some of the performance metrics that we provide both in our supplementary financial deck and in some of the slides that we include in our earnings call deck. Having said that, when we set out Citicorp and Citi Holdings, as much as some people want to characterize that as a good bank, bad bank type of structure, that really wasn't the case. What the two represent, Citicorp represented those businesses that fit in with the strategy that we had laid out going forward. And Citi Holdings, those businesses in Citi Holdings just didn't fit the strategy.</p>
          <p>So as much as we've done to improve the overall portfolio, the retention of it would still mean that we would have to first convince ourselves that, that retail partner card business actually fit in with the Citicorp strategy. And that just is not a determination that we have made as of yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify that. So, in other words, it sounds like you &#x2013; well, actually, I don't want to put words in your mouth, John. So in other words is that still something that you're thinking about possibly? Or in other words in the current posture, it is still not deemed to be strategic, therefore, eventually perhaps might be disposed of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that as with any decision, you look at those decisions as time goes by and just make sure that you're still comfortable with the initial decisions that you made. You may recall that &#x2013; I think it was late in '09 or perhaps it was the very beginning of 2010. I can't recall. I think it was the beginning of 2010, we took a look at what was in Citi Holdings at that point in time. This was the post the ending of the Ring Fence agreement. And we actually identified some of our mortgage assets that really fit our ongoing retail bank strategy and, therefore, moved them out of Holdings at that point in time back in to Corp. At the same point in time, we also identified some corporate loans to customers that we intended to continue to service as part of our Citicorp strategy. And, therefore, chose to move them back to Citicorp.</p>
          <p>So, periodically, I think you always revisit your strategic decisions. But we haven't revisited the Citi Holdings &#x2013; current assets that are in Citi Holdings recently. And I can't give you a timeframe as to when we might take a look again, nor can I tell you with any degree of assurance what the results of that type of review might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is, and this is just by the way of clarification, with respect to Citi Financial, I think what you have said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you'll &#x2013; I think you're looking to eventually dispose of perhaps $14 billion of assets but you're going to retain a bunch of Citi Financial assets. Could you just walk us through what you plan to keep, what you plan to sell off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the exact figures in front of me, Ryan. I apologize. But what we've indicated is that we have &#x2013; we have certainly split Citi Financial. We separated Citi Financial into a legacy group of assets and then the assets that would actually constitute an ongoing business. We did that around the summer of last year, sometime during the third quarter. And so there are definitely &#x2013; there's definitely a group of the Citi Financial assets that we will be looking to retain just because we &#x2013; our goal is to sell Citi Financial as an ongoing business. And so there will be a large piece of those assets that will stay on our books and there will be some piece, then, that will go with the &#x2013; with the sale. But I don't want to quote a number right now because I just don't have those figures in front of me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, maybe instead of specific figures, if there are particular asset classes you're going to stay in, some asset classes you're going to move out of? Maybe we could just do it that way, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the asset classes are somewhat split. Again, it was more based on assets that we thought that went with customers. Citi Financial very much is a customer strategy. So it's more what loans would go with an ongoing business, that couldn't be supported by an ongoing business. And what would be more of a legacy-type assets that would not necessarily be sold or salable.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. How liability sensitive is the balance sheet right now to the U.S. dollar yield curve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Samuel, it's Eric. We &#x2013; as part of our K and Q disclosures, we typically show an IRE map, or Interest Rate Exposure map. We show it to rising rates and falling rates. And in our case, we actually do it for our top five currencies, because if you remember, dollar is just one of those measures. I think we disclosed that. You can go to our K, and we had a slight sensitivity to rising rates. But you'll clearly get an updated look at that as the Q comes out. And what I'd tell you is that we continue to be thoughtful about what we think interest rate moves are likely to be in the U.S. and international markets. In some we might be more positively sensitive, in others, less so, and are pretty conscious of the &#x2013; of some of the opportunities for us as we go through a general rate tightening environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just something for literally almost the purposes of historical fact. You all made a big shift of mortgages into the trading portfolio, substantially selling that position before the earnings call. Could you tell us what was the entire, sort of on an average basis, what was the entire write-down on those mortgages? What was it from the very get go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's John. I just want to make sure that we got your question right, because there were some Alt-A securities that were part of the overall asset transfer, but mortgages were not the only assets that we shifted from the hold to maturity to the trading account. And so if you go back to, again, our earnings deck, there's a slide that actually lays out the component pieces of hold to maturity and you can see the various classes that have come down. So that's one thing.</p>
          <p>On the asset transfer itself, again, we took a $709 million pre-tax hit as we transferred those assets. And there's a slide in the Appendix of this investor presentation, slide 26, that lays out some of the component pieces. But in general, the $700 million came about from taking a loss out of the &#x2013; that came out of our OCI accounts, these &#x2013; this is where we had previously held &#x2013; previously classified securities as available for sale and we had $1.7 million &#x2013; $1.7 billion, although I wish it was $1.7 million, $1.7 billion of pre-tax losses associated with those securities in OCI. We passed that through the income statement. And at the same time, we had roughly $1 billion positive mark on other securities. So that &#x2013; those two components netted out to the $700 million pre-tax charge that we mentioned earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, in fact I did realize that the OCI reserving net-net had been sufficient or even more than sufficient. But even that reserving was not in and of itself the entirety of the expensing and writing down associated with those assets. And I'm just wondering what the cumulative total was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the cumulative total of those specific assets as we &#x2013; again, are you talking about all of the hold to maturity assets or just the $12.7 billion that we moved at the end of March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd love to know it for all, but I'll take it for the $12.7 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, you can actually &#x2013; we actually on the hold to maturity in total, in the &#x2013; in the K, and the &#x2013; and you'll see it again in the Q, we actually give you a roll forward as far as what is the original &#x2013; the par value of those securities and what we currently carry them at and where the various component pieces are as far as what is still left in OCI. So you can actually see all of the component pieces. I don't have the K in front of me right now. But maybe &#x2013; why don't you take a look at the K. And if that doesn't answer your questions, give Ilene a call and we'll try to do what we can.</p>

          <p>Back on slide 13. And thank you for providing this. I think what we're all looking at is the callables, the ones that are currently callable and the ones that are optionally callable. I think that most of the people on the call that speak for them assume that these will be called according to the published call schedule and the &#x2013; what you did with the replacement capital covenant solicitation is a demonstration of that, potentially. I think that what we're wondering about is, one, what are you considering to be a regulatory event by which you could justify calling trust-preferreds that may be callable after January '13? And would you look to do that prior to Jan 1, 13 or would you do it around then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, it's Eric Aboaf. Good question. The &#x2013; our legal counsel as well as the legal counsel around &#x2013; for most of the banks have been wrestling with exactly that question. We've gotten some &#x2013; some strong indications, but this is not definitive that a regulatory event could occur in a couple of situations. The forthcoming notice of proposed rulemaking, or NPR by the agencies, might very well qualify as regulatory event. There's also some in the legal community who believe that the actual rulemaking, right, not the notice of, but the actual promulgation of the rules, which we expect to occur in January 2013, might also be a regulatory event.</p>
          <p>So without being certain, and we're dealing with that uncertainty ourselves, right, those give us two additional timeframes under which, or by which, we could consider calling some of these securities. And as you can imagine, we're monitoring when that &#x2013; those events may happen and we're continuing to work with our legal counsel to determine how certain we are that those qualify as legal &#x2013; as regulatory events, right? And then we're doing the economic analysis underneath to say what is optimal for the company given that the &#x2013; these issues here that we've talked about, the 20 issues right?</p>

Or is that not a consideration?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I &#x2013; to be honest, everything is a consideration on one hand and then you've got to go down to the brass tacks and find out what's the right tradeoff for the company and we'll obviously will make that with the interest of shareholders are at heart.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last question. On slide 18 on the deposits. You pointed out the non-interest bearing deposits. How &#x2013; how is this that 144 number going to be impacted by Reg Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that's a very good question. There is a fair amount of speculation on that, and we &#x2013; we're not sure, to be honest. And I'm not saying that to be opaque. I think we expect that it will be larger, but it is very hard to tell, Rob, what this &#x2013; where this will go. Reg Q has been in place for a very long time and clearly the market will react, customers will react. I think I'd expect it to go up. But it's very hard to determine more than that right now.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Barry Cohen of Knott Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. A couple of quick questions, I hope. One is, could you just maybe outline a little bit where the TLGP debt resides at the corporation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Barry, it's Eric Aboaf. The TLGP debt really resides in, I'll say big picture, in two vehicles. There is about $18 billion that right now is in the bank, right, in Citibank itself. And then about $38 billion that sits within the &#x2013; what I'll call the Corp. chain, which is Citigroup and CFI, which is often used as our funding vehicle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is any of that like commingled in what you kind of termed the Holdings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you can really think about it that way, because Holdings is really about assets, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our funding structure, whether it's capital or debt really supports the entire company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Holdings &#x2013; this is John. Holdings is a management structure. It is always set up as a management structure. There is no legal entity structure surrounding Holdings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that. I wasn't trying to confuse the subject matter. I'm just trying to understand as you make the decision to essentially pay that off and you have what appears to be excess liquidity pools, what that may or may not mean, essentially. That's why I'm trying to understand it. Those assets may not go away, but the liabilities underneath them may. Right? So that's what I'm &#x2013; I may be wrong, but I'm trying to understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the ways to think about it, and I think you've already stated that if you look at the balance sheet right now, we currently have excess liquidity. It's one of the reasons why we can &#x2013; we can afford to have that TLGP debt just continue to run off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the other question is where are you kind of in the discussions with the FDIC with respect to the preferred issuance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, the FDIC and what preferred issuance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Doesn't the government have a trust preferred, a $3 billion preferred issuance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. I thought you were talking about a future issuance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the $3 billion &#x2013; they hold $3 billion of the TruPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that. But where &#x2013; are you in a discussion with them in terms of negotiating what you might be able to buy that back for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to comment on any discussions that we may or may not be having with any of our regulatory bodies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you maybe then talk a little bit is &#x2013; how much of &#x2013; there's been lots of speculation, you guys were talking a little bit about on the phone with respect to Citi Financial and some assets being sold and some assets being kept, but I'm kind of curious away from the asset side of the discussion, kind of what the expenses that are there. Selling the assets one thing, but would a theoretical transaction actually have a disproportionately higher expense reduction than in the past whereas if you had kind of grass asset reduction versus expense reduction there's tends to be reasonable linearity to it. Would something with those assets actually cause that linearity to improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't comment right now as far as how the actual cost structure of CFNA lines up against the assets. But you're correct that if you look at over time our ability to reduce expenses is right in line with our ability to reduce the assets. And, you know, so we have some businesses that are a little bit higher and a little bit lower. But in general, over time, the right expectation is that as we reduce assets, we will also take out the expenses. And I think you can see that clearly over the course of the last couple of years as to what we've been able to do with both the Brokerage and Asset Management assets as well as the Special Asset Pool assets.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at the local consumer lending assets, we haven't quite met that exact linear approach. But that's mostly because we have had to add extra expenses into the mortgage business, as you can imagine with some of the foreclosure activities and OREO, etcetera. But otherwise, if you keep on thinking in terms of a roughly linear approach as far as expenses and asset reductions, you should be on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then maybe two final quick questions. One is, what is the internally kind of where you think the regulators are timing-wise perhaps with SIFI [Systemically Important Financial Institution]?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we can comment on where they are with SIFI. It's sort of exactly what Eric had said as far as when they might do anything as far as publishing an NPR, coming out with guidance for SIFIs. The hope would be that we would get some guidance before year end. But there's been no timetable published so we really can't comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think in the earnings call, you guys talked a little bit about the relative size of the Hold Co.'s assets versus the relative size of the RWA. And inside of the Holdings, is there a set of assets either in LCL or other places where there's actually an even &#x2013; a relatively even greater disproportionate amount of RWA in the calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said is and Eric repeated it I think today, Holdings currently constitutes about 31% of our risk-weighted assets. And yes, there are some assets in Holdings that have disproportionately higher risk weightings. As a matter of fact, that was the reason for the transfer of the $12.7 billion pool out of hold to maturity to trading. So that transfer gave us the ability to sell that particular pool of assets as part of our plan towards meeting the Basel III targets that we've laid out for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I appreciate your help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Olsen of J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is a follow-up question around the TruPS. You mentioned before about individual TruPS may be able to be called one at a time as you see fit. I would assume though, that with those you're just talking about the contractual calls once they become current. But if you're specifically going to invoke this change in capital treatment, the call language per the Collins Amendment, it's my understanding that that's just a one-shot deal that you invoke that and then you either call the actual TruPS or you don't. But you couldn't go back and revisit that issue. Is my understanding correct or do you feel like there are going to be multiple times when you can actually invoke the same change in capital treatment call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Eric. A good question because there are some in the legal community that I think would say there may be only one call time and there are others that might say there are multiple ones. And so to be honest, we're kind of wrestling through that imperfect information. I think as we get closer to potentially seeing an NPR, I think the legal community will start to converge and obviously we'll then know better how to proceed. But I'm just sorry I can't be more clear than that because we're actually getting, I think, all banks are getting a variety of different views.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so even if what you were saying is you feel like there could be at least two additional times that could be trigger events. So if that's the case right now, would you think that during or around those additional events that you could call? Or is that still even up in the air?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think like you said, if we think there's going to be only one event, we may take certain actions. If we think there are going to be two events. We'll take probably somewhat different options or actions because the optimization will be a little broader and we're just kind of trying to figure that out as we get closer to seeing an NPR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Knutson from Legal &amp; General.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow up on that. Regardless of whether that information, the NPR comes out, we should take away from this call that you're going to be making economic decisions if something is trading well above par, it's obvious that the call is in the money and you're going to exercise your right to redeem these securities if there's a change in their capital treatment to be blunt about it, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what you can take away from this call is as we said before, there's a wide range of considerations that will go into our thinking. And quite frankly, given everything that is not clear at this point in time, it's a little difficult for us to tell you with any specificity as you can obviously see, exactly what we're going to do or when we're going to do it. And so I absolutely wouldn't walk away from this call with anything set in concrete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You talked about the ratings upgrades recently. What about the short term ratings stability and contingency plans if there is &#x2013; if you lose your prime short term rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Eric. Yeah, there's clearly been some progress with the rating agencies on that question. And clearly they're recognizing some of our progress. In fact, one of the three major agencies, Fitch, actually has our unsupported rating at F-1 which is prime. So one of the three has already published that. And that obviously leaves your question with S&amp;P and Moody's and I'm sure you're in discussions with them. And, you know, we'll all learn more as they make some judgment. That said, you can imagine that we are well prepared for a variety of different possibilities out there. Right? We just lived through a pretty harrowing financial crisis. We've learned a lot about what liquidity is stable and what isn't. And, so, literally as part of our historic process, we have had contingency funding plans that are codified, they're reviewed at multiple levels of management, including the board.</p>
          <p>And you can also imagine that we actually stressed for a number of different scenarios; regional stresses, rating agency stresses, different markets moving in different directions. And, so, there's a wide range of scenarios and I think you could reasonably expect that rating downgrade given how much we talked about it is one of those that we've been very thoughtful about.</p>
          <p>Given that, what we do in a contingency funding plan is literally estimate what may happen and then we determine what actions we would take and obviously that's not a theoretical exercise. The idea is to have sufficient liquidity and sufficient structure and parameters and so forth so that the actions can compensate for the potential risks, right, were they to occur. And I'd tell you that one of the reasons why we describe our liquidity buffer so clearly and describe it as ample as an example is that when we run those stresses and we work through the very practical contingent actions we would take, that we have sufficient liquidity to operate under those circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Standard Charter actually came out &#x2013; you guys have talked a lot about how international is the future and the growth rate and a lot of your income's coming from these markets, developing markets or growth markets. Standard Charter obviously is a competitor in that area. They announced that they had met both the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio earlier this year. And I'm curious, what are your plans? What will you have to change in terms of security holdings and debt issued to keep up with arguably a competitor and new regulations? Is it...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Eric. We &#x2013; with regard to the Basel III liquidity ratios, the LCR in particular, the liquidity coverage ratio, as of several quarters back, we actually have been quite clear that we are above the 100% standard that is mandated by Basel III. We've actually spent less time, to be honest, internally on the NSFR because the regulators have been quite clear that one is really more in process. They expect to make some substantive changes. So we really don't think that a percentage level on that is particularly indicative either of enough or not enough at this point, but we've been very clear and I'm happy to continue to be clear that on the LCR, which I think is the one that is going to be implemented first, and is pretty far along, we are &#x2013; we are over the &#x2013; the minimum requirement.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two last &#x2013; two quick last &#x2013; the NPR, your expectation is July? Or when do you expect that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very hard to tell. We have &#x2013; some have said in the media, some observers have said July, August, but you probably really need to ask the agencies that question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then last, the nine days after the equity call, I think is too late. And I don't know if other people have voiced it, but I would appreciate it if this call is held much closer to the equity call.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the call. Most of my questions have been answered here, but I wanted to focus a little bit on the mortgages and the statement you made earlier about remaining focused on selling delinquent mortgages, is that primarily occurring from the Citi Holdings piece? Or is it more ratably across Corp and Holdings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The sales are really coming out of Holdings. It's part of our mitigation strategy and one that we focused on pretty early as far as the ability to avoid this severity risk, which I think is where the whole industry is headed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what types of marks are you realizing on that? And then what can we expect in terms of the trajectory over the next three, four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The marks &#x2013; I mean, we are certainly able to &#x2013; I'm not going to give you an actual mark, all right? But we certainly find the terms to be attractive on the sale of the delinquent mortgages. Again, we're selling &#x2013; we've done roughly $6 billion over five quarters, so roughly averaging $1.2 billion a quarter. I think this quarter we did another $1.1 billion. So kind of right in there. And the marks here &#x2013; it's a little bit above. We're taking a little bit of a loss against what we would have against available reserves against those mortgages, but well within what we think would be the lifetime losses associated with those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then that run rate, though, is something that's largely expected? Do you think? In the course of his year, is that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to do $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion a quarter, but we do remain active sellers of delinquent mortgages. Again, we &#x2013; we think that it's the best way of managing the severity risk that you have associated with the mortgage portfolio. I mean, when you get to a credit card portfolio, you get to 180 days, you write the whole thing off, it's very easy to see. When you get with a mortgage portfolio, you get to 180 days, you take your initial write off, but then you keep having to assess the fair value of those mortgages until you actually go through the entire foreclosure process and then actually get them off of your books through a short sale, an OREO, or whatever, so that risk stays with you. And that's the risk that we're trying to very actively manage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the $6 billion sequential reduction netting out the $1 billion or so of sales, is that $5 billion net. Is that principally pay-downs? It would be a combination of maybe all of the additional charge-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Okay. And ultimately, when do you have to stop reflecting it when all of it is, essentially, spun off or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we stop holding any of the equity in Primerica.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I notice in your &#x2013; in your earnings deck that you &#x2013; you have a breakout for Citi Financial, NA in the Citi Holdings Group, is that essentially a platform that may actually &#x2013; that's the ongoing business that is going to be sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the totality of Citi Holdings, I'm sorry, of Citi Financial. That includes both the legacy book as well as the assets that would be sold as part of the ongoing business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. How much of that is &#x2013; in terms of asset wise do we attribute to that Citi Financial NA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset wise? Is it &#x2013; is it primarily this mortgage line, essentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just not following the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citi Financial, that unit, Citi Financial NA, I'm just trying to figure out what are the assets associated with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Citi Financial has got some mortgage assets but it's also &#x2013; the largest asset class in Citi Financial would be personal installment loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then in the special asset pool, the &#x2013; the sale of the &#x2013; of what was transferred over to trading, that occurred after the quarter end, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were some sales that occurred pre-quarter end, but the bulk of the sales activity certainly occurred from April 1st until the date of the earnings call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that trading MTM line should go down by 80% or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you should see the bulk of the asset sales reflected in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the rest of special assets, I mean is it just an orderly runoff at this point, I mean at least an HTM bucket and a loan bucket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will continue to pursue sales as we can do it, obviously not out of the HTM pool, but to the extent that we can still do sales at attractive prices from either the loans bucket or the AFS bucket. We will continue to pursue some level of sales out of the special asset pool.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right? Thank you.</p>
