        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentleman, good afternoon. It's my pleasure to open this afternoon session. We will have a series of presentations. First, following me Joe Jimenez, Joerg Reinhardt, Thomas Ebeling, Andreas Rummelt, and then Raymund Breu; and then we will come to conclusion and to the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>If we look at the group performance, you have seen that meantime obviously, and as reported, growth in local currency 3%, dollars 8, operating income up 58%, net income 12 billion, EPS a little bit more up because of the share buyback program which concentrates the earnings to some degree, but of course this gives you one piece of the picture, but not the entire picture.</p>
          <p>We had several important one-timers last year. The biggest one was a positive one of 5.2 billion post or after-tax benefit through the sale of Medical Nutrition and Gerber, an increased environmental provision 590 million, and the restructuring program roughly 450 million. And if one takes out these one-timers, then you see that turnover increase by 6% in local currencies, operating income up 2%, net 7% up and EPS 9% up. And obviously you can take out just the income and leave the negative one-timers and then you will come to a negative growth.  And I think we have that in the press release too. So I will not go into this detail.</p>
          <p>If we look at the geographic growth patterns, you can see that exceptionally for once the U.S. did underperform and had a contraction. This is due exclusively to the performance of Pharmaceuticals. By the way the Pharmaceutical business in the other regions did grow dynamically, in most, double-digit, and that explains why all other regions are also doing well.</p>
          <p>By division, dynamic growth of Sandoz plus 13% in local currencies, plus 20 in U.S. dollars and remarkable improvement of the margin with operating income 41% up and with over a billion now, they have tripled their operating income in three years.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health up 6% in local currencies, 11 in dollars and also here in margin improvement operating income up 19%, and Vaccines and Diagnostics with the strongest growth rates close to 50% in local currencies. And then the operating income really in percentage increase doesn't make sense to put it down.</p>
          <p>We had several events in 2007. By all means I would say more which I experienced is negative than positive ones, that's even true for the approvals. We had 15 approvals in the U.S. and the EU, but the two non-approvals and especially the delay of Galvus in the U.S. was a setback. The Zelnorm suspension started the whole series of 2007 in April, then Galvus, then we had the unexpected launch of a generic for Lotrel and Famvir at risk, meaning we still have a patent but Teva launched anyway. And then we had the expected generic competition for Trileptal and Lamisil, that was in our plans, then the Prexige non-approvable letter was less of a surprise. And then also planned was the divestment of the Medical Nutrition business and Gerber and the rotation at the divisional level.</p>
          <p>If we look at this strategy, then obviously the question is what are the fundamental trends? I will not go into these details, you know them as well as I have &#x2013; I know. And they haven't changed really from the past. So, we have substantial pull, growth drivers, which at the same time really create the problem, because with that the healthcare bill is increasing and with that the counter measures with the pressures on prices are also increasing.  And then we see that some states in mid-income countries or low-income countries have weak PIP, or weaker PIP. And in the U.S., we for example didn't get an injunction when Teva launched Lotrel and Famvir, which also is indicative that the environment is not as friendly as it used to be to the innovator. But, all of that will of course find its end in front of the judge and we will see who eventually prevails.</p>
          <p>Strategically, we therefore have decided to have a focused diversification strategy, not only investing in branded innovative pharmaceuticals, which remain very important and attractive, but also in quality, inexpensive alternatives, the generics, prevention, vaccines and diagnostics, and self-medication, consumer health. And I think the results show this strategy does deliver and will also continue to deliver, we believe.</p>
          <p>Now what strategic implications are we drawing from that?  First of all under the business portfolio level, we believe that we should continue to strengthen the non-branded businesses, addressing specific customer needs. On the innovation level, we need to focus on truly innovative products which are differentiated and bring a real health benefit to the consumer or the patient and we have to work on organizational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Why do we think that the non-Rx or branded Rx portfolio has strength? First of all, it allows us to tap new growth sources; secondly, diversifies our exposure, for example, reimbursement, but also patents versus brands; then convergence of technology and customer needs in technologies like biologics &#x2013; biologics, we have it in vaccines, we have it in pharma, we have it in generics with the biosimilars, and we can leverage assets and have an economy of scale.</p>
          <p>Growth rates have changed in different industries. Pharma has come down. The margins obviously in the Pharma business are still the most attractive of these four businesses. If you look at the evolution between 2004 and 2007, you see that the faster growth rate in the non-Pharma business has increased its percentage. At the same time, I have to stress it's not because Pharma was weak; Pharma did gain market share and did well except in 2007. So it is just that the other businesses have been more dynamic.</p>
          <p>If we look at the innovation, and this is one set of measures one could take, is neighbors, so Mark Fishman's organization, we look at target discovery programs and drug design programs and the new molecules. And all of these have been increasing over the past years at a really attractive rate. We, at the same time, have a qualitative change, more highly differentiated products, more biologics, which are now 25% of our early pipeline.</p>
          <p>And the track record even in 2007 at FDA has been at the top of the industry in 2007, together with GlaxoSmithKline. And in 2007, we had the lowest approval number of new drugs, new molecular entities at FDA since 1983. So it's very clear that we had a significant slowdown by the regulators.</p>
          <p>Innovation in generics, in various fields, difficult-to-make inhalative and of course the biosimilars, where we had some success. Certainly we are here leading the industry. In Consumer Health, on the OTC area, we have had very interesting new brands, new delivery forms where we see very good consumer acceptance.</p>
          <p>In CIBA Vision we were the first to introduce a lens where you can keep it for 30 days in your eye. In Animal Health, we have an interesting pipeline. We don't talk much about it, but for example, we have for aquaculture, for fish, we have a very nice portfolio in aquaculture, and it will become more and more important as the sea has become more and more empty because of over fishing. So, that is an interesting field, and Joerg Reinhardt will talk about his innovation, and the most important one in the short term certainly is Menveo for meningitis.</p>
          <p>Pharma, last year several approvals as I mentioned.  Now we have also the rollouts, and more specialty products which are being approved and will be launched. Also we see that the specialties as a percentage overall of the current product portfolio is increasing and will go beyond 50%. But you can see here two very important franchises where we have Oncology and Hypertension and how they have grown very dynamically over the past year.</p>
          <p>Initiatives in 2008: We will continue really on what we have announced. Research sites, we will have a concentration. We've closed Vienna and Tsukuba. And we'll transfer some of the scientists to Cambridge and some of them to Basel. So from Japan to Cambridge and from Vienna to Basel, and put Immunology together and Cardiovascular together.</p>
          <p>And the Biologics unit which we have announced and we are building up and then Step-up, which is a project to accelerate and prioritize better in development, and Joe will talk about this also afterwards, and Forward which is across the entire organization, a desire to simplify the organization to fasten the decision processes by also delegating more and then at the same time to reduce costs by simplifying the organization.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to pass to Joe Jimenez. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I would like to leave you with three messages today. The first is that we had strong underlying performance in 2007 despite the issues that we saw in the U.S. The second is that we are positioning Novartis Pharma to win in a rapidly changing environment. So I'm going to take you through some of the key changes that we are generating in Pharma to gain competitive advantage. And then the third message is that 2008 is going to be a year of focusing on the fundamentals and driving our new product launches. So you will see accelerating growth in the back half of the year, low-single-digit sales growth in total, but operating income growing ahead of sales.</p>
          <p>Starting with 2007, our sales crossed the $24 billion mark up 6%, 2% in local currency, operating income was down 9% impacted by the forward restructuring charge as well Zelnorm withdraw and the generic issues in the U.S. impacted products that had higher margin than line average. Importantly though, you have to look at the underlying growth.  So this chart shows in the middle 2% local currency growth.  If you back up the one-time effects to the left of Zelnorm and the generic hits, there was $20 billion of business that was growing at about 10% and that is important, particularly as we think about 2008. You see it in our geographies.  So outside of the U.S. we had double-digit growth in some key geographies, importantly Europe, also up a solid 9% in a pretty tough environment.</p>
          <p>So franchises did well, Oncology approached $7 billion up 13%. This is the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth for Oncology. Neuroscience also approaching $3 billion, very important third platform for us behind Oncology and Cardiovascular.</p>
          <p>We have the number one hypertension portfolio in the category with Diovan, and now Exforge and Tekturna. You can see that we grew the franchise by $300 million overcoming a $700 million hit with Lotrel. Diovan crossed 40% share of the ARB market in the U.S. Oncology continues to grow. Glivec crossed $3 billion in total sales, up 14%. Femara up double-digit, and importantly, Tasigna, just launched, will drive continued Oncology growth into the future.</p>
          <p>We have the strongest regulatory performance in the industry.  And this is important because this is our future when you think about the launches in 2007, and how we are going to drive those in 2008. The launches are off to a good start. Lucentis, Exforge and Tekturna generating about $500 million in sales in 2007. In fact, Lucentis, which is the only approved treatment for macular degeneration that actually improves vision, increases the independence of the patient and reduces the overall burden on the healthcare system.</p>
          <p>Exforge, which is our combination of Diovan with amlodipine, is off to a tremendous start. It's exceeding benchmark analogs in most markets, and we continue to believe that this will be a blockbuster for us.</p>
          <p>Tekturna is gaining momentum after what was a relatively slow start. We've gotten some new formulary wins in the U.S. As well, we have Tekturna HCT to be launched in the first half of 2008, which combines Tekturna and a diuretic for even more potent blood pressure reduction.</p>
          <p>Aclasta, which is our once annual infusion for osteoporosis; this solves a major unmet medical need. 50% of patients that are on oral bisphosphonate don't comply after six months of therapy, and that's the same as no protection, so Aclasta is very important.</p>
          <p>Exelon Patch, better tolerability for Alzheimer's dementia than other drugs in this class. This thing is also adding to our Exelon total share.</p>
          <p>So overall, performance in 2007; heavily impacted by what happened in the U.S., but good underlying performance and launches that are off to a good start.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to talk about how we are changing Novartis Pharma. I have been in Pharma for about three months. And I got to tell you the people in Pharma are &#x2013; this is a high-performing team. They are &#x2013; it's a group that likes to win. They are used to winning.</p>
          <p>But there are some things that we have to change. If you look at the events that hit us in 2007 in the U.S., these are fundamental consequences of an industry that is changing relatively quickly. So, we have to turn this to an external culture where we can better anticipate some of the changes that are occurring in the industry and then change our business model in a way that generates competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Now, the issues in the industry are well known, they are listed on the left. But to be able to win in this environment, we are changing Novartis Pharma in four ways, and I want to touch on all four of them. The first is development. We have a very strong development organization that has a very good track record of success. But in a tougher regulatory environment, we have to move from what is today functional decision making where we make decisions along clinical development, safety, regulatory, on up the line to cross-functional teams that manage the projects from early development all the way through to commercialization. This will push accountability deeper down in the organization and allow for decisions to be made at the right level. So the way these teams are going to look, they will have a product leader at the center for every project in development with functional experts reporting to that project leader, and they will manage the process. This will force integration at lower level and accelerate and improve decision-making.</p>
          <p>The second big change that we are making beyond development is in innovative commercial models. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has had a once-size-fits-all approach to sales where we bombard the physician multiple times per week or per month, and that model doesn't work in all markets anymore. If you look at the chart, the left hand side shows the old share of voice market where the doctor had a high degree of autonomy. But as markets evolve, the payers and the reimbursement agencies have much more say in what's actually dispensed. So we are geotailoring our sales force, pulling resources away from the physician in those markets and surrounding those payers and reimbursement agencies with cross-functional teams. So we are physically moving from a once-size-fits-all approach directed at the physician to a cross-functional team approach in those markets, where it's appropriate where we include marketing, sales, logistics, and we &#x2013; it's a different sell, it's a different approach. But this is going to help adapt to a changing customer base.</p>
          <p>Another example of innovation is in pricing. In a very tough pricing environment, we believe we have to become more collaborative with the payers and the reimbursement agencies. So, one example is what we are doing in the U.K., where we are guaranteeing the patients on Diovan-based therapy we will deliver a blood pressure reduction at target or we will refund the cost of Diovan. What this is helping us to do is gain primary access in the U.K., but it's also a win for the NHS, which knows that they're going to get a drug that will effectively reduce the blood pressure for those patients who need it.</p>
          <p>The third area of change for Pharma is in productivity. We announced in December that we are undergoing a broad-ranging productivity program that will involve all of our functions. It will streamline the organization. We will offshore and outsource some of our back-office functions. It will save over $600 million in 2008 and growing to 1.2 billion by 2010.</p>
          <p>And then the fourth and final change is around growth areas, and focusing on emerging markets. As I have come into this business, I am pleased by the strength that we have in some emerging markets. For example in Brazil, the number one pharma brand of any therapy area is Diovan. In Turkey, we have the largest pharma business in the country on down the list. We can leverage our strength in some key emerging markets to grow faster, and you will see additional investment in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So, these are the four areas that we believe we can change Novartis Pharma to be able to gain even greater competitive advantage in a pretty tough industry environment.</p>
          <p>I'd like to finish by providing an outlook for 2008. We are going to really focus on driving these launches. The launches are out there and now we have to execute them with excellence. The first half of the year is going to be highly impacted by Zelnorm and the other generic issues until we lap that. However, we will show low single-digit growth in total and operating income growing ahead of sales.</p>
          <p>We don't usually do this, but I wanted to show the quarterly flow because of how different it's going to be. You can see in the first half of the year, we will have about $1.4 billion of lost sales. We're going to have to get out from under. And then as we move into the third and the fourth quarter, the underlying growth rate of the business will reemerge and we will generate high single-digit growth by the end of 2008. That will result in low single-digit growth for the full year.</p>
          <p>We are expecting strong continued news flow. These are just some of the examples, more news on Tekturna around the blood pressure efficacy of the drug as well as the organ-protecting properties, two filings in Oncology with Glivec and with RAD001.</p>
          <p>So I'm optimistic about 2008. This is &#x2013; we are physically changing Novartis Pharma to be able to create competitive advantage in what is a pretty rapidly changing environment and at the same time, we've got great launches that we can drive in our developed markets and leverage our strength in emerging markets for continued growth.</p>
          <p>So thank you, and now I would like to introduce, Joerg Reinhardt.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good afternoon. 2007 was a good year for Vaccines and Diagnostics. We had second year of strong sales growth after 2006. We achieved profitability ahead of schedule. We had a number of growth drivers for not just influenza. And last but not least, we also did move our pipeline forward, especially for the meningitis projects.</p>
          <p>The vaccine sector is a very attractive part of the healthcare business. From a more long-term perspective, the healthcare market is clearly shifting more towards prevention. Innovation in the vaccine sector is accelerating. There are now opportunities to discover new vaccines that were not able to be put to use 10 years ago. All new vaccines that are adopted on vaccination schedules in the individual countries show strong performance. And then last but not least, there is a significant barrier to entry and also the threat of generic competition is very limited.</p>
          <p>Number wise, we grew by 25% in U.S. dollars, by 20% in local currencies. Operating income 72 million; return on net sales was 5% on a reported basis. When we look at the adjusted basis, meaning excluding all exceptional events, the underlying return on net sales is 21.3%</p>
          <p>The vaccine business is the driver of this growth. We have 72% of the division sales come from vaccines, 28% come from diagnostics. When you look at the geographical distribution, it's almost even between the U.S. and Europe, with 44 and 43% and the rest is coming from international, mainly Asian markets. In Lat Am, we are still relatively weak, but we would like to grow there.</p>
          <p>If you look at the growth drivers of 2007 sales, it was mainly our tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, which we sell in Europe, in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where we could actually sell almost double as many doses as we did sell in 2006, but also the pediatric vaccines and among them Quinvaxem, which is a fully liquid pentavalent vaccine that we developed together with Crucell and that we also sell together with Crucell mainly to NGOs, like UNICEF and PAHO. It did develop very, very nicely. And you can see here that sales more than tripled.</p>
          <p>Influenza was a little bit of a disappointment. Growth was only 10% as compared to 2006, mainly based on weak influenza season, especially in the U.S., but also in Europe. I believe we did comment already in the third quarter that most of our influenza sales will be in the first &#x2013; in the third quarter. There was not much of sales anymore in the fourth quarter, which had to do with the fact that the season was mild and still is mild. Nevertheless, sales grew by roughly 10% also in this segment of the business.</p>
          <p>In the influenza business, we believe that it will be necessary and very important to come up with more differentiated products and there we do have two offerings that are unique in the field. We have the only adjuvanted flu vaccine, which is Fluad, which is currently indicated in elderly of 65 years and above. We do develop that vaccine now also for children because there is still a significant need for children. And the second one is Optaflu, which is the first cell based flu vaccine that was approved in mid of 2007 and we will launch this product now on a broader basis for the coming flu season 2008 in Europe.</p>
          <p>From a pipeline perspective, we made good progress, especially with the meningitis vaccines. And here, meningococcal disease is very, very severe in its impact. We can see on this chart a number of reasons why the medical need for that indication is so high. There is still a very high mortality rate of 10 to 30% despite treatment. Those who survive have long-term consequences that they have to deal with. So, overall, meningococcal disease is a very severe disease. Now it's complicated by the fact that there are five different strains of the bacterium, which all are important and all can lead to disease, A, B, C, W and Y.</p>
          <p>The market for any of those vaccines is expected to be substantial. It is an infant vaccine, which will be given to infants at the age between one month and 12 months. The birth cohort for U.S. and Europe together is more than 11 million babies. When you look at the adolescents where there is a catch-up opportunity, it's more than 12 million people. We need four doses for infants. We need one dose for adolescents. And when you look at benchmark prices, modern new vaccines are at the range of around $100 per dose, so $400 for a course, just to give you an indication.</p>
          <p>Menveo, which is the first vaccine that we will submit for registration, is an ACWY vaccine, which is coming to close to completion of Phase III trials. We have run Phase III trials in all three populations, in infants, in toddlers and in adolescents. Results will be available in the second quarter. I hope that we can present some of these data in May.</p>
          <p>Now, in Phase II, this vaccine has shown remarkable effectiveness or remarkable level of immunogenicity not only in adolescents after one dose as we can see here, but also in toddlers after two doses, and also, and that is really new in infants, after three doses.</p>
          <p>The current gold standard in that indication is Menactra, which is a Sanofi vaccine, which is not indicated at the moment in subjects of below two years. There is a program ongoing that may get this product to kids of above nine months, but there is certainly no current focus towards lower ages. We believe that Menveo will actually cover the range from two months upwards. As I showed before, we have data that show that in infants of two months and older, Menveo shows in Phase II, remarkable results and I hope that we can confirm this in Phase III.</p>
          <p>When you compare the profile of the two products, Menactra and Menveo, as I said, it's the efficacy in infants that Menactra doesn't show. We have in our Phase III programs co-administration with the standard vaccines, data that Menactra does not have. And also from a persistence perspective, we have shown that Menveo shows a more persistent immunogenicity as compared to older polysaccharide vaccines and Menactra could never show that.  So altogether, we believe that we are on a good track for submission by the middle of this year in adolescents first.</p>
          <p>However, the main challenge in meningitis vaccines is still a B vaccine. All attempts so far have failed to come up with a B vaccine. Since years and years, people are trying more or less in a standard way to come up with a B vaccine, and so far nothing has worked.</p>
          <p>Now a number of years ago, around year 2000, our Head of Research in Italy, in Siena, did start a project together with Craig Venter at TIGR [The Institute for Genomic Research] at that time to sequence the genome of meningitis B. Meningitis B has 2,200 genes. Out of those, they identified 350 proteins that are potentially amenable for the creation of a vaccine. They tested those in a range of in-vitro and in-vivo tests and came up at the end with four antigens, four protein-based antigens that could potentially lead to a vaccine.</p>
          <p>Now, it looks like that vaccine, based on these four proteins works. These are Phase II data in adults which show that against three of the most prevalent strains of MenB, there is a really high immunogenicity and a very high immune response that is absolutely adequate for adults. And this is very new data, and we could also show that against infants there is a very &#x2013; or in infants, there is a very good immune response against these three different strains. So given those data that no one could show before, we will now start Phase III in beginning of 2008 &#x2013; just the MenB vaccine.</p>
          <p>In addition to the meningitis portfolio, our research and development alliance with Intercell did lead to a broadening and strengthening of the pipeline as you can see here. The first vaccine that comes out of this development collaboration is Ixiaro which is our Japanese encephalitis vaccine that was submitted for registration before end of the year of last year by Intercell in the U.S. and in Europe. In addition, we have started Phase I with GBS, Group B Streptococcus, vaccine and we hope that we can start Phase I with an H pylori vaccine as well this year.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, base business, no new product so far.  Base business coming from the acquisition is continuing well, growing strongly. We have a pipeline that is emerging very positively, not just in influenza and in meningitis, but also beyond that. And last but not least for 2008, we believe that we will have another year with double-digit growth and despite the lack of separate one-time income, we believe that we can keep the margins at the levels of 2007.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and with this I hand over to my colleague Thomas Ebeling.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. So consumer healthcare markets are really attractive. They demonstrate very solid high mid-single-digit growth rates and healthy growth levels, and we expect the growth rates of markets to accelerate driven by innovation and by payer and the regulatory trends which will further drive healthcare, and by an increase in purchasing power in emerging growth markets, specifically markets like Russia, China and Korea.</p>
          <p>The megatrends in consumer healthcare are significant. First, we believe that there is a shift of costs driven by payers and authorities towards the consumer, so the consumer has to carry more costs. Secondly, the consumers are becoming more self-aware, more educated about healthcare, and are willing to invest more to prevent diseases and to treat diseases. And we believe as well that in terms of sales channels, you will see a customer consolidation which will lead to stronger customers, but those are more skilled in driving revenues through better in-store promotions. And we believe that new channels like Internet will open up more distribution points and more distribution points will lead to higher revenues.</p>
          <p>The three common characteristics of all three businesses are:  They are all consumer-driven, they are covering professional and retail channels, and they have at least all types of science.</p>
          <p>The Novartis Consumer Health Division has demonstrated high single-digit growth rates in terms of sales and operating income growth, and was able to improve the return on sales over the last five years.  The business split &#x2013; that OTC represents 50%, CIBA Vision 30, Animal Health 20; and if you take a look at the geography, this business is less U.S. dominated than other businesses of Novartis.</p>
          <p>Both OTC and Animal Health were able to outgrow the market significantly.  CIBA Vision is growing a little bit behind the market and was, however, able to defend a strong number 2 position with more than 20% market share.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating income, the business grew by 11% in U.S. dollar, 7 in terms of sales, in terms of operating income 7, and if you exclude the effect of project "Forward", it would have been 19%, so very healthy growth rates for Consumer Health in 2007.</p>
          <p>The priorities are that we have to continue to outgrow the market.  We want to grow operating income faster than revenues.  All of our businesses have still not yet achieved 20% return on sales, so there is room for improvement.  In terms of innovation, all businesses have rich pipelines, but what we need is more impactful innovations.  Marketing and sales capabilities are good but not yet best in class.  And in terms of efficiency, we want to have special emphasis next year on supply chain improvements and on reduction in overhead costs.</p>
          <p>Our position in emerging markets is relatively strong.  Our self-medication business in Russia has already exceeded $100 million revenue, but there are still more to gain.  And we will continue to explore external growth opportunities for the businesses.</p>
          <p>A quick look at each of the units.  In OTC, we rank fourth.  Europe is the key region for that business.</p>
          <p>You can see here our brands and major categories.  We have a strong position in cough and cold, in pain, and derm, and in GI.  In 2007, specifically, Voltaren was growing nicely and our cough and cold brands outside the U.S. showed very good growth rates.</p>
          <p>You can see here that we have 170 projects in our pipeline.  Admittedly, these are more smaller projects incremental innovation.  However, we believe that we have one of the largest pipelines, that our speed to market is good, and that we have some very impactful innovations like Voltaren Gel, which we got approval in U.S. and the Rx-to-OTC switch for Prevacid.</p>
          <p>In terms of key priorities 2008 for OTC, it's clearly the launch of Voltaren Gel in U.S.; secondly, to remain on track regarding the switch of Prevacid, to explore acquisitions and external growth, continue to strengthen our position in emerging markets, and to really drive the productivity improvements in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>Animal Health is an interesting business.  The spending for pet drugs has doubled over the last 10 years.  You can see that more than 60% of U.S. households actually have a pet and more than 50% of dog owners are actually giving their pet a birthday or a Christmas present.  So that shows that there is tremendous potential in this business.</p>
          <p>And not quite surprisingly, for us, the key geography is the U.S., with 44%. It's the strongest country we have and we rank 5th in the market.</p>
          <p>We have 41 projects in development, 25 in registration.  The Animal Health unit is very effective in leveraging opportunities coming out of our Pharma pipeline and out of other businesses from Novartis.</p>
          <p>You can see here our brands and our four key segments.  In 2007, the performance of companion animals therapeutics and of our water business was very strong.  Paraciticides in U.S. was the performance which was most concerning. But overall we are very pleased with the performance of our key brands.</p>
          <p>Priorities for next year is sales force optimization, launches, continuing to drive innovations and improving their productivity and supply chain.</p>
          <p>CIBA Vision is ranked number 2 in its market, more than 20% market share.  Here again, for us, Europe is the key region.  In the past, CIBA Vision was really very, very innovative and we had several groundbreaking innovations like NIGHT &amp; DAY, FreshLook and DAILIES, and those brands have captured leading market share in their segments.</p>
          <p>For the future, we intend to launch every year between three and four projects.  For 2008, we will launch DAILIES AquaComfort Plus and two optimization projects of O2OPTIX, and for our 2009 and '10, we are hopeful to launch four new projects.</p>
          <p>Aqua DAILIES Comfort (sic) [DAILIES AquaComfort] has a unique triple action for moistening has been launched in the first European countries in the second half of 2007.  So far the initial up-tick is good, and we will roll out this product in more countries in 2008.</p>
          <p>So, for 2008 the key priorities are launches, innovation, continued drive for quality, as you know we had in the last two years every year with some products quality issues. We have made great progress in controlling this.  So we are very hopeful that 2008 will be a year of uninterrupted supply chain based on good quality management.  And we will here as well continue to improve the efficiency in supply chain.</p>
          <p>So, overall a strong performance in the past; good market growth outlook; Consumer Health is well-positioned based on strong brands, strong innovation, and being part of Novartis; and we expect in 2008 a very dynamic operating income growth and significantly ahead of top-line growth.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to pass on to my colleague Andreas Rummelt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  2007 was a great year for Sandoz.  We grew very fast, top-line and bottom-line, outperforming the global generics market in a highly dynamic industry.  We also took important steps to get even better prepared to expand our leadership position.  Already now, more than 90% of the world population has access to our drugs.  In about half of the markets we are either the number 1, 2, or 3, which is very important in this still very local and fragmented industry.</p>
          <p>There is very different business models from pure key account management in countries like the U.S., in the U.K. too, branded generics business which is very pharma-like, and we are following with the business model the local market needs.</p>
          <p>Looking a little bit deeper into the numbers, we added more than a billion in sales and 300 million in operating income, so basically a very profitable growth.  We had another year of very strong performance of our anti-infectives business which accounts for about 10% of our global sales, and this is driven by an underlying high demand.  We are the only remaining anti-infectives company in the western hemisphere and this contributed a lot to the good results in 2007.</p>
          <p>Overall, the growth was driven by a high demand and we produced about a quarter more in 2007 as compared to 2006.  ROS developed favorably in 2007.  We promised to achieve 15% three years after the acquisition.  So we are nearly there, and we are ahead of our plans.  If you just see ROS for exceptional items, especially the acquisition-related accounting, we are at 20% which is even a little bit better than industry average.</p>
          <p>Looking into the different countries, we were not only able to outgrow our two most important markets, the U.S. and Germany where we grew significantly faster than the market; we also could show very good results in some of our key countries, and here especially we started a growth program in Russia which already developed nicely in 2007.  So here we ramped up field force we focused on specific product which really paid off.</p>
          <p>Another important market is Japan which is expected to grow fastest in the next few years, and here also through significant number of new products and more field force we could outgrow this important market.</p>
          <p>Overall, the growth of course was fuelled by new launches.  We had nearly 300 new products introduced in different countries, and just looking at the example of the U.S., here we were able to achieve already 30% of the total sales just generated by the newly launched products, end of 2006 and 2007.  And we had a particularly strong contribution of difficult-to-make products. Here just two examples, the generic version of Toprol-XL from Astra and Omnicef from Abbott which contributed significantly.</p>
          <p>The Cefdinir launch, Omnicef, in the U.S. was a very successful one. We could develop this product in only one year from beginning to end, and this was a development not only of the dosage form but also of the active ingredient. We were in court with the originator, and only four days after the court decision in favor of us, we were able to launch this product from Austria where it was manufactured into the U.S. which was a great achievement.</p>
          <p>Another good example of difficult-to-make generics is an implant which we produced also from scratch &#x2013; developed and produced from scratch in-house. We now have a one and a three months implant of leuprolide. In Germany we will introduce this into other markets and here so far we don't have generic competition.</p>
          <p>Looking at the overall markets, the global market, we expect to have a 9% growth over the next five years, so year-by-year 9%. Little bit slower in the more mature generic market like Western Europe and the U.S., very dynamic in Latin America and some Asian countries, in Eastern Europe which is one of our most important geographies, and in Japan, as I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>In half of the countries, we are amongst the top three generic companies. In other markets, we have plans in place in order to expand leadership, to grow our position with very different strategies. Just the example of Central and Eastern Europe, here we started our growth program. This is a branded generics market and is expected to stay as a branded generic market in the next few years. We focused our promotion on few products, ramped up field force, and as OTC &#x2013; generic OTC and prescription generics go very well along with the pharmacies; we increased our spend here. And already in 2007, we could show some remarkable growth rates in many of the countries in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Germany is a different picture. Here, the business model is moving towards key account business. We built this key account business in our negotiations with the health insurers which become a more dominant player in the German healthcare system. So the decision power is moving slowly from the physicians and pharmacists to the health insurance companies, and a good part of the portfolio will be driven by these new contracts.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it will still be important to bring new products, differentiated products, difficult-to-make products into the German generic market in Germany where it's still necessary to promote these products to doctors and physicians. So it will be a differentiated model and we are very well prepared to play this model, as the healthcare reform implementation in Germany is further developing.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., again, another different picture. Here we see for the last years, the blockbusters &#x2013; easy-to-make blockbusters, more or less disappearing in terms of value after patent expiry. So, some of the products go from originator value of 100 to less than 1% in only a few days. So this means a $1 billion product develops into a 10 million product which is then shared many generic players. So another very attractive business and Zolpidem is just an example for this.</p>
          <p>What is even more important than in the past is to have a higher proportion of difficult-to-make generics in the U.S. market where there is less competition, where you can expect higher and sustainably higher margins. Here the generic version of the Toprol-XL is a very good example. So we are still now for a period of longer than one year on the market with just the originator and the authorized generic of the originator, nobody else has approval because nobody else was successful to develop this products to the satisfaction of the FDA, and these are the products in the future which will also dominate the growth in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Difficult-to-make generics in very different technologies, it's not just the special hard-to-make oral dosage form, it's also injectables, it's respiratory, it's patches and of course biosimilars. And here we have a nice track record over the last three years to bring successfully products to the market in Europe, in U.S. and in Asia and more importantly we have in all these technologies a significant number of projects in development which we will bring after patent expiry to the respective market.</p>
          <p>Focus of our activities are still on the biosimilars after the success of achieving Omnitrope approval in the U.S. and in Europe last year. We achieved Omnitrope liquid form which is a much more competitive product in the Europe and last night also in the U.S. So this will fuel the Omnitrope sales around the world. Another big success in 2007 was the European approval of erythropoietin which we launched in Germany and some European countries in 2007. We will continue to launch in other European countries as soon as pricing and reimbursement negotiations are completed.</p>
          <p>An example of Omnitrope development, so here we compare our Omnitrope introduction in France with the last somatropin launch in France. So the uptake was much faster and we were able in the fourth quarter to get about 10% of the new patients and I expect now with the new form of Omnitrope to even accelerate this growth.</p>
          <p>Key priorities for 2008, two major areas, it's growth and it's operational excellence; growth through further expanding our market presence, of course, organically and if there are good opportunities also through acquisition, and what is important is our continued success with difficult-to-make products. On operational excellence we have programs ongoing especially in our Technical Operations and production organization in order to further increase cost competitiveness, and with this we should be able to achieve high single-digit sales growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>In conclusion record year 2007 in a very competitive environment, in a very dynamic industry, Sandoz is the leading high quality generics company and we are off for a good start to further expand this leadership in 2008.</p>
          <p>And with this I hand over to my colleague Raymund Breu.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I will cover only three topics. The drivers of group sales and operating income, the non-operating performance, and cash flow and liquidity, and I start off with this slide that Daniel Vasella has already shown. I refer at a few numbers here, and want now to comment on the sales growth, the 11% and then the operating income margin development from 22 to 20.5%.</p>
          <p>Sales increases of 11% in dollars were driven by strong volume 5 percentage points, but we also had the benefit of a weak U.S. dollar. So currency gains added another 5 percentage points. Growth was particularly strong in emerging growth markets: Russia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, India, China and South Korea in this example. These markets account already for 9% of Novartis sales and are growing at 17% in constant currencies, which is almost three times the Group average.</p>
          <p>For margin, you have seen that operating income grew only a 2% compared to a top-line growth of 11%, so margin was down for the Group 1.7 percentage points. The main reasons are twofold, in COGS, you see a deterioration of 1.6 percentage points. This is due to portfolio mix changes, higher rate of vaccines in Sandoz, and a 320 million impairment charge for Famvir that is booked in COGS. Second driver, R&amp;D expenses as a percent of sales grew 1.4 percentage points, so drove this expense item up to 16.9% of sales. As we did not reduce development investments back in the rich late stage Pharma pipeline despite the sales slowdown in Pharma.</p>
          <p>Non-operating items, 2007 net income benefited also from better financial income and from lower tax rate. The net financial income improvement was partly due to higher average net liquidity because of the divestitures. The excellent performance but &#x2013; was also then due to good currency management, because you can see that currency gains were boosted from 38 million to 158 million in the reporting year. Overall, net financial income reached a good return of 9% of net liquidity.</p>
          <p>I mentioned that the tax rate in 2007 as a percentage of profit before tax of continuing operations dropped to a very low 12.6%. This is an exceptionally low level that benefited from unusual one time items, a positive tax effect of the one time charges for environmental and restructuring, the impact of a reduction in the overall German tax rate from 37.5 to 28.5%, and the one-time tax benefit from integrating Chiron into the Novartis organization. So, if you exclude these factors then the underlying rate of 16.2% is a number which is more predictive of the future underlying tax burden.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow from continuing operations reached $3.8 billion, this is 7% less than the year ago. Cash flow from operating activities still was up 11% in line with sales, so working capital management was okay. But this was still more than offset by significantly higher capital expenditure and significantly higher dividend payments for the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure for mostly capacity expansion in production and in research and development in the Basel campus increased 43% to now 2.5 billion or 6.7% of sales. And the dividend payouts for 2006 and 2007 increased 27%. Given the strong free cash flow and the absence of major acquisitions in 2007, we used part of the divestiture proceeds to buy-back additionally 4.7 billion in owned shares via the so-called second line, completing the fourth and fifth programs.</p>
          <p>As the market prices for our shares are currently depressed, which I would read as attractive, the share buy-backs were clearly net income and value accretive. To create flexibility for the future, we have proposed to the AGM, the upcoming AGM the new sixth program for up to 10 billion Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>Finally, net, our liquidity at the end of 2007, stood at 13.2 billion or net of financial debt, it reached a net level of 7.4 billion. This increase in net liquidity was due to the strong free cash flow of the group. And the proceeds after tax of 7.8 billion from the Nutrition divestiture, obviously against this, we had the share buy-backs.</p>
          <p>Overall, the group continues to enjoy an excellent balance sheet and a solid financial basis and we continue to have the top three player rating for debt and the top short-term rating from all three rating agencies.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And I pass back to Daniel Vasella.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me come to the conclusions. We had a good track record till 2007, growth wise and if you look at the various divisions that each and everyone has strong positions in franchises, in pipeline, and in performance.</p>
          <p>From a point of view of return to the shareholders, we have changed two policies. One is the payout ratio, which we have increased from 35 &#x2013; from 40 &#x2013; maximum 40% to 60%.  And we have also said that we will return up to 100% of the free cash flow to investors after dividends and acquisitions via share buy-backs. This was 50% before. So, we have changed here the policy. And for 2007, we propose to increase the dividend by 19% in Swiss francs. In dollars, obviously it's more to CHF 1.60 which brings the annual growth rate of the dividends to 11% overall these years. And of course, we hear and see a lot about the share price and how it doesn't move.</p>
          <p>And so, we thought we should look once at the generation of income, of profits over a number of years, how the P/E evolves and how we compare to competition. That's really what comes out. What you see in the past five years, we have increased the income by over 80%, indexed, the P/E went down, but as compared to competition, we were better in both measures.</p>
          <p>If you take a ten-year look at total shareholder return, then we can see a few changes. In the recent years, the world stock market has grown faster than the pharmaceutical market. Of course because of the high growth of cyclical industries and that you see reflected here, we did however do better than world pharma and peers. If you take a five-year picture of total shareholder return, it's even more marked that the world stock market did outperform the pharmaceutical market, but we did again beat the world pharma market index and the peers, so with over 10% of total shareholder return.</p>
          <p>If we look at the year 2008, then we anticipate over the entire year a mid-single digit net sales growth in local currencies and what you will see is that Q1 especially is negative &#x2013; negatively impacted by Pharma. The other businesses should be doing fine. The second quarter will about the neutral in Pharma, then come to growth and then to dynamic growth in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now some may have the question well how come that you are so confident?  Well, one is that we have a washout period of the baseline. We grew 18% in the first quarter of 2007, so that will come back as the terrible comparison quarter one to quarter one, and we lost the sales over the half year, especially second half year of 2007. So the baseline then improves, so that's just pure washout.</p>
          <p>And then secondly we have the new launches, which are delivering, which Joe Jimenez did present. They add up to that, and that's how we project the growth to be delivered. There are no approvals which are calculated in this growth. So, there is certainly one risk factor which is a delay in approval or so forth is not in this projection. Towards the end of the year, I think we will gain market share again in Pharma and comeback to dynamic growth, over the entire year, record operating and net income.</p>
          <p>Now, why do we believe that despite the dip we have in the fourth quarter, first quarter, in first quarter 2008, why is it a good investment?  First of all, we have a good business. We are one of the global leaders. I believe that the focus diversification strategy on a business portfolio is delivering, and we saw the results this year. The pipeline is strong. We have a good performance record. The balance sheet is solid by all means which we see is important and last but not least we are not terribly expensive.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to conclude the presentations and invite my colleagues to the floor.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay we have two questions here then a third one. One, two, three.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Graham Perry from Merrill Lynch. Just starting off with a question on your guidance beyond 2008; in the past you've talked about continuing to grow revenues returning to the top line growth for the Pharma division beyond 2008, I noticed that slide was absent from the presentation today. So could you inform us whether you no longer believe in that or whether you are just reserving judgment for the time being?  And secondly on FTY720, I also noticed that the transforms one-year data was not included in the upcoming events for this year. Is that delayed or is that just something which you didn't see as particularly important?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly on Tekturna, is there an argument, for you to lay back on your detailing of Tekturna until you got outcomes data to support the product, given some of the less than favorable editorials on the product you have seen in peer-review publications?  And also, you talked about 63% Tier II coverage in commercial plans. I was just wondering if you could update us on where you are with Medicare. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of your first question around Pharma growth, I think, as I look at the business and I look at the launches, and I see very confident high single-digit growth returning by the end of '08, and I think that's as far as I would go. I think this is -- that will be the base; I know historically we have said double-digit, but as I look at double-digit and I think about changes in assumptions around Galvus or Prexige. I feel like by the end of this year, we'll be confidently in the high single-digit rate. Regarding the second question on FTY, that Phase III study is underway currently, and we expect to announce results in the first quarter of '09, so there is no issue, there is -- and I don't believe that that's a change in timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can help you with some details. So remember that study had completed enrollment; that is a 12-month positive control study. So the last patient will complete that at the end of the third quarter of 2008, but the two-year placebo-control data, the trials are still ongoing, so we want to maintain those patients. So we need to control the release of that information to maintain patients in the trials, so that's why we don't list it in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the third question about Tekturna; I don't believe now is the time to back off detailing. Tekturna is going to be a slower burn I think than some of the other drugs that we have, only because it's a new class. And if you go back and you look at the original Diovan launch in monotherapy, it was similar in profile to Diovan. So we got good -- we've gotten good increases in formulary access on the commercial side. Medicare is &#x2013; where is Medicare today, Alex?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>52% Medicare. So I think we are going to continue to -- we have a strong and steady news flow over the next year, and we're going to continue to pound away Tekturna because we continue to believe in the business. As well as Tekturna HCT coming out will add additional life to the brand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Can we go to the next set of questions?  Yeah, it was just in front of you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Marcel Brand from Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. I remember the December conference call where you talked about margins Dr. Vasella, being a bit more upbeat than Dr. Breu saying that EBIT should grow double digit. Now obviously we have a pretty weak quarter, so we're looking at Pharma margins on a pretty weak baseline. Could you maybe give a little bit more color on your expectations there?  And my second question is, regarding restructuring, is there anything really new about product teams that you want to install in the company? My understanding is that this is a pretty generic thing in the industry nowadays when I look at the chart, so I guess there is something more to it.</p>
          <p>Then my last question is on Vaccines. When I calculate EBITDA margins adjusted for inventory step up, restructuring and other one time items, I see margins hovering since you own the business between minus 3% and 60% EBITDA adjusted &#x2013; and I understand that there is a seasonality to it, but could you maybe give a little bit more color on that and maybe also talk about your margin expectations for 2008?  Last question on FTY720, if you could maybe give us an update where we are, possibility maybe of an interim analysis there in the pivotal studies?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Margins, I think, you are talking about the Pharma margins obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of expectation for 2008 specifically, we expect to grow operating income at a faster rate than sales, so higher than low single digit, and we expect to grow in absolute above the 26.7% margin that we delivered in 2007, excluding restructuring; so reported was below that, reported was 25.3%, but 26.7 will grow off of that. And then I think the aspiration long-term is to return to historical operating income rates at 30 -- at or above 30%. Now that obviously depends on a lot of things in terms of what happens in the pharmaceutical industry, but that's the ambition.</p>
          <p>The second question was about development and whether the changes that we're making are really different. I can tell you that being new into the pharmaceutical industry and also into Pharma, the changes that we are making in development are fundamentally different for this organization. We are literally moving from what has been very functional decision making to decision making at the right level. I think that's one of the things; we've got great scientific talent throughout the organization, but my take is that decisions weren't always made at the right level in terms of being closest to the molecule -- closest to the data as it was coming out. So this is a fundamental change; it's requiring significant behavioral change in the development organization and it's going to take time to execute it, but I think that the pay-off will be there. The next question was on Vaccines, or actually -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The product teams I don't know if you have any -- anything specific to say about that, was it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was, that was my interpretation of that question. Is that answered &#x2013; around the product teams that we create.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And Joerg.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, margins in Vaccines; that is an interesting topic. Obviously, it is a seasonal business. On the other hand, it depends of course on the structure of the business. Now for us, where we have almost 50% of our sales in influenza business, obviously these three or four months where we have strong sales in influenza does affect the quarterly performance strongly. So, for example, when I look at just sales month by month, my strongest and my weakest month are a factor of 10 different.</p>
          <p>So that compared to an underlying significant infrastructure cost that we have every month, plus the seasonality between the third and the fourth quarter depending on how the influenza season comes out is extremely contributing to this flexibility in the margins. And I am afraid we will also have to live in 2008 with significant differences. Now from an overall perspective, as I said at the end of the presentation, I believe that the margins on a reported basis for 2008 will stay around the margins you have seen for this year, despite the fact that we do not have this one-time income of 83 million that we did have this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FTY, we mentioned that the Phase III results will be in the first quarter of 2009, but James, is there any interim report out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to give you a feedback of the overall FTY program, you know we have two placebo control trials running which are two years in duration, and the one year positive controls study from Avonex, which I mentioned will have last patient, last visit end of third quarter this year, we will report it much like the first quarter of 2009. The European placebo-controlled trial, we have been asked by the health authorities not to do an interim analysis in that trial. That trial also was fully enrolled, as I mentioned, in September of 2007. So the last patient of that trial will complete in September or so 2009.</p>
          <p>The US study, the second placebo-controlled trial, we have been asked by FDA to provide approximately 300 patients from a safety perspective from the US, those patients were in that trial in September of 2007. So in September 2007 all of the patients were in that we need for -- end-2009 filing. We will see data from the one year control study in early 2009, late 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had in the middle somebody I think, before I come to the right.  I don't recall who it was, then here in the front and then here on the right again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Amit Roy from Citigroup in London.  Firstly just again on the margins, obviously, you've suffered from product mix, and your gross margin essentially would have gone down for 2008.  Our estimate is a margin of about 83%.  So my question is in order to meet the improvement in the operating margin for Pharma, where do you see the product mix improving in 2008?  How can the product launches or the sales of existing products improve that product mix to help your gross margin get a little bit better?</p>
          <p>Secondly on Tekturna, are we going to be seeing any data on the triple therapy, so that's Tekturna plus Diovan plus diuretic versus Diovan and diuretic alone, exploiting the synergy that you've shown before that Tekturna with Diovan together gives you better blood pressure lowering on the renin-angiotensin system.</p>
          <p>And lastly, a question again on FTY720, just a little bit on this hypertension signal that we've seen before.  My question is, is this Hypertension reversible or not, or does it seem to linger around?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with gross margin, and &#x2013; or not even just gross margin, but total margins, how do we expect to grow? There will be a negative impact on margins next year with the overlap of the Zelnorm and the generic issue still hitting us in the first half of the year, but that is more than offset by the productivity initiative that we have with Project Forward; so, the $600 million in savings that we will deliver in 2008, and that is across a variety of P&amp;L line items. So you will see it across procurement in direct and indirect you will see it in marketing you will see it in sales.  So that will be throughout the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And we do expect to see mix improvement with our launches.  If you just track through the heavy spending from a launch standpoint that we had in 2007, and then as you look and play out that plays some part of it too, but all of the components work together to generate margin improvement year-on-year and in a sustainable way so that as we go forward into '09 and '10 we are continuing that trend.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second question on Tekturna-Diovan, we should receive approval for Tekturna HCT any day now, we filed HCT in Europe in December of 2007 and will launch in Europe in probably the fourth quarter of 2007. Regarding a Tekturna-Diovan combination, we do expect to be in a position to file by the end of 2008 for Tekturna-Diovan combination and, am I missing anything, James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the date on the Diovan-Tekturna, and hydrochlorothiazide, you should see mid-2008, and just to correct Joe's comment, the European is likely to be fourth quarter 2008, not '07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even though we would hope.  And the question on FTY hypertension, the hypertension seems to be a reaction to the known cardiac effect of FTY. As you know we have a slowing of heart rate in the first dose or first doses effect which ameliorates over the first seven to ten days. The hypertension seems to go paradoxical to that so as we slow the heart rate, we raise pressure and as the heart rate effect wears off, so does the blood pressure effect.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. S&#xE9;bastien Berthon from Exane BNP Paribas.  Three product questions; please, first could you update us on your pricing strategy for Lucentis in Europe and your discussions with health care authorities especially with regards to competition from Avastin.  Secondly, when will we have data on QAB149, the Phase III results which I thought we could see this year but doesn't appear on your news flowchart.  And lastly, the question is on the Menveo, when do you intend to submit for the infants indication please?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question around Lucentis.  In terms of Lucentis versus Avastin, obviously, Lucentis is the only approved treatment for macular degeneration.  Avastin and Lucentis are different molecules.  So we, the way that we approach pricing is we look at, we would look on a market-by-market basis in terms of the outcome of Lucentis and the fact that you look at the benefit that this drug has on improving patient independence and reducing the cost on &#x2013; the health care burden and the cost of not improving vision of somebody with macular degeneration.  So, I think we are having very good success.  We got a positive reaction from the UK in terms of reimbursement recently.  And so, we continue to drive that business.  In terms of QAB, we will &#x2013; the 12-month study is complete from a recruitment standpoint; so we should be in a position to file by the end of 2008.  So by the end of this quarter.  And then Menveo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Menveo adolescents middle of this year; infants, middle of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  It's Ben Yeoh from Dresdner Kleinwort.  Three questions if I may.  Firstly, just on CapEx, there was a big ramp-up obviously in CapEx in 2007 you said for capacity and things like that.  Will we be likely to see that sort of level for the foreseeable future or at least into 2008?  Is there more spend required there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on personnel costs, and I guess this goes into some of the restructuring costs.  I noticed in your annual report, personnel costs actually came in around 9.9 billion, which was up from 8.7 billion in the year before.  So, personnel costs seem to be ramping up quite a lot even though the number of employees seem to be down, slightly down, 2,500 year-on-year.  So, I was just wondering what's happening on costs there, and what's the scope there?  I mean back in the end of 2005 you only had 90,000 employees.  So, people are either getting more expensive or something is happening there.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just sort of more broadly, just in terms of US politics, healthcare reform, obviously going into election year, I mean how do you see that playing out short to medium term?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Raymund I think, first two...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The outlook for capital expenditure, I would expect that 2008 will be another high level of CapEx.  So similar level to what you've seen in 2007, so somewhere in the 7, the 6.5 to 7.5% range.  Thereafter, it would tail off a bit because according to the current planning we would not expect that we would stay at this high level of expenditure.  It depends a bit on the growth trajectory later on.</p>
          <p>Personnel costs, I think the increase that you have noticed had two factors in it.  One was a very rapid increase in infrastructure in the emerging growth markets.  In Sandoz, in Pharma, and the second element was a big increase in manufacturing, in particular in CIBA Vision and in Pharmaceuticals.  I think that personnel costs, or at least the head count gross, will slow down now a bit as a result of Project Forward too.  One of the reasons for Project Forward was that we saw that these personnel costs was not only in the areas where we wanted it, in sales or in manufacturing, but also in the overhead areas, and obviously in the overhead areas we will now try to break that cost or reduce it, and the savings that we have announced are to a large extent personnel-related.  US politics for healthcare reform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take that.  Obviously the US is a tough environment right now and we are working to operate in that tough environment.  We don't expect significant change, sorry, we do expect change, whether it's a Republican or whether it's a Democrat in the White House, and the changes that that will affect. There is still 40 million uninsured Americans, so if it's a Democratic administration there may be additional coverage for the 40 million, yet there may be more downward pricing pressure.  On the Republican side there may not be as much pricing pressure.  So, we are going to be able to work with whatever administration comes into the US, but we anticipate the US will continue to be a tough environment, and we are going to operate our business accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What may be somewhat beneficial is if the White House and Congress are of the same party, the majority of the White House, of the Congress.  So that there is not, healthcare doesn't become a permanent dispute between Congress and the White House.  But that, you know, we will see how it turns out.  First there and then afterwards Mr. Koch.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris Schott, Banc of America.  Just, first question is on Menveo, could you just talk a little bit about capacity, obviously the infants will be requiring multiple shots here.  Can you just give us some timing and magnitude of capacity you are planning associated with that program.</p>
          <p>Second with regards to Medicare Part D, just to get some more clarity heading into 2008 what are your expectations for that business, particularly from a pricing standpoint? And then finally on the generic side of the business, do you see further margin opportunities heading into 2008 on that front?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the process of establishing adequate capacities for Menveo.  Obviously, background of the question is shortages that some of our competitors have.  We are aware of the situation.  As I said, the infant indication will come a year later than the adolescent indication.  We do currently plan for sufficient capacities for both indications.  It will be more than 10 million doses, but I will not give you an exact number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the Medicare Part D question, we've got Alex Gorsky, who runs the US operation, and I would like him to talk about expectations around that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I think overall Medicare has been a success at least in the implementation of Part D.  If you take a look at the program itself, the long-term projections from the forecast have been reduced by billions of dollars.  The monthly premium for patients have gone down from an initial cost of approximately $35 to $25; and thirdly, if you look at the patient satisfaction where the consumers -- asking the consumers themselves, they are in excess of 80%.  So, I think it's a real example of the government working with private payers and bringing forward a very good solution.  So far, we've not seen what I would call extraordinary pricing pressure on Medicare.  We've got very good access particularly for brands like Diovan, where it's well over 90%.  You heard the figures earlier, which &#x2013; of over 52% even with our newly launched brands.  I think that's indicative of a number one ranked key account management team.  Going forward however, we'd expect there to be continued pricing pressure in the long run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And in terms of generic margins, we have achieved 14.5% this year, up from 7% three years ago.  We wanted 15 after three years, so here we are a little bit ahead of plan, adjusted now at about 20, which is above industry median.  And of course, we are constantly aiming for further improving profitability and also aiming to be above average industry margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Karl Heinz Koch from Bank Vontobel. I've got three questions if I may.  First of all, could you talk a little about the lumpiness of the big ticket items in pharmaceuticals, especially in R&amp;D where you mentioned an impairment charge and also in the admin and other expenses?  There seem to be some cost items which you haven't specifically mentioned.</p>
          <p>One, also, that may lead us to agomelatine.  I was wondering whether you could give us an update.  I think that was missing in the press release and also in the slides.  I was wondering whether the impairment charge might be related to agomelatine.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, Dr. Vasella, you mentioned the very attractive valuation of your shares and I couldn't agree more.  In fact, if I back out everything that is non-Pharma and benchmark that to peer groups or the market, the implied Pharmaceuticals valuation is actually one of the lowest in the industry.  And I was wondering whether, where you believe the market is missing something, is it really Pharmaceuticals or is it any of the other businesses?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the lumpiness of the big ticket items in the Pharma division.  If you think about the impairment line, obviously, Famvir is the majority of that, but there are a series of other smaller impairments that are included in that, which we don't disclose.</p>
          <p>In terms of the agomelatine, it is currently in Phase III, designed with the FDA.  There is really nothing new to report.  The Phase II data was positive, and so we are continuing to track the Phase III results and we'll be announcing Phase III results when -- James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the Phase III results are on track.  The two pivotal studies are on track for completion roundabout mid year and the longer term for the third quarter, then we have a proposal to file at the end of 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you see any side effects which are unexpected to the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the last time we spoke in September, the question came up, we do have liver function test abnormalities round about at 0.8% at the doses we study, which is similar to other drugs in this class.  But just talking about the overall environment of FDA, there are number of areas where FDA are scrutinizing very carefully.  The COX-2 market clearly was one of those.  The area of drugs in depression is another, which they look at very carefully, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, I can add just on -- sorry, I didn't interrupt, James.  Just on the lumpiness, that the items there, if you really look, you have the big one which is the Famvir impairment.  All the other items in the Pharma industry more or less net out, Karl Heinz. So you have obviously in there, the reversal of the Tekturna launch provision of 107 million.  You have in there proceeds from divestiture of tail brands and there's one of 171 million in sale of Tekturna shares.  So that's 171 million.  So if you take Famvir and these items it's more or less zero.  That's why we have not made a big noise about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I come back on that because I was specifically referring to Q4 because other operating, other expenses in fact, have been quite a bit higher than what I was observing the market was expecting.  I was wondering whether...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In there, you have the impairments of a series of early stage in-process R&amp;D intangibles that are mentioned by Joe.  And in there, you obviously have the big increase in the research and development expenditure for late stage projects.  Those two items explain the big variation in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you have any remarks about admin because I think you asked also about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But in admin, we have, apart from the reversal of this Tekturna inventory provision, we have nothing unusual.  And obviously, we have the Forward restructuring provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a big one, yeah. But it's a provision.  Raymund, I thought that you are much better suited to answer the question which Karl-Heinz asked, and addressed to me.  So basically, not only in the Pharma business do you get the pipeline almost for free or the research for free, but you are saying if you take a market valuation of the other businesses, then you see how long the Pharma valuation really is and what we have to say about it.  So this is a market question.  I think Raymund could take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, first of all, we all know that the market tends to overshoot in the positive direction and the negative direction. When it overshot very positively in 2000, we probably didn't believe it. I think now we are in a situation there according to my belief, the market is too negative on the industry, because all the negatives are noticed and all the positives are ignored.</p>
          <p>I showed in London in November in a presentation a chart where I took valuations by Lehman Brothers I think at the time, to take an outside view and not an inside view. And then we simply looked at our market capitalization and took out from the market capitalization the values for the non-Pharma businesses according to market ratios. We took out and then if you take out further the NPV of the in-market products, and the NPV of the visible pipeline, then you arrive at an NPV for the unvisible pipeline of zero. That means if you invest in shares, you get the unvisible pipeline for free.</p>
          <p>Now obviously these numbers are big ticket numbers and they have to be taken with a grain of salt, but I think for good pharma companies this is now the situation. Now you can argue there will be delays and not everything will come to the market and there is uncertainty in this invisible pipeline, but as long as you get it for free I would argue you shouldn't care, because for free it certainly has a positive value.</p>

          <p>For us, we are convinced that our portfolio has strategic benefits. It obviously, and we have shown data too in the past, it obviously has a financial diversification benefit, it can be shown that our data, for example, the volatility of the share is significantly lower than pure-plays and so on. So you have that financial benefit. But in addition to it, you also have the benefit of strategic synergies between those businesses. In manufacturing, in early research where you can transfer products from or a candidate from Pharma to Animal Health or in switch opportunities and so on, and these strategic opportunities synergies can only be realized in a portfolio that you own. And the minute you start breaking up the portfolio or placing parts of your businesses in the markets, you lose a lot of flexibility to realize these synergies.</p>

          <p>And we did, of course ask the question ourselves, focused versus diversified. What is the evolution?  And if you take J&amp;J, us, for example, Pfizer, Roche and you compare focused to two businesses, more than two businesses, you mentioned already the volatility, which is lower in the diversified businesses. If you take J&amp;J and us over the long term, if you look at TSR, we do marginally better even than the very focused ones in the analysis we did. So total shareholder return. So, if you look beyond what's just fashionable, and if you just look beyond what's short-term, then it doesn't seem to be really a disadvantage in performance, also not on, by the way, the income generation for whatever it's worth. Yes, in the front, and then middle left, second.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. Richard Foster from Bear Stearns. A couple of questions, if I may, returning to the costs in the fourth quarter. Just looking at the COGS ratio in Pharma first of all, the COGS for the, has gone down -- or gone up to about 17% in the fourth quarter despite the products, the lost products actually having a lower impact cumulatively over the third quarter, so the effect on the third quarter may be about 300, the effect on the fourth quarter, only 100. So basically, I'd just like a bit more color on how the COGS is developing. You say mix effects, but are there any other things in there?  And the same sort of question on Vaccines and Diagnostics. The COGS, again in the fourth quarter, is absolutely higher despite lower flu vaccine sales in the fourth quarter, might have expected that to come down. And then my final question on Prexige and following the withdrawal from a couple of the European markets and the approvable letter, I just wonder if you could update us on next steps for Prexige?  Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The COGS on Pharma in the fourth quarter were disproportionately high. There was a write-off also for Prexige inventory and for Famvir inventory in the fourth quarter which is one-time in nature. So you won't see that repeating.</p>

          <p>No, we don't disclose how much of that it is -- but just all of our margin assumptions have &#x2013; there was no surprise in the fourth quarter in terms of COGS. So for example, when you look at our forecast going forward, we will, once we get out from under that write-off, COGS will be at an expected level. Oh, and the Prexige update, Prexige as you know is now off the European market. We still market Prexige in Latin America. We still believe that the 100-milligram dose is a safe and effective dose and that 200 and 400 milligram are safe and effective for short-term use. So it's unfortunate. We're continuing to market the drug where it currently is available. And that's really all I can say.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as I mentioned before, we have a relatively stable base of standard fixed costs, that is one factor. Second, we are making significant infrastructure investments right now, for example in products like Menveo where we need to build infrastructure that we currently don't have. Third, we have the currency effect as well and the fourth one, we also had a write-off and that is related to influenza vaccines. As I said several times now, the season was weak, we had more vaccine put to use that we could finally sell and part of this is related to the write-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean, to say it in a very pointed way what you do basically produce as much as you can during the production season but you have no clue what the flu season will be. So, either you have the right amount or you have too little or you have too much. And if you have too much, then basically you have to write-off at the end of the season, because you can't sell the stuff after the season is over. And in the new year it's a different strain and so that's the game in this one. And therefore I think Menveo and other vaccines which are in the pipeline are so important because it gives a different kind of yearly usage and much more continuous utilization and better forecasting. First there, and then here on the right.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Paul Embers here from UBS. A few product questions. On your meningitis B vaccine, to clarify from your slide, to what extent is that a genomically derived vaccine with some IP around, either a gene or the antigens, which may throw up some barriers for competition?  Secondly, for Aclasta, with the recurrent fracture claim, are there any claims against mortality that are being sought there?  And then lastly, with your most recent data sets on Tekturna in terms of prescriptions, is there any information on Hypertension market segmentation?  Are any patients taking it differently than say, Diovan or other drugs?  Are we seeing use in some segmented population?  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can start with the Men B vaccine, that vaccine is covered by a range of IP applications for different aspects of the vaccine. Since the applications have not been, or the patents haven't issued yet I might not like to go any further, but it's several aspects. It's not just proteins or the process, et cetera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Aclasta, regarding the recurrent fractures claims, there is evidence that we, that there is a reduction in mortality driven by the reduction in fractures. And so, we will be pursuing that claim, in terms of specific claim for Aclasta. Regarding Tekturna, there is today no evidence that it is being used differently, but I will tell you that the overall cannibalization of Tekturna from Diovan is very low. So it's obviously very early in the life cycle stage of that drug. So as we get more and more data we'll learn more about specifically source of volume and specific segments. But, as of today, I would say no.</p>

          <p>Eric Le Berrigaud, Raymond James, five questions please. First three for Pharma, could you update us on Galvus, probably I misunderstood but I thought you were ready perhaps to give up in the US and that Galvus is still on schedule even for 2010. So, perhaps, can you update on that?  Second about Exelon, I guess, there is a generic that has been approved recently; do you think you are at risk of having Exelon in the oral formulation launch in the US this year?  And thirdly, perhaps a quick thought about the size of the sampling you may have had in 2007 for the big launches you had in the US, and when we could expect that to disappear in the course of '08?  One question about CIBA Vision, in the press release you mentioned two lawsuits, for the first one you say you are at risk of substantial damages, and on the other you may lost some royalties. Could you elaborate a bit more to give perhaps some size about what that can represent, especially for the second one, if those royalties were to disappear, is it something significant?  And finally, lastly you provided some numbers about the recurring amortization in the vaccines business representing 80 million per quarter, coming down to 60 million by the end of the decade. Could you provide the same kind of information for the Sandoz division please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with the Galvus question and a Galvus update, we do intend to launch Galvus in 50-milligram form in Europe in 2008 and continue to market it around the world where it currently exists. We have been asked by the FDA to execute a very, very large study and we at this point are looking at the certainty with which we would get FDA approval and balancing that against the cost of a very, very large trial. And so what we have decided to do is to step back from the US right now and to focus Galvus, ensure that it is a success in Europe, get additional data and at some point we may go back to the US. But we don't want to invest in a very large study unless we had reasonable certainty that we would gain approval for Galvus in the US.</p>
          <p>Regarding Exelon, Sun and Watson did file Paragraph IV challenges to our patent in the US. There was an announcement by those companies that we had reached agreement therefore they will launch prior to the expiration of the Exelon patent in the US but it wouldn't be any time soon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based upon the data that's available to us, we have not seen any excessive sampling with any of the launch brands in the United States. In fact on about 25% of the occasions, which is well within the normal limits that you see in the anti-hypertensive category, you see a patient get a sample only prescription, but we don't believe there is any excess at this time and we continue to monitor that very closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are two patent cases related around the SiHi technology. The first one involves one of the patents we have, the Nicholson patent where we have won the two first cases against two of our competitors, and now it's the third, the last remaining we have to take up. And obviously we have won the first two, so we are optimistic that we can win this as well. But, as stated in the press release, if we would lose then that would have an impact on the royalties we receive from the other two cases. The other one, it's a patent where &#x2013; a case where we got accused that we have infringed a patent, and this next major point will be end of the month, end of January. And obviously, if we would lose that would have an impact but because of legal reason, I don't want to comment and want to specify the financial impact now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have no clue. I mean we have no clue. And we don't believe we infringe, I mean that is the situation, we don't believe we infringe, the others believe that we infringe, so it goes in front of the judge. We have amortization, Raymund, why don't you take this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe give you a partial answer here, if you would want to have more details we would have to check the files. But, Sandoz in 2007 had a recurring amortization of $293 million and my view is that that number should continue for the foreseeable future, because it relates really to intangibles for products rights, core technology, trademarks and so on and the lives for these intangibles vary in between 10 and 20 years, on average 15 years. So you can take an impact to the Exelon deal and acquisitions mostly. So you can assume that this amortization will continue at the same level for approximately 15 years since acquisition. Obviously it will change, if you would make new acquisitions, then the number will be change, would have to be changed.</p>

          <p>Dominic Kunzler from Weise Bank. Firstly, could you give us a schedule for the share buyback of 10 billion?  Secondly, the figures of Consumer look a little bit strange to me, could you give us a little bit more color to that?  And thirdly, we have a very strong increase in intangible assets charges from 936 million to nearly US$1.6 billion, could you give us a little bit more color to that?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The schedule for share buyback, all I can say is that the timeframe is open. We have not disclosed and don't think we should disclose any share schedule there. The policy is unchanged that we will buy back up to 100% of free cash flow after dividends and after acquisitions, for &#x2013; we will use that for share buybacks. So obviously the level of share buyback depends on the dividend going forward, but it also depends on whether we have larger or medium or smaller-sized acquisitions because we would use first the free cash flow for our acquisitions. And for that reason, and for the reason that we don't want to hint to the market when we will be in the market in advance of that, we are not prepared and don't think we should give you a schedule.</p>
          <p>For the intangible asset charges you have in there two elements, recurring amortization and impairments. The recurring amortization, the increase from 800 million, 810 million to 1.091 billion, so the increase is not so large, and that is just the full year effect of the acquisitions that we have made. Impairment of intangible assets jumped from 126 to 482 million, we mentioned the biggest item impairment of Famvir 320 million. These impairments will always be a bit lumpy because they depend on the reassessment of these intangibles depending on how the projects are developing. So, the development project or if they are on the market and how the products fair on the market, whether we reach the targets or whether we have generic competition earlier or not, so it's very difficult to forecast these items.</p>

          <p>Well it seemed to be a rather a stable business there now you have an increase in Q4, sales increase of 30.6%. And the margin, operating income margin was 6%, of course, there were some forward points in it but it's, what's sustainable there?</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="a">

          <p>I think, the quarter was very much impacted by the end of 2006, there was a provision made in relation to the O2OPTIX recall, and in quarter four this year, we have basically had the restructuring provision for Project Forward. As a sustainable margin for such a business it's circulating between 15 and 20, and I would say, if you would exclude the items this year, it would be around 17% as a rough return on sales.

OTC didn't have such a strong finish because the cough and cold season this year was not as strong, so it was, those effects the average out. And I think if you would take, these markets are always growing mid single-digit, and we intend to grow a bit better, and the margin level is between 15 and 20%.

        <plist>
          <p>Maria de Mamies with Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. A few questions please, the first one related to write-offs flowing through the COGS line. I was just wondering, are we actually at the end now or could there be more write-offs flowing through in the first quarter of '08, because you were saying once we come out from under the COGS we'll return to normal level?  And then the second question relating to Galvus, I'm just a little bit surprised because I thought the worst case scenario had always been that you might actually need the outcome trials you are going to be doing anyway. So I'm just trying to understand what is it that the FDA could be asking on top of that that would require a huge investment on your part. And I completely understand if you don't want to comment in a lot of detail on Galvus, but I'm just trying to get an overall feel for where the FDA is going right now, how they are thinking? And the final question relates to M&amp;A in the non-Rx businesses. I was just wondering if you could maybe walk us through the individual components of the non-Rx businesses and walk us through the sort of order of magnitude of M&amp;A we could expect there and whether any specific negotiations are already ongoing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with whom.  So I'll take the easy question, the last one, which is obviously I'll not answer. Because I'll not answer as I don't want to give any hints or beliefs, and don't make an interpretation that this means we are in negotiations or we are not in negotiations. So it does just mean nothing. Having said that, I would say that we think, of course, strategically about it but also, opportunistically. So, we look what is available, at what price level does it fit, is it strategically right?  And there are a series of criteria which we use and looking at the track record we didn't so bad.</p>
          <p>On Galvus if I may, I will comment we were at the FDA, James Shannon and I, and have discussed the situation. We came out of the meeting thinking that, yes they want the very large study looking at safety, and if we do this study they might ask another study, and we were reminded a little bit of Prexige where they wanted to see if we had a side effect on the heart, and we didn't have a side effect on the heart. And then in the end, they said well, but the liver side-effects are too pronounced to give you approval, and despite the fact that we have much less liver side effects than, for example, with diclofenac, which is in the market and very broadly used.</p>
          <p>And so the question then came up, well, if the new therapy is much better than the old one because Prexige had 79% decrease in GI bleeds, isn't this a better therapy which you would approve. And they said no, history is not really the standard we are using. So that made us not terribly confident about going into something where we seem to be on moving grounds. And if we will get more clarity, and as Joe said more confidence that with a study then afterwards we would sense openness and interest then that would be a different story. We still believe it's a good drug. Meantime, we can also collect a lot of safety data from the other countries where we are launching. And maybe that this whole situation evolves and changes again as we move forward, and what you heard is really reflective of the current situations. And on the COGS?</p>

          <p>Okay. Yes, there will be centralized global product teams. When we use the word global product team, that is primarily in Basel, so there will be a &#x2013; and the word global signifies that we are talking about a globally marketed molecule. So central in Basel primarily with the functional experts also in Basel and some in the US. So, primarily Basel but some in the US.</p>

          <p>You have project teams. Project teams meaning a team of people from various functional expertise ranging from marketing to research, tox and what have you, DRA, they work together in bringing a drug forward from early development to registration. As you approach registration and you prepare for launches, you have a product team, which is the product manager centrally and then in the countries. There is a handover process which is happening. But then, Emmanuel Puginier who is here, who is heading Global Marketing, could explain to us what is strategic marketing, where does he see a role of global and where is the local team really responsible. And so while we are in development it's really global. Once you go in the countries it's being given to the countries and we check a few things &#x2013; do you want to comment, Emmanuel, just for understanding?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If you want me to elaborate on strategic marketing, which is the interface between marketing and development. Strategic marketing is based both in Basel and in the US. This is a team which is collecting customer insights, which is looking at the commercial potential of products which are in early development and interfacing with the development function to help profile the new compounds. And these people are partly in Basel and partly in the US.</p>

          <p>Regarding the flu sales, well I would feel much better if I would know whether it's the third quarter and the fourth quarter and how much it would be. I think in a normal year, you would expect most of the flu sales to happen in the third quarter. Normally, it would mean that the strains that are going to be used are known relatively early, that there's not too much change in the strains that are in the 2008 vaccine as compared to 2007 vaccine because then you know your yields, you know how the whole thing will work. But what we can already tell now is that for 2008, there is probably going to be significant change in the strains that are going to be used. We will have two new strains, if not more, which means everyone starts from scratch again, which means there is a certain risk that the overall production period will take longer, that the deliverables will be later. So then, the peak of the sales would shift in the fourth quarter. So it really depends on the period between February and May because then is where the production takes place and depending on how this works out, we will have either early sales or late sales. I really don't know.</p>

          <p>Yeah, the contact lenses is a market when a product is not available or has to be withdrawn, the competition will be benefiting from it. Unfortunately in 2007, it was the other way around. Competition was basically benefiting from the absence of O2OPTIX, which was not basically present significantly in the first half of 2007. And we are now basically regaining the market share we had before the withdrawal. So, our &#x2013; and that's one driver of our growth in contact lenses and the other driver is the new innovation, new product launches like dailies which we have &#x2013; the new dailies which we have launched at the end of the year in Europe.</p>

          <p>So breaking my principle, and there's one last question, and then please &#x2013; we will be around and please just come up and ask if you have something. Last question.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Just &#x2013; it's Richard Foster again from Bear Stearns. Just a quick &#x2013; two follow-up questions. One on the share buyback, I noticed, and this may be the language, but in the press release, there was no mention of up to 10 billion share buyback. It was just a 10 billion share buyback. So, could we just clarify maybe about &#x2013; on timing or something like that to do with the share buyback? And then the second follow-up, just on the &#x2013; on vaccines, on the flu vaccines. Given that 2008 looks like we may be moving into a &#x2013; certainly in the US, a situation of overcapacity for the vaccine &#x2013; for the flu vaccine manufacturers, what are you &#x2013; what are the key steps to ensuring that a potential write-off of flu vaccine is minimized that you will undertake?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's start with flu. Obviously, the most efficient measure is to sell as much as you have, then the write-off is little. So I'd like to come back to what I said before. No one knows how this season is unfolding and the exciting stuff about flu is that every year is different. So, if for example, we have a difficult year, production yields will not be at the level that we had last year, we may not have an oversupply in the US market despite the fact that we have new competition coming in. So, I would not a priori assume that it is a significant oversupply, it really depends on how the supply situation will evolve. Now, what we will change as compared to last year, we will open new channels for our vaccine to be distributed. We had last year, still the old Chiron approach which was very focused on the number of distributors. We will change this, we will go broader, and we hope that we will have a better reach out to more customers than we did have in 2007. So we will intensify our efforts there, and then we'll have to see how it evolves.</p>

          <p>On the share buyback, no, it's a 10 billion share buyback program, open-ended. But if you look at the history, we have completed all programs we had announced even if we did not give a timeline, for obvious reasons.</p>
