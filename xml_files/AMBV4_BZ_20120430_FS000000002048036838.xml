          <p>Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our 2012 first quarter results. Before getting started, I would just like to remind everyone that as usual the percentages discussed during this call today are both organic and normalized in nature, and unless otherwise stated, prospective changes refer to comparison with Q1 2011 results. Normalized figures refer to performance measures before special items, which are either income or expense that do not occur regularly as part of Ambev's normal activities. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I'll kick things off with a short review of all results for the quarter and then turn it over to Jo&#xE3;o, who will cover the main performance highlights for our Brazil, HILA-ex, Quinsa and Canada business units. I'll close by discussing our financials in a bit more details. So, let's begin.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, our consolidated EBITDA reached approximately BRL3.4 billion, which corresponded to 8.8% organic growth against the first quarter of last year. Consolidated EBITDA margin was 46.9%. If we break these results down by our three main divisions, Brazil EBITDA grew 5.9% organically with volumes up 4.8%, net revenues growing 6.8% and EBITDA margin at 50.4%. LAS EBITDA increased 22.1% while the volumes grew 3.2% and net revenues increased 23.8% leading to an EBITDA margin of 47.3%. And for Labatt, EBITDA grew by 7% mainly driven by the volume growth of 1.9% and a 5.4% improvement in net revenues, giving us an EBITDA margin of 34.1%.</p>
          <p>Normalized profits totaled amount BRL2.35 billion for the quarter, which represented an increase of 12.3% while normalized earnings per share increased 11.8%.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn it over to Jo&#xE3;o so he can give you some more color on the performance of each of our operations, as well as on the outlook for Brazil. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nelson, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter brought us high single-digit net revenue and EBITDA growth, where first we delivered volume growth at the upper end of the low to mid single-digit guidance mentioned on our March 8 release, led by the 4.8% growth in Brazil. Second, revenues grew ahead of volumes, helped by LAS and Canada <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:20) anticipated net revenue per hectoliter grew below the average for the year.</p>
          <p>Third on the cost side, COGS per hectoliter grew below inflation, thanks mainly to Brazil growing only 2.2% and as for our SG&amp;A growth of 10.5% on a consolidated basis, the timing of our sales and marketing investment strategy for Brazil had a relevant impact. And fourth, our international operations did well, with continued double-digit EBITDA growth in LAS and good news out of Canada overall.</p>
          <p>Zooming into our business units, today I'd like to begin with HILA-ex for a change. I believe they have earned it. As you may recall, in mid-April we announced our strategic alliances with the Le&#xF3;n family, the former controlling shareholders of Cervecer&#xED;a Nacional Dominicana, also known as CND, to create the leading beverage company in the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>The combined business will have approximately 37% market share in the beer in CSD markets combined for the Caribbean and roughly 42% market share for beer in the Caribbean. Presidente is a great brand with fantastic brand health indicators in the Dominican Republic, growing presence across the Caribbean and potential to expand even further abroad, especially in the United States.</p>
          <p>Ambev will own approximately 51% of CND beer following the acquisition of 41.76% stake in CND owned by the Le&#xF3;n family and an additional 9.5% in CND to be acquired from Heineken. The Le&#xF3;n family will remain as shareholders playing a key role in integrating and subsequently growing the combined business by leveraging our management expertise with their regional knowhow. We are thrilled about this strategic alliance and the value-creation opportunities it will generate. We believe it fits perfectly in our long-term strategy for the region and give us unparalleled scale to continue expanding the Caribbean and Central America, as we did back in 2002 in the Southern Cone of Latin America.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, top line kept improving in our existing HILA-ex operation with volume performing 4.7% or better due to industry growth and market share gains in some of our beer operations, coupled with the 10.6% of net revenue per hectoliter growth due to pricing.</p>
          <p>Now shifting gears to Beer Brazil. Overall, this quarter was about how best to leverage a better industry through our commercial strategy making the most out of Carnival season while speaking to our long-term priorities of innovation, premium, North and Northeast and with Carnivals. And I believe that on balance, we did okay, especially if one factors in the higher taxes that ate into our net revenue per hectoliter performance.</p>
          <p>Volumes were up 4% to a better &#x2013; due to a better industry and a 70 basis point of market share gain year-on-year. First and foremost, there was Carnival. This year, we decided to deliver a special Carnival for our brands and our consumers. Our plan involved a different prioritization of commercial expense on a quarter-by-quarter basis with higher sales and marketing investments in the first quarter of 2012. Two, for example, sponsor new events such as the Salvador Carnival in addition to our long-standing sponsorships of the Recife, Olinda and Rio Street Carnival. Second, changing our promotional calendar to enable us to take advantage of the positive industry momentum around Carnival. And third, creating new ways to connect with consumers by either using digital media to engage down in our roster of brand activation initiatives throughout the country or by launching specific consumer target promotion such as the Skol full year which took a group of Skol consumers to our sponsored Carnival event in Recife, Olinda, Salvador, Ouro Preto and Rio.</p>
          <p>We firmly believe that by providing consumers, we do unique and memorable life experience with their favorite brands will contribute a lot towards maintaining and/or improving brand health indicators in the long term. And the plan was executed flawlessly, thanks to our team. They did a great job indeed.</p>
          <p>In addition, our first quarter volume was supported by sustained positive momentum for innovation such as Antarctica Sub Zero and Skol 360 in the liquid front, which still have route expand and a promising growth of our international premium but in Stella Artios, but by the way can already found in the major cities in the North, Northeast and Midwest of the country.</p>
          <p>In terms of package innovation, the one-liter returnable glass bottle did great through a combination of slightly deescalating volumes of 2011 and increased distribution throughout the country.</p>
          <p>We are in the early stages of taking the 300 milliliter returnable glass bottle to selected markets, delivering our high quality preferred brands at attractive price points to the Brazilian consumer, particularly in the off-trade channel.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew only 2.1%, although increased price to retail mostly in line with inflation year-over-year. First, we faced a tough comparison with Q1 2011, which saw net revenues per hectoliter grow 11.7%. Second, we decided to our proportional calendar as part of our Carnival strategy to which I have already alluded. And third, we also got hit by higher tax accordingly when we compare year-over-year at the February level we were obviously impacted by the excise tax increase of April 2011 as previously mentioned and at the state level where our overall tax burden increased at a greater rate.</p>
          <p>Turning to cost expenses, Brazil Beer COGS per hectoliter declined by 0.5% in the quarter, thanks to currency gains from the implementation of our hedging policy and mainly due to the easy comps with the first quarter 2011, which was still impacted by the imported cans.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A excluded depreciation and amortization increase by 10.3%. Three main drivers were behind this growth: first, general inflation; second, the previously mentioned higher commercial expenses during the Carnival; and third, greater logistics pass, which results primarily from a combination of higher volume and more direct distribution.</p>
          <p>As a result, normalized beer business increased 6.4% in the quarter with gross margin expanding 70 basis points in the mid-to the margin expanding by 10 basis points organically. Now let's move to Brazil soft drinks and non-alcoholic, non-carbonated business.</p>
          <p>Here, too, we benefited from a better industry and also market share gains. Volumes grew 7.4% and we improved our market share performance by 40 basis points. Top performer was the Guaran&#xE1; Antarctica one-liter returnable glass bottle which continued its growth trajectory by solidifying its presence in the markets where it was launched last year and starting to venture into new markets in Brazil during first quarter.</p>
          <p>We are also satisfied with the performance of Pepsi, which did well mainly in the South of the country. Net revenues per hectoliter performance improved by 2.7% with higher federal excise and states VAT taxes, offsetting our price increase as was the case in beer.</p>
          <p>COGS per hectoliter however had really tough COGS comps versus the first quarter of 2011, growing by 12.9% mainly because of higher sugar and PET resin costs which were partially offset by gains due to currency hedging.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, SG&amp;A excluded depreciation and amortization, increased by 6.3% due to general inflation and higher logistics costs, impacted by 7.4% of volume growth. CSD and NANC Brazil EBITDA grew 2.8% within an EBITDA margin of 42.3.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Latin America and South, we delivered good top line performance in beer, with volumes growing 2.8%, while net revenues per hectoliter grew 17.7. In Argentina, Quilmes and Stella Artois gained market share in a growing industry, regarding Stella Artois in particular, it's a strong performance remain as an important source for volume, as well as profitability growth in the premium segment that continues growing, similarly the Chilean market presented very strong growth with the better brand continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Our strategy remains unchanged throughout the region, strong communication and support to our mainstream and premium brands, supported by strong innovation pipeline. Latin America and South CSD and NANC business increased volume by 3.8% due to the industry growth, but also driven by market share growth in CSD sports drinks and flavored water. The Twister non-carbonated flavored water has continued to perform well, delivering another quarter of volume growth and market share gains.</p>
          <p>Net revenue per hectoliter grew 26.7% mainly due to price increase to keep up with inflation, but also to partially offset the severe cost pressures coming mainly from labor and transportation cost, as well as commodities such as sugar and PET resin. Nevertheless, we're still able to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth in Latin America and South in both beer and soft drinks, while EBITDA margin at 47.3% for the region.</p>
          <p>And finally Canada, Labatt delivered a great top line performance to start 2012 with a 5.4% growth in net revenues, driving a 7% improvement in EBITDA, performance was driven through strong pricing evolution in the volume growth of 1.9% with domestic volume increasing by 3.6% and stable market share. The Canadian beer industry increased approximately 3.3% cycling 2011 performance and continuing the improving trends seen in the fourth quarter due to a favorable weather conditions and some recovery into domestic economy.</p>
          <p>Our leading brands in the country, Bud and Bud Light, maintain their positive trend momentum as we continuously invest heavily behind Budweiser and hockey with a number of TV programs, while Bud Light delivered very strong performance with growth in our regions.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, COGS per hectoliter decreased by 2.6% driven by lower industrial depreciation and better currency hedges and SG&amp;A excluding depreciation increased by 2.7% in the quarter, given increased spend sales and marketing. Looking ahead, as we enter the key summer selling period, we will be keeping &#x2013; we will keep investing behind our brands and work in better ways to connect with consumers by among other things bringing new and exciting news to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Before handing back to Nelson, I would like to update you on our outlook for the year in Brazil. We believe higher disposable income should help volumes grow in 2012 versus last year. It is a more balanced volume and price equation when compared to the past few years. As usual, many challenges lie ahead. The inherited risks to our business remain out there but in our view, the fundamental opportunities such as per capita consumption, they develop core premium brands and the North and Northeast continue to be there for the taking.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one of the most important things to keep in mind that management has to be ready to navigate in better times or through more turbulent waters which is what I believe we have been able to demonstrate in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Over to you, Nelson.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final portion, I'll go through the main items between normalized EBIT of about BRL2 billion and profit close to BRL2.3 billion as disclosed on page three of our release. Net finance results were BRL60 million negative, which is BRL14.5 million worse than Q1, 2011. Greater interest income and lower interest expense were more than offset by loss in derivative and non-derivative instruments as well as higher taxes on financial transactions.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate was 19.8% compared to 22.2% in the first quarter of 2011. And finally, our net cash position reached around BRL4.3 billion compared to BRL4.2 billion of net cash at the end of 2011. However, this picture does not include the BRL2.5 billion in dividends and interest on capital paid starting on little account and the additional BRL2.3 billion that should be paid in the second quarter in connection with the strategic alliance in the Caribbean, which would start to bringing us back to the leverage levels we were prior to December 2011 when we achieved the current level of the net cash position.</p>
          <p>We'll now take some questions. Mike, can you help us please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question we have comes from Lore Serra of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Jo&#xE3;o, there's are a lot of things going on in price per hectoliter and I just wonder if you could help clarify a couple of that typically we've seen your price per hectoliter in Brazil Beer go down sequentially in the second quarter and I guess if I look at it over the years, it's usually been a couple of points. But last year, it was more pronounced. So as you get into the second quarter, should we think about not having an impact from state tax resets, i.e., a more labeled pricing sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lore. I think this could be the best way to look into the pricing sequentially. Of course, when you look on a year-on-year &#x2013; I think there was a lot of confusion, when you look on a year-on-year basis, you know the biggest impact is of course the IPI or the federal taxes, because it was taken April. When you look on a sequential basis, that's where VAT had an impact and the potential that you had earlier surveys and things like that. So we continue to say that for the year, we will be in line with inflation and all things being equal, we could have a better sequential basis going into Q2 than on the other years because of this anticipation for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on a mix basis, I know you don't want to talk too specifically, but should we see a headwind from mix as you push &#x2013; put more effort behind the one-liter and 330 milliliter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you said, we are not going to give a lot of news on this, on detail. I think we continue to be in a country, when I talk &#x2013; when we talk about Brazil Beer where we see all of the different social classes gaining more income, okay, so there is opportunity for us both in the premium and let's say in the more affordable presentations. And I think we are in a unique position to take advantage of our premium portfolio and not really being complete with Original, Bohemia and now Budweiser and Stella, but also being able to compete also on more affordable presentations within one-liter and the 300 ml, so in a way this really let us to be excited about really having a good portfolio, liquid wise, packaging wise to take advantage of any opportunities that arise.</p>
          <p>The consequence will be mixed when you look on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:00) particularly depending on which one is growing faster, okay, and how the mix will play out in the different channels. So that's why it's difficult really to model exactly how things will be, but when you look on a net-net, just to finalize on the point we started, feel very comfortable with the net revenues per hectoliter in line with inflation, all things being equal, and on a potential better sequential basis for Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just very quickly, on the distribution expenses in Brazil, per the ABI disclosure, they're rising higher than volumes, is that &#x2013; I mean I know it's both because of more volumes and more &#x2013; I'm sorry more volumes and some higher costs, but is it more related to the volume impact or costs of transport going up in a more important way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also it's really a combo. I mean, we're not explaining exactly which one. You have to remember, one, of course. I mean at the same time that we benefit from a 14% minimal wage growth or a BRL7.5, this also impacts helpers and drivers in the transportation. Those are the ones actually more impacted by minimal wage growth. So labor is definitely a point.</p>
          <p>Overall inflation when you talk about fuel, it's important. Volume is important, but we cannot forget the mix innovation. Because as you're starting to have, let's say, Budweiser in selected cities throughout the country, as you have the 200 ml going to other places and we continue to expand innovation, remember that we took innovation from very little to very high digits in terms of our total volume. And the footprint continues to adapt to that as we continue to be successful in the innovation strategy because you always start producing them in one location and then you replicate in other regions of the country. It takes &#x2013; sometimes there is a delay until you take full advantage of the new footprint that is coming with the new investments that have taken place in the last 18 months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. My question relates to some of the margin pressure we saw on the quarter, you were specific about where you're seeing that from, whether it be in soft drinks in Brazil or Beer in Latin America South. I was just curious if some of these pressures, particularly in the first quarter, were more than you're expecting? And then just how should we think about the remainder of the year, return to better margins and some of these cost pressures getting a bit better as we trend through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we both heard this morning, I think when you look at Brazil Beer in particular, we do not see so much of that pressure. If you look at the EBITDA margin growing on a comparable basis, right, and we have a more of a hit on CSD. If I were to give an answer on the overall, I would say that if we put together the guidance of net revenue per hectoliter be in line with the inflation and cost of goods sold being below inflation, I think that combination on the gross margin. It's a positive one. So, you'd see, if we're able to deliver that, we're able to see gross margin expansion. And I think when you look in the lines between gross margin and EBITDA, many times there is a choice that you'll be making. I mean, there's of course the overhead and the distribution expenses, but there is also the sales and marketing.</p>
          <p>We feel that the pressure from sales and marketing in the first quarter, there is a component of phasing due to the strategy of taking full advantage of the Carnival. We have to remember how important is Carnival to Brazil and how that really fits the Northeast, North region strategy. Some of our competitors have built their brand health in the past 10 or 11 years around those, and we have the opportunity to take one of the most important events in Brazil which is Salvador Carnival. We didn't have a doubt for a second that we wanted to have that back. Of course that has an impact in the short term, especially in the quarter. It will yield return in the long term.</p>
          <p>We have already seen in the past three years very good momentum from brand health indicators, very good momentum from market share, very good momentum for per capita growth. So the main strategy the Northeast, North strategy is actually contributing above the average in all of those three indicators that I just mentioned. In this quarter and specifically, it paid its part, giving the Carnival its strategy. So, I would say that the combination of gross margin and then all those things that I mentioned in terms of SG&amp;A, you can do the math and I think it can be positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Lauren, it's Nelson. Just to complement on what Jo&#xE3;o just said, I think on the SG&amp;A side I think it's crystal clear that the choice we took in terms of sales and marketing spend. But on the gross margin impact and particularly the COGS outlook we give, as we said remain very committed and comfortable with our guidance of a full year COGS per hectoliter below inflation.</p>
          <p>I think what we saw in Q1 was in line with our expectation as part of the plan and at the same time we had a combination of declining COGS per hectoliter in Beer Brazil and that was mainly because of the easy comps versus the imported cans we had last year, still in the first quarter. And also better currency hedge is while for soft drinks mainly because of sugar and PET so commodity related, we had a particularly tough comp in Q1. But again that was part of the plan.</p>
          <p>So for the rest of the year, with the predictability we have and the visibility we have also given our hedging strategy, we are comfortable that we should have an improvement in CSD year-over-year, right, going down to low single digit growth instead of double-digit like we've had in the first quarter. While with beer, it should not be negative like it was this year as you're going to have some less favorable, if you will, aluminum, barley and FX hedge, so less everything in Q1. These two favorable less than in Q1, for the fourth we should have a total, let's say, below inflation growth at a COGS per hectoliter level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's really helpful. And then if I could ask one other question, you talk about this balanced volume and pricing growth this year, but we're obviously hearing about the potential for a further tax increase on beverages. So, I assume if that happens I don't know if you could comment on that and if does than that balance kind of goes away for this year, is that the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the balance between volume and pricing, it's something that we want. We think it's &#x2013; we always try to navigate in that manner. We were more skewed towards volume in 2009, 2010. We were more skewed towards price in 2011. And we want to be somewhere between the two.</p>
          <p>You're right, definitely the size of the increase that it comes will have an impact on our decision. If it's something that we can continue to find for what we think is the right balance and what actually we think is better for everyone, including the government, when we look at the long-term, great. Because then we invest more. If it comes, then we will first protect our profitability.</p>
          <p>I mean we already said that we move price in line with inflation, plus the tax pass-through. And second, if that happens, there will probably be an impact on volumes. And if that is the case, given our demand plan and the ability that you have to very quickly define what's the right footprint given the new pricing strategy, we will revise our CapEx for the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question is really a follow-up to what you were just talking about in terms of hedges. You are saying that aluminum and barley hedges get tougher for beer in Brazil later this year. But presumably the FX part of it becomes easier, especially if you went ahead and went a little beyond your limit last August and you hedge the real at the BRL1.50 BRL1.60 level, but I guess any color you can give us as well into what you've done so far for hedging 2013, given that we're almost halfway through the year, because I got the FX hedges are getting much tougher there and you're not getting the relief, that you've gotten in the past couple of years on the dollar price of the raw materials. So, any color you can give us as to how should we start thinking about 2013 and into the second half of this year, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jose. It's Nelson here. Well, starting for our 2012, as we said I mean for the year, we are going to have &#x2013; we have better currency hedge and no, right, we have everything locked for 2012 already. We will get some better quarters or there's not so bad, but in general, we are going to see &#x2013; we're going to have these upsides at the cost level. But on the other hand, commodities, be it aluminum, sugar, barley, of course, we had it at higher level than what we had in 2011. So, the net we are comfortable that you give us the ability to deliver COGS per hectoliter below inflation also into account for productivity improvement and all that we have as part of our SG&amp;A, right. So, we are very comfortable with that.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2013, I think well, it's kind of too early to give any sort of guidance. Of course, the hedging strategy remains the same. So, we are not deviating from that. You know it very well. And that should probably help you in terms of forecast, but we are not giving any specific guidance for 2013 yet.</p>

          <p>The next question we have comes from Alan Alanis of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you for taking my call. It has to do regarding dividends and the dividend policy in the month of leverage that you feel optimal now that you have announced the acquisition of the Dominican Republic and going forward. Should we expect any &#x2013; what kind of change, if any, we should be expecting on the dividend payout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan. Well, as we said we had a kind of unusual, if you will, net cash position since December last year. Of course, we reported the cash position right now, but that was I mean clearly associated with some of the movements we had and particularly with the acquisition in the Caribbean. Of course, it couldn't comment on that at that time first because it was not concluded, was still in the negotiation process. But now it's out there and we signed with CND. The whole idea was of course to close the operation. And as I said, with the dividend payment we just had early April, we should go back to the level of net debt to EBITDA that were, let's say, prior to December 2011 until September 2011, if you will, which is the sort of position we probably should see moving forward at least &#x2013; I mean consistent with what we had in the last three to four years, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So, basically, returning to that level of net debt to EBITDA, but at the same time if it's hard to say that you &#x2013; that we will continue to see the excess free cash flow beyond that level to be given back to shareholders via dividend, as you have been doing it for quite a while now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, that's what I meant. And we are of course in terms of use of cash after the investment behind the good organic opportunities we have, be it through CapEx and also &#x2013; I mean, looking at your other investment opportunities, we always have given the sort of free cash flow donation we have, we always have an important designation in terms of payout and we always maximize the interest on capital for the tax reasons and complement the total payout, given the sort of free cash flow generation. I would say no change versus what we were primarily doing or have been doing at least for the last three to four years. We don't speculate, let's say, future point decisions regarding timing or specific amount, but on a &#x2013; as a base case, we should see something similar to what we saw in the previous year. And as I said because of the acquisition in the Caribbean, we cannot deviate if from that for pretty much three or four months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And sorry I'm joining a little bit late in the call. I don't know if you already mentioned this or answered this question, but are we talking about labor cost in Brazil going forward? I mean an issue not only of 2012 with the minimum wage increase of 14%, but if we look into 2013 and 2014 we're likely to get what minimum wage increases in the very high single digits, maybe again double-digit or high single-digit, let's put it this way. Do you feel that the consumer in Brazil can take the necessary pricing for in order to offset that increased labor costs going forward? More of a long-term question, not only for the next quarter, but for the full year 2012 through 2014, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well let me start saying that for this year in particular given the minimum wage and we just mentioned some minutes ago about the impact on our SG&amp;A particularly on transportation cost where we have the drivers and the helpers let's say a more tied to the sort of a minimum wage salary and before this have an impact on our logistic cost and you know that this increase follows a formula right and since we had a high GDP growth two years ago, that was 7.5% predicts kind of a strong impact in 2012. If you look forward, I mean it's kind of easy to model if we view that it will be going back to 4% to 5%, that should &#x2013; which is a very interesting growth, right, that should ease just an expanded pressure coming for the minimum wage which is only for part of our labor force, right. That's also important to mention which if you think off payroll, it's not the number one or two item in our total cost and expense view, right, in which more exposed to commodities and less to labor and let that labor-intensive. So, that said we do not expect major pressures on our let's say financials and our first directional is always be to try to look for more, let's say, opportunities, to have further productivity, efficiency and then only as our last measure, if you will, to see what we need to offset via prices. So, it's not a strong concern, I mean, as part of our &#x2013; let's say outlook here.</p>

          <p>The next question we have comes from Alexandre Miguel of, Ita&#xFA; BBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Jo&#xE3;o. Good morning &#x2013; good afternoon, sorry, Jamel. My first question would be related to taxes. I know it's just to give any more visibility here in the case, but I was just wondering what's your base case scenario for taxation? Do you expect an increase this year or it will be only a yearly update of the reference price or you think there's also under discussion on increasing the tax burden for the beverage rent industry overall, just to get a better picture of what's going on if you can share with us that would be my first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandre as we said before, this new excise tax regime was implemented in 2009. It's possible that excise tax rise every year. With respect to 2012, we will not speculate on the report. I mean it's very difficult to read exactly what's going to happen. So I think what we can say is what I said before earlier &#x2013; a little bit earlier in the call is that we'll pass it through whatever it is to consumers. As a result, there could be an impact on volumes, and as well as in the love of investments. We hope that we see a number that makes sense, so that we can &#x2013; we rather see the business expand and invest more and create jobs and everything. But if it's not the case, if for the year we need to take some more, we will adjust our plans accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So my other question will be more related to working capital or may be to Jamel. We saw a reversal in terms of working capital gains, many on provisions and other payables compared to the gains you showed in the fourth quarter of last year. So if you can enter more &#x2013; a little bit more details if this new, I'd say, trend tends to be a better proxy in terms of payables turnover for these accounts or just discuss in more details what happened, whether I think it was BRL1.9 billion in high working capital needs in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's true. I mean, we saw this &#x2013; if you look at the evolution of our working capital and impacts on our operational cash flow, there was a decrease. It was many leakage payables and that was around BRL1 billion. So, instead of generating BRL1.1 billion, we had more of a BRL2 billion net impact of working capital in Q1 particularly in payable. So, that the delta was BRL1 billion. And this impact was mainly due to two things. I mean, there was a higher concentration of CapEx related payments, which as you know, they have a longer term and therefore they hit our cash flow in Q1 this year as opposed to Q4 2011 had a higher investment than before, higher concentration of CapEx payments with longer term. So, there was this &#x2013; there's a carryover towards Q1. And finally, there was an important impact of our later barley harvest and the full purchase, which providing payments made primarily in early 2012 rather than late 2011. You have to bear in mind that we buy in big pretty much in a short period of time our full year needs in terms of raw material, in terms of barley during approximately two to three months. And this time around, it was more skewed towards 2012. So the bottom line is that most of these downsides we have in Q1 is the opposite of the upside we saw in Q4 and now we say that we are more back to a normal level moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect, Jamel. If I may just one additional question on Latin America sales. You've just wondered, if you can give us some color on what you expect for volumes growth going forward, given any potential macro risks I think mainly in Argentina and expected economic deceleration in 2012? Should we expect maybe a deceleration in beer and soft drinks growth volumes for the region for the next quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I mean very difficult to anticipate any changes to be quite honest. You saw the results of the first quarter. They were very good. So, we have not seen any changes to the current domestic consumption levels, giving this sort of I guess instability that you are referring to. So, we don't have any news in terms of updates from what could happen from changes in the microeconomic center. That to be quite honest have not changed for the beverage industry so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon. My question is related to effective tax rate. It's down from 22% to 20% year-on-year. I want to know if it's related to the startup of the Pernambucu plant or if it's related to any issue. Nelson, you mentioned some tax on derivatives during the quarter. So just want to know if this is one-off or going forward, if you should see the effective tax rate going down year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, indeed &#x2013; hi, Gabriel. The effective tax rate was down versus last year, so Q1 2012 versus Q1 2011. And it was &#x2013; part of it was explained by a higher benefits from interest owned shareholders debt which is why the tax benefit we get from there and that could be slightly better than last year indeed. But then also, let's say, all the adjustments are related to income tax, which is are directly linked to the incentives we got from the investments we do. So, we are right. I mean especially when we invest in the north and northeast, there are some income tax incentives that impact our effective tax rate. So we saw a sort of &#x2013; or have an upside in this quarter. It's always difficult to look on to volume on a quarterly base because there are some shifts from one quarter to another and some easy comps you could take the effective tax rate on a quarterly basis for instance of last year we see some ups and downs because of some one-offs, but I would say the outlook for the year is indeed should be at least slightly below last year rate, bear in mind last year was around 22.4%. So, we should be below that, slightly below that, but that may vary on a quarterly basis. For instance, you have a tough comp in Q2, because of some of the one-offs you had last year, but again for the year which I prefer always to talk about the effective tax rate on a 12 months' basis, we indeed could be slightly better because of the &#x2013; maybe because of the incentives related to the CapEx we have been doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very interesting. And can you give us some updates on the Pernambucu plant and utilization and how everything is going on there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well, as we expected, I mean we see the volume went up, I mean, efficiency growing. So, it's coming in a very important moment for us. I mean you know our focus on the North and Northeast and this footprint improvement not only in Pernambucu but all the investments we did in the region. Last year, we had important expansion in four other plants we have in the region is giving us the flexibility to continue growing this region, which is a region that is growing above the national average.</p>
          <p>We still have our market share opportunities with national average as well, although have been closing this gap. So, we are very excited with the opportunities there and again footprint  improvement is a key element and Pernambucu plays an important role. This has everything to become the second biggest plant in our entire footprint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, got it. And your effective tax rate, your tax rate benefit linked to the sales you have in the Northeast or to the investments you made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's triggered by the investments, but is proportionally to the profits who came in the region. So as we grow in the region, of course, profits will grow, but incentives should grow together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. So my first question is on the market share gain in the Beer division in Brazil, which was pretty impressive at 70 basis points. So I just wonder if you could provide some more color on what drove this gain in terms of regions or brands or even how the premium segment affected this on a consolidated basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's much more related to the mainstream business, given just the size as you know the premium segment is &#x2013;  it's a small segment so to get that sort of market share gain. It will be always 90%-plus in the next &#x2013; it happens right now into the next few quarters given the size. What I think is interesting to say is that we are seeing most of our competitors to fall, the price increases on a faster pace for whatever reason and any time that happened, given the good job done by the sales team in terms of executing well and better execution in the off-trade and the on-trade channels as well as the brand health indicators that actually continue to be at very high levels, any time you decrease on a faster pace the discount that our brands have to our competitors' brand you will see us diminishing the gap between our market share and our preference levels. And that's exactly what happened in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just coming back to that COGS over hectoliter discussion that we had in the previous questions. So, just want to &#x2013; if you could provide some color, how you see that going throughout this year. I understand that you're keeping your guidance of lower than inflation cost per hectoliter growth, but I was just wondering how you see that involving the second, third, and fourth quarter of the year? Because if you look at how sugar prices or the commodity prices were a year ago, I was just wondering if that could affect the second quarter in a negative way, even considering the FX rates? I just wanted to see how you see that curve evolving throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we &#x2013; well, hi. It's Nelson here. Well, we have a very good visibility on our COGS outlook given the hedging strategy, right. I mean it's bigger. The predictability, I would say, is beginning in beer, because we have a hedge for aluminum, for barley for dollar of course. And we will see also, given the easy comps that we had primarily beginning of last year, that in beer we should see COGS per hectoliter as I said instead of going down half a point that we saw in this quarter, it should grow as the year progresses and also given the sort of commodities curve that we had in the market last year. While in soft drinks because of the timing of VAT in mainly sugar hedges, we have, let's say, a short &#x2013; let's say three to four months visibility. But knowing what we know for sugar hedges, we should see the other way around. While in beer COGS per hectoliter is going to grow more along the year, in soft drink it should go down. We had for instance &#x2013; we had a particular tough comp in Q1 but then you are going to have easy comps in Q2, that has to do with the timing of the hedge that were made. So far, you might expect CSD COGS per hectoliter to be right now the double-digit growth right adding Q1. But for the half year, we already expect it to be pretty much a mid single-digit given the Q2 is a comp you have.</p>
