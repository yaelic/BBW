          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our 2009 interim review. The first six months of the year have been challenging. In E&amp;P, with oil prices down 53% year-on-year, production was affected by OPEC cuts and force majeure, while in Gas &amp; Power, the economic downturn hit gas sales. Despite these challenges, we have achieved sound financial results with &#x20AC;6.3 billion of adjusted operating profit, &#x20AC;2.7 billion of adjusted net profit, and &#x20AC;7.6 billion of cash flow from operations. In the context of an uncertain macro environment, I intend to propose to the board an interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.50 per share which reflects ENI's prudent approach to the short-term challenges.</p>
          <p>During the first six months of the year, we made good operational progress across our businesses, consolidating our long-term growth prospects. In E&amp;P, we developed our portfolio further, and we have had that 300 billion boe of new resources through successful exploration activity. A significant contribution comes from discoveries in Angola, Gulf of Mexico, Indonesia, Pakistan and Brazil through Galp. This was achieved amidst a 30% reduction in exploration expenses year-on-year.</p>
          <p>In the same period, we have added 21,000 square kilometers of new acreage to our portfolio, which will sustain our reserves replacement. Amongst this new acreage is the Barnett Shale formation which we acquired from Quicksilver. This alliance will promote technical exchange particularly in drilling and completion technologies in unconventional gas shales. In Gas &amp; Power we completed the restructuring of the regulated business and the integration with Distrigas.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Alessandro for the second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the second quarter of 2009 the Brent price showed an increasing trend averaging $59 per barrel, down 52% compared to the second quarter of 2008. The European refining margin averaged $3.6 per barrel declining by 55% versus the corresponding period of 2008. Finally, the euro showed a depreciation of 13% versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to remind you that ENI's results are affected by several issues including the seasonal factor affecting the demand from natural gas and petroleum products use for residential heating, the demand for which is highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter. Therefore, ENI's operating profit and change in net debt in the first six months cannot be extrapolated for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the results, adjusted operating profit in the second quarter totaled &#x20AC;2.5 billion, down 54% year-on-year. This result mainly reflects the lower contribution of the Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing divisions. Adjusted net profit in the second quarter declined by 60% to &#x20AC;902 million as a result of a weaker operating performance and of the lower contribution from equity-accounted entities. These negative factors were partially offset by the lower adjusted tax rate.</p>
          <p>As far as the Exploration and Production division performance is concerned, hydrocarbon production in the second quarter decreased by 2.2% compared to the same period of 2008, averaging 1,733,000 boe. The decrease is due to the OPEC cuts, 29,000 boe per day, the force majeure events which occurred mainly in Nigeria in overall 34,000 barrel per day, weaker European gas demand, and the mature field declines. These negatives were partially offset by the production ramp-up in Angola, Congo, Gulf of Mexico, Egypt and Venezuela, as well as the impact of the production shares agreement around 60,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Second quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, down 58% compared to the second quarter of 2008, mainly as a consequence of the lower hydrocarbon realization prices denominated in U.S. dollars and the lower production sold. These negative elements were partially compensated for by the depreciation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>As for the Gas &amp; Power division, overall gas volume sold in the second quarter of 2009 including both consolidated and associated companies decreased by approximately 8% year-on-year, totaling 19 billion cubic meters. This decrease is due to the lower volume sold in Italy as a consequence of the economical slowdown partially offset by higher international gas sales reflecting the Distrigas acquisition and the robust sales in several European target markets despite the weak gas demand.</p>
          <p>As for the Gas &amp; Power division adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;690 million, up 10% over the same period of 2008. The increase reflects the higher contribution from the marketing in regulated activities partially offset by the lower results in international transportation.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the second quarter of 2009 amounted to &#x20AC;821 million. This compares to &#x20AC;806 million in the second quarter of 2008. Marketing segment result increased by around 8% as a result of favorable scenario related to euro appreciation versus the U.S. dollar and a positive trend in energy parameters.</p>
          <p>Certain operating expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2008 related to a claim filed by the authority for electricity and gas which reverted a favorable tariffs regime on electricity productions as well as the Distrigas consolidation. These positives were partially offset by the lower gas volume sold. The regulated business generated &#x20AC;301 million, up 12% versus the second quarter of 2008. The increase mainly reflects the higher contribution from distribution activity as a result of the revision of the tariff mechanism that has moved the seasonality of the business. Finally, international transportation declined versus the second quarter of 2008, as a result of costs incurred to repair the TMPC pipeline damaged in an accident which occurred last December.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Refining and Marketing, utilization rate declined by 12% year-on-year, as a result of the weak demand and higher maintenance activity. The second quarter accounted for an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;106 million compared to an operating profit of &#x20AC;97 million in the same period of 2008. This result reflects significantly weaker refining margins mainly as a result of the narrowing of the differential between light and heavy crude. This reduction was partially offset by the depreciation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate. Marketing performance improved, reflecting higher retail volume sold in Italy as a result of increased market share. These positives were partially offset by the lower volumes sold to wholesalers.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2009, the Petrochemical business posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;146 million due to the very weak volume and margins. The Engineering and Construction sector, the second quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;297 million versus &#x20AC;253 million in 2008. The increase is attributable mainly to higher result in the offshore drilling and construction business lines. The Other Activities segment reported an operating loss of &#x20AC;73 million and finally corporate activities have posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;117 million, due to higher insurance cost, expenses related to the bond retail offering as well as increased ICT and research and development cost.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2009, operating activities generated a cash flow of &#x20AC;7.6 billion. On top of this, disposals and the Snam Rete Gas minority shareholder capital increase contributed around to &#x20AC;4.8 billion bringing the overall cash generated to &#x20AC;12.4 billion. The cash flow generated financed CapEx of &#x20AC;6.8 billion, acquisition cost mainly related to Distrigas minorities for overall &#x20AC;2.4 billion, and dividends of &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Other uses absorbed &#x20AC;800 million and they brought the overall cash outflow to &#x20AC;12.4 billion. Net financial debt as at the end of June amounted to &#x20AC;18.4 billion and the debt to equity ratio slightly decreased to 0.37 when compared to 0.38 of year-end.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now I hand you over to Paolo for his closing remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In conclusion the industry as a whole faces challenges from the economic downturn which may result in renewed oil price weakness and which will continue to depress gas demand and put pressure on refining margins. The outlook for the near-term remains highly uncertain. In this context ENI will continue to leverage on its strategic strength. The E&amp;P division, a healthy pipeline of projects is coming on stream over the remaining part of this year. In Gas &amp; Power, despite weak volumes caused by the economic downturn, we will deliver a stable result year-on-year. Our small downstream exposure means that the negative impact from this sector will be relatively limited.</p>
          <p>Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to invest for growth in the long-term interest of our company and shareholders while maintaining firm financial discipline and ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong. This approach leaves ENI well-positioned to achieve continued growth and equips us to overcome industry challenges.</p>
          <p>We will now be pleased to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question from Mr. Alastair Syme from Nomura. Mr. Syme, you can now proceed with your question. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Can I just ask on &#x2013; relating to the dividend about the rationale for capping it? Is it something to do with the structure at the holding company level? And obviously you present the accounts on a consolidated basis, but now with the move to the storage assets <mark type="inaudible" />, would it be more helpful to present the accounts on a go-forward basis looking at the holding company level? Is that the way we should be considering it, do you think?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandro will answer this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The restructuring of the regulated business will not generate any particular impact on our earning generation. But because what we &#x2013; what will be lost at the bottom line level as a consequence of the fact that 45% of Italgas and Stogit will be attributed to minority. Minorities reflect only a very, very limited amount because we &#x2013; for 2009 we have &#x2013; our estimate is in the region of &#x20AC;80 million, so absolutely negligible amount. So the restructuring of the regulated business will not upset our dividend strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you happy that the rating agencies can see your credit rating in the same mind, look at a consolidated company, or do they look at the holding company do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; since the restructuring will not change the scope of consolidation, I mean we will continue to consolidate on a line-by-line basis as Snam Rete Gas as well as Italgas and Stogit. So the restructuring and the sale of Italgas and Stogit to Snam Rete Gas has not modified the positive attitude that we have vis-&#xE0;-vis of the rating agencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask one supplementary to Paolo as well, just in terms of the way that the dividend policy is being set for the interim. Should we take it on a go-forward basis that the dividend will relate to the net income in a given year? Is it going to be very variable from here on in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Of course, dividend is very much a question of judgment. We thought that considering the uncertainties in the economic environment, we would like to take a prudent approach. What I would like to add to this that it is certainly not part of our strategy today, it will not be part of our strategy tomorrow to distribute reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. On the timing, could you enlighten us to &#x2013; you are making any progress on disposing of any of your assets? And if not, do you see the second half environment as one in which you take down some more capacity? There's one question on refining.</p>
          <p>On Russia, now that you &#x2013; now it's clear what the situation is as regards what assets you have for the future. Can you remind us what your development plans are for the remaining assets that you have there?</p>
          <p>And I guess just coming back to the dividend, which probably won't be the last question on it. With respect to the statements that you made earlier in the year as regards how we should go about calculating the payout, can we just take that, is that still current that you will not go above 100% with a caveat that you &#x2013; with your last answer that you're not going to go above a 100% payout ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me quickly tackle the first question about refining. Now, we continue to have a pessimistic view of the future of refining margin in the Mediterranean. And therefore, we keep our view that investments &#x2013; CapEx in refining should be limited and the disposal of Livorno is still on the agenda. We are running a process of sale of this refinery. By the way, this refinery is not losing money today. So we are not losing actually money. But we certainly want to reduce our refining capacity in a market which is going down. Petroleum products are down, both in Italy and in Europe. We are confident we hope that we will receive an offer which satisfies our request for the Livorno refinery in the next couple of months.</p>
          <p>On Russia, we have closed the famous Gazprom Neft question quite satisfactorily, I think, and now we are left with our share in what we call synched which are the assets in the Yamal Peninsula of Arctic Gas and Urengoil. We are &#x2013; we will continue to develop this field for which we expect to have the first gas in -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; June 2011. As far as the CapEx which will be required from now to the first gas, we are in the region of two billion more or less.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's less than two billion.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less than two billion, 100%, 100%, since we have 30% of it, we should expect to be investing in order to achieve the first gas something in the region of 500, $600 million, not euros.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We will take the final decision at the end of the year &#x2013; at the end of this year. As far as the dividend is concerned, yes, I want to reiterate that we do not consider now and in the future to distribute reserves because we maintain that the major target that we want to achieve is to grow. Now to grow at the same time to distribute our reserve would be a contradiction.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we will continue to pursue our target in terms of cash allocation. So first, we want to protect a rating which is solid, strong, and which will allow our company as we have done in the last few months to go in the market and raise funds easily at a competitive cost. We want to continue to invest.</p>
          <p>You have seen that we confirmed our CapEx with a slight increase for this year. And finally, we look at our dividend as a way of rewarding our shareholders, but we certainly don't want to jeopardize our growth prospectives.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just clarify then as regards to comments you made on the Q1 conference call about the method of calculating and targeting a superior yield, would you say they -</p>

          <p>&#x2013; still stand? Does the target of a superior yield, and all of those comments still stand with the caveat that you're not going past the 100% payout or should we be just rebasing our expectations completely here that we're not really going to go in there for superior yield?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we still target a superior yield in &#x2013; we target a superior yield as we stated. Therefore with all the clarifications we made in the past few months, having in mind that this is the third of our objectives. So, we would be able to pay a superior yield as long as we would be able to protect the strong credit rating and finance all our CapEx.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I hope you can hear me this time. My question is just related to the comments you make in other information about legal proceedings. And I wondered if you could just spelled out for us, what do you think potential payments made during the second half of the year related to that whether or not you intend to appeal them. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, of course, when we speak about this litigation, this kind of litigation is not easy to make forecast, neither in terms of the amount of money it will cost us, nor in terms of the timing in which all these events will happen. In any case, we expect developments in some of these pending legal proceedings in the second half of the year, mainly as regard possible antitrust inquiry of the EU Commission on our international gas transport operations and the proceedings relating to Snamprogetti's participation to the TSKJ consortium, as better we said in our interim report. I have to say that under the present circumstances, the company is in no position to make a reliable estimate of the loss provision associated with these proceedings also considering the numerous elements that may concur in determining their amounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You &#x2013; but you are expecting to make a fairly significant payment, are you not in the second half in relation to these?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say, it's not very easy to say what is significant. We are expecting that possibly one, two of these events, mainly the two, I've been mentioned, might in the next five or six months come to an end. Now what it is significant is very difficult to define?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But more than &#x20AC;1 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would think less, but of course it does not depend from us, or rather it depends how we want to close some of these issues. Let me just make you an example on the EU Commission on our international gas transports. We are somewhat in a squeeze between a rock and a hard stone. In the sense that we are reasonably confident that we close with no fine &#x2013; no fine, zero fine, if we divest from our TAG pipeline, the TAG gas pipeline which links Italy to Russia. On the other hand, the Italian government does not want to do a divestment of this pipeline which regards as strategic one for the country.</p>
          <p>So we are somewhat in a bind because we don't know exactly what to do. I'm personally hopeful that we will find a reasonable compromise with the EU Commission, which we will start discussing in September. But, of course, this is an issue which is very difficult to quantify. As far as TSKJ consortium, I think, you might have some indication about a potential compromise looking at the numbers that Halliburton has been saying, and considering that Halliburton was the head, the leader in the consortium.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, guys. It's Iain Reid from Macquarie. On your production forecast 2009, I think I saw some headlines this morning saying that after the impact of the OPEC cuts, you are expecting to see some &#x2013; a small growth rate of between 0.5 and 1%. I wonder if you could tell us what &#x2013; how that's influenced by your assumption over OPEC reductions and also the PFC positive effect which you're expecting this year, because it seems to me that using your relatively low oil price forecast have given you quite a lot of benefit in terms of the PFC effect? I'm interested to know also what you are seeing in terms of the OPEC effects for the full year. That's the first question.</p>

          <p>Talking about production in the second half, I think, the PFC effect is always in the region of 1,000 barrel per dollar, so remain constant. And the growth that we expect is without considering the up quarter, in considering the Nigeria situation as usual, so no growth at all. And considering &#x2013; and still a restriction on the gas demand can bring us to an increase of our production of about 1%, so that is confirmed.</p>

          <p>Okay. Could I ask another question, sir? I wanted to ask really the second question at the same time. I think, you said in the last quarter, you're expecting overall EBIT for the gas and power business to be similar to last year. Is that the case for the full year still?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's for the full year. Let's say, we expect this year the gas and power pro forma EBITDA of the division, therefore including the regulated assets in the same region than last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>EBIT probably, yes, as well. I mean, no different. As you know as far as the trading activity of the gas and power division, EBIT and EBITDA are essentially identical because there is no CapEx. And for the regulated businesses depreciation remains the same.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Jason Kenney from ING. Just going to go back to the dividend, if I may. I probably won't get an answer to this, but I'll ask anyway. Are you building your war chest by any chance, because you got positive cash balance at the moment and the cut in the dividend was probably more than you had to do to keep that yield commitment, or is there some strategic thing that maybe we're missing, maybe renegotiation of gas contracts later in the year or something like that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Kashagan, I think, it was the CEO of KazMunaiGaz, who said earlier in June that he wanted to cut development costs there by 30%. I was just wondering what flexibility is there to cut costs for Kashagan at this time and what is the outlook for Kashagan going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the first question, and then I will pass it over to Claudio for the second one. No, no war chest, or rather we want to keep ENI with a balance sheet which will allow us to continue to pursue our growth strategy. So our decision around dividend is a combination of a prudent approach in very volatile times, which are the times we are living today, combined with the desire of having a balance sheet which a growth company should have. Claudio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Talking about Kashagan, that's true. As a result of the downturn in the global economy, the KMG and the Kashagan consortium decided to take strong action to reduce cost. It's clear that we want to reduce cost without impacting on security around the HSE and the rest. We never talk about reduction of the experimental phase budget. We try to optimize. So there is no new budgets at all. And this reduction is going to impact mainly on the second phase, because in the first phase all the main packages &#x2013; all the main contract has already been awarded.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's Gordon Gray, Collins Stewart. You talked about the measures you're taking to ensure your gearing is adequate to sustain your current credit rating. On the dividend, obviously part of that comes around the issue of cost reduction. Maybe you can just give us a little bit more information on current progress on costs in the year-to-date, and in particular what you see the potential is for taking costs out of business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me first qualify a point. We are not saying that we want to protect our present credit rating. What we said is that we want to preserve a solid and strong credit rating, which could not &#x2013; could be also a notch lower what we have today. So we consider that. Of course, we would prepare to keep the AA minus, which is the rating we have today, but we will not regard an A plus as a something that we &#x2013; at any cost we refuse to have.</p>
          <p>In any case, we believe that a prudent approach in terms of dividend in these difficult times will also flag to the rating agencies that when we said that dividend comes after a solid credit rating accomplished, we really mean it. It's not just a question of talking, but is a fact.</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; and more specifically on the cost savings, you might remember that we defined a cost reduction plan of &#x20AC;2 billion in the period 2006, which was the beginning of our plan until 2012, which is the end of our planning period. Today, we are at 1.2 billion, so we are progressing well and we are confident to reach the two billion by 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Can I ask two more questions related to dividend? Firstly, if the second half of the year proves to be a repeat of the first half of the year, would you expect to repeat the dividend? And secondly, if &#x2013; we were currently assuming a $48 Brent price. If the Brent price proved to continue at around $70 versus currently, would you therefore expect the dividend to be higher at the final stage than at the interim stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now let me try to answer your first question in this way. Now first of all, we will take the decision about the second half dividend sometime in February, possibly in the first half of February. At a moment in which we'll have in front of us the results from 2009 finals, we will have maybe &#x2013; maybe some results of extraordinary litigation that we have been mentioning few minutes ago. And we will have in front of us the plan for 2010, 2013. So we will have in front of us elements which today we don't have.</p>
          <p>At that time, I would propose to the Board a dividend &#x2013; a final dividend which will reflect a prudent approach which we want to keep. At the same time, I would like reiterate, we'll certainly not imply distribution of reserves. Now if the scenario you are making that is we'll have a result net similar to the result we had in the first half, the possibility of repeating the same dividend that we pay today is very likely considering all the rest I've been telling you so far. As far as the Brent price is concerned, yes, of course Brent price is quite important in our forecast, I mean, what happens to our result. But it's not the only one element we have. The conditions of other markets, including refining, including the gas market are also relevant. And therefore I would suggest that the best answer to your second question is the answer I gave you to your first question.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. A question, what was the methodology behind your calculation of &#x20AC;0.5 per share for the first half. And I'd like to that &#x2013; I'm still not quite up to speed on what the new dividend policy is. I hear what you say about ramping up reserves. But is there &#x2013; a payout bind, is 0.5 per share, is that a new floor for dividend payout? I just simply don't understand this high dividend yield aspiration, is that not tantamount to wishing for a lower share price? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well, let me try to be a little more precise on that. Now, first of all, ENI never declared any specific dividend policy. I'm talking the last 10 years. It only reiterated that it wanted to be generous with its shareholders. And in fact we have been generous with our shareholders, particularly as far as dividends are related. Because just as a reminder, until last year nobody was really talking about payout or dividend yield, but everybody was talking about cash back to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Because in fact, the buybacks were so relevant that only comparison which included buybacks could really make a meaningful comparison. Now we &#x2013; coming back to what we said that we wanted to preserve a strong credit rating first, finance CapEx second, and pay a superior dividend yield, third. We consider that &#x20AC;0.50 was complying for the time being with all three of these objectives. Because if you look at what it means, &#x20AC;0.50 for one semester considering with a share price on the 13th of February of 2009 which was our base point, you will see that we are more or less complying with all three objectives that we set in our cash allocation.</p>

          <p>You say that about the dividend policy but in the '07 20-F, you did say subject to caveats, of course, that the intention was to pay to shareholders yearly amounts of dividends in line with the level of fiscal year '07 in real terms.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Maybe at that time we knew what the results for 2008 was already &#x2013; I mean we had an idea. Those times where much less volatile times than we live today, so maybe at that time this was the rationale behind such a declaration.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But is &#x2013; can the 0.5 be seen as a floor now or is that too strong a statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't define it a floor. In both ways I would take &#x2013; as I say, we will take the decision on the &#x2013; I don't know, 10 of February, 11 of February when we will have in front of us all these elements which we consider extremely important to protect the solidity of the rating of our company and our CapEx plan. On top of that, at that time we will have in front of us and we will present at the same day our plans and maybe at that time we will present a dividend policy which will be built around the plan that we will present.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for that. Just a final question. The strategic implications of this, so should this imply that perhaps in future periods that the gearing ceiling will be reduced assuming this volatility in the operating environment might continue, might be better <mark type="inaudible" /> gearing or perhaps phasing CapEx, or CapEx in individual years might be somewhat lower. Are those types of strategic things that can fall out from this change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see I think we are quite happy with our, say, 40% debt-to-equity ratio in this kind of region. 40 can also mean 36 or 44. We are not looking at a very precise number. Considering, the most of our peer group has a lower debt-to-equity ratio, but most of our peer group does not have the solidity of our results which are based on &#x2013; particularly on our regulated businesses which provide a very solid ground to our results.</p>
          <p>So 40%, it is equivalent to a 30 or a 32% of some of our peer group simply because with this regulated portion of our results. For the rest our strategy remains the same. We want to continue to be a growth company, growing more than our peer group. We will continue to develop in particular our Gas and Power division. And while will continue to remain a small player in Refining and Marketing, and we are quite happy to be small in this difficult times which we do not see improving in the short term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon, gentlemen, just two questions if I could. Firstly on chemicals, contrary to some of your peers, you've remained in the red in chemicals in 2Q and you've actually shown no improvement versus the fist quarter. Was there anything unusual about 2Q and what can you do about this? Were there any structural disadvantages that will take time to be fixed?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you give us a flavor of what projects you expect to get to FID in the next year or so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let me comment on chemicals. I think I have to be a little long. I could not give you a short answer, but maybe it's worthwhile that we touch this part of our business, which normally is somewhat neglected, no. And that today it pops up because the results are particularly bad.</p>
          <p>Now, our chemical business which is a European business, but is largely an Italian business, has some structural &#x2013; some structural problems. One follow a part of our production is competing with gas-based chemicals while we start from virgin naphtha. And, of course, when you are competing with gas producing countries which produce chemicals on the spot, you are in a very weak position. We know that the position is weak and that's the reason why from a few years we have been reducing these businesses, closing down inefficient plants, reducing costs, and we have been quite effective at that because this part of our business in the last five years has been generating cash, not consuming cash.</p>
          <p>Now all this until the crisis of the second half of 2008 and 2009 and this business has been badly hit because volumes have been down by something like 20, 25% in tons, something that nobody has seen before. And our business, as most of the other chemical businesses in Europe and in the world, have been suffering dramatically. I have to say that we expect &#x2013; we have seen some positive signs in the last few months to the point that we expect that this business in 2009 as a whole will be better than 2008, since the second &#x2013; the first half has been very bad you can see that we expect to come out from the dramatic situation in which we have been in the last 12 months quite quickly.</p>
          <p>So this is how we perceive our chemical business. The &#x2013; our strategy has not changed. We wanted to reduce our prices, cut down production which are inefficient and improve this business for the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions please. Sorry to belabor the point, but I just need to clarify the definition of superior yield. I think you talked in the about the share prices of 13th February, of yourself and your peers, prospective dividends. And one thing I just wanted to really get clarification on, was when you say superior is that you being the top one, two or is it top one, two, three?</p>
          <p>The second question is your outlook for the oil price seems very cautious. It is implied around $44 per barrel for the second half of the year. Can you say whether you considered hedging in increased portion of your oil production to therefore secure second half of the year cash flows and perhaps therefore provide the market with some confidence about your full year dividend? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me answer quickly your second question. No, we are not planning to hedge our normal production. This hedging policy which we very rarely follow is linked to specific acquisitions or specific developments. We are not planning to hedge our production. We expect our shareholders to know that they are running the risk of the oil price and they decide if they want to run this risk or not. As far as the first question of yours, we consider that we are part of a peer group out of seven companies including us. So, we would rate superior the first three.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for that. And just to follow up on one of the comment more than anything else. Do you not feel that you may come under a criticism that you're actually favoring your bond holders rather than your shareholders with this current cut in dividends?</p>

And therefore, we have not been looking at our bond holders taking the decision. We have been looking at our shareholders because we think that a company which wants to grow should have a very prudent approach to its cash allocation priorities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Two questions. I'm afraid the first one will focus a bit on the dividends again. Can you tell me what change in terms of your view about the outlook for cash flow relative to where you were in February when you said the final dividends for 2008?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you said the final dividend for 2008? What has changed in terms of your view of the outlook that makes you perhaps a little bit more cautious in terms of move &#x2013; not in terms of your financial work in the first half effectively for this year? But it seems to be you are taking a theory in terms of where you think cash flows and profitability maybe. Your gearing obviously is a little bit less stretched at this point than it was at the end of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>

          <p>So I just wondered what has changed in terms of your prudent cash flow outlook effectively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure I would like to link what is the different in our view today as compared to February on the dividend. Our dividend decision has been made on the results of the first half and what we expect as a result for the rest of the year then maybe we are wrong. But we thought that this is just a &#x2013; an interim dividend and that we will take a final decision completely freely in February.</p>
          <p>Now to answer your question on the substance what we &#x2013; what has been surprising to us in the last six months is how deep has been the crisis, particularly on the gas market. On the petroleum products market we have seen drops in demand of petroleum products for diesel and gasoline of around 15% in some countries which we have never seen before. In chemicals, we certainly, we're not very optimistic, but the drop has been quite dramatic. And therefore, everything which is related to how deep and steep has been the crisis has been wider than we anticipated.</p>

          <p>I think we shouldn't fairly recognize that for the first half, but you &#x2013; actually we're talking about a quite bullish outlook I thought in terms of your chemical business for the full year, for this year -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bullish, last &#x2013; lower than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. No, in the first half, but you obviously &#x2013; you're saying for the 2009 you expect full year chemicals to be better than 2008. You are saying your gas guidance is remaining unchanged in terms of where it was in February, in terms of keeping profitability flat despite the declining volume. So, I just wondered what specifically seems to have changed <mark type="inaudible" /> since February when I think the superior yield you was just targeting probably was closer to the first, one or two rather than perhaps the top three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, chemicals, now listen, just I want to give you a couple of example. Last year we had an operating profit of our chemical division at the loss of &#x20AC;420 million. When I say that this year to expect to do better, well, I am not very bullish because, better can be 400 and to move 400 billion &#x2013; million is not very positive. As far as our gas business is concerned, just remind for a second that we said that we expect to have an EBITDA of our consolidated Gas and Power division not lower than last year. And last year, we consolidated Distrigas for one semester and this year we consolidate for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's say when you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But when you used that in February &#x2013; that's all I am suggesting is, this is &#x2013; there it doesn't seems too much change in terms of the guidance you are giving there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, well, well, we at that time &#x2013; at that time we were not expecting a drop in gas consumption in Europe as dramatic as it has been which has impacted not only the Gas and Power division, but it has also impacted the E&amp;P division which have not been able to sell all the equity gas which has been producing therefore impacting the E&amp;P division. So let's say, certainly in February we were not bullish, now that's for sure. When we look back at what has happened in the last six months, what has happened has been fundamentally worse than we were expecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, perhaps if we move on in terms of some other prospects you're pursuing, do you have any more information in terms of your negotiations in Iraq and sort of the development prospects that you're pursuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, no, we do not have. As you know, we have two fronts in Iraq. One is the offer we made around Nasiriyah and the second one was the offer we made within the first big round for Dubai. I don't think we have many more elements as of today. Maybe in the next few weeks something will happen, even if &#x2013; now that we start to know Iraq, we can see that timing is not always as announced and it has a tendency to move month-after-months with very little decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you still expect the potential from Nasiriyah to be within a sort of 12 to 18 months view, sort of, some fairly substantial production ramp ups there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, let me tell you what is the view we take on Iraq. Now, of course, Iraq is a very interesting country, because it's the second holder of reserves in the world. So and therefore, Iraq is an El Dorado for everyone in the oil industry. But that's not enough. If we do not see at least two other elements, the one is the profitability of our presence and the second is security, we will not be there. So we don't want to be there at any price, at any cost.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Della Vigna, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to see if you could give us some guidance or some visibility on what you expect from gas and power in 2010. And in particular what dynamics you expect on the margins there given the increased competition especially on the Italian market? And also if you could see some risk in terms of potentially gas sales being below your flow on the take-or-pay contract? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, Michele, let me first say that our EBITDA pro forma of our gas and power division today is composed by more than half by regulated businesses, plus there is another portion quite relevant which is a semi-regulated business, which is international transportation. These components of our EBITDA pro forma will not change, will remain or will probably slightly improve rather than decrease.</p>
          <p>As far as the marketing part of our EBITDA, we expect increased competition in Europe and in Italy. We expect also a market which will probably be low next year, still low, is very early days to make forecast. We don't have a plan for next year. But we expect that this portion of our business might face a challenge of increased competition and slower demand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you got any comments on the potential of your sales being below the floor or the take-or-pay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. It's possible there will be take-or-pay next year. Now, of course, you are familiar on what it is, a take-or-pay, so a take-or-pay particularly in times of low gas prices, it can be an opportunity because in fact there's a prepayment of the gas. If you are not familiar with --</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to firstly follow up on Michele's question here. When you look at the second half outlook for gas and power, first half is down 10%, you have got increased competition in the second half. Is you're confidence for flat full year profits based on hedges in place, forward sales that underpin that forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not hedges, simply contracts that we've been signing really at the end of last year, because most of the contracts are signed in October 2008 and they're still valid until the end of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly I had question on working capital. Most of your peers have been reporting big increases in working capital in the first half. You've shown a big decrease. I appreciate in Q1 you're normally running down your gas storage inventories, but there's also a further decline in Q2. Could you perhaps comment on that, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have achieved a very good result in terms of working capital in particular in the second half, because as you know most of the revenues and the cash flow associated to the gas and power business are translated into cash flow in the second quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>So for sure, we do not expect a similar trend in the second half because both volumes and also the dynamic of the business will not allow the same trend in the second half. But we are confident despite of the economical crises to maintain a very good level of working capital also in the second half of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have &#x2013; you clearly stated that you don't want to distribute reserves and &#x2013; but you will face some, let's say, less predictable elements in the second half, such as potential provisions from litigation. So I would like to understand how will you consider this in your dividend policy? You partially answered my question in the last question mentioning the reported net profit, but --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you see, it depends on the amount. If the amount is limited and closed down, issues which have been pending for many, many years, okay &#x2013; well, we will not particularly look at that. If this amount will be significative, then they will include &#x2013; they will be considered because we &#x2013; as we said, our priority is to defend strong credit rating. And therefore the credit rating will be based among other things on our leverage. The leverage will be impacted by any cash outflows, even if it's on an item which is coming from our past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But also if it is a, let's say, due to some provisions or so, not necessarily already a cash item but just an account.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
