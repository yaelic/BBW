        <plist>
          <p>My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dennis. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter conference call.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was characterized by a continued deterioration in the global economy, and this has led to a rather challenging business environment that has impacted our Q1 performance. Other themes that have affected our sector are changes in patient behavior, reductions in inventories as wholesalers adjust to lower demand, and unfavorable currency trends.</p>
          <p>Our Chairman and CEO Kevin Sharer will begin the call today with a strategic review of our business and the environment that we operate in. Our Chief Financial Officer Bob Bradway will then provide some additional details on our performance during the first quarter and how the trends observed in Q1 translate into expectations for the rest of the year. George Morrow, who's our head of Global Commercial Operations, will then discuss our product performance, both in the U.S. and international markets, once again with a view towards how the Q1 trends translate into a revenue outlook for the full year. We'll conclude the formal portion of this call and open it up for your questions after a presentation by Roger Perlmutter, who as you know is our head of R&amp;D. Roger will provide an update on the timing of ongoing Phase 3 trials with denosumab and Vectibix, as well as a brief overview of our earlier stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>We'll use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.</p>
          <p>So before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that through the course of our presentation today, we'll make certain forward-looking statements, and of course, actual results can vary materially.</p>
          <p>As in the past, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. These non-GAAP figures have been reconciled with GAAP figures in the press release that we sent earlier.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2009 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>We all know we're in the midst of the most challenging economic environment in 80 years. We also now know that for the first time, the biopharmaceutical industry is not exempt from these economic factors in the United States.</p>
          <p>In America, patients are sometimes postponing doctor visits, not always taking medicines on a prescribed schedule, and in some cases, particularly Enbrel in our case, are finding the copays difficult to afford. We also know that health and insurance coverage is not as broad or robust as in prior non-recessionary years. We will talk about these factors later in the call, with particular emphasis on the aggressive steps we are talking to help patients afford their medicines.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to focus on the first quarter revenue and our perspective about the rest of the year. It is a normal cyclical pattern at Amgen to have the fourth quarter be stronger than the first. For example, in both 2007 and 2008, the first quarter revenue was 4% below the prior fourth quarter. This year, the difference is 12%.</p>
          <p>Looking more deeply, in both 2007 and 2008's first quarter, demand was down approximately $147 million from the prior quarter. This year, demand is down about $214 million fourth quarter to first quarter, with a difference between this and prior year's numbers due to negative Enbrel trends. We also experienced an inventory swing, fourth quarter '08 to first quarter '09, of $176 million &#x2013; that is, we were up 61 million fourth quarter '08, and down 115 million in Q1 '09 &#x2013; that accounts, along with the Enbrel drop, for the vast majority of the total quarterly drop in revenue. Clearly, Enbrel is a major challenge, and George will provide more detail later.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on the rest of our business. Our revenue plan is the basis for our revenue guidance, and I will now put my view of our business in the context of our plan.</p>
          <p>Our international business is strong, doing well against biosimilars, and should be on or above plan for the year. While EPOGEN is a bit behind plan to date, we expect dose recovery and a modest price increase to help it achieve budget for the year. We are more cautious on pegfilgrastim. Achieving unit growth is our objective, and George will describe our plans.</p>
          <p>Oncology clinic practice economics are more challenging for physicians than ever, and they are understandably taking more care in accepting economic risks that can arise from co-pay non-collection and individual product and service economics. It is difficult to predict the exact outcome of these two factors, unit growth and office economics, so we are being cautious in our forecast. We are also working constructively with the FDA on crafting a REMS program for Aranesp and expect implementation later this year.</p>
          <p>The final two revenue areas I'd like to comment on are our other products and other revenue, particularly our out-license partnering revenue expectations. The other products, Vectibix, Sensipar, and Nplate, will probably be a bit off our original plan for a variety of reasons that George will explain later. We decided that to be conservative, we would project that our out-license partner revenue will be more in line with 2007 and 2008 levels, which is somewhat lower than our 2009 plan.</p>
          <p>I've gone into some detail since the quarter has more moving parts than usual and the effect of the economic environment is more profound than we expected. So let me summarize regarding revenues before turning to comments on earnings and the pipeline.</p>
          <p>One, first quarter is seasonally down, with the difference from prior year's patterns being Enbrel and inventory swings, both heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. International is performing well and ahead of plan. Three, Enbrel and GCSF are under pressure for variety of reasons, with the single biggest facto, the economy. It's not the only factor for sure, but the major driver. EPOGEN, with dose recovery and a modest price increase, should be on track to meet our expectations.</p>
          <p>And finally, we've conducted a very detailed comprehensive analysis of all other sources of revenue, combined with things we expect or can control, and believe our new revenue guidance range of 14.4 billion to 14.8 billion is achievable.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to EPS guidance. We are affirming our EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. We can do this because very early in the year, with macroeconomic effects becoming clear, we took additional and decisive cost actions across the company. I deeply appreciate the degree to which Amgen's staff have embraced and are executing this plan.</p>
          <p>I want to further assure shareholders and staff that we continue to appropriately invest in advancing denosumab, providing support for key products, advancing the pipeline, and assuring product quality, while also striving to deliver this year on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Finally, the pipeline, the future of the business. All aspects of preparing for a denosumab launch in osteoporosis in both the United States and Europe are proceeding as expected. Roger will elaborate. We are working hard to complete and analyze key clinical data for Vectibix and denosumab SRE that are expected later this year. We continue to look for product opportunities outside the company. A number of mid-stage products look very exciting, and we are also advancing them. Roger will comment in a moment.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to thank Amgen's staff for their dedication, hard work, and results in this most challenging environment. I remain very optimistic about our future prospects as we work through a challenging year and prepare for a bright future. Bob?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Kevin.</p>
          <p>If I can direct your attention to page 5, I'll walk you through the first quarter adjusted income statement. And as you can see, we reported revenues for the quarter were down 8%, to $3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at these results, a bit of context might be helpful, and in particular, it's worth noting three of the factors which created an unfavorable comparison for us versus the prior year. The first of these three factors concerns Enbrel, the second concerns foreign exchange, and the third involves product divestitures, so let me step you through this.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that in the first quarter last year, we moved to a wholesaler distribution model for Enbrel. That transition increased sales of the product in the quarter by $120 million as wholesalers acquired the product for the first time. This is obviously a large variance in our revenues year over year. Second, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar worked against us in the quarter as well, and third, recall that we divested Kineret, Kepivance, and STEMGEN in the fourth quarter last year. So taking together, these items amount to just over $200 million, and if you were to adjust for these, then you can see revenues would be down not 8%, but 3%, year over year.</p>
          <p>Now shifting to a review of our business by geography, we experienced a particularly difficult quarter in the U.S., where our business was down 10% compared to last year, with sales of $2.5 billion. Internationally, we posted first quarter sales of $736 million, which is a decrease of 2% versus the prior year. As I noted earlier, however, we were hurt by a strengthening dollars &#x2013; a strengthening dollar, rather, with sales down $69 million from foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this impact, our international product sales were actually up by 7%, which is solid performance, particularly when you consider that this was achieved in the face of biosimilar competition for two of our franchises in Europe.</p>
          <p>Turning now to operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, you can see our operating expenses were down 10% this quarter versus last year, and despite the drop in our revenues, our operating margin actually increased year over year. You can see from these numbers that we've been managing expenses tightly in the uncertain economic environment we're operating in, and I'll now walk you through the components of our operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Starting with cost of sales for the quarter, you can see they are down 13%, and that's primarily due to lower sales volumes and a favorable mix, as Enbrel represented a lower percentage of total sales this quarter than it had in the prior year.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses were down 8% year over year, and this is primarily a function of the fact that we had lower clinical trial costs associated with our denosumab registrational studies and lower clinical trial costs associated with motesanib following the delay in our study of that product in the non-small cell lung cancer setting. In addition, we benefited during the quarter from lower staff-related costs and increased partnership expense recoveries during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to SG&amp;A. SG&amp;A expenses decreased 10% year over year, and several factors account for this decrease. First, our expenses associated with Wyeth were lower, reflecting the lower Enbrel sales in the quarter. In addition, we had lower litigation expenses, lower information system expenses, and lower staff-related costs, all of which were partially offset by some decisions we made to spend more money on product promotional expense during the quarter. Excluding our Wyeth profit-share expenses, SG&amp;A decreased 6% year over year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the tax rate. As you can see, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, which represents a decrease from the 22.4% in the prior year, and this is primarily due to the fact that the R&amp;D tax credit had not been extended by Congress in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share. You can see that first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.08, which is down 4% versus the prior year. And EPS this quarter benefited both from the decreased tax rate, as well as the decreased share count following our buybacks in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now if you turn to page 6, you'll see we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Our first quarter global cash balance was $10.4 billion, which is an increase of $1.8 billion versus the prior year. Our debt increased by $1 billion year over year, reflecting the fact that we retired a billion of debt in the fourth quarter of 2008, and then raised $2 billion in a successful debt offering in January of this year. And keep in mind when you think about our balance sheet that we have $1 billion liability maturing in November of this year, and we currently expect that we will retire that liability with cash.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to our cash flow, we generated about $860 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter. Note that this is less than what we generated in the same period of 2008, but of course in that period, we had the benefit of a $300 million upfront milestone payment from Takeda, as well as net income, which was some $100 million higher, and in addition, there were some timing issues in particular as we received $100 million of corporate partner receivables in the first quarter last year, which we expect to receive early in the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased shares during the first quarter of 2009. We repurchased 38 million shares, and we currently have approximately $2.2 billion of authorization remaining on our Board-authorized stock repurchase programs.</p>
          <p>Now If I can direct your attention to page 7, I'll walk you through our updated revenue and adjusted earnings guidance for the year. As you heard Kevin say earlier, we now expect 2009 revenue to be in the range of 14.4 to $14.8 billion, compared to the range that we gave you in January, which was the 14.8 to $15.2 billion range.</p>
          <p>Now in bridging from our reported first quarter revenues of $3.3 billion to our full-year revenue guidance, you can see that we're expecting growth for the year off of this first quarter base. Now again, as Kevin said, note that through the years, we've observed relative weakness in our first quarter product sales versus the product sales from the preceding fourth quarter. Now this has been due to a variety of factors such as customer ordering patterns and wholesaler inventory changes which historically boosted the fourth quarter and dampened results in the succeeding first quarter. We think this effect was larger in the first quarter of 2009 than in previous years due in part to large inventory drawdowns, and George will talk more about this in a moment.</p>
          <p>So why are we expecting product sales growth for the rest of the year off this first quarter sales base? We're expecting inventories to normalize to levels that we've seen in prior years. We're expecting segment growth for most of our products. We're expecting share growth in a number of our products. And of course, we have some modest price increases planned during the year as well.</p>
          <p>Now I have been talking about product sales, and I want to talk now for a moment about our other revenues, which, as Kevin suggested, may annualize at a level higher than what's reflected in the first quarter number.</p>
          <p>Other revenues consist primarily of royalties from J&amp;J and partner revenues associated with Kirin-Amgen, and while we're not expecting much fluctuation in these revenues, to the extent we're successful in out-licensing molecules, -molecules like AMG 108 or AMG 223 &#x2013; or to the extent that we're able to trigger milestones from prior deals, we may see an increase in the other revenue line, for example, as we did in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to earnings per share and expenses. Let me reaffirm that our EPS guidance for the year is unchanged. We maintain a guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75.</p>
          <p>I think we demonstrated both in 2007 and 2008 that we could rapidly adjust our expense plans to align them with the revenue reality that we're facing. Obviously the first quarter of 2009 was a tough one for us at Amgen. But once again in the quarter, we adjusted our expense plans to adapt to our new revenue outlook, and we will continue to look for efficiencies and ways to build operating leverage into our business in this market downturn, and to do this without compromising on our investment in denosumab or our commitment to advancing the pipeline.</p>
          <p>As you think about modeling our expenses for the balance of the year, note that our expense growth within any given year has tended to be weighted towards the second half. This is likely to be magnified for us in 2009, as we prepare for the launch of denosumab and add sales and marketing resources and, to a lesser extent, research and development resources, including our medical liaisons through this important new product.</p>
          <p>We've been consistent for the past several years in saying that we want to maintain a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows while returning capital to our shareholders. We ended the first quarter again with a strong and flexible balance sheet, as reflected in our strong single-A debt ratings. We returned $2 billion of capital to our shareholders through buybacks in the first quarter, and we will &#x2013; we'll remain opportunistic throughout the balance of 2009 and will look for ways to improve our cash flows as reflected in our ability to continue to manage down capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we now believe that CapEx for the year is likely to be more on the order of $650 million, than the range we previously gave you of $700 million.</p>
          <p>Based on our business outlook, we expect we can deliver strong earnings for 2009. We expect we can maintain our strong balance sheet and our healthy cash flows.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to George to talk in more detail about the product performance on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Bob.</p>
          <p>Let's go right to the commercial highlights on slide 9. Product sales declined 8% year over year, but this performance was heavily impacted by several factors unrelated to customer demands. First, quarter one '09 had an $120 million unfavorable inventory comparison with quarter one '08 for Enbrel, due to the switch from direct-ship to wholesaler distribution in quarter one '08.</p>
          <p>Second, a stronger dollar diminished international sales by 69 million. And third, the divestiture of Kineret, Kepivance, and STEMGEN in 2008 accounted for an $18 million delta. In the absence of these items, year-on-year sales would have declined about 3%.</p>
          <p>The 18% year-over-year decline in Aranesp sales was primarily due to 2008 label changes and some share loss in the U.S., as well as a $29 million foreign exchange negative effect. Excluding the first quarter '08 inventory load, Enbrel was down 5%, as growth rates declined sharply for both rheumatology and dermatology segments. This segment growth rate decline was heavily influenced by a weakening economy, as the high rate of unemployment coupled with health insurance loss adversely affected patients' ability or willingness to pay relatively high co-pays.</p>
          <p>As Kevin mentioned, we recognize the burden the economy's having on patients. We have enhanced our current Enbrel co-pay program, and will soon be introducing the first medical benefit co-pay card program in the oncology space to lessen the financial burden on patients who need our medications.</p>
          <p>Wholesalers also reduced their inventories more than usual in first quarter '09, presumably to manage their working capital more efficiently.</p>
          <p>And finally, international continued its solid performance, growing 7% before foreign exchange effects.</p>
          <p>Next slide [slide 10]. I don't typically talk about quarter-on-quarter growth rates, because they can be misleading based on non-primary demand-related customer buying patterns. However, given the revenue delta between quarter four '08 and quarter one '09 and our new revenue guidance, we thought some perspective would be helpful.</p>
          <p>This slide shows our quarterly sales, excluding Aranesp, which of course has been contracting recently, and excluding the one-time $120 million Enbrel wholesaler load in first quarter '08. What it illustrates is the consistent pattern of relative quarter one weakness versus the preceding fourth quarter, and in fact, this pattern was evident even during the preceding rapid-growth years. This effect is due to several factors, including holiday-driven wholesaler and customer stocking, patients stockpiling extra doses ahead of plan-year resets, and contract-driven customer buying.</p>
          <p>The fourth-quarter-to-first-quarter change in demand &#x2013; and when I say demand, I'm talking about shipments from wholesalers to hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies &#x2013; and inventory &#x2013; and when I talk about inventory, I'm talking about wholesaler inventory &#x2013; are typically both negative, and this year even more so. This year, the effect was amplified by a larger inventory drawdown which was influenced by credit market conditions and by economy-related challenges with Enbrel demand that I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>If you look at our first quarter revenues of 3.3 billion relative to our revised revenue guidance, you can see that we expect the remaining three quarters of 2009 on average to experience an increase in revenues, although we are not suggesting any specific quarterly pattern. The factors that should drive this increase in quarterly revenue include normalizing inventory levels, segment growth in most products, share growth in some products, planned price increases, and an expectation of some revenue related to our ongoing licensing and partnering activities.</p>
          <p>Next slide [slide 11] is Aranesp. Worldwide Aranesp sales decreased 18% in the first quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 28% year over year, with oncology sales down 34% and nephrology sales down 18%. Overall U.S. segment share decreased by 3%, or 3 points, versus the first quarter 2008, but increased by 2 points versus the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year sales were also negatively impacted by a $22 million benefit in the first quarter of 2008 resulting from a change in an accounting estimate for product sales returns reserves, and a 12 million negative adjustment in the first quarter of 2009 for changes in accounting estimates related to accruals for sales incentives for sales in prior periods. Internationally, Aranesp sales grew 2% excluding FX. I'll discuss specifics of share and segment changes when I review the international results.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I'll update you on the trend in utilization of Aranesp in the U.S. market. This slide [slide 12] displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to quarter one 2007. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of inventory build-ups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red trend lines indicate average weekly sales over the past two years. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true-ups, as well as the effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide.</p>
          <p>U.S. Aranesp averaged $25 million per week in the fourth quarter of 2008 after the most recent label change and share decline. First quarter 2009 was down about $0.5 million per week versus the prior quarter. The decline is not as severe as the previous chart would suggest.</p>
          <p>On the last earnings call, I mentioned that Aranesp sales may be impacted by an ESA REMS program beginning in the first quarter. Obviously the REMS did not launch in the first quarter, and Roger will have more to say about that in a moment.</p>
          <p>Next slide [slide 13]. EPOGEN grew 2% in the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008, driven by patient growth, an increase in price, and a comparative increase in dose versus the first quarter of 2008. You'll remember that quarter one '08 was the implementation of the revised EMP, which lowered the maximum dose for EPOGEN while imposing penalties when ESA doses were not appropriately reduced in response to hemoglobin levels above the target range. The growth in EPOGEN sales was partially offset by lower wholesaler and customer inventory levels. We continue to expect minor dose fluctuations as healthcare practitioners refine their treatment practices to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range.</p>
          <p>Next slide [slide 14]. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined declined 1% in first quarter '09 versus first quarter '08. In the U.S., sales increased 1% driven by demand, which was partially offset by inventory and business adjustments. Internationally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN declined 6% year on year, with 4% growth excluding foreign exchange effects. In the international regions, the NEUPOGEN/Neulasta franchise growth continues to be driven largely by conversion of NEUPOGEN to Neulasta. I'll provide more information on biosimilars later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., conversion from NEUPOGEN to Neulasta is largely complete. We estimate an addressable patient population at medium to higher risk of febrile neutropenia of about 600,000. Over 500,000 patients are receiving AGCS at some time during their chemotherapy treatment. Unfortunately, less than 300,000 receive it in the first cycle, as primary prophylaxis is where treatment delivers the most benefit. Going forward in the U.S., the growth rate of NEUPOGEN and Neulasta franchise will be driven by price, modest incremental penetration in untreated patients at moderate to severe risk of febrile neutropenia, and offset by medical practice changes that reduce the utilization of myelosuppressive chemo regimens.</p>
          <p>Enbrel is next, on slide 15. At a reporting level, we experienced a decline of 20% versus the first quarter of 2008. 15% of this decline was driven by inventory. You'll recall that in the first quarter of 2008, we changed our distribution model from drop-ship directly to customers to distribution via wholesalers, and this resulted in a $120 million of one-time sales in the first quarter of last year. The remaining 5% decline during the current quarter was driven primarily by demand. The primary driver of this softness in Enbrel sales is dramatically decreased growth in both rheumatology and dermatology segments. During quarter one of 2008, both the rheumatology and dermatology segments grew between 15 and 20%, and so far in 2009, we're seeing growth that is less than half of this. In fact in the fourth quarter of 2008, the dermatology segment grew 17%. In the first quarter, it grew only 6%.</p>
          <p>We believe the primary driver of the slowing segment growth is macroeconomic factors, with evidence of office visit cancellations, dose stretching, and abandonment of prescriptions at the pharmacy counter. In addition, we lost share year over year to new competition in dermatology.</p>
          <p>As Kevin mentioned, we recently launched a new co-pay offer to further support patients during these difficult economic times. This new offer replaces our existing co-pay program, and together with our other patient assistance programs, is critically important to ensuring that appropriate patients in need are able to start or continue therapy.</p>
          <p>We do expect Enbrel to maintain its leadership position. In rheumatology, Enbrel continues to be the biologic of choice and continues to lead the class in segment share. In the next six months, we're expecting new products to enter this highly competitive area, but we're comfortable that the market's vast experience with Enbrel and its long history of safety in the class will allow us to maintain our market leadership position.</p>
          <p>In the dermatology segment, Enbrel continues to get the majority of first-line biologic use for psoriasis, and captured more than 60% of the dollar share during the first quarter. New prescription volumes stabilized in quarter one after declining in the second half of 2008. Dermatologists continue to believe that Enbrel has a solid balance of safety and efficacy, which is a high hurdle of proof regarding long-term safety that will have to be overcome by new competition expected later this year.</p>
          <p>On to Sensipar, on slide 16. For the first quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 11% versus the first quarter of 2008. Continued unit and price growth delivered 15% year-over-year growth in the U.S., which was offset by inventory and business adjustments for reserves.</p>
          <p>While the FHPT market in the U.S. has experienced only limited direct effects from economic pressure on patients, we are seeing some payers restricting access to Sensipar recently. We are working to educate all payers on the unique therapeutic benefits of Sensipar, while encouraging prescribing nephrologists to complete any necessary documentation to ensure that their dialysis patients are managed optimally. Internationally, sales grew 23%, or 33% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Next is Vectibix [slide 17]. Our promotional efforts continued to focus on identifying specific and appropriate EGFr-eligible patients based on our existing label and highlighting the key benefits of Vectibix versus the competition. While awareness of KRAS data is nearly universal, only 53% of oncologists have tested their patients for the KRAS mutation. Increasingly, commercial and Medicare payers are requiring KRAS testing as a condition for reimbursement, a practice that will continue to accelerate down the road. Future growth is highly dependent upon label expansion into second- and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and Roger will have more on this in just a few moments.</p>
          <p>The next slide [slide 18] summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 9%, excluding divested products and excluding the effects of foreign exchange, versus the prior year, with growth across all products in nearly all existing territories and from expanding into new territories. This performance reflects a slight increase in segment share year over year for both Aranesp and Neulasta. The next slide looks specifically at new competition in Europe in these segments.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 19, most ESA competitors and biosimilars have launched in Europe in some major countries, and other countries are expected to launch this year. For G-CSF biosimilars, we saw the first launches in the fourth quarter of 2008, and expect additional launches in 2009 and 2010. It's still too early to draw a firm conclusion, but so far, the G-CSF biosimilar uptake curve is tracking similarly to the ESA uptake curve.</p>
          <p>On the next slide [slide 20], we look at international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology. As in prior quarters, Aranesp share remained steady at 52% as biosimilars take share from EPO alpha and EPO beta but not Aranesp. Price erosion was offset by market growth. In some situations, we respond to competition by lowering the price for Aranesp, but we always try to maintain a premium to the first generation EPOs. Reflecting the fact that physicians continue to recognize the value of our second-generation product Aranesp, share in oncology has also increased slightly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, George.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was a period of steady progress in research and development at Amgen, and we are poised to review a series of important clinical trials as the year progresses. And we have put in place the infrastructure to make sure that all of these datasets can be handled correctly.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 outlines some important areas where progress was made during the first quarter. With respect to denosumab, our fully human antibody directed against RANK Ligand, early in the quarter we completed our submission to the European Medicines Agency, seeking approval for the use of denosumab in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and of bone loss associated with the use of hormone ablation imposed in the management of breast and prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>The FDA review of our denosumab application, which we submitted at the end of last year and for which a PDUFA date of October 19 has been applied, is proceeding well, and the European process is similarly on track. Also, our Phase 3 program exploring the use of denosumab for the reduction of skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic bone disease is fully enrolled and moving towards completion, with data from two Phase 3 studies expected in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to other pipeline programs, the Data Monitoring Committee supervising our Phase III study exploring the use of motesanib, our investigational VEGF receptor antagonist, in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, approved protocol amendments that permit re-initiation of this study. Briefly, you will recall that we placed our study on clinical hold at the end of last year because of concern about adverse events, including possible excess deaths in the group of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. After reviewing additional data, the DMC advised us to exclude such patients from future enrollment, but to permit enrollment of additional patients with other histologic subtypes of lung cancer. This analysis has now been reviewed by the FDA, and they have improved our protocol amendments.</p>
          <p>At present, over 1,000 patients have been enrolled in the MONET1 study, in which paclitaxel and carboplatin treatment is impaired with the use of these agents, plus once-daily motesanib in the first-line therapy of non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to enroll approximately 300 additional patients in this study beginning in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Also with respect to motesanib, results from our Phase 2 programs in non-small cell lung cancer and in metastatic breast cancer were reviewed during the first quarter and were found to support continued development of this molecule. Detailed information about these studies will be provided in an appropriate scientific forum. I should note that the development of motesanib is part of a broad collaboration between Amgen, Takeda, and Millennium: the Takeda Oncology Company.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Vectibix. We have continued to follow blinded data from our randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy of Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX therapy to the efficacy of FOLFOX alone, in patients with previously untreated, that is, first-line, metastatic colorectal cancer. Our initial projections suggested that the study would complete this month. However a review of the still-blinded data showed that insufficient centrally-adjudicated progression events, as defined in our FDA-approved statistical analysis plan, had occurred. That is, the disease was not progressing in these patients as we had expected. Based on this review, we are now confident that this study will complete by September.</p>
          <p>We also expect the results from a second Phase 3 steady, this one in patients with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer, that is, second line, will become available at just about the same time. So we will have a large amount of important new data on the use of Vectibix in the treatment of colorectal cancer available by the end of the summer.</p>
          <p>You will recall that these studies will also provide, for the first time, prospective data on the importance of KRAS mutations in tumor DNA. Ascertainment of mutation status in our study populations is excellent, so I feel confident that we'll have very high-quality datasets to review.</p>
          <p>Finally, our Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy of Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy, versus chemotherapy alone, as first-line treatment for metastatic and/or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, has completed enrollment, and data from this study will become available in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, we continue to have very productive interactions with the FDA in the area of ESA therapy. We have an agreed-upon pharmacovigilance program that includes a new study in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia following treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, in which the effects of Aranesp treatment on overall survival will be evaluated. Identification of clinical sites for this pharmacovigilance study has begun.</p>
          <p>Also, we are working closely with the FDA to develop a comprehensive risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, for the use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the regulatory front, marketing authorization for Nplate, which is indicated for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP, in patients who have failed other therapies was obtained in Europe during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we're looking forward to reviewing a very large number of clinical datasets starting in the next few months. Slide 23 provides an overview of clinical trial results that we expect during 2009 and 2010. You will note that there will be five Phase 3 studies this year and five next year that will provide important clinical data, as well as some very exciting Phase 2 studies involving six pipeline molecules, each of which has exhibited substantial promise in earlier clinical trials. So we're very excited about looking at these important datasets over the next few months.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks, Roger.</p>
          <p>We've gone over a lot of information for you today, and before we take your questions, I'd like to summarize what we've tried to communicate.</p>
          <p>First, in January, we knew we faced a tough macroeconomic environment, and we pledged that we would watch the business very closely to understand and react quickly to revenue trends. We have done that, and by controlling expenses, we'll deliver good EPS performance.</p>
          <p>Second, there are some challenging macroeconomic factors that are a fact of life and are affecting demand. We can't change that. However, we are doing everything we can to execute as well as possible, and are focusing more intensively than ever on helping our patients to get the medicines they need.</p>
          <p>Three, our revenue challenges are well understood and concentrated in the United States market, while our international results are on track.</p>
          <p>Four, denosumab continues to advance on all fronts, and we are very optimistic.</p>
          <p>Next, we are on track to report, and will report, significant clinical results later this year.</p>
          <p>And finally, I remain very optimistic about Amgen's future prospects.</p>
          <p>We will now take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, guys. Just wondering if you give a bit more detail on the comments around some segments growing in terms of your guidance assumptions. Which segments are you expecting to grow?</p>
          <p>And the second part of it is, with regards to Enbrel, if the economy continues to deteriorate, do you think we could see further declines in Enbrel, and is that contemplated in your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll give you break here and answer both those questions, but we would like you to stick to one question, please. And I'll pass this over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's very hard to tell, because I think certainly with regard to Enbrel and have we seen everything that's going to happen, I think whenever you start a new plan year with managed care organizations, you probably have the most disruption. So our sense is that we may have borne the brunt of it, but no one knows for sure, and no one knows exactly where this economy's going, where employment is going, and where &#x2013; how many more people will lose health insurance. But we think we're through the worst of it, but we got to check that every day.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth, we think that the GCSF market still has some growth, and when I talk about growth, I'm talking about the combination of units and price. We think EPOGEN has growth potential. We think the SAPT market has growth potential, and we think that the rheumatology segment will clearly grow. Dermatology we think will grow, but boy, there was a big drop in that first quarter, so there's a pretty negative trend there, but I &#x2013; hopefully that'll stabilize.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Clearly your revenue guidance for the year contemplates booking a milestone revenue for denosumab upfront. Can you help us understand what the quantity of that, that you're including in your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, we're not expecting denosumab to contribute much to the other revenue line, so it's premature to say what the contribution might be in terms of other revenue, but we're not expecting that to be a significant contributor to other revenue.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with the progress we're making in the partnership discussions, but again, it's premature to give you any particular guidance on how that might wind up for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on dmab and PMO. You guys talk a lot about economic issues, and if everything goes according to plan, you'll be launching essentially in a market that still has economic challenges. I'm not asking you to give away all your programs here and what your plan is to do, but can you maybe talk about how your plans might be now, versus where they were last year, considering that you'll have a space that has a significant generic option available? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think fundamentally doctors are going to want to write the prescription that they think is clinically best for their patients, and I &#x2013; we believe that's still going to favor denosumab in the long term. Obviously, as we get more and more into this recession, we are sharpening our co-pay programs, and we'll learn a lot from this situation. I can't imagine a worse situation, in terms of patients being able afford their medicines. And so we continue to have eyes wide open. We do a fair amount of research with doctors and with payers, and certainly that'll all be reflected in the final decisions we make around how to go to market with this product and how to price it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd like &#x2013; I'd just like to add, maybe something that's fairly clear, George, that I think, in November, when were with you all, a really fine job, we knew we were going to launch into a generic bisphosphonate environments. We've known that all along. We also knew that co-pays and other patient economic factors were going to be important, and we've thought about that. And finally, we never have anticipated, and I refer back to our November presentation, that we would somehow take the whole market here. There are some folks who we won't go after, but this is such a big market that even a modest share performance is going to be a substantial revenue source. So about the same conditions that we thought, a little bit more headwind, but nothing fundamentally different.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A question for you on Enbrel. Can you guys quantify the Enbrel co-pays that patients will have with the new plan? How does that compare with out-of-pocket expenses for some of your competitors in the class?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know Abbott just launched one for HUMIRA, and basically, really no cost for six months and then $10, but you have to qualify, you have to have insurance to qualify. If you don't have insurance, you go into our Encourage Program, where we can potentially get you the product for free. So this is de minimis in terms of the patient out-of-pocket.

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Wondering if you could give us, George, the number of shipping days for Q1 for you in the U.S. compared to prior periods, and the days on hand of inventory for the main products in the U.S. channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, Geoff, I'll even take it up one level and reiterate what Kevin said initially. Fourth quarter '08 inventory built 61 million in the U.S. First quarter '09, we depleted $115 million of inventory, so the delta's 176 million. Shipping days, there were 51 in the fourth quarter of 2008. There are, by the way, 50 in the first quarter, and there were 49 in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Just going through the products: Aranesp went from 17 days on hand in the fourth quarter of 2008, to 14. Neulasta went from 15 days fourth quarter to 11, and this is the end of the quarter obviously. NEUPOGEN went from 18 to 15. EPOGEN went from 14 to 8. Sensipar went from 16 to 15. And Enbrel went from 17 days on hand to 14 days by the end of the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Another question for George on Enbrel. I know you don't necessarily look at things on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but since the trend line looks like Enbrel's fallen off a cliff in Q1, maybe you could just help us understand the underlying demand here a little bit more? Had you constructed a graph similar to what you've shown us on Aranesp in the past, would we see weakness kind of month on month into Q1 that continues to trend down, or what would that look like if you strip out all of these other one-time items you've discussed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so here's the challenge with Enbrel. We have demand and inventory, and then there's some other factors. There's no foreign exchange in this particular case. So inventory was a factor, but in demand &#x2013; remember the way we defined it, it's shipments from wholesalers to clinics, hospitals, and to pharmacies.</p>
          <p>What you don't know is, at the end of the fourth quarter, were patients expect their deductibles are going to go up in January, they might be switching plans, maybe the co-pays get bigger, did they actually fill an extra prescription?</p>
          <p>So that's going to be counted in demand in the fourth quarter, and so that typically creates what's known in the prescription market as the "shoebox effect," right? So you get a little bit of an air bubble in the end of the fourth quarter, a little air pocket in terms of patient demand, and so that's what's &#x2013; it's going to take a little while longer to sort that out.</p>
          <p>So we're looking pretty strongly at the prescription trends. They're slightly encouraging, but I wouldn't say we're through the worst of it yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Looking at your total revenue numbers, it looks like this quarter, the shortfall is about $300 million less than the consensus, and your guidance is about $400 million less for the whole year. I know that you can have a little bit more normal inventory at the wholesalers, but the frankly, that is probably up to the wholesalers. And the economy continues to be weak, more and more people unemployed. So how are you thinking about this little cut in total revenue for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So one of the things that we do is we do a lot of modeling. We always triangulate, so when Kevin and Bob and I sit down and look at revenue, we triangulate. So we look at various statistical models, run rates, things like that. You're obviously not &#x2013; you can do those analyses, it's public data, but you're not privy to our models, and it's probably not something we're going to share.</p>
          <p>But what we do is, with these statistical models, we do it in a variety of ways. Some of the ways, we weigh the most recent data points, the most recent events that we're using, either DDD data or actual sales data. And we aggregate products, and we also look at products individually, aggregate across regions.</p>
          <p>So we have lots of history with these models. These models have a high degree of accuracy in terms of predicting where we're going, as long as there aren't major inflection points. Obviously, no model's going to predict an inflection point, for example, if the economy got even &#x2013; much, much worse than it is right now.</p>
          <p>So we think, in these models, the effect of the economy's sort of built into the most recent data points. We're encouraged &#x2013; early days &#x2013; but we're encouraged by the way the models are directing us, and certainly that's been reflected in our guidance at this point, so &#x2013; but it's still early days.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to harp on guidance too much, but George, what gives you confidence that wholesalers, and potentially customers, would increase their inventories? It seems like the same credit and economic pressures that led them to draw inventories down are still in place. So why would they normalize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so first of all, we have contracts with them. They are incentivized to keep within a range of days on hand, and most of them right now are at the lower end of that normal range. In fact, Enbrel's below &#x2013; let's see, Aranesp is pretty close to the low &#x2013; or they're pretty much middle, Neulasta is toward the low end, NEUPOGEN's towards the low end, EPOGEN is right at the low end. So are they going to go to the top? Who knows? Typically the fourth quarter, they do get pretty close if not over the top of the range. So they do have to service their customers, but they're also incentivized to be in that range that we typically speak of.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that, on that point is, what &#x2013; can you describe how severe the disincentives are for them to stay below range, or stay potentially out of range on the inventories?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>No, they will stay &#x2013; we're highly confident they will stay within the range throughout &#x2013; on average throughout the course of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi. Can you provide some additional detail on the G-CSF dynamics at physicians' offices, and how you expect that to play out for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I guess a couple things. First of all, there are patients who are not being treated first cycle, and we're doing our best to point those patients out to doctors and correlate the use of different types of chemo with the likelihood that this patient's going to run into an FN event. So redoubling our efforts on that.</p>
          <p>Certainly, co-pays matter, and these are buy-and-bill products, and so we're very limited in terms of what kind of economic discussions we have in offices, but I think the doctors are certainly aware of what the situation is, and to the extent that we can help their patients who are really struggling with their co-pays and they don't want to take the risk of losing a co-pay, this new card system, which again is the first ever in the commercial side of the business for oncology, I think will help maybe make them feel more comfortable to prescribe Neulasta when it's indicated.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roger, could you comment on Enbrel trends? No I'm just kidding. Roger, do you expect an FDA Advisory Panel meeting for dmab, and if so &#x2013; for the PMO setting. And if so, given that the data look so clean that you've publicized, what do you think the FDA might be interested in discussing, and when do you think a panel may happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, for the Advisory Panel, I think that the guidance from following the FDAAA act is that new products will have advisory committees, so you can expect there would be one based on that. Under ordinary circumstances, that would be our expectation, certainly what we're planning for.</p>
          <p>And I think that the issues that &#x2013; we don't know, of course, what issues will be raised. We're having good discussions with the FDA. We speak to them frequently as they really are digging into the review very well. And so things have moved along quite smoothly in terms of the medical review. So they're getting into all of the issues, and naturally, I think they're going to want to explore how much is known about the behavior of denosumab in this patient population for how long a period of time, and what do we need to know to feel comfortable, since this is a drug that will be used in a very, very large number of patients. So I think those will be the questions that they will seek advice on, but they'll find other things no doubt as they go through their review.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide more detail on the discussions that you've had with the FDA on Aranesp REM, and what potential impact that might have towards the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The discussion &#x2013; we've been having a discussion on ESAs, the risk evaluation mitigation strategy has the component of course of wanting to update the information available to physicians and to patients, and to include measures that assure appropriate use. Needless to say, the risk information that is available on our label needs to be communicated to physicians correctly, physicians need to be trained in the use in the chemotherapy and induced-anemia offsetting. and of course we want to make sure that patients understand this as well. And so those are the principal features of any REMS program, and that's the kind of stuff that we're discussing. There's &#x2013; I think we're getting very close to the point where everybody agrees the right elements are in place, and I can't predict what effect that will have in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>I think George would say that when we look out at that &#x2013; and we do look of course in aggregate numbers, physicians are using Aranesp according to the label, as we look at it. We don't see use that is in segments &#x2013; in sections and segments or according to programs that are different from what's outlined in the label. In that sense, it may not have that much effect. On the other hand, to the extent that it's very difficult for physicians to complete the training process or participate in the dialogue with their patients, it could pose a barrier. We'll just have to wait and see what we get to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question. On the TREAT study, is there an upper limit on the per-patient Aranesp dosing, and if so, where is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, on the TREAT study? The TREAT study is &#x2013; the design for a hemoglobin target, and this is in a patient population that of course is a diabetic population, not on dialysis. I can't recall whether we have a specific unit upper limit, but we would be unlikely to hit it anyway in that patient population, because this is typically a pretty responsive population, not on dialysis. We'll get back to you on that one.</p>
