        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our Q3 conference call. First I'd like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the third quarter 2011. Then, Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the Q3 financials in greater detail. And after that I'll give you an update on the outlook for 2011. And finally, we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation discussion are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the record for the purpose of the conference call.</p>
          <p>Now let me get started. Market environment highlights of the third quarter of 2011. Overall, we saw a continued slowdown in the global economy. We saw a Europe with mixed growth. The north of Europe continued to be strong while the south continued to be weak and also impacted by the ongoing lack of resolution in Greece. The U.S. economy grew, but only slightly. The emerging markets, from an overall GDP growth, continued to be strong, and MENA, while underlying good, remained politically unstable.</p>
          <p>We are still seeing a considerable expansion of the industrial sector. Private consumption remains on a moderate level and the commodity price is still on a high. So overall, a somewhat similar picture that we've seen throughout the year, but, however, with a decreasing growth rate that, if you go back and look to the May expectations to GDP for the year, the global GDP expectation was 3.1% and we are now hitting an all-time low for the year of 2.6%. So, we are seeing a consistent slowdown, which we also experienced in the third quarter, and that will also be our expectation going into the fourth quarter that we'll see an overall slowdown of the global economy.</p>
          <p>What were the highlights for Henkel in the third quarter? We continued very strong organic growth rate on the top line for all businesses, so, our three business groups, all three came above 14% adjusted EBIT margin for the first time. We continue to see double-digit growth in the emerging markets that now account for 43% of our total business, and we saw market share gains in our relevant markets. So on the positive side, a good quarter.</p>
          <p>What we are not so satisfied with, we are not satisfied with the declining gross margin. The raw materials continue to be on a high level. And we are not content with the performance our Electronics business. It is below previous years, both on growth and profitability. This has stayed stable but dissatisfactory throughout the entire year. So, no big change, but that does not make it satisfactory.</p>
          <p>If we go through each of the business groups, we saw positive organic sales growth in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business based solely on price increases, showing that our pricing is sticking. We saw solid performance in our emerging markets with high single-digit growth rates and we also gained market share in the relevant markets. We saw gross margin negatively impacted by raw material despite the increase in pricing. However, we did, at the same time, see a further increase in our EBIT margin to reaching above 14%. Innovation rate is trailing at &#x2013; or is running at around 40% consistently. So overall, an enhanced performance in a highly competitive market environment.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to our Cosmetics division. We saw a strong organic sales growth predominantly driven on volume. We saw all our regions growing and emerging markets continued to grow with double digits. Again, also in this market, we got the right balance between profit gain and market share gains and we also saw market share gains. Also here, we show a gross margin negatively impacted by raw materials. The adjusted EBIT margin further increased also to above 40% and the innovation rate remained at a high above 40%.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind everybody that every time we put new products into the market, when we do the price/volume calculation, it is always calculated in volume. That means the more new products we introduce into the marketplace, they will be calculated in volume rather than pricing. Lothar will go into greater details on this. So overall, a strong performance in a highly competitive market environment.</p>
          <p>On the Adhesives side, very strong organic sales growth based on a mix between price and volume. We took the first pricing actions a year ago in the third quarter of 2010, and we had almost double-digit growth rates. All regions growing. The emerging markets were the main growth driver, however, the mature markets were also strong. Again here, we saw market share gains. But again, here also, gross margin negatively impacted by raw materials despite four quarters in a row of price increases. Our adjusted EBIT margin further increased and our innovation rate were above 25%.</p>
          <p>As a side remark, for the first time ever we hit a &#x20AC;2 billion-plus revenue number for our Adhesive business. So, our strong, profitable growth path was sustained.</p>
          <p>Now let me move to the numbers. We grew organically 6.5% and on the reported side, 1.7% to &#x20AC;4.028 billion, so surpassing the &#x20AC;4 billion mark for the first time. On the top line, we were satisfied with the performance. Our adjusted EBIT (sic) [gross] (6:20) margin came out at 45.7%, down from 47% a year ago, so a decline of 130 basis points. We were not satisfied with the development in the gross margin line, which means that we'll be taking further actions to change this development around. Not happy on gross margin.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT grew 4.7%, adjusted margin from 13% to 13.4%, which was in line with our internal expectations, a growth of 40 basis points. Adjusted EPS from &#x20AC;0.80 to &#x20AC;0.85, 6.3%, so also in line. Our net working capital declined from 7.8% to 8.0%. While the decline is very minimal, we're not happy with the development on this line item. Our net debt went from &#x20AC;2.8 billion to &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>So when you look upon the balance sheet, top line was good, adjusted EBIT margin was good, gross margin was not satisfactory and development in net working capital, not satisfactory. However, overall what we'd describe as a solid performance in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>When we look upon the direction we have, we've had unclear strategic direction for the past almost four years. We are completely committed to our 2012 target and we are continuing to adapt our structures to the market. As I alluded to in the introduction, we are seeing a deterioration of the overall economy. And in order to address a slowdown in the market, we have substantially increased our short-term efforts, which Lothar will go into. But we are completely committed to our targets in 2012, and that's why we proactively adapt our structures to the market with the speed that we can.</p>
          <p>One of the areas that we have greatly expanded over the last couple of years is our exploration in shared services. 2008, we had 300 head count; in 2010, we doubled it from 300 to 600. In 2011, we have almost doubled it over 2010, and we expect the same growth rate also for 2012, reaching the 2,000 mark, driving not only speed into our organization, but also enhanced &#x2013; or better cost structure. So, a lot of focus on addressing and continue to slim down our fixed cost structure.</p>
          <p>Then we look on a topic that's been highly discussed, particularly in Europe, in the last quarters, have been the share of female managers within our management team. That is not a new area for Henkel. We've increased it from 23 points to 30 points over the last four &#x2013; seven years, so approximately 1 percentage points a year.</p>
          <p>What we also did in the third quarter was an extension to our management team. HR has been part of the global management team within Henkel for many years. It's only the last two years that I've had that direct responsibility. We've promoted Kathrin Menges, a long-term Henkel employee, who was running HR and is now part of the management team.</p>
          <p>What we also have done, and we announced it last year, last year, by the end of last year, we hit our sustainability targets that we had set for 2012. We hit them by the end of 2010. This year, by the end of this year, we will be announcing our new sustainability strategy. And I'll not go into details on this today, but it is really focused around two things: achieve more with less, and it's built around what we call a factor of three: triple the value we create for the footprint made by our operations, products and services. That will be announced in the fourth quarter and also externally announced by the beginning of next year, and you will see that in our sustainability report that will be issued at the same time as our annual report in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to hand over to Lothar, who will take us through the financials in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>As usual, we'll start with a look at the sales growth by business sector and for the total company. The picture is obviously heavily influenced by the foreign exchange impact and, in particular, Laundry &amp; Home Care, which has reported negative reported growth. With a strong negative impact from foreign currencies of minus 4%, we end up at an organic sales growth of 3.8%. Cosmetics/Toiletries, 5.6%. Adhesive Technologies, 8.7%. And the total company at 6.5%. That is about the same level, a little bit up, versus the Q2 of 2011. So, we've continued on our strong organic sales growth path throughout the third quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>A quick look at Laundry &amp; Home Care first. 3.8% organic sales growth, about the same level that we had in Q2 of 2011, composed of 3.8% pricing and zero volumes. So, it was all achieved by raising our prices, output prices. We've reported quite a bit about pressure on the input side. We've reacted to it. We've finally made it, implementing our price increases to quite a significant degree.</p>
          <p>We've been quite strong in our Laundry division, which is the major part of our Laundry &amp; Home Care business, with an organic sales growth ahead of the average of 3.8%. And we've been particularly strong in a number of countries and regions. Among which is most notably Germany, which has continued above the average organic sales growth level. Middle East, North Africa, which is coming back to the growth rates that we have experienced in the past despite the political turmoil. And despite the fact that this is not over yet, we are reaching again double-digit rates there. We've been positive again in North America, so we're more optimistic although we're not through with it yet. And in Latin America we're again reaching the high single digits, or have reached the high single digits. Positive effect from our own price increases and market share gains in a difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Next up, Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries division with negative pricing overcompensated by strongly increased volumes. And that's the appropriate place to point out again what Kasper has alluded to earlier, that as new product introductions are reported under volume growth, because obviously new products create new volume, but as we have reported on other occasions, we introduce new products only if they are margin accretive. So in other words, there's a pretty significant pricing impact from new product introductions.</p>
          <p>Our best estimate in respect of the Cosmetics division is that if we were to report this under pricing for new product introductions, that would change from a negative 0.7% into a positive 1.3%. So from that perspective, I think the way we've been implementing our price increases, not just by increasing list prices, but by also introducing new, more valuable products to our customers and consumers, we have implemented a margin increase, or fought back on the pressure on the input side.</p>
          <p>Our strongest piece in that business is obviously Hair Care with a strong increase above the average of the total division. Particularly strong, our Professional Hair Care division with double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of regions, Germany was still quite positive, Middle East/Africa again in the high single digits, Latin America with strong double digit as was Asia Pacific, and particularly strong was China, where we have successfully introduced our SYOSS range.</p>
          <p>Next, we look at our Adhesive Technologies division which has been continuing on a pretty strong growth path with 8.7% organic sales growth for the total division, composed of 6.2% price, 2.5% volume. Here again, we've been able to increase our prices, implement pricing increases, which have fought back on the pressure on the input side.</p>
          <p>Particularly strong in terms of divisions &#x2013; or subdivisions within the unit, our Consumer and Construction Adhesives division, but also Packaging was approaching double digits and also our Transportation segment.</p>
          <p>Look at the total company, the strong negative impact from currencies, which was mainly from the U.S. dollar, Turkish lira, Russian ruble and the Chinese renminbi, which have resulted in the negative of minus 4% on sales growth, and that then translates eventually into a 6.5% for the total company.</p>
          <p>Now, averaging over the all divisions, it's 4.0% pricing, 2.5% volume. So, despite the strong impact and strong actions on the pricing front, we've been able to either maintain or increase our volume, which shows the strength of our businesses and our brands.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the regions in terms of sales growth. We've seen all regions growing organically, positive. So we've continued with Western Europe with pretty strong almost 4% organic sales growth. Even stronger performance in Middle East/Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, with all of them in the double-digit organic sales growth rates. We've seen a little bit of a slowdown in Asia Pacific with 7.6%, which is obviously something which has been impacted by the events in Japan and somewhat lower growth in China, although China is still double-digit organic sales growth.  So in other words, we expect that impact in Japan to go away over a period of time. It is still &#x2013; or has been affecting our numbers in Q3.</p>
          <p>In the emerging markets, we've been particularly strong, as I mentioned. In a double digit range is Eastern Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America. And if we looked only at the emerging markets part of Asia, that again has been double digit. So, without Japan, Asia, that's double-digit sales growth.</p>
          <p>Sales share in emerging markets increased from 42% to 43%. That obviously was driven in major part by Adhesive Technologies and the Cosmetics/Toiletries, so both have continued to experience double-digit sales growth in the emerging markets. But our Detergents division has come back to a pretty high single-digit organic sales growth. So therefore, we're pretty happy and satisfied with our performance in terms of driving sales growth in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at our operating earnings evolution, Laundry &amp; Home Care, Cosmetics/Toiletries, Adhesive Technologies, all with an increase in adjusted EBIT margin. Laundry &amp; Home Care with 40 basis points, Cosmetics/Toiletries with 70 basis points, Adhesive Technologies with 60 basis points, it all ended up at <mark type="ph" /> 40 basis points (18:29) or above, so, in other words, we're moving in the right direction and we're having our target in sight.</p>
          <p>First, a look at our Laundry &amp; Home Care division, where we have experienced a strong impact from the high input costs, which we have mitigated by our own price increases and we've lowered our cost base in order to support our EBIT margin. Among others, we have consolidated our market research and media management between the two divisions, Laundry &amp; Home Care and Cosmetics/Toiletries, and we have realized savings in that particular arena.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics/Toiletries, efficiency gains and tight cost control which have, again, delivered an improvement in our margin evolution by 70 basis points. That again, has been supported, to some extent, by the consolidation of what I mentioned just a minute ago with respect to our Detergents division.</p>
          <p>Finally, 60 basis points up in our Adhesive Technologies division, where we have experienced quite a strong impact from input cost inflation, which we have compensated by our own price increases plus efficiency gains and, thereby, increased our margin.</p>
          <p>Looking at the gross margin for the total company which is down to 45.7%, which is minus 130 basis points, where we have experienced the strong impact from raw material price inflation of 500 basis points, which we have equalized to about 75% by increasing our own prices and, obviously, also through savings, gain savings which we have implemented in the various divisions and functions.</p>
          <p>We've also seen a negative mix effect from the slow growth or low growth of the Electronic Adhesives division, which, under normal circumstances, generates significantly higher gross margins than other parts of our business, and therefore other parts growing stronger therefore results in a slight dilution of our gross margin.</p>
          <p>Income statement to adjusted EBIT, I would like to highlight two lines, marketing, selling and distributions expenses which were down by 210 basis points, and admin expenses down by 20 basis points. Let's start with marketing, selling and distribution. We have basically spent the same total amount on media and promotion, but there's been a significant shift away from media into promotion. That's a market evolution. That's not something that we've basically driven. We've been in line with market development. We've basically maintained our media spend in the same &#x2013; for the same levels that our peers have been maintaining. And therefore, we've followed the same strategy of increasing our promotional spend in order to trigger sales at the point of sales. Increased promotional spending offset the reduction of the marketing budget. So, the total budget has been basically the same.</p>
          <p>Selling and distribution expenses have been down thanks to our restructuring synergies, amongst which has been the one that I mentioned earlier, that is the consolidation of our media management operations in the two divisions.</p>
          <p>We've seen a reduction of 20 basis points in our admin expenses. Extended usage of shared services which has further improved our cost base, that is obviously something about which we have communicated quite a bit. We have extended our shared service approach, which we had initially implemented for the finance functions, now to purchasing and also to the HR division which has been quite active in implementing shared services as part of adapting our structures to the more competitive environment.</p>
          <p>We're in the process of extending this program into the other parts of SG&amp;A, in particular in the business divisions, where we expect a significant savings potential in the next two years from implementing shared services in the processes &#x2013; in the transactional processes that are currently being operated within the business divisions. So there is a significant arena of cost savings opportunities which we are currently addressing quite aggressively.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted EBIT, the difference between Q3 '11 and Q3 '10 is basically there's a strong increase in restructuring charges from &#x20AC;26 million in '10 to &#x20AC;90 million in '11. And therefore, the difference between the increase in adjusted EBIT and the decrease in reported EBIT is entirely due to the fact that we have increased our efforts at changing our structures, adapting our structures, not only in following the markets, where obviously our markets are growing much stronger in emerging markets than in the mature countries, but also in anticipation of potentially more severe developments in the near future. So we have increased our efforts and our speed in order to restructure our structures.</p>
          <p>Now, that pertains in large part to shared services which I have explained a minute ago, where we've, again, spent, or provisioned &#x20AC;30 million for restructuring expenses in Q3. We've optimized the administration manufacturing footprint, in particular in the Adhesives division, and we've looked into the Laundry &amp; Home Care division in terms of delayering the leadership structure with an expense that we've taken in Q3 of &#x20AC;25 million.</p>
          <p>So all these three programs together, and others, add up to the &#x20AC;90 million charge that we've taken in Q3. And that is no more than a signal of our determination to adapt our structures to a changing market conditions, but also be prepared should the situation develop negatively.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow generation, cash flow from operating activities is up, &#x20AC;676 million in Q3 of this year. Free cash flow is slightly down to &#x20AC;515 million, but on a pretty good level. And that has permitted us to reduce our net debt to a level between &#x2013; below &#x20AC;1.9 billion. That's for the first in a long period of time that we're below &#x20AC;1.9 billion. Actually, since Q2 2008, that's the lowest level that we had ever since and it's a strong signal of our unbroken strength to generate free cash flow and retire debt.</p>
          <p>Net working capital to sales ratio, Kasper has alluded to that earlier. Although the change to previous year is only 20 basis points, as you can see on the detail, our Adhesives division is up by 110 basis points, our Detergent division is down, so they continue to manage their net working capital quite aggressively and quite successfully. A little bit up in the Cosmetics/Toiletries division, which, again, is not satisfactory. But the bigger issue is with our Adhesive Technology division. While it is best in class if we compare ourselves to our immediate peers in this particular sector, I think we can do better, and we've communicated about this. This is not satisfactory. We want to achieve a better level of performance, and I think we have the means of doing it. We'll address it aggressively in the next quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Net debt development, I've mentioned that earlier. Compared to the period Q3 in 2009, that's a very significant net debt reduction and in a way that signals our ability to generate free cash flow, retire debt which we have incurred in connection with the acquisition, National Starch in particular, in a very short period of time despite difficult conditions. So net debt under &#x20AC;2 billion for the first time since 2008 and we've reduced total net debt by 41% in the last two years. Communicated a lot about it, we've withheld &#x2013; held back on acquisitions, and I think we've been extremely disciplined in managing our balance sheet in order to regain the strength that has permitted us to get the upgrades that we've received earlier this year.</p>
          <p>A number of items that we have guided. Direct materials, increase in the low teens, that's not changed. Restructuring charges, we're updating that to &#x20AC;220 million. Obviously, we have spent in the first nine months already above &#x20AC;160 million, which was the original guidance and, therefore, we've increased our guidance basically by the amount that we've spent additionally in Q3 to &#x20AC;220 million.</p>
          <p>The other items basically remain at the same level the we had guided earlier. So from that point, the only significant change is in our aggressiveness to adapt our structures and incur charges in order to make that as fast and as quickly as possible, and also as effectively as possible.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over back to Kasper to provide the outlook on fiscal year 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. We expect a decreasing outlook for the remainder of the year. So, the overall market environment will decrease as the years go by. It will remain positive, however, so, we expect a global GDP growth of 2.6%. So still a matter of growth but with an increasingly decrease.</p>
          <p>How does our forecasts look? We've changed our forecasts up again. Our organic sales growth we're guiding to between 5% and 6%, and it will probably rather be a 6% than a 5%. Our adjusted EBIT is maintained at 13% despite the decreasing market environment and our adjusted EBIT growth will remain at 10% plus.</p>
          <p>We are confirming then our outlook for the full year of 13%. We are confirming our financial guidance for 2012 at 14%. And the specific growth targets that we always give for the year will be given to you at the disclosure of our annual results in March of 2012. So, these are the growth targets, the margin target remain unchanged at 14%. The new targets beyond 2012 will be disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, when I summarize the third quarter of '11, it was a solid performance in a challenging environment. It was an equal contribution from all business groups. We saw strong organic growth with market improvement. We still experience high raw material prices. We were unhappy with the development in the gross margin that continued to be under pressure. And we continue to see a market in the Home &amp; Personal Care with high promotional activities. So, the bottom line is, we'll continue to focus on efficiency gains and profitable growth moving forward.</p>
          <p>When I look upon the year, we'll continue to focus on getting the balance between profitable growth and market share correct, which we've done so far this year. We will focus on extending our position in the emerging markets that was up to 43% in the third quarter. We are in the process of improving our HPC business in North America. It has stabilized. We continue to push sales prices through to mitigate the increase in raw materials and go back and regain a positive development GP1. We're applying a very strict cost control. And as Lothar closed on his presentation we'll continue to adapt the structures to the market. We've seen a deterioration of the overall market environment, and that's why we are increasing the spend in order to ensure that we have the optimal structures to ensure that we hit our targets not only in 2011, but also for 2012.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to thank you for dialing in. And now we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hi, guys. Two questions from my end. The first is in raw material and packaging inflation. Have you any early views on what that might be next year, and also for Q4, compared to the nine months so far this year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, you said you were going to take further pricing. Could you perhaps quantify that for us? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Eamonn, let me start with the outlook on at least Q4 and, to some extent, next year with respect to raws and packaging. We expect &#x2013; and if I may say or <mark type="ph" /> form (33:28) that into the impact on our gross margin, we think we've seen the peak of it in Q3. We expect that to remain at the level or decrease slightly over Q4. And we expect to see some relief, so, lower raw material price inflation in Q1 of next year.</p>
          <p>So I think we're at the peak of it in Q3; we see slight relief in Q4 and a stronger relief in Q1 of '11 (sic) ['12] (34:02). With respect to pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a couple of comments on pricing. I won't comment on the detail or give you actual numbers. We will take pricing across the board. But just one point on the pricing translation into GP1, there's not 100% correlation between the two because, of course, our GP1 is also impacted on the mix we have, not only the regional mix, but also the product mix.</p>
          <p>So right now, when we're seeing growth in Adhesives, but the growth is coming for, for the sake of example, for our Packaging business. There is a dilution to GP1 when we don't have the similar performance in our Electronics business. So, it's not only a price to GP1 translation, it's also a mix translation. So we of course are doing both.</p>
          <p>We're managing the price across the three divisions up, but over time, it is also depending on which kind of mix we have. And right now, we have a mix in our Adhesive division, but it is driving a lower GP1 due to the slowdown in the Electronics division, and that's why you're seeing that change. But, of course, the target we have at our hands is how we get our GP1 back, which is a mix between product mix, regional mix and pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I would like to know, you spend more on restructuring, what measures are you taking there, or what additional measures, additional to what you had planned previously?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've tried to detail a little bit already the types of actions that we have undertaken. I mentioned the example of shared services, which is the best example because we're extending shared services beyond the immediate area that we had worked on, and that's something which we initially were targeting for next year. We have decided to accelerate this program into this year in order to get as much as possible the savings earlier.</p>
          <p>But generally speaking, in the SG&amp;A sector, if you look at the processes in the business division where, for example, sales management is one process where obviously contacts with the customers will remain in the countries or in wherever they are currently located. And then beyond that, there is a level of transactional activities handling the sales order, pushing it through the system, eventually recording it. All this can be done in a shared service organization.</p>
          <p>So we're, again, taking the same approach that we have taken in the functional units into the business units, we're looking at the frontend, which will remain with the organization, and we're basically transferring the backend from those transactional processes into shared services. And we accelerated that because we want to get the savings earlier rather than later.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you and good morning. I've got two question. The first one is focusing on Adhesives. Could you give us your best view how you expect volumes to grow in Q4 and into 2012, please? And the net working capital in Adhesives, is the negative development there an indication perhaps of a buildup of inventories?</p>
          <p>My second question refers to the gains that you have made in consolidating the marketing efforts in Laundry and in Cosmetics. Could you give us an indication whether this is the first step to potentially consolidate more between those two divisions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Susanne, let me start. And good morning to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Adhesives side, as you know, we don't give outlook on volume, neither for the quarter or for the year, and we'll give growth targets for next year in the month of March. But what we are doing is, and that's what I said in my call, we are consistently trying to find the right balance between profitable growth and market share gains. So right now, we believe that we are winning market share with the balance of putting pricing through, and that's what we'll continue to do so. So, we expect over time that our growth, as it has been in the past, will be a mixture between volume and price. The actual growth targets for next year we will be giving next year.</p>
          <p>On the decline in net working capital from 14% to 15% roughly, what we have done, as you know, that we have done a substantial consolidation in our manufacturing footprint, and that has helped us. We still don't have the optimal processes to get the most out of it, and that's why it's so important for us that we drive our backend infrastructure into shared services and thus standardizing our processes and also speeding up our capability to react to market changes. So I would say right now, it has been a focus. It's not been enough in focus, that's why you're seeing the decline.</p>
          <p>Whether 14% or 15% is best in class in the industry, we're not happy with the performance and we believe over the next one to two years, there is still substantial headroom to improve in that area. We're taking the first step by consolidating approximately 50 plants in the last two or three years. And now we're taking the next step of driving our backend infrastructure into shared services, and that standardization will allow us to get improvement when it comes to net working capital on Adhesives.</p>
          <p>Lothar will take the second part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just adding a little bit of perspective on the question that you had with respect to inventory buildup, the point that Kasper mentioned which is we're in the process of building or actually constructing new plants and then moving production volumes from existing operations into a new plant, it's usually accompanied by inventory buildup because you cannot expect that the new plant will run immediately without any interruptions, and therefore, there's a tendency within the organization to buildup somewhat inventory in preparation for these kinds of movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're currently moving production from Western European plants into Hungary. So that's one reason why we're building up inventory, in anticipation of potential problems when we know that we're building or constructing plants elsewhere. So there's one element of preparing for potentially problems which the organization obviously feels is necessary. But again, I think we're looking for structural improvements rather than short-term negative impact &#x2013; or let's say mitigate the short-term negative impacts, which may occur in the future as well because we're continuing to move production into the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>The second part, the gains that we have achieved in consolidating our media management. In our view, that was basically &#x2013; that was not trying to anticipate &#x2013; and with consolidation of Cosmetics and Detergents, it's for us a quick win. I think they're both basically active in the same markets, in the same media, with the same agencies and, therefore, to consolidate this is, from our perspective, something which is rather natural rather than something spectacular. And it's accompanied by an improvement in efficiency, but also an improvement in the way we operate and handle this whole thing. We're also actually bundling our power much better vis-&#xE0;-vis the agencies. And that's basically where the savings will occur.</p>
          <p>So, from that perspective, that's, in a way, a quick win rather than us anticipating a signal for consolidation.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Guillaume Delmas from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Guillaume Delmas from Nomura. Two questions from me, please. The first one would be on your full year '11 guidance of 13% EBIT margin. Given the numbers reported for the first nine months, are you now effectively guiding for around 100 basis points of margin expansion in Q4? Now, am I right in thinking that you will also benefit from around 60 to 70 basis points of positive margin impact from the special incentive you booked last year? So, excluding this, effectively you're guiding for underlying margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points. It's less than what you achieved in Q3. Are you just being conservative or should we interpret your around 13% as 13.2% rather than 12.9%?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on U.S. HPC. You've had now a new team in place there for almost a year. They've implemented a new strategy. Are you already seeing some improvement in terms of market share momentum and also from a margin improvement standpoint? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the second part of the question and Lothar will take the first part of the question. On the U.S., you've seen in our slides, for the last three quarters we've had the U.S. in my part of the presentation being on the right-hand side of the slide, meaning dissatisfactory performance. You didn't see it there on the right-hand side and you didn't see it on the left-hand side, so what we're seeing is a stabilization. We've seen an increase in growth in market share in the last couple of quarters and also increase in profitability.</p>
          <p>And the guidance we've given so far has been that we believe that we'll have turned around the situation by the fourth quarter. That is still what we're seeing at this stage and still our anticipation. We've spent a year, we've put a new team in place. We've done a lot of changes to not only the team, but also the strategy and the position of our products, brought new products into the market like Crystals that was announced in Europe.</p>
          <p>So at this stage we believe we have taken the right steps. We are starting to see the initial results. But as I also said in previous quarters, we believe the turnaround will be done by the fourth quarter, and that's why we're calling it a stabilization while we're seeing slight growth on the top line, increase on the bottom line in market share improvement. But we're still not where we want to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to our full year guidance, obviously we'll withstand the speculation to interpret our own guidance one way or the other. It is 13% and that's what it is. With respect to all the arguments that you have raised, I think what we're trying to do is to be on the safe side in terms of what might happen in the fourth quarter. You always know that our industrial business has a weak fourth quarter because industrial companies tend to close down their facilities rather early in December. That's not particular to this year, it's basically happening every year. The question though is whether there will be a stronger slowdown than we have seen during the course of this year. That obviously nobody knows exactly.</p>
          <p>So from our perspective, that's our best guess. It may be better or it may be different, but I think we're happy, or, let's say, we're confident that we're going to reach our best guess, but there's an upside and a downside, as usual, with any guess.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good morning. I was just wondering if we could talk a little bit about your earlier comments on marketing spend and how the level has stayed the same but there was more of a focus on promotion. So just firstly, you bundle it all in, so it's sort of marketing and selling and distribution. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about what was the delta in each of those bits of that 210 bp swing. How much was attributable to distribution, how much selling, how much marketing? And if you could also just remind us exactly where within your P&amp;L you recognize promotion, that would be very helpful as well. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me address the question, Iain. First of all, marketing spend or media spend is only in the marketing spending and distribution expenses, whereas promotion is above net sales. That's the way the International Reporting Standards require it. So therefore, promotions are not in the P&amp;L, they're above net sales &#x2013; the net sales line.</p>
          <p>With respect to the difference that we see compared to last year, the difference is basically in the range of a bit more than &#x20AC;60 million, half of which is allocable to the reduction in media and half of it is the lower selling and distribution expenses that we have incurred.</p>
          <p>And from the reduction in media, there again we're also generating the savings that I alluded to earlier from the consolidation of the media management and marketing management operations. But the smaller part of it though is from reduction in this sector. The bigger part is reduction in spend which has been basically added back to increased promotional spending. So, the totality of both is basically at the same level of last year.</p>
          <p>And the other element that we look at is share of voice per share of market, and that scenario where you obviously want to be represented, in terms of media spend, in line with your market share, or more, for that matter. And so we're basically at the level of one, that is to say, we're well represented. And those are figures &#x2013; the public figures, so therefore, we just refer and rely on public figures, or figures that have been collected by agencies.</p>
          <p>So our spend is basically in line with what happens in the markets. We're spending as much as is appropriate in terms of our market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just a very quick follow-up, if I may. Could you talk a little bit about what's actually happened within Cosmetics to drive that growth figure, which I think is some way above what we'd have seen out of some of your European competitors? I mean, how much of that 5.5% is SYOSS? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look upon it, SYOSS is actually only a marginal part of it. If you go back and look upon the sales development we've had for the last many quarters now, it's been consistently above market. And we've been running &#x2013; I don't have the actual number in front of me but I can get it in a second, but we've be running at 5% plus consistently this year. So it's just a very, very strong innovation pipeline, very much focused on execution in the core segments that we're in. And the fluctuation in our execution has been very little. So, if you were to go back and look upon the last three years, we've been consistently growing above market. We have consistently expanded our EBIT position quarter after quarter.</p>
          <p>So it is not a SYOSS takes it all, so to speak. It is a consistent execution of the strategy that Hans put in place a number of years ago. And some of you who we actually have been <mark type="ph" /> privy (50:15) to &#x2013; I've just gone back and then looked upon now that the OSG trend, or the organic sales growth trend was 5.5% in Q1 '10, 5%, 4.6%, 4.1%, 4,8%, 5.7%, 5.4%, 5.6%. So if you take it and then just average it out, pretty much since the first quarter of '10, we're running at an average at 5% plus. And that's what you're just seeing, a consistent, strong, very focused execution.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions, if I may. In terms of input costs, can you speak to whether it's related as much to supply shortages in terms of the pressures that are coming through and, therefore, potentially still very strong underlying demand from the industrial complex across the board or whether it's literally just the commodities themselves going in terms of pricing? And within that, the pricing that you've taken, have you taken some tactical decisions to perhaps under-recover slowly versus your peers and take market share?</p>
          <p>And then on my second question, this deals with inventories, but rather than for yourselves, more at the industrial complex level. Are you seeing any signs of the industrial complex building up inventories which then may need to be released as sales growth slows due to slowing global GDP? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the topic of input costs and pressure on scarcity. We continue to see that in the industrial business. We've communicated about it on several occasions. It is obviously not helping in terms of putting back pressure on rising input costs. We don't think it's really the major issue. I think the stronger issue is the strong recovery and the ability of many suppliers to reduce their capacity, which has resulted in a lower volume in total and, therefore, has permitted the market to increase prices on the input side.</p>
          <p>But there's a strong demand which has been continuing throughout this year and, therefore, there's a continuing strong demand on the materials that we source, and that has obviously had an impact on some of the materials. We've communicated about hotmelts which is in scare supply.</p>
          <p>It's been difficult more for us in the sense of not being able to sell as much as we could have sold otherwise. I guess our guess on the impact would've been &#x2013; or would be that we lost about &#x20AC;60 million to &#x20AC;80 million of sales which we otherwise could have achieved with &#x2013; obviously a good margin.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, we don't really think that's the biggest impact, the scarcity. It is the overall demand which is strong in the markets and that has resulted in the increasing prices.</p>
          <p>And we also obviously have seen a strong increase in the oil price, which has been &#x2013; although it's been coming down a little bit over the third quarter, it's still on a very high level compared to last year.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, while inputs obviously have increased, competitive situation in sourcing has been severe and, therefore, that all together has resulted in the tense situation that we have experienced.</p>
          <p>With respect to pricing, have we been lower than our competitors. If you look at the margin, gross margin development basically with our competitors who have experienced very similar gross margin negatives, we don't see much of a difference between ourselves and what our peers have reported. That's certainly true with our adhesive peers but it's also true with HPC.</p>
          <p>So from our perspective, we've not been slow in terms of pricing. We've been in some countries actually earlier and stronger than our peers, and in other countries, our peers may have been stronger. So from that perspective, we don't really see much of a difference in behavior in that respect.</p>
          <p>In terms of inventory buildup, do we see a lot in the markets. The answer is basically no, with one exception. The electronics sector seems to be still sitting on a significant inventory, so we don't expect that slow movement that we've seen in, basically, in the three quarters to go away anytime soon. So that's an area where we don't see a strong improvement over the next quarters. But other than that, we don't see a strong buildup in inventories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. My first question would be on your outlook. First of all, for sales, you said your 5% to 6%, even if you arrive around 6%, will imply a slowdown in Q4. Is that just being conservative and &#x2013; or maybe is there more something to say about Q4 in sales?</p>
          <p>And on your 2012 outlook, you yourself said that there was uncertainty in the market and it seems lower visibility. So, could you tell us what are your underlying assumption for you to basically reiterate your high confidence in that?</p>
          <p>And my second question, which is probably also similar, could you give us an idea of the margin drivers in 2012? It seems to me that 2011, we've seen a lower SG&amp;A or &#x2013; and A&amp;P driving EBIT, as gross margin were ahead. Could you give us a bit of the big picture for 2012, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the fourth quarter. There are two things that is impacting the fourth quarter. First of all, it's a slowdown in the global economy, which is across the board; that's not specific to Henkel, that is across the board. And if you look upon the <mark type="ph" /> first (57:13) chart I showed you in the beginning of the presentation, you can see a slowdown. Point one. Point two, we have, as Lothar said, always had a slower fourth quarter than the previous quarters, predominantly due to our Adhesives business.</p>
          <p>So right now there is no cautiousness in the outlook to our fourth quarter. We believe we would be running between 5% and 6%, probably closer to the 6% than 5%. But also impacted on &#x2013; also depending on what's going to happen on the situation in Europe with the unresolved Greece scenario. So we believe that it's a very realistic guidance that we are running on right now.</p>
          <p>On the details of the outlook for 2012, that we'll be giving in March. And we're very confident that we will hit our targets. We've had these targets in place since 2008. We've not changed any of our guidance from 2008. We've hit the targets we set &#x2013; or we guided for '13, throughout this year.</p>
          <p>And maybe just to put what we called a solid quarter into perspective. The solid quarter we're speaking about today is the highest quarter ever in the history of Henkel when it comes revenue and when it comes to margin and when it comes to actual EBIT. The reason why we're characterizing this as a solid quarter and not a great quarter is that we're not happy with the Gross Profit 1 margin. That's why we're characterizing this as a solid quarter and not a great quarter. When I look upon the translation from revenue to GP1 to EBIT, what you're seeing is we're not seeing a savings in our marketing business. We're seeing a change in the spend of A&amp;P and where you're going into promotion. So by default, what you are seeing is in spending on one line, you're spending on the different lines from gross to net. So that's why also GDP is going down because you taking in to promotional spend and that's why it's hitting that line and not the advertising line.</p>
          <p>So we believe that we spend in line with the market. Lothar spoke about our share of volumes to share of market spend, that's actually stable to up. So we're not seeing any change in that.</p>
          <p>And when I look upon the outlook of '12 and we have consistently at every quarter throughout this year confirmed our guidance for '11, confirmed our guidance for '12. We believe by managing the portfolio, we have continued to address the cost structures as we are doing, because what we are seeing is, contrary to the outlook or the expectation we actually gave in 2008, in 2008 we said our expectation to global economy would be a growth of between 3% and 4%. That growth we're not seeing at this stage, and that's why we're accelerating the activities that goes in in addressing our cost line. That's why we're confident that through consistently driving our costs down and also getting the right mix, we can hit the 14%.</p>
          <p>The details we'll give in the quarter, the first quarter of 2012 when we speak about the overall growth outlook. But as I said, I want to reiterate, we had the best quarter ever. We're characterizing that as a solid quarter. We're not trying to say it's great, because we were not happy with the two line items I mentioned, GP1 and net working capital. And we're at the same time maintaining our guidance for 2011.</p>

          <p>Which brings me to the closure of the call where I'd like to thank everybody for participating in the third quarter conference call. And as I said, despite the challenging environment, we did have a solid quarter in the third quarter of 2011. At the same time, we will maintain our rigorous approach to cost management and continue to adapt our structures to the changing in markets. But let me stress, we remain fully committed to achieving our financial targets not only in 2011 of 13%, but also our financial targets of 14% in 2012.</p>
          <p>We wish you all the best and we look forward to speaking to you at the full year 2011 conference call on March 8, 2012. Thanks very much.</p>
