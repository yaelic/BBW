          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2008 Simon Property Group earnings conference call. My name is Tawanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions.] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice-President of Investor Relations. You may proceed, ma'am.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Welcome to the Simon Property Group second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe that it is important to note that today's call contains time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, July 28, 2008.</p>
          <p>The company's quarterly supplemental information package was filed earlier this morning as a Form 8-K. This filing is available via mail or e-mail and it is posted on the Simon website in the Investor Relations section under financial information, quarterly supplemental packages. Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. And now I will turn the call over to Mr. Simon.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. I'm just going to take a few minutes to discuss the highlights and then open it up for your questions. Second quarter FFO was $1.49 per share, up 13.7% over the prior year. Please note that this growth was achieved in spite of the $20.3 million extinguishment charge incurred in connection with the redemption of $200 million of MOPPR notes. These notes which matured on June 15 contain a repricing mechanism that allowed the underwriter to remarket the issuance as a new 20-year SPG security.</p>
          <p>In exchange for this remarketing right, we received an $8 million payment from the underwriter when the MOPPRs were issued in 1998. This remarketing feature would have resulted in the issuance of above market rate debt due to treasury rates being lower than when the debt was originally issued and marketing conditions on the exchange date. Therefore we elected to simply retire the notes and pay the premium. As a result of the redemption, we expect to save approximately 5 million annually in interest expense over the $20 million -- or 20-year term that these notes would have been in place had they been remarketed and reissued as compared to current rates available to us from our other financing activities.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of this one-time charge, diluted FFO per share increased 19.1% for the quarter to $1.56. We continue to benefit from the impact of solid operating results from all of our five property platforms as well as decreasing LIBOR rates. Results were also positively impacted by cost control including our energy efficiency efforts. Occupancy in the Mall portfolio was down 20 basis points as compared to the year earlier period. Square footage lost to bankruptcy for the first six months of 2008 totaled 151,000 square feet as compared to 30,000 square feet during the first six months of 2007.</p>
          <p>As we discussed on the first quarter call, the decline in the Premium Outlet occupancy is primarily due to lease terminations or bankruptcies of four tenants comprising about a dozen spaces in the late March 2008 openings of Houston Premium Outlets and Phase II of Rio Grande Premium Outlets. We expect occupancy within the Premium Outlet portfolio to return to previous levels. Sales in the Mall portfolio, that is comparable sales, were $494 per square foot, up 1% as compared to the year earlier period. Sales continue to moderate due to the general weakening of the U.S. economy as well as our portfolio's exposure to Florida and California.</p>
          <p>Premium Outlet sales growth remained strong increasing 5.5% to $519 per square foot, driven by our Centers with substantial international tourist exposure. Comparable NOI for the Mall portfolio was 4. -- excuse me, 5.4% for the quarter, comparable NOI for the Premium Outlet portfolio was 7.3%. Year to date, comp NOI is up 3.7% for our Malls and 5.7% for the Outlets. The re-leasing spread for our Mall portfolio was $8.32 for the first six months, representing a 23.1% increase. The re-leasing spread for our Premium Outlet portfolio was $13.33 representing a strong 50% increase. Pricing power remains strong in the Outlet business due to low occupancy cost, continued sales growth, and ongoing demand for space from tenants.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Premium Outlet bankruptcy space that we mentioned earlier had a positive impact on the re-leasing, at double the previous rents. Effective cost control and continued conversion of tenants to fixed CAM resulted in continued higher recovery of common area maintenance expenses. To date, we're about 70% converted to fixed CAM.</p>
          <p>Interest income included in the other income line of our income statement was 11.5 million lower in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the prior year primarily related to our loans to Mills. The loans are now nearly 1 billion lower in 2008 than they were in the first six months of 2007. The Mills portfolio is performing at expectations if not above, and its contribution to our FFO was equivalent in the second quarter of '08 to the prior year as improved property performance and profit from managing the portfolio offset lower interest and fee income from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our development &#x2013; redevelopment pipeline remains intact and will be a contributor to future growth. We continue our focus on redevelopment and the expansion of franchise assets in the U.S., and new Premium Outlet development in the U.S. and Asia. Our recent U.S. openings include Pier Park and Hamilton Town Center and performing very well. Our Chelsea projects currently under construction including Jersey Shore opening later this year and Cincinnati Premium Outlets opening in the summer of '09. We remain very disciplined in the allocation of capital to only those projects that meet our return expectations.</p>
          <p>On May 12, we raised $700 million of five-year 5.3% notes and $800 million of 10-year 6.125 notes at a re-offer spread of treasuries plus 235 basis points. This pricing implies zero new issue premium on the new offer. We received over $5 billion of order for our bonds, and our issue was well timed as market conditions have deteriorated since then. We remain exceptionally well positioned following the bond offering. Our share of maturities in 2008 is less than 500 million evenly split between secured and unsecured debt. We also have approximately $2.8 billion of current capacity on our line as well as $500 million of cash on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Based upon our strong second quarter results, projected activity for the rest of the year, and our market -- and our view of market conditions, today we gave 2008 FFO guidance of $6.38 to $6.45 per share increasing the lower end of our previously provided range by $0.03. Please note that this guidance includes the impact of the second quarter extinguishment charge of $0.07 per share. This is particularly meaningful as when guidance was last given in early May, we were working toward exchanging the MOPPRS into new notes, which would have resulted in no charge being recognized.</p>
          <p>Finally let me just say before I open it up to questions, these are clearly challenging times but we're positioned -- well positioned to succeed in this environment. Our high quality and diverse portfolio &#x2013;  real estate, strong balance sheet, and robust infrastructure provide the necessary framework.</p>
          <p>On a final note, I'd also like to thank all of you for your support and confidence. We were pleased to be recognized by Greenwich Associates in June as having one of the best IR programs in corporate America.</p>
          <p>Operator, we're now available for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Gorman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. This question is for Steve, I think. Could you just spend a little bit of time going over the provisions for credit losses in the quarter? Obviously it was up a lot year-over-year and sort of in-line with what we saw in the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what went on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, you've got a couple of things. We take a relatively conservative tact in that when a tenant files for bankruptcy, we reserve 100% of the receivables. So with the tenants that are currently in bankruptcy including the recent filings by Steve &amp; Barry's, we are fully reserved for all of the receivables that were outstanding in June 30. I think when you couple that with just the fact that it's a tougher environment out there, and we've got receivables that are at a little bit higher level than they were a year ago, we think we're pretty conservative in how we provide for bad debt expense. And I wouldn't necessarily expect to see that run rate in the first half translate into full-year provisions, but you couple those two or three factors, and we kind of are where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the run rate should drop off a little bit from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think it would a little bit because with some of the tenants who are out there, we won't necessarily see a closing of all the stores, and so if they affirm some of the leases, then those receivables will come back to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Rick, just quickly, could you talk about what happened with the leasing spreads on the Community Center portfolio? I notice they went negative this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a relatively small inventory, so they are much more influenced by if there are a couple of box deals that are in there, but there is nothing -- the amount of activity in that portfolio is very small, so we can have a higher degree of deviation from quarter to quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess just what type of space was it that had a negative mark-to-market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were that we had basically we had a couple of boxes, and we had two CompUSA stores that closed and a Nordstrom Rack at Shops North East that closed. And the Rack was replaced by Barnes &amp; Noble, and we're working on the CompUSA</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wouldn't classify it as mark-to-market. What happens is you just take the opening versus the closing, and it's really -- it has nothing to do with marking to market, so it's not a -- we don't match the numbers. The average in and the average out, so it's not a mark-to-market issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And just final question, sorry if I missed this, but what was the loss from the unconsolidated entities in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's Mills extra depreciation expense. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Banc of America. Please proceed, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. David, you talked about how specifically Outlets have benefited from an increase in customer traffic as the dollar has weakened and international tourism has spiked. How much would you say that trend contributed to your sales growth in that portfolio and kind of anecdotally, can you give us a sense for how much you think traffic could be at risk as we have heard that airlines have started cutting international flights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far we haven't seen an impact on that. It certainly could be at risk, but I will say it's certainly adding I would say around 300 basis points, so 5%, but generally out of the 5%, so maybe 3% of it, but generally the Outlet business even in the &#x2013; across the portfolio, we're up, so it is having some added benefit, but not &#x2013; it's not the entire benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then regarding IN CITY plaza, what percentage occupied will the asset be when Wal-Mart opens in August and kind of what are you expecting in terms of a stabilized yield on the project, and can you give us a sense for have you learned anything from the development and lease-up of this first Center in China that you would do differently with the other four projects in process there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say I think it's essentially fully let. So it may be 98, 99%. I will tell you that the demand from the small shops is increasing. There's more tenants, but I will add that it is much more difficult to do business there. Rules on land values, on process, on debt continue to change, so we're taking a very deliberate and cautious approach. I think our going in yield is around 9. We expect it to at least achieve 10% by year three, and I will &#x2013; my general anecdote is that it is very difficult to do these deals, though we seem to be meeting with certain success. But it's going -- the proof will be when sales start to come in and tenants perform, so we're happy we're doing it but we're also happy there is only five of them at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then finally, Steve, given that your prior guidance range did not include an assumption for the extinguishment charge, can you kind of just walk us through what changed over the last three months to cause you to effectively raise your guidance for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Christy, I mean you have two or three things going on. One, we certainly have visibility not only into the rest of our '08 leasing activity, but we're well into leasing '09. Two, you have LIBOR where it is, but also the forward curve for LIBOR being where it is. And then three, I think the fact that we did go to the market and we were very successful in doing a $1.5 billion bond deal, that put us in a very good position related to our balance sheet for the rest of '08 and into '09. I think those are the three primary drivers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Ambika Goel is here with me as well. Maybe you can touch a little bit on the 2009 leasing, which I think, Steve, you just mentioned you're well into it and sort of talking about what tenants are and how those negotiations are going. You read an article in the Journal that lululemon is saying we're getting fewer built-in increases, we're having the ability to terminate our leases early, we have higher percentage rent threshold. I'm just wondering if that's just a special case or is that more the norm into your negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It ain't with us, okay? So, I guess my one point is don't always believe what you read. Look, tenants are -- I mean, the negotiation's always been a process, but I don't think we're doing, Michael, anything out of the ordinary or anything different given the more challenging economic times. So the demand is still there. Obviously we're going to have more spaces back, because certain tenants for all sorts of reasons have run into financial &#x2013; some because they were buy-out oriented, some because the category is not good, some because they're not great operators, and all of this comes to the forefront in a tough economic environment. But I will tell you unquestionably that we're not really changing how we -- that what we think is market rent, and what the terms are given the environment at all. So that -- now, I'm sure there are others that are doing it. Certainly the smaller guys that have lease-up that they've got to achieve, but we're not quite in that position. Rick, you can add anything to that, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing that I would say to you is that if anything, we are even more focused on our lease terms, and we are spending a great deal of time ensuring that the lease rental flow we are negotiating for we're going to get, and eliminating kick-outs, eliminating co-tenancy, and we have been successful in doing that. We are as we sit here today ahead of our '09 leasing in '08 than the pace we set in '0 &#x2013; when we were working last year. We have had a continuing emphasis on dealing with our tenants on a portfolio basis. When they come in, we're talking about '09 renewals as we're finalizing our '08 transactions and that is going to continue as we get further out ahead of our leasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you're saying you're ahead of how much --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are ahead in as we sit here today, we have more of our '09 leasing done in '08 than we had our '08 leasing done in '07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're more than 50% through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have between the things in process, we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how are the -- I know the rental spreads in the Mall portfolio this quarter came back at least for year to date toward your historical levels because there was some stuff I think in the first quarter that made it wide. Where are your sort of rent spreads as you're sort of rolling those leases next year coming out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's entirely consistent. We have not seen a change in that trend at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then can you comment on your appetite for acquisitions. Internationally, there has been speculation that you are looking into Europe and U.K., and then how &#x2013; given that your cost of capital has increased, how has that changed your appetite for acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're always thinking about how to appropriately grow the company, and one of the ways in doing that &#x2013; I think one of the ways we've been successful is through our acquisition activity. Sure, our cost of capital has increased, on the other hand, I think values have adjusted worldwide. The two of them potentially have in the sense gone hand in hand, so there is still that relationship. We look -- we have got the capacity to do transactions, but we're -- there is nothing imminent you're going to hear or read about, but we're always thinking about how to effectively grow our company and we'll continue to do that. I think this environment, frankly, gives us a little bit more opportunities than an environment, say, a year ago. So in that sense there is more to think about. But like I said, I mean the math has got to work over our analytic period before we do anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say that you're more focused on acquisitions in this kind of market relative to developments which you have been more focused on recently internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say development &#x2013; we're very fortunate in that we have got a platform in Chelsea where development yields continue to produce the results we want to do. I think as we look out -- look at the two platforms that we want to continue to develop new would be Chelsea if we can find the opportunities, and I think we still are very strong believers in redevelopment. I think what's clearly changed in our thinking is that the new ground-up development outside of Chelsea is at this point tougher to justify, and it's longer. The returns are going to be longer than we want to wait given the risk.</p>
          <p>So as we look out, I think that gives us a lot of financial wherewithal to look at other opportunities. Now, the product side, there's a lot of new development that is out, available, that's for sale &#x2013; kind of opened last year, opened the year before. The price expectations we think are still higher than what they should be, and in addition they're not very good. I mean that's the bottom line. They're not overly compelling properties, so we're not very excited about the individual acquisition market primarily because the quality is not there, and there is too much on the come given on the lease-up and given the pricing. So in that sense, we'll be patient. I don't know if I answered your question, but --.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David you said that you think values have adjusted worldwide. I mean if you could maybe pin that down. How much do you think A-mall cap rates in the U.S. even though we don't see them trade, how much do you think that they have moved if they were to trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when I was talking worldwide, I was really looking more at the -- my -- I was really talking about the public market, and I was really talking about worldwide public company equity values as opposed to cap rates on particular properties. I mean, all you have to do is look at what happened with the U.K. and the European property companies and a number of Asian companies in terms of the adjustments. So that's really what that comment was intended to reference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think then maybe that the implied cap rates for these companies is unfair given what you think is happening or going to happen in the private market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to pin that down, Paul, only because there has just been no trades. I do think if you had a -- an A to A+ quality asset, I don't think the cap rate has moved all that much. Probably certainly 50 basis points just to give you a number, but it would really &#x2013; so much depends on who's selling it, what the basis of selling it is, is it 100%, do you have a partner, do you get the management, and there has not been that kind of A+ unambiguous asset that's free of all of these other items to be able to pinpoint on. But it's safe to say, look, I think return expectations are certainly up, so it would be na&#xEF;ve to suggest that even on unambiguous quality stuff, that it hasn't moved up at least 50 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Rick, maybe regarding store closings. Do you think this year will be atypical in the sense that a lot of retailers from now through the holidays will try to hold out and then you would see more fall out in the first quarter, or do you think we might see more than average in the third and fourth quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, interestingly, I think it's been atypical in that typically you'll see your closings in the beginning of -- in January, after the December receipts, and we've seen the closings now come more in the second quarter. We still have a number of tenants that we're monitoring, and it remains to be seen, certainly they're going to want to remain in business as long as they can remain in business. And the key issue is whether they can get the support from the vendors and the factors to fund their business.</p>
          <p>I would point out and I think it's very important to point out that the vast majority of our tenants are in very good financial shape. And when you go through our top ten tenants, virtually none of them have debt at all. So, as David pointed out earlier, the ones that you're seeing have issues are either where they were private, private equity came in and very highly leveraged capital models that couldn't survive in this environment, or you have chains that are very well capitalized that are just going in a different strategic direction, and in those instances we're getting substantial lease buy-outs that are making it a profitable enterprise for us going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add, Paul, though it is &#x2013; we are going to have more store closings in '08 and in '09 than we did in '06 and '07. I mean there is no ambiguity about that. Now again, we still think the way we operate and the way we can -- we'll still be able to grow our cash flow, but we are going to have -- we're going to deal with more store closings in '08 and '09 than what we have at least in the last couple of years. The one thing I will say, at this point the cycle that we're in doesn't feel like or seem like anything different from a retail perspective that we haven't already dealt with previously, unfortunately numerous times. So at this point it feels like, seems like kind of something that we've done &#x2013; I'd say d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu all over again, but we've seen it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My last question on the Outlet spread for rents. Is that being driven by like the expansion in Orlando where the new Center is, or is this more -- how much of it is sort of same space versus -- ?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That didn't come online yet, so that would not be impacted by that. But a big chunk of it is because we got some of that Mikasa space back that was re-leased, but again, I mean I think as evidenced there is a lot of inherent value in those leases as they come up.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. It's actually Tom Baldwin . I'm here with Jay and Johan as well. Just trying to get a sense for the magnitude of the impact of California and Florida on your same store sales number. Could you provide what growth in comp sales per square foot would be ex those two states?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Steve. Florida is probably 100, could be as much as 150 bips, California a little less so, maybe 50 bips. So between the two, you're probably in the 150 to 200 bip range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's judgmental as opposed to scientific. I mean, we could obviously have that number, but we don't have it right in front of us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, guys. My second question, could you provide an update on lease-up at The Mills Regional Malls? I'm wondering if you've revised your expectations with regards to how long it will take to close the occupancy gap between The Mills and your core Mall portfolio given how much the environment has deteriorated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the actual Mills side is actually doing well. Now The Mills did have -- does have a significant exposure to Steve &amp; Barry's. So, but actually the Malls -- I'm sorry, the inside of The Mills we're making pretty good progress, and I would tell you, generally all of the assets are trending up except one or two from both sales and new occupancy and things going on there. So there is clearly a benefit we're seeing as the consumer moves a little more toward value in today's environment. Now, the setback being Steve &amp; Barry's is something we're going to have to approach, but I would say generally speaking, we're in pretty good shape there. On the Mall side, the Mall side is taking a little bit more time. A couple of those &#x2013; we're being brought down by a couple that were repositioning their big centers, so like a Southdale is bringing down the average pretty significantly as we try and reposition that asset in a meaningful and significant way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What's your best guess in terms of how long it might take to break the 98% level in The Mills Regional Malls portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have that right in front of us, but we're working on it every day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my final question relates to Hamilton Town Center. I noticed that the leasing level at delivery on that Center was a little bit lighter than you'd expect at 79%. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what transpired there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically it's going according to plan. This is a -- some of the development you do or you -- if you do do it, is going to be a little bit early, and in this case we always knew going in that it was a little bit early. So we're not completely dissatisfied or we're not completely off the mark on the 80, and I think we'll over the next year or so, we'll get it well into the average, the 90 plus percentile. It's a little early. It's doing very well. It's not a big transaction for us. So it's getting the returns we thought it would get.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, good morning. David, just going back to Outlet Center dynamics and sales trends there a little bit, could you maybe add a little bit of color with regards to how much you mentioned the boost from the international activity, but you see much of an impact from just consumers just going to lower price points and then what kind of impact is that maybe being offset by just the higher gasoline prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so far I will tell you, Lou, that this theory that people aren't going to go to an Outlet Center because it costs too much to drive there, I don't know where the science behind that is but we are certainly not seeing that in any respect. And as I said, of the 39 Premium Outlet Centers, we had one that was down, one or two that were down primarily because they're at the lower end of the one or two, and one was actually outside Indianapolis. We had a flood during June which thankfully the Center wasn't hurt, but it did affect the -- it did affect the ability to get there. So I haven't seen that, Lou, we haven't seen that, and if anything, I think people are seeing the benefit, we're seeing that a little bit in Mills where people are seeing the benefit of value oriented shopping, and they're offsetting that against whatever incremental cost it is to go out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have -- we could probably do a lot of analysis to get to the specific numbers, but I don't have that in front of me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. And then Steve, question for you just on the JV debt maturities. Can you give just a little bit of an update on that and maybe just some color on the status of the mortgage market right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the status of the mortgage market is still much lower loan to values. The life companies are there but cannot be there in size, and so once you get above a couple of hundred million dollars, you're really talking about pairing up people. In terms of our specific maturities -well, I'd make one other comment, was that the CMBS market is still virtually nascent and just don't expect any recovery there in the near term. And then with respect to our maturities, both on the consolidated portfolio and the JV portfolio, what we have coming due in the next 18 months is all relatively good assets at relatively modest leverage loan to values, and so feel very comfortable about our ability to rework those loans. And obviously given the bond deal that we just completed, we are exceptionally well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's actually Dave Fick here with Nate. Most of my questions have been answered. Can you comment a little bit about (a) how much NOI you're getting out of Florida, and what you're seeing in terms of traffic there, and what you expect to happen over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The NOI, our share of NOI in Florida, to be specific is 13.2%. It's in our 8-K, and I think what we said earlier, the first quarter call was basically pretty much online. There are a number of Centers in Florida that are doing extremely well, and what I'd call the traditional suburban mall in Florida is underperforming compared to what it's &#x2013; how it's performed over the last couple of years. Now the predominance of what generates that NOI obviously is our big-time Centers. So Dadeland at Boca, Sawgrass Mills, Florida Mall, The Falls in Miami, to name a few, Aventura, is all still going very, very strong. Where you may see -- where you have seen some sales underperformance, not leasing underperformance, but really sales underperformance would be the malls &#x2013; kind of the suburban traditional mall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually we're very bullish on that, and the demand I think -- this is Dave -- the demand is very strong. And this was the site that a number of developers wanted to build a high-end center, and some of the redevelopment took place in Cincinnati proper. That demand was reduced, so we feel very bullish about it and I think we'll pull off a great mix and a great return, and I think it will have very good sales productivity. So --.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the ultimate test is that we're opening in August of 2009, and we're already 40% leased with very good receptivity, and the products that we build are frankly designed to be the dominant outlet channel in their market and we fully expect that we're going to repeat that in Cincinnati.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is maybe a Rick question. I'm just curious as to some of the tenants that you're talking to right now to potentially backfill Steve &amp; Barry's and to a lesser extent Linens 'n Things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been working on the Steve &amp; Barry's portfolio for over a month. An important thing to point out is that in the Simon portfolio, the vast majority of our Steve &amp; Barry's are relatively smaller sized stores in small shop space and not all department store spaces. So in addition to having it out to a number of alternative anchors and depending on the markets, we're talking to Ethan Allen, ESW, Maggiano's, Nordstrom Racks, Sports Authority, Saks OFF Fifth, A.J. Wright, Ross Dress for Less, Medieval Times, that's more in The Mills Outlet, Target, more in The Mills portfolio. We also have an ability to just reconvert that space back to small shop. It's not particularly deep and it has a great deal of frontage on the mall, so not only are we having our traditional box teams look at it but our small shop leasing people are also simultaneously looking to chop it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you that to give you a specific anecdote with respect to that, Livingston Mall is a great example. We did a Steve &amp; Barry's probably three or four years ago, and we debated it, we thought about it, and we said, you know what, we haven't figured out how we want to reposition the Mall. So come in and fill space. We never really thought that maybe it was a temporary gap measure, and in fact as we have renovated Livingston, we're bringing Barnes in, we've redone the food court. And now we want the space back, and we're going to chop it up, and it's 50-yard line space, so same thing in The Source in New York, so it's interesting. It was kind of in some cases it was the path of least resistance, and I should say in a lot of cases in the Mall portfolio was the path of least resistance, and now I think we're going to turn the small shop or turn it back into small shop space in a number of Centers which obviously will generate more NOI in the long run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if you can believe it, this will be an another question on the Cincinnati Outlets. I'm just wondering what direction you can work with The Mills in? I mean given 120 shop Outlet 20-minute drive away sort of limits moving in that direction. What can you do with The Mills at this point since that note ?</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Just kind of building off of the Steve &amp; Barry's bankruptcy. We've also heard some rumors in the market about Mervyns and potentially Bosco's heading down a similar path given what's happening and the vendor impact to the communities. And while your exposure to these particular anchors is not very large, it must concern you to some degree. Can you share your opinion on what you see happening to this particular segment of the department store industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean I think the fact of the matter is Mervyns &#x2013; Mervyns has always -- we have always earmarked Mervyns to go away. And the fact of the matter is the fact that it's lasted this long is a testament to the guys that own it and operate it. It's just been out positioned between Penny and Target. Bosco's has always been a kind of unique retailer and did things a little bit different. Now, they got a different capital structure and I think that's put in a little bit more pressure on them, but from a uniqueness of in terms of retail, actually in some markets have performed reasonably well, so it's not a performance issue. It's more a capital structure issue. I think Mervyns is simply Target-Penny squeeze, and we would look to reclaim that space and operate look for those. I don't think it's any -- you see very similar tenants like Penny that are performing reasonably well, and it's just that Mervyns was an afterthought at Target and it's not something that we haven't anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we're not going to see maybe any big consolidation happening for these lower end department stores you'd say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think it will be -- I think it will boil down to real estate play. I do think Bosco's has a little bit different retail angle that maybe able to at a different capital market structure may be able to operate accordingly. I think they're more constrained capital, they do things different from a retail point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then last question: you talked about your China investment garnering say a 9% going in yield. Are there any major structural differences in how leases are signed there versus how you do them here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean there are lots of them, because let's face it. And this is what I think we all have to be sensitive about this sexy overseas development &#x2013; the right to pursue tenants if they don't pay is a lot different in a lot of different markets. And so I think our big issue is if a lot of these tenants don't perform, how do you get rent? We don't know yet, we're not confronted with underperformance, but the laws associated with that are a lot different. Now these are longer term leases. I mean, the leases look a lot like ours in terms of rent, and fixed common area reimbursements and the like.</p>
          <p>The real issue though is if performance isn't there and they don't pay, do you have an issue? Now, it's interesting in Japan, which I like this system I'd like to bring it to the U.S., is what they do is they collect sales from the actual customer, and then they send the retailer everything but what the landlord's share is. We're actually putting that in China as well, but it's the process of that hasn't been adjudicated. So it's a risk. That's why we'd like to see higher returns. It's a huge market. We're doing this in R&amp;D. We have executed the plan the way we thought, but we're very, very cautious in a lot of future opportunities there until we get a better handle on exactly that question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. You mentioned earlier about being harder to lease-up new development space, harder to justify it. Can you take a minute and talk about the pace of leasing and the appetite for space when you're looking at the redevelopment projects, particularly the ones where you're adding new shop GLA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends. There are -- we have a lot more scrutiny and ability to execute, not that we have had execution problems, but the days of &#x2013; oh the tenant is interested, let's build it &#x2013; are done. So it's a function of who the tenant is, how much we can rely on their good faith intentions, and our judgment. It's a judgment call. Now we've been doing this a long time. So our judgment here ought to be pretty good. Our track record is pretty good. But the intense focus has certainly increased because we got to rely on the tenant. We got to rely on our people in terms of what they can deliver, and there will be a few instances where we are going to slow it down just to make sure that we can pull it off as pro forma.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing in the redevelopment area, because you're adding tenants to an already demonstrated productive property, it is an easier proposition. And if you look at the redevelopment program, we've added Nordstrom to Burlington, we're opening in the spring of next year Nordstrom at Northshore, the year after it's Nordstrom in South Shore, Nordstrom is opening at Keytone Fashion this fall, opening at Tacoma this fall. While in all of those instances where we're adding incremental small shop space, we're substantially improving the market share of the property, and it's an easier proposition to attract the retailer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would say we just don't have a lot of risk. To us we want -- if we add GLA, we want it 100% leased. The risk we have is it's 90% leased. I mean, the deviation from our plan to the results is not going to be all that material, yet it's going through a further level of scrutiny given the environment that we live in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So for new ground-up development non-Chelsea in the U.S., it sounds like that's slowing. Chelsea, it sounds like the pace is keeping up. If we're looking at the redevelopment expenditures say '07, '08 levels versus 2009, 2010 expectations, do you think it's -- the capital spend is still about in the same ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say clearly new ground-up ex-Chelsea you're right, I mean it is. The only thing that we have opening in '09, it's really Phase II of Phase I which is Domain, and then we had three or four others that we have back-burnered for all sorts of reasons, not all of which are the current economic environment, but they were early projects and there is no reason to push it. On redevelopment, we're on the straddle of a couple, but I think it's safe to say that I think redevelopment in '09 will be similar to '08 though it could be less. I don't think it will be more, and like I said, there are a couple of projects that we're straddling. The good news is &#x2013; I look at it, both -- I mean, obviously you want redevelopment because it's accretive, on the other hand if we don't and we want to hold on it, our cash flow increases from after dividend and so on, and there is nothing like firepower in an uncertain economic environment.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. David, I guess a two-part question for you on just the outlook for occupancy more broadly. Given your experience with cyclical downturns and retail space demand &#x2013; the time it can take for retailer appetites to change to absorb that excess space, when do you think mall occupancy in the U.S. as a whole will maybe find its bottom? Is that a 2009 event, or do you think it will be far into 2010 and do you think we'll see much variability in the performance between A and B malls over that time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's tough, because we're I think kind of in the downturn -- we're in the first half of the downturn, let's say. Okay? So it's a very tough judgmental call. I do think we'll see the worst of it manifest itself in '09, not '10. But a lot of the story hasn't been written, and clearly the trend of better properties getting better and worse properties getting worse is only going to accelerate in a tough economic environment. But it is -- that trend has been with us for quite some time, and I don't -- it will accelerate a little bit, but it's not going to be a dramatically different outcome in that I think good properties are going to continue to get better, and bad properties are going to get worse.</p>
          <p>And I don't look at it so much A or B. I look at market share, the property getting better, what's the -- what are the demographics, what is the trade area, et cetera. So that trend I think is with us, and has been with us for quite some years. Now, on the other hand, we've had some Centers that have really underperformed that we actually had some very interesting development plans, and that's the big delta that I mentioned earlier. But if we can pull off some of the things we're working on, we have some real upside in some of these and we have already suffered through the downside. So that remains to be seen. But I think '09 is going to be a little bit of a -- we're going to use '09 to bounce back, the industry I should say, because you're going to see more stores closing because of the credit situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess building on that, maybe this one is for Rick, since the kiosk and temporary tenant business I would say probably tends to skew more towards a less sophisticated operator than perhaps your typical in-line tenant, any sense of how this economic environment is weighing on appetite for rental demand from those tenants particularly as we near the holiday season where it's more dominant for the mall business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far we have, and this is as of June 30, we are on track to hit our budgets in those businesses for 2008. So it's one of the things as we have been, we're very focused on the leasing, as we get a little more space back from the small shops closing that's incremental inventory for that business. And that's on track still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how are your rents typically structured there? As a percentage of sales or just fixed rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's fixed rate plus a percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one last question for Steve. I don't want to leave you out. For your 2008 guidance, can you just tell us what's implied I guess from an occupancy perspective for the back half of 2008 versus where you were in the same period of 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, continuation of the environment that we're in right now, and I think it would be reasonable to say that we're expecting occupancy to be lower at 12/31/08 in the Malls than it was at 12/31/07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the occupancy, I mean there is a lot of occupancy stuff that is out of our hands because we do have some tenants that are in Chapter 11. Whether they reject their assumed leases is out of our hands, so as precise as we would like to be, precision is not available to us at this point. With that said we're going to grow our comp NOI in the way that we've described it, and that's going to be a function of temporary tenants and the like, and so on. But pinpointing occupancy is going to be a little bit tricky given at this point it's a little bit out of our control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm curious then, do you think there's a chance that your year-end '09 then is lower than your year-end '08 or just too difficult to say right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Hey, Rick, you had a good list of tenants that might be available to backfill Steve &amp; Barry's and I was wondering who in the small shop space is opening stores? Who stands out for you as particularly strong in that arena?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're doing a lot of business now with Forever 21, with Sephora, with Apple, Coach is still opening stores. Tilley is coming out of California, Zumiez, Express, Abercrombie, American Eagle with aerie. Abercrombie is rolling out Gilly Hicks, we still have substantial demand across the portfolio from tenants. GameStop is still opening stores. Liz Claiborne is converting from a wholesale distribution channel to a retail distribution channel, so they're opening Lucky Jeans, Lucky Kids, Kate Spade, and Juicy Couture stores. H&amp;M &#x2013; we're doing a lot of business with H&amp;M. So there is still a great deal of activity here and the tenor of the demand is strong. And echoing David's point, the good malls are getting better, and supply almost is -- demand is almost inelastic in those better properties. It's subject to downtime just to reconfigure and re-lease the space, but we could add more space to our better properties and have demand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you thinking of those names for 2009, 2010? Is that where their interest is? I mean I assume 2008 is mostly done, so not as important, but 2009, 2010 both -they have interest in both years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, Rich, as an example, we just refinanced Stanford which is obviously an A+ asset, and yeah, the demand at that end of the quality spectrum is obviously better, but even then you run into two challenges: One is loan to values because the underwriting is very conservative, and two, the big malls are obviously worth a lot, and so if you want to put an appropriate loan to value piece of debt on the property, you're either going have to do it through the bank market or you're going to have to involve multiple life companies in some kind of club deal .</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. David, you mentioned earlier a little bit about getting more restrictive on some of your lease terms. Can you just talk about the existing leases, what kind of co-tenancy exposure you have especially to some of the names on your top anchor list like a Sears or a Dillard's or Bon-Ton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would depend on the Center, but not that much really. I mean, usually if there is any co-tenancy, it's at a four department store mall and maybe two anchors. The fact of the matter is if the anchors are going out of business, you don't really have those tenants anyway, so it's somewhat of a &#x2013; I can't recall anywhere where co-tenancy is really affected us financially. So it's a thing here or there, but it's really not for us a material financial issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And well, Michael, probably three four years ago now, we also started writing in those instances where there are co-tenancy "show harm" provisions, so it's just not the event. It's the event then coupled with a sales decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry if I missed this, but when you were discussing acquisitions earlier, do any of those opportunities include buying back space at existing centers that you don't own?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not -- I would say at this point nothing major is happening there. Sure, occasionally a good &#x2013; like Rick whispered to me Sharper Image. I guess a good example of demand for retail space is Sharper Image is liquidating, and we had to actually bid on some of our leases because there were hostile retailers bidding on it, and even though we love that retailer in this particular few malls we didn't want that retailer in that particular space. So we had to pony up some money to buy the leases from the estate, so yeah, we're doing that in cases. When it comes to the big department stores, we're still -- there's a bid and ask there that is a normal process with us, so we are going to be buying some anchor spaces over the next few years, but there is a value gap between the owner and what we want to pay for it at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only thing I would add is that, as David said, this is not new business for us. I mean, we acquired a lot of stores from Macy's when they merged with May, we have acquired stores from Belk we've acquired stores from Lord and Taylor, and we've been able to very effectively redeploy those assets to make our properties better. And if you go back in past 8-Ks, you'll see the capital we spent and the returns we got through those redeployments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just one follow-up for Rick. Rick, as you talk about I think your leasing plan and you're talking about being ahead of pace for 2009, how does that leasing plan for '09 compare to what it was for '08? You're dealing with about six million square feet of scheduled roll in the Mall portfolio. How much did you increase your store closures, how much did you increase your bankruptcy expectations, relative to the '08 plan?</p>

          <p>Well, it's not a plan per se, Michael. It's really a productivity measure. What we track is what results we are generating, so we have basically told our teams that we need to be far further ahead in our expiration, then so our teams are now working on '09 and 2010 expirations so we can get further and further out ahead of the tenants in the planning. So it isn't really a plan per se that we said we wanted to be at, we are tracking it against our past performance and every year we're getting better in getting further out ahead of the expirations so we can be proactive in dealing with these spaces rather than reactive.</p>

          <p>I would just add to that, Michael, that we are clearly aware of inventory -- the inventory has increased just because take an example, demo is out of business. We decided to work with PacSun, take a lease termination payment and then added that to the inventory. So the inventory -Sharper Image is obviously added to the inventory, and even guys that are in 11 where we don't know exactly -- say Whitehall &#x2013; where we don't know exactly what space we may or may not get back depending on the outcome of that proceeding, our people are leasing as if they don't exist. And so the inventory's increased, yet we're fully aware of it, and we're obviously shopping the inventory to the best of our abilities.</p>

          <p>Thanks. David, with the limited acquisitions and more difficult development environment, is it more likely you'll be a buyer of your stock around these levels?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess &#x2013; we have been very conservative given the world in terms of capital at this point, I think we're going to &#x2013; we still have the open to buy, we're still ready to take advantage of volatility. Yet we're -- prudence at this point is not an unwanted asset, so we're going to be very prudent as we think about that.</p>
