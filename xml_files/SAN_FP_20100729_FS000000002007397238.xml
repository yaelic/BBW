          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the sanofi-aventis 2010 Second Quarter and Half Year Results Conference Call. I'll now hand over to Mr. S&#xE9;bastien Martel, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, everyone, and welcome to the sanofi-aventis Q2 2010 conference call. As you know, our slides are available for download on our website. As always, I must advise you that the information presented in today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. These may cause actual results to differ materially. So please refer to our Form 20-F on file with the SEC and also our Document de R&#xE9;f&#xE9;rence for a description of some of these factors. The company undertakes no obligations to update forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to highlight that we have enhanced our regional revenue disclosure this quarter. We are now providing product sales breakdown for the following 4 regional headings: Western Europe, the US, emerging markets and rest of the world, which we are defining as Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. And so we've also posted on our website today quarterly historical consolidated sales data by geographic region as of Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>Now with us today on the call are our CEO, Chris Viehbacher; our President, Global Operations, Hanspeter Spek; our Senior Vice President, Vaccines, Wayne Pisano; and our Executive VP, Chief Financial Officer, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;bastien. Good afternoon, good morning, everybody. I understand that the Bayer call starts at 3:30, so we are going to try to get this call wrapped up, so that everybody can get all the calls in today. I'm going to start with the first slide, which really shows the evolution of sales and business earnings per share for the first half and you can see that sales increased at a constant exchange rate of 2.2% and earnings per share at 10.1%. Now and obviously in the second quarter sales were slightly down at 1.2% at constant exchange rate and profits though were still up 4.5%.</p>
          <p>The second quarter is actually something that we're actually quite satisfied about. It's not necessarily the highest profit growth this company has ever shown, but as you will see later, given how much money we have actually seen lost to the generic competition, I think to be able to show this profit growth despite that significant sales erosion to generics, it really demonstrates the resilience of the underlying business and to a great degree starting to describe kind of an, if you like, an older sanofi-aventis and the new sanofi-aventis, where the older sanofi-aventis was really the PLAVIX, Taxotere, Ambien, ELOXATINE, Avapro and of course we know that those sales will have declined significantly in Europe and the US over the next 2 to 3 years.</p>
          <p>But if you then look at slide 6, you're seeing a very strong growth of our growth platforms. So emerging markets, up 25.9% on a reported basis, 12.5% on a constant exchange rate basis. Those sales represent 30% of the group sales today. Nobody in this industry has more sales in emerging markets than we do. The 12.5% was drawn down a little bit by Turkey and the result of the price cut. But if you actually look at the BRIC-M countries, they were growing at close to 30%. This is a huge opportunity. I think this is probably the single biggest area of under valuation by the investor community. When I talk to CEOs in other industries, everybody wants to talk about emerging markets. But our industry is still one where you're going to get more questions about a product than a market. And we had our executive committee in China last week and there was just again a reminder of the significant opportunity that we have in emerging markets. The world population outside of US, Europe and Japan is over 5 billion people and today, folks that's where the economic growth is occurring and the more there is economic growth, the more people spend on healthcare.</p>
          <p>Diabetes, huge opportunity for us. And when, if you had looked at slides last year, we'd have talked about LANTUS. Last year, LANTUS was one of a number of products. Hanspeter will talk a little bit more about this but I think we now look at that as a diabetes business. Over 280 million people around the world suffer from this disease and it's a market that is essentially going to be dominated by 2 players going forward.</p>
          <p>Vaccines, very strong performance due to H1N1. Other vaccine sales, and Wayne will comment on that, partly affected by the fact that packaging and filling capacity was needed for H1N1 which has caused some displacement of sales of other vaccines.</p>
          <p>Consumer healthcare, for a company that didn't even really think of itself as being in the consumer healthcare business 18 months ago, here we have &#x20AC;1 billion in the first 6 months, growing at 56.3%, obviously helped by acquisitions. But even the underlying growth rate when we strip out the acquisitions of 15.5% is very significant. And you just add those numbers up and you can see that the growth platforms are already over 50% of the company's sales.</p>
          <p>Of course, we've also seen the successful launch of new products. MULTAQ is doing extremely well. We have a presence in a number of markets and we are very happy to see support from reimbursement authorities in UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain. I have been seeing a lot of launches of products in Europe. It's fairly rare to get that kind of level of endorsement from reimbursement authorities in such a concentrated period of time and I think underscores the value proposition of MULTAQ.</p>
          <p>Jevtana, also out of the blue, here we have a drug that was one of the fastest drugs ever approved by the FDA on oncology. And that's really based on the significant benefit that you get on advanced prostate cancer. So we were able to not only get that approved but turned around and launched in the US market and we'll be filing in obviously other markets shortly as well.</p>
          <p>Animal health continues to progress. This is really our sixth growth platform and it doesn't always get described as a growth platform, because we don't consolidate sales. But this is a business when you combine it with Intervet, has before divestments anyway, sales of over $5.3 billion. If you take the implied value of Merial of $8 billion and the implied value of Intervet at the time of the announcement of the merger, you got a business that would have on a standalone basis a value of something between 16 and $17 billion. I mean an extremely interesting business, certainly not the type of business that I knew when I was first involved with animal health 20 years ago.</p>
          <p>So if I turn now to page 7, you can see again the hit really that we've taken. The patent cliff is here. And this has become part of day-to-day business. We have lost over &#x20AC;500 million of sales of ELOXATINE in the United States. Now we have an agreement with generic companies that they will cease selling in the US as of 30 of June. There will of course be some time before we see any benefit from that because they will have filled the pipeline for supply, so we need to see stock levels burn off before we benefit from that and we estimate that to be sometime in early 2011.</p>
          <p>PLAVIX in Europe, obviously generics are now <mark type="audio gap" /> competition, but we've had over &#x20AC;100 million of growth in Japan <mark type="audio gap" /> by 50%, the other is increasing by almost 50%. Allegra continues to decline by 100 million but we have of course filed our OTC switch file back in March and all of that is progressing well.</p>
          <p>If l go to the next slide, I'm not going to take you through everything, but one development that we have is that we actually now have a pipeline chart. We have not always had one and not certainly one we always believed in and I think we are starting to actually see significant signs of progress, particularly in the oncology area and diabetes area. All of that licensing and partnering activity that we have been engaged in has been very helpful to rebuilding our pipeline. And we have a number of headline data that come along and I'll show you that in a minute.</p>
          <p>And if I go to the next slide, we also have a very strong pipeline in vaccines with the Japanese encephalitis vaccine coming along. We also have an intradermal micro-injection for the US that come along. We will be filing Menactra in markets outside of the US but more importantly, we've just filed on the infant/toddler in the US. And you can see that we actually have quite a robust pipeline.</p>
          <p>And now if I move to the next slide, we will have some milestones coming up in really the next 6 months. We have a number of Phase III data coming out, particularly for lixisenatide or our GLP-1, which we will develop as a standalone but also in combination with LANTUS. I think when I look at what has happened in the competitive landscape that lixisenatide, just even on a standalone basis, has suddenly seen its profile enhanced. At the time we questioned really developing the standalone given that we thought that would be once weekly products, now that doesn't look so likely. You know the once weeklies are going to be strong and I think a product that combines a GLP-1 and allows you to have a titratable dose on insulin is one of the most interesting products in diabetes today.</p>
          <p>On our VEGF Trap, aflibercept, we will see data in second-line colorectal cancer. We have the VELOUR interim analysis coming along. We have a product called Temusi, which would be one of the very first gene therapies in lower limb ischemia. We have teriflunomide Phase III data coming along in multiple sclerosis and of course we will start the Phase III with that combination of LANTUS and lixisenatide that we talked about.</p>
          <p>So we are starting to see some progress, to give a little bit more of an opportunity to talk about, not so much the pipeline but how we see research and development evolving given that we are spending still significant amounts of shareholder money on that. We will be doing an investor seminar at the end of September initially focusing on diabetes and oncology and we would welcome all of you to attend that.</p>
          <p>Going along to page 11. Last year we did 33 partnerships, licenses and acquisitions. We spent &#x20AC;6.5 billion last year, 2009. In the last 18 months, we have spent close to &#x20AC;9 billion. You can see from this slide that we continue to maintain the same level of, pace of deal making that we did last year. As I think I mentioned at the end of the first quarter, one of the advantages we actually have is that having done a proper clean out of our R&amp;D portfolio, this has given us the capacity both in terms of people and budget really to be able to use the infrastructure we have to bring in promising products from outside and then to look at &#x2013; and then to develop those. So and that's what's starting to rebuild the portfolio. What you can also see is that we are still very disciplined about this because R&amp;D expenditures are very tightly under control. We have reduced the ratio of R&amp;D to sales again this year and we've been able to bring all these deals in largely because we have been able to take out a big chunk of our costs, fixed costs in particular, that were devoted to internal projects and now we are able to invest in external projects.</p>
          <p>We are also starting to take a much different view to R&amp;D expense, in the sense that I'm not really looking at R&amp;D to fail so much as what is the percentage of fixed costs to variable. In particular, I think we look at R&amp;D expenses, the amount needed to fund kind of the ongoing infrastructure of R&amp;D, if you like, the sites, the people and the like. And then, we're starting to look at R&amp;D projects in a similar way to looking at capital projects. So we now are starting to assess the budget in two ways where obviously the infrastructure costs are something that you really want to maximize and get the most efficiency out of. The projects then have to wash their face in terms of return on investment and potential to add growth.</p>
          <p>Next slide is on, you have seen just this week that we put out an announcement, we've appointed a new CEO to a company that we are now formally going to call Merial-Intervet. This is a company, as I said earlier, that has over $5.3 billion in sales prior to divestitures. The combination value is 16.5 billion. We would expect the transaction still to close in Q1 of 2011. Everything that we have seen is confirming the level of synergies and level of divestments that we had anticipated. Integration continues to go well. So, this is an important business for us. As you look at the rising income levels, people do eat more protein, you have a rising population and they have to be fed. But one shouldn't forget the pet business either because we have seen that there is an interesting correlation between rising income and the willingness to have pets.</p>
          <p>So, finally then we'll go to slide 13. And obviously the business has suffered from some generic erosion but you've seen that the investments we've made in the growth platforms are really compensating for this. And that's going to be a trend we're going to see going forward into this year, into next year. Obviously this has all been married with some tight cost control and J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me will give you some more color commentary on that. But I think we have got a fair discipline, not only on just the absolute amounts we spend, but how we allocate resources.</p>
          <p>So the business is actually on track. We have changed our guidance. Our guidance previously was 2 to 5% earnings per share growth, not assuming any generic for LOVENOX, though as of Friday evening, of course we can't assume that anymore. So the difference really between the 2 to 5% is really an estimated impact on LOVENOX. Obviously the actual financial impact of LOVENOX is still difficult to determine. We haven't got immediate clarity yet as to how much of the market, the generic can supply. And at this point in time, price reductions by the generics seem to be relatively modest. So it may be that the erosion curve is less aggressive than with some other entries but obviously to the extent that other generics come in or there is greater supply, that might change, and hence the range.</p>
          <p>We were surprised by the timing at least of that. Obviously there have been a number of rumors around for quite some time. We talked about that also at the first quarter. It was unusual to see the approval of this in a week where Congress was essentially criticizing the handling of the heparin scandal in China two years ago. And we also believe that from a technical point of view the FDA in using immunogenicity data from the generic company has really violated the law really on how generics get approved. Normally it is the originator dossier that is used and under the statute in which this was approved as a substitutable generic, it would be unusual to request additional data. So we have contested that. We've contested also the fact that they have approved a substitutable generic since the FDA has standing guidance that low molecular weight heparins are not substitutable.</p>
          <p>And finally obviously, we don't believe that there's been an adequate response to the citizen's petition, which really points out the significant body of scientific evidence to suggest that there are risks to approving a substitutable generic without a clinical trial. And it's interesting obviously that the FDA would be now much more aggressive than other agencies around the world, Europe, Canada, and Australia having said that they want a clinical trial.</p>
          <p>Guidance does include the effect of U.S. healthcare reform as well as the recent EU price cuts and of course, as always, it bars any unforeseen major events. But I think largely the business is on track. I think we had a very strong quarter, given what headwinds we were facing and again I think you're really starting to see the emergence of a new sanofi-aventis that will allow us to grow beyond the patent cliff period.</p>
          <p>So with that, Hanspeter, perhaps I will turn that over to you to take us into a little bit more detail on how the business has developed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everybody. If you switch please to page number 15, you'll find in a rather schematic but also impressive way how the sales results of the first 6 months of 2010 have been constructed. You see that we have lost approximately &#x20AC;1 billion due to generification of our major products. On the other side, we have driven growth on the 5 platforms of growth, totaling 1.2 billion. From other initiatives, we have announced approximately 100 million of incremental sales and yes, we have also benefited from a positive ForEx impact equal to close to &#x20AC;300 million. So in a nutshell, the good performance of the first half is due to the fact that we have over compensated what we have lost due to generics.</p>
          <p>On page 16, then more focus on one of our flagships in so called emerging markets and the performance within. You see then that we have obtained sales of close to 2.3 billion in the second quarter alone. This is a growth of approximately 13% at constant exchange rates and even 23% on a reported basis. The so-called BRIC dot M countries grow even stronger by nearly 31% with sales very close to 850 million. We have other content, which is split of sales, you see we have on the left side of the chart, an equal share in Western Europe, 29%; USA, 31%; and in the emerging markets, 29%. And as the new reporting section, you see for the first time rest of the world, which mainly consists Japan and beside also Australia and New Zealand. So we of course hope that this will help you to understand our performance even better.</p>
          <p>On page 17, a focus on our presence in diabetes. We have a growth with LANTUS alone in the second quarter of close to 11% or 17% on a reported basis, sales of 926 million. During our last quarter call, I introduced you to the fact that we see the need to accelerate our investment in the diabetes market, especially in the US. We have done so. We believe that we'll see a first positive reaction to this is in terms of prescription, in terms of our overall growth. The market definitely is today much more competitive than, let's say, 1 or 2 years ago due to the various new products entering the market during this period and of course accelerated investment of our competitors.</p>
          <p>We believe that overall it is not at all only LANTUS, which is driving our presence in diabetes care. No, there is also good performance of Amaryl, which is a product largely promoted of course outside of the United States because it's a product which has lost during the last 4 or 5 years already its patent protection. But you see in an impressive manner we are able to continue to grow this product mainly into the rest of world and into developing markets by close to 10% and we are equally satisfied this 20% growth of Apidra.</p>
          <p>On the lower right side of the page, you find a picture of one of the various devices we are currently developing together with AgaMetrix and which we intend to launch by the end of this year 2010 and very early 2011 in the United States and in Europe. In fact we will introduce the whole program to the market at the occasion of the upcoming Congress of the European Society for Diabetes which takes place in late September in Stockholm. So, we more and more have a really holistic approach to this market, attacking in this oral product, evidently this, our insulin product, with blood glucose monitoring and evidently also with future products to come.</p>
          <p>On page 18, then a focus on the 2 new products currently being launched. Chris already had alluded that we are content with the acceleration of absolute sales of MULTAQ in the second quarter. There is more to come as Chris equally has outlined. We are preparing currently the launch in 3 major markets in Europe, France, Italy and Spain. We're very content to have obtained the totally homogeneous prices level in all of those 3 markets, also very in line with the price we already had obtained before in the UK and in Germany, a pricing that's very small spend, at between &#x20AC;225 per day and approximately 250.</p>
          <p>We have gotten approval for Jevtana, cabazitaxel in the USA in a record time. We also have managed to launch the product in a record time, this in less than 4 weeks after approval. I have attended the launch conference. We have an extremely positive expectation from oncologists in the United States for a disease which is otherwise today not treatable and we are very confident to see here a rather positive launch, we are out there since approximately 2 weeks. And what we hear so far is absolutely in line with this. We believe that the product has more potential to come. You see on the chart that we expect CHMP opinion for the second quarter for 2011. And yes we have initiated the necessary steps to take the product into other settings and first of all to the very closed setting of first-line prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>On page 19, a totally different angle to 2 major products. What is the future for those 2 major products being under generic threat, PLAVIX and LOVENOX. So on PLAVIX, first of all you see that as we speak today the performance of PLAVIX in the US is positive, it's a growth of above 7%, and yes the sales which are currently under threat from generics represent only 12% on a worldwide level. We feel it is really important to underline that what we are losing in Europe, which has been in the second quarter approximately 200 million is exactly compensated just by 2 markets, which means the growth we achieved in Japan and China where we have obtained 189 million with an extremely high growth rate of 42%. It is worth mentioning that PLAVIX beside continues to grow in all other Asian markets and also in South America.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the chart, LOVENOX. Sales have been growing by 5.5%, 866 million during the second quarter. Chris has outlined our position with the recent approval of a generic in the United States. I'm sure you'll get back to the issue during the Q&amp;A. Of course we defend this product by all means in the United States but nevertheless we feel it's important to outline that 40% of sales are being achieved outside the United States and we do so with very reasonable growth rates. As you see in the emerging markets, the growth is approximately 8%, close to 9%. In Western Europe, it is still growing 4% despite some existing competition since many years in Europe and in the other markets the growth is even stronger with 14%. So in very short, we believe that both products PLAVIX and LOVENOX even after finalization of the generification still remains strong blockbuster product.</p>
          <p>Finally, last chart from my side, page 20, a snapshot on the consumer healthcare business. We are very satisfied with this development. We have given it more structure as you may remember during the second half of 2009, in terms of organization, in terms of spending, in terms of investment and last but not least also in terms of acquisition. I remind you of the acquisition of Chattem, which is doing very well also in this respect we are very content. You see then a very impressive growth rate for our CHC of 65%, which of course is a little bit inflated by a recent acquisition, but nevertheless even if you take the acquisitions out, the growth rate remains at 16%.</p>
          <p>So we really are in the process of doing a bunch of successful diversification in this field of activities. And in saying so, I pass it over to Wayne Pisano in order to comment on the vaccine business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter. Good morning and good afternoon. In the second quarter the vaccine sales as you can see were relatively flat. We're starting to see some improvement from the phasing that occurred in the first quarter in the US and the recovery in terms of filling and packaging with H1N1. As you know, we completed our H1N1 production in the first quarter. That did have an impact on filling and packaging for the rest of our product line and we are in the stages of just about completing that.</p>
          <p>In terms of our polio, pertussis and Hib product line, we've had very good performance particularly in the emerging markets. PENTAXIM is a pediatric pentavalent vaccine that is now licensed in 97 countries. Growth was 33% in the quarter. We saw recovery on Pentacel in the US, up 8%. Pentacel today in the US holds nearly 75% market share compared to the other pentavalent competitor that we have in the marketplace. Menactra, we saw a modest decline in US and this is reflecting the continued shrinkage of the catch-up market. There was limited impact from the first competitor to Menactra in the US and we are now in the stage of licensing and launching Menactra in the emerging markets. The launch in the second quarter was done in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Middle East is an area where there is concern with bacterial meningitis.</p>
          <p>In the emerging markets, like our pharmaceutical business, we had very strong performance, sales of &#x20AC;264 million. We're up 19%. Some of this is attributable to the growth of PENTAXIM as well as a very strong flu campaign in the Southern Hemisphere. So this is Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. We supply nearly 80% of the influenza vaccine for the Southern Hemisphere. And we saw both improvement on volume and also improvement on pricing which is attributable to the concerns around the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the second half of the year, we anticipate a very strong seasonal flu campaign in particularly the US. This is due to a number of factors. The ACIP has now implemented a universal recommendation for influenza. In essence they are now recommending all Americans be immunized, not just the elderly and pediatrics. We will be launching Fluzone High-Dose this season. This is a product that was designed specifically for patients who are 65 years of age and older. This set of patients are at the greatest risk for morbidity and mortality linked to influenza. And the existing products do not provided an adequate immune response or at least an immune response that is comparable to what adults receive with the current intramuscular products. So with Fluzone High-Dose we see a superior immune response which will benefit this population. We've received full reimbursement from Medicare on this and we expect this to be a strong growth driver for us not only in 2010 but in 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally on the US influenza, we have seen an exceptionally strong pre-book. We have many new customers and existing customers ordering larger quantities. Some of this is linked to the expanded recommendation for immunization and some of it is also linked to the fact that we're being rewarded for the way we handled the 2009 seasonal campaign. We were the only manufacturer to actually deliver 100% of the commitments on seasonal influenza and this has resulted in many customers increasing orders or new customers coming to us.</p>
          <p>Looking briefly at our pipeline, we have filed for our Menactra infant/toddler. This is the 2-dose 9 and 12 month indication for Menactra. And we expect a decision in the second quarter next year from the FDA. And we have also entered Phase II with a quadrivalent seasonal vaccine. The quadrivalent is a vaccine that will now have 2 B strains. This is particularly important to the pediatric population. They experience the greatest morbidity and mortality from B strain disease and there are 2 lineages of  B strains, and we will have both lineages of B strains in this new product.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to turn it over to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, the Executive Vice President and CFO. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wayne. So I am moving to slide 23, as Hanspeter has mentioned already as well as Chris, revenue for the full half year, we have another growth of sales by 4.3%, which includes basically stability on pure organic growth, but as described before in means in fact that on one hand we have we have lost around 1 billion of revenues from generified products, we have replaced by positive sales coming from our growth platforms. And the acquisitions have contributed for 2.5% during the first quarter, only 1.3 during the second quarter because precisely we had already consolidated those, mainly Zentiva and also Medley as early as Q1, end of Q1 2009, therefore, in terms of variation of parameters, Zentiva is not contributing anymore.</p>
          <p>So if I look at the second quarter, it's mainly Chattem which is a contributor to the change in structure, which is developing along these plans. And you can see that on the ForEx side, been a helpful impact of ForEx variations activity during the second quarter, which is not a surprise. The main positive impact is coming from the US dollar but that's not the only one. That you can see just the Brazilian real, or the yen, is representing each of them half of the overall contribution of the valuation of the US dollar against the euro. I think it shows also beyond the pure activity of currencies, I mean the logical strategy which is both having the global footprint, global presence on taking advantage of the growing, but also more and more stronger economy from the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>I move now to slide 24, as expected I will say that the gross margin is declining, this is mainly the result of the evolution of our business mix. I think we had already ample time in other locations to various locations to discuss that. I would say that, well at the end of the day, we have managed to keep gross margins, which is well just declining 1.8% and keeping in mind that 0.87% is coming from the sharp increase of the raw heparin price, which being used to produce LOVENOX. So the rest is 1%. So we can say that on a ongoing basis, where we are today at this stage the evolution of the business mix as well as the acquisitions and the loss of some higher margin, now generified products has impacted our gross margin by 1%.</p>
          <p>Also I think it is a time to remind you that we stopped to rate the impact of our restructuring of the organization of our industrial platforms. And I have just put up the slide from short reminders of what we have embarked on in terms of reorganization of our French operations. We are converting Vitry, which used to be a chemical plant into a biotech platform. We have transferred Colonie facility which has been now outsourced. We are, decide to close Kansas City in the US as well as Dagenham in the UK and Textitlan in Mexico. All these are ongoing projects which will bring some extra savings in the years to come. And as we know it takes always a bit of time to close industrial plants in this industry because we have to, at the same time transfer the production and get the adequate approval for the new product lines. And as a result of our chemical rehabilitation project, which is still a project, but this is ongoing. We are going to phase out Romainville, close to Paris, are we are also going to convert Neuville plant, close to Lyon from a pure chemical plant to a vaccine plant and more precisely we are presently building our new dengue vaccine plant in Neuville. So these are very big evolutions which will bring value over time, and but I think which gives a good view of how important is this reorganization of our industrial platforms.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, R&amp;D, I think it has been a while since we have seen an R&amp;D to sales ratio below 14%. I don't think we should be proud of that as such but it shows that we are clearly implementing a better efficiency of R&amp;D spending. So beyond the ratio which I think as such is not that important, what is important is that we are at the same time implementing a shift in our spending. We are reducing significantly our internal R&amp;D costs and just over second quarter we have reduced by 44 million of internal R&amp;D cost. So the overall R&amp;D spending is minus 5%, just one quarter, but if it is only an entrance cost is much more than that. At the same time, we benefit from &#x2013; still from the portfolio rationalization, but we're spending more on partnership, on external partnership.</p>
          <p>So the reasons, behind this decline, although R&amp;D spending, our good control of R&amp;D spending, the very significant shift which we have embarked on since last year, where we spend. As Chris mentioned before, trying to squeeze our internal cost and trying to review external cost and spending as an investment, so to benchmark it against any other capital spending. And also we are on the way to implement a true transformation, 2 things, first thing as a reminder, is that we are reducing the number of sites from 28 in 2009 to 16 in 2011 which I think is impressive, keeping in mind also that we are opening a new site in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>So it's one more, I would say a reduction, because we are moving oncology as you know in Cambridge. And we have now fully implemented our new R&amp;D organization. The model, which I think creates more visibility and more challenge, on the way to handle it. On one hand we have entrepreneurial units,  business divisions or <mark type="inaudible" /> units, on the other hand we have a sort of a common facility, which are scientific co-platforms which are providing services to these entrepreneurial units and which are supposed to be competitive against external source of service to be provided from external outsourcers or providers.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A here again, the SG&amp;A to sales ratio is down by 0.8%, so we have always been resolute in our performance in SG&amp;A to sales ratio. We are again continuing to improve by 0.8% over the first half and meanwhile, we are changing and realigning our pharmaceutical efforts from mature countries to emerging markets. And just to give you a feeling of that, just over this period if you compare first half of 2009 with first half 2010, we have reduced by 1,400 the sales force in the U.S., by 400 in Western Europe. And at the same time, we have increased by 600 in the emerging markets, and clearly we continue to increase our sales force in the emerging market.</p>
          <p>Last but not least we are continuing to reduce our G&amp;A costs and we have reduced these by 2% over this period of  time. So all-in-all I will say that we are on track with our overall transformation and cost-cutting program. When I say on track, in fact we are ahead of schedule. If you remember that in February, when we released our 2009 full-year accounts, we said that we were ahead of schedule,  that we had a plan to save at least 600 million from our overall plan of 2 billion recurring savings in 2013. And now we can tell you that we will have saved at least I would say more than 1 billion, more than 1 billion in 2010 as compared to 2008, again on a recurring basis, clearly showing that we will reach the 2 billion much in advance as compared to our initial plan.</p>
          <p>On the other items on the P&amp;L, I think I can go short, just a few reminders. As from April, unfortunately, we don't have any more revenues from Teva on COPAXONE, so this explains mainly why the other current operating income and expenses are declining in Q2 2010, as compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>We have an increased share of a profit from associates, mainly from the interest share of our shared profits in the BMS PLAVIX <mark type="inaudible" /> venture and we are now consolidating 100% of the profit of Merial which basically is doubling the profit contribution. On the other hand, the minority interests are declining precisely because BMS is taking its share of our declining sales of PLAVIX in Europe.</p>
          <p>Net financial expenses are definitely under control, and the net, the gross, the cost of the gross debt is around 4%. And since beginning of the year you know that I expect this tax rate for 2010 is expected to 28%, to be compared to 29% last year. And all-in-all we managed to keep a higher net margin despite the generification of some of our key products at 21.8%, to be compared to 21% which will bring us to a business EPS of 1.9% -- &#x20AC;1.90 against &#x20AC;1.76 last year which is an increase by 4.5% on a constant exchange rate base.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, our net cash flow from operating activities has been 4.7% -- 4.7 billion, sorry, so it remains very strong. The CapEx spending is definitely under control. We are spending less CapEx than last year by around 60 million, just was first half of 2010. Therefore, the free cash flow generated has been over 4 billion before the payment of dividend. We have spent 2.2 billion on acquisition, on in-licensing, 2.1 in fact on acquisitions of which main part is Chattem.</p>
          <p>And we have other, which is 785 million, which is a buyback of some shares, which we did during the first quarter for an amount of 320 million and the payment of the restructuring cost on which we have taken provision last year and so the payment is now coming out and this represents around 500 million. And I would say this is totally expected.</p>
          <p>Dividend has been paid, as you all know, 3.1 billion. So therefore, we have an overall debt which is around 6 billion, which is in line with what we have expected. And I would say that the gearing, i.e. the debt-to-equity ratio remains very low at around 11%.</p>
          <p>So just as a wrap up, we are continuing to focus on our growth platform as Chris mentioned at the beginning of this conference, with now more than 50% of our sales. We have continued to reduce our operating expenses and we've been able to stabilize our overall operating margins. And we have posted an EPS growth, despite of slightly declining sales growth, reasons were discussed before. We are now able to confirm that we will deliver more than &#x20AC;1 billion of savings over 2010, as compared to 2008, being ahead of our plan. Now we have continued to generate strong cash flow generation and low gearing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On cost savings, obviously you're ahead of plan now, and you will reach your 2 billion before 2013. Will you continue to save more than that 2 billion or will you just stop at that level and can I tempt you for a number? And just in the discontinuation of the Long-acting LANTUS, could you just talk a little bit more about your plans, now that product is gone in terms of whether you might go and find something else and whether there's anything out there. And indeed whether you are incrementally now more worried about the potential threat from Novo's Degludec. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost savings, yes thank you, Mark, and yes you are right to say that we are ahead of schedule that we will generate 2 billion, ahead of our plans. And we are looking at seeing how much more we can save. I mean legitimately I would say maybe the fall is the period for 2011 budgets, so I think it would be the right time to precise what could be a revised objective, which we could disclose later on. So we'll not give you any figure today, but I think that this is something we are working on. I think once again, I feel it was &#x2013; we still have some actions to be taken. So I think it's certainly very important to maintain the momentum of what we are planning to do and starting to identify the further savings which we will implement over time and be in the position to give you an update, objective, let's say by year-end, when we release the full-year accounts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's true that we have stopped the development of longer acting insulin, but we have not given up hope to come to longer acting insulins. I think I have ensured during earlier calls, my own thoughts, what is really the optimal time of a long-acting insulin. And we continue into this development. Beside, of course we continue to do our development with the GLP-1 combination with LANTUS, which from my personal point of view is really the key target we are pursuing as of today. And beyond we have signed numerous agreements to go into totally new directions in terms of diabetes treatment and diabetes prevention.</p>
          <p>On Degludec, well that of course a very subjective statement I have to give. I tell you what we think. We believe that there a limited differentiation between Degludec and LANTUS what we see so far. Of course, we are following closely what has been happening in the market and also so far we see nothing which would be really alarming for us. We have read comments in the sense that Degludec will be perhaps the product Levemir was supposed to be and that's perhaps a good summary of how we judge Degludec today. But let's keep in mind that final approval has to come with more Phase III data on this product.</p>

          <p>Hey there, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. The first one is on your strategy. I can imagine that obviously you will not discuss and comment on the current removals of the US acquisition. But can you please give us an update with regards to your strategy in the US and also your strategy in terms of M&amp;A. The second question is on LOVENOX, can you please elaborate, can you please tell us what will be the claims you will try to defend precisely against the FDA and what kind of price cut do you expect from Sandoz? And the last question is on Jevtana. Can you please make an update on the pricing, the number of addressable patients and your sales target for this product. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll ask Hanspeter to respond to the lower LOVENOX and Jevtana question. In terms of strategy, strategy hasn't changed. We are clearly looking at external growth opportunities as part of our 3 pillar strategy of renewing R&amp;D, seeking external growth and transforming the business. Our objective was really laid out when we established long-term guidance of stable sales and profit in 2013 versus 2008. That really meant that we have enough organic growth resilience to really grow through the cliff. And therefore the acquisitions that we do can really be done to enhance earnings and sales growth.</p>
          <p>So we've always said we're going to avoid the mega mergers and concentrate on the small to medium-size. And again the small to medium-size has always been in this industry, as you well know, small being up to about 5 billion in market cap and up to 20 billion for a medium-size. What is absolutely important is that these things drive value. We've seen a lot of transactions that don't drive value. And so we look globally. We are looking in the last 18 months, we have acquired generic companies in Brazil and in Eastern Europe. We have done a joint venture in over-the-counter in China. We bought a vaccines company in India, We bought a consumer healthcare company in the United States.</p>
          <p>So we are looking globally at these opportunities and wherever they can be bolted on and added to business. The key thing we are looking for is sustainable growth, and reducing our dependence on patents. So we did the 33 deals last year. We're on track to do the same thing. I think we have been pretty consistent in what we said we are going to do and have been executing.</p>
          <p>Hanspeter, for LOVENOX and Jevtana?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris, I'll start with Jevtana. We have a rough price of $8,000 per injection, which gives an average treatment cost of approximately $48,000, which is approximately three-fold the treatment cost of Taxotere in first line prostate cancer. Concerning peak sales, we do no more give peak sales for reasons you may understand. I have read peak sales, which are in the spread of 300 to 400 million in sales which I could consider as being reasonable. Of course this is only the current indication of second-line prostate cancer as I had indicated earlier. Of course we'll pursue also this in agreement of the FDA, a further clinical program in first-line cancer of the prostate and eventually also in other cancer settings.</p>
          <p>Now on LOVENOX, you see we have a competitor since less than one week so it's extremely preliminary, but I can give you as the market information. But nevertheless let's keep in mind that this is a market which is approximately 50-50 share between an institutional market, largely hospital-driven through CPOs which means very centralized purchasing in the United States and the retail market. We see so far very little activity in the retail market overall, which may be reflecting Sandoz' strategies. It may be also indicating a certain short of supply situation. All of this is speculation, but of course it's part of our war gaming.</p>
          <p>What we see in the institutional parts are discounts between 15 and 35, 38% which is much more modest of course, what you would expect to see overall. But once again the institutional market follows different rules than the retail market and this is not a generification you could compare with a classical cardiovascular product or similar.</p>
          <p>So, this is all what I can say on the situation and of course we react to this. I have always stressed over the last 5 or 6 years and I said I believe that in the institutional market segment we have a strong foothold. Let's not forget that we are producing, distributing with a perfect degree of liability these products since a decade. We have very strong customer relationships which are of course not only both on LOVENOX, but also from our other hospital portfolio. And yes of course we try as best way possible to adapt to the new market conditions which I outlined. And you may understand that for evident reasons I don't want to go into further details at least for the time being.</p>
          <p>As far as our litigation against the FDA is concerned, well I think Chris already had outlined the major hooks. We see in this litigation, we believe that the FDA has not properly assessed the overall risk of such a generic. These are in reference to the situation in major other parts of world like Australia, like Canada as an able country and evidently the European Community. For a more details I kindly ask you to go to the website of court where our litigation is fully available and where you can get every detail you may need.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hoping to getting an update on what to expect for generic timing from LOVENOX in Europe. I appreciate that the regulatory standards are different there but I'm under the impression that European filings by generic companies could actually occur in the current year, and I'm wondering if you can comment on this. And second question is just generally your interest in orphan drugs. One or more big pharma companies have kind of disavowed getting into areas where drug prices are so high because of political reasons primarily, and I'm wondering what sanofi's view is of the political risk to this sort of endeavor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with Enoxaparin generic, I think it's important to say that today we have legislation and guidelines in the European Community, which expressively ask for clinical trials in each and every indication. I believe that in average, in Europe, LOVENOX has about 12 to 15 different indications in each and every member state. So, this is an important entry hurdle and of course we strongly believe that is for good reasons the case.</p>
          <p>Consequently, at least one of the manufacturers aiming to get access to the American market already has publicly announced, that they don't intend to pursue a European strategy with a generic. So that's really a speculation. I personally doubt that this situation we have today could change within a timeframe of 12 months because those trials would be probably selective. I don't believe that somebody could run 12, 15 indications within 12 months and see successfully, so I believe that if there would be any change it would take much more than 12 months.</p>
          <p>I also remind you that we have a totally different situation in Europe already because we have other low molecular weight heparins on the market. There is a product from Pharmacia Pfizer, there are some Southern European products from Italfarmaco and other Spanish companies for example, with which we are eyeing a fierce battle also concerning prices. Nevertheless, nevertheless, we have a market share in Europe, if I remember correctly of approximately 75% in average. And the product continues to grow. So once again, I'm not too much scared about additional competition in Europe, because this means basically nothing new.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly on your 2013 outlook, which you have reconfirmed, I just wonder whether you could remind us, exactly what was in your original thinking and possibly whether anything might have changed. For example your assumptions on LOVENOX, are they the same as they were before and is Chattem in or out of that guidance?</p>
          <p>And then on the R&amp;D ratio, you highlighted that obviously you have been controlling the costs there but you do have more external collaborations. So just wondered how we should think about that R&amp;D ratio if we try to include the costs of the external collaborations. Should we use for example the cash going out on licenses as a kind of proxy for the money that you are spending externally? And then finally, I just wonder if you could give us a quick update on Shantha on the vaccine side please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so on 2013, we gave the guidance a year ago. So that was prior to the acquisition of Chattem. We did however always have a belief that we should plan our lives and future not only always in having everything for right for us. So we didn't assume that we kept LOVENOX forever. We would have, at that time, we thought a non-substitutable generic was more likely than a substitutable one. However given that there are a number of orals that were expected to enter the marketplace, when we actually look at the difference between a substitutable and a non-substitutable in 2013 terms, the difference is actually negligible. The only real difference is the slope on which you get there. So obviously on a substitutable base, the slope might be a little bit more rapid and steeper.</p>
          <p>But it is really &#x2013; you talk about area under the curve between now and then, which is cash. I look at PLAVIX in the US, I look at Taxotere in US and Europe, largely as cash on the balance sheet. It has to come in and it's maybe a little bit varied on sales. But those aren't the products that really are driving the future growth of the company. So as I say, the only real difference in LOVENOX is perhaps the speed at which we will get there and so we've adjusted the guidance for 2010, but by the time we get to 2013 it's the same thing.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D, we have been trying to provide you obviously with all the details of the external deals that we do. And it's unfortunate whenever &#x2013; and I am a charted accountant by profession &#x2013; and I hate it when charted accountants try to be economists because you end up with a mess. You end up with R&amp;D expense that you spend yourself as being an expense, but if someone else does the R&amp;D it goes on the balance sheet. And I don't think that's serving interests of investors.</p>
          <p>Clearly if you pay an upfront, that is largely compensating people for past R&amp;D. So it really represents the cumulative of a number of years of investment in R&amp;D. So probably to take all of the milestones in 1 year would be excessive. You may want to take a factor of, divide it by 5 or something like that to get an idea of an annualized run rate. Beyond that obviously as you develop the product from that initial milestone, then that is going into our R&amp;D cost. And you then only have the milestones as and when you have success on those stages.</p>
          <p>We will actually be happy to work with investors and analysts to see how we can improve that. I mean today we are trying to get to, and we pretty much are there, in terms of 50% of our projects being sourced from external collaborations and 50% internal. But, I think the R&amp;D ratio broadly is where it will be and trying to perhaps bring a little bit more visibility on the fixed cost of R&amp;D, which is going to stay. And then the rest of it will vary by the number of projects that you have. Because at any one time the R&amp;D budget, if you don't do any further external collaborations are half are in external, then as you have attrition, the costs would by nature then go down. So you can kind of track how we are going to be by the type of deals that we have going forward.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you Chris. So with regards to Shantha, the issue at hand pertains to a pentavalent product Shan 5, and there were reports of abnormal visual appearance to the product for batches that were produced prior to the acquisition of Shantha, the product that was in the marketplace. We have dedicated all of our technical expertise to design an action plan that is geared toward improving the robustness and the processes and guaranteeing the highest quality standards for these vaccines.</p>
          <p>This root cause analyses and remediation plan was submitted to the WHO on June 21. They have not acknowledged receipt of that plan and we have a number of meetings scheduled with the WHO coming up after the summer break. So we'll have more information available in the future.</p>
          <p>Obviously, Shantha is an important acquisition for us, more so for its strategic importance. The intent is to have the Shantha facility in India to serve as the platform for both R&amp;D and manufacturing to serve many of the poorest markets of the world. And so, that long-term strategy remains in place and that is our overall plan for Shantha.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we continue to develop the new vaccines. I mean, largely the acquisition around was acquiring a low-cost facility in India and a pipeline of vaccines. The WHO did confirm that revaccination wasn't necessary. So the issue of flocculation  appears to be more cosmetic. It will be redeveloped and will be on the market again as soon as possible.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have 2 questions please. Firstly on the M&amp;A strategy, if I may posit further queries. I don't remember the exact terms you used about a year ago, I remember you said something like at the current multiple sanofi's share is trading, it would be difficult to justify paying with paper. So I would love to hear that perhaps to repeat it or perhaps clarified. Then the other one on the change in the guidance, if I assume about 4, 4.5% change in the midterm of the profit guidance before and after LOVENOX, that gives me more than 600 million impact on profit and that is pretty big chunk of the expected US sales of LOVENOX in the second half of this year. So perhaps you could help me on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think our objective is to do accretive transactions, accretive to top line, accretive to bottom line. And it's pretty hard to do an accretive deal if you are using a paper with the low P/E to acquire anything with a high P/E. So, all I will say is that we take all of those factors into account and our M&amp;A strategy is really designed to create shareholder value as well as strengthen the underlying business. I'll perhaps ask J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me to comment a little more on the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well for me, I do a slightly different calculation. We had a previous guidance, which was between 2 and 5%. Clearly we have taken the lower end of the new guidance because we have very little visibility on the, let's say the most dramatic case, would lose basically all LOVENOX sales as early as end of July, in order to be on the safe side, because I think that none of you would accept that we could come back and to say hey guys, maybe it could be even a little bit lower than what we have told you. So you are right to say that we can expect that the low end of the guidance which has also to be looked at together with the lower end of the previous guidance, is really the maximum we can get to. And then I mean I tend more to look at something like around 400 million and not the 600 million you are referring to.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Le Berrigaud from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, 2 questions please. First, I do not see any sign of AVE5026 in the R&amp;D roadmap for the second part of the year. In the context of generic LOVENOX in the US, is it fair to just think that you are reassessing the value of this asset? And secondly, very quickly how would you rate ex-US profitability for LOVENOX versus the one enjoyed in the US please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, I didn't understand the first part of your LOVENOX question when you said the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No 5026 he meant there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To what extent, not having AVE5026 on the roadmap has anything to do with the context of the situation with generic LOVENOX in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric there was recently a meta-analysis of the three short-term studies, <mark type="inaudible" /> studies that basically provided initial data that confirms that AVE5026 has a favorable benefit to risk profile. But as you know, we've always said in the pipeline update last year that our focus was to actually to look at the onco and abdominal surgery indications and those are still ongoing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's just there's no data point because we've specialized that on the oncology indications. The things that we've put in the roadmap were just where we have data readouts. So there is no change in that. And this is an area where LOVENOX really wasn't used. And so it was actually part of the reason why we shifted the use of 5026, partly because we felt that there would be oral treatments available and you have potentially a generic treatment available. So therefore we looked at where were areas of unmet need that neither the orals nor generic LOVENOX is really going to address because they don't have those indications. So it would have a smaller set of indications than LOVENOX but it still appears to be well worth developing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the profitability, I think you have to assume it is less. I mean we sell about 15% of our volume in the US but we have about 60% of our sales there. So you can see that there is quite a substantial difference in pricing, which also makes it less attractive quite honestly for other generics really to do the clinical studies that so far Europe and other countries have requested. And that's why we actually see, as Hanspeter has already pointed out, a drug like LOVENOX still being a significant product for the group albeit mostly outside of the US and at a somewhat smaller margin, but still very much an attractive margin.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, if I can add, did the new GLP-1 analog on the market delay the use of long acting insulin or LANTUS in type-2 diabetes? Could you update us on that, whether you've you seen already anything?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, 2 remaining quick questions. Number 1 about the flu vaccine in the second half that you mentioned will be quite strong. Will we see some booking of that in the Q3, or will all that be in Q4 as you can see it now? And one question probably on Temusi, the ischemia drug that will report Phase III, it's quite a specific drug so how will you market that? Will you use your existing sales force, whether it will be specific networks, how will that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I'll start with the second question. This will be an extremely selective marketing. First of all it's a product that if successful, which will go to very specialized angiologists and surgeons working in angiology. Secondly the distribution of the product, given its mode of action will request precautions, which are atypical for distribution of a pharmaceutical. So it will be extremely selective. And third I believe it's fair to say that this is a market segment which is extremely easy to be penetrated given the small targets group. I'd also second, if this product should prove to be successful what we all hope, it would be really such a major therapeutic breakthrough that news would spread through the Internet, through congresses extremely rapidly. So the way, how to promote it from a financial point of view is really insignificant.</p>

          <p>Wayne, on the flu vaccine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think the flu vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere is shipped generally from the August through mid November timeframe. So, you will be seeing significant sales in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. And in fact, we would expect actually to shipped our first early doses at the end of July. So I think it's difficult to say what percent will be in the September timeframe and what percent would flow into October because every single lot is released by the regulatory agencies. But we are at 100% of production right now in both our facilities Valder&#xF8;y as well as in Swiftwater and doses will begin flowing in the next several weeks.</p>

          <p>The last question is from Mr. Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Could you just comment a little bit more on LOVENOX, and talk about the supply agreements you have in place with principally the hospitals and if you could give some indication of what percentage of US LOVENOX is hospitals? I guess what I'm getting at is, to what extent can you lock in any of your existing customers in long-term supply agreements by flexing price? And then maybe if you could say something also on your plans for an authorized generic at some point over the life cycle of, the remaining life cycle of LOVENOX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andrew, the percentage, that's really the easy part of your question. The hospital segment in terms of value is approximately 60% of our business in the US. So 60% are really strongly concentrated either by GPOs, purchasing organizations or directly by major hospitals. It is really premature to say something, but I can really indicate that because we had really 5 years to prepare for this situation, we are relatively well prepared in terms of the setup of our negotiations with those major customers. What we see so far is a high degree of readiness to continue to work with us given the confidence those customers have in us as supplier, as a manufacturer and evidently in the drug itself.</p>
          <p>Now it would be dishonest if I would say well if you sign a contract, we can be sure that this will hold for the next year. We have to see how the customers will be compliant with those contracts. We evidently have to see how the new competition has to react on it. And lastly, we also have to see what the court of Columbia will decide upon our request for an injunction. But so far, we have a very good sustainability of our customer base to be taken with all caution of the less than 1 year &#x2013; 1 week of appearance of a generic company.</p>
          <p>On top you will understand that I'm not ready to go into more details concerning how much we discount. But I think overall if you look to our worldwide strategy, I believe we have been the first company which did not raise its arms when we lost the patent. No, we continue to fight for the product, because we believe it's important for many reasons to keep the volume. And yes, it will be exactly in this sense that we will continue to fight for our important share in the LOVENOX volume market.</p>
