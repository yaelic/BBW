        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you at another teleconference dedicated to the publication of the consolidated reports by Gazprom covering H1 2010, which was prepared according to IFRS. My name is Andrey Kruglov. I am the Deputy Chairman of the Management Committee and the Head of the Financial and Economics Department. Together with me we have my colleague, who is the Deputy Chairman Management Committee and General Director of Gazprom Export, Alexander Medvedev; as well as various colleagues representing the Accounts Department for Economic Appraisal and Pricing; the Accounting Department, like I said; Marketing, Financial and Economics Department, and quite a representative group of our officers.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to say a few words about the macroeconomic environment, and would also introduce the operational results. And in the second part of my presentation, we'll have Mr. Mikhail Rosseev, who is Deputy Senior Accountant, will give us more details about our financials. And in conclusion, there will be a few words also about other important events in the work of the company. As is usual, we have our slides uploaded on our website.</p>
          <p>I would like to draw your attention to slide number four, representing the main statements. We see a continued recovery of the economics which contributed to strong financial results in the first half of 2010. The net profit, which is attributed to the shareholders, grew by 67% up to RR 495 million. The money derived from the operational activities grew by 43%, amounting to RR 748 billion, in H1. Substantially decrease we see in terms of the debt burden, the net debt went down almost by 30%, and the adjusted EBITDA to net debt from 1.3 by the end of '09 it went down to 0.8 by the end of H1 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let's move over to the next slide in order to appraise the macroeconomic environment within which we are operating. This is slide number five. Like I already noted, the Russian economics has been demonstrating in the current year very sound pace of GDP growth and recovering quite successfully after a deep crisis of 2009. The GDP rate of growth in the second quarter was 5% year-on-year, while the rate of growth of industrial output 11%. Positive contribution comes from the price dynamics in the global energy resources market, the low level of the government debt, which is below 10% of the GDP and substantial reduction of the inflation level, all of which put together contributes to the stability in the macroeconomics of the country.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our operational results, and I would invite you to take a look at the next slide, this is slide number six. In Q2, we've witnessed continued trends in the recovery of the production of hydrocarbons, which started in the middle of last year. The production of natural gas grew almost by 30% year-on-year. The production of oil and gas condensates continued their stable growth compared to last year. The production of oil grew by 3% and the gas condensate by 12%.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven, dear ladies and gentlemen, represents the balance of the work being done by our gas transportation system. This chart reflects the physical transfer and movement of gas through the trunk pipelines rather than commercial operations of the Group. And it is noteworthy though the main results of Q2 exceeded the similar results of Q2 of the previous year. Following the growing demand, production also grew and the underground storage of gas functioned normally. The main increases are the volumes, fell upon the consumption in Russia, as well as the induction into the underground storage facilities.</p>
          <p>The next slide, number eight, is where you can see that in Q2 2010 we've witnessed substantial growth of the revenue from the sale of gas in all of the markets, now 24%, which was the strongest one, was the growth of sales in the former Soviet Union countries. The reverse situation manifested itself in the Russian market where the volumes of the sold gas went down just by nearly 3% only, but nevertheless, however, the revenue because of the increase in the regulated prices by 15% from the start of the year and the derived revenue grew by 23% compared year-on-year. The revenue from the sale of gas in Europe grew by 10%.</p>
          <p>I would like to slightly step away from these reporting figures and say a few words about the outlook, which is slide number nine, which demonstrates the dynamics for the sale of the volumes of gas in the main Gazprom markets. Based on the preliminary estimations, the sale of gas in the Russian market during the 10 months of this year exceeded by 7% a similar result in '09. Speaking about the price environment, one can note that the government is following the established plan of raising tariffs. Changes in terms of the current gas prices in that, makes us hopeful that the gas prices would continue stable growth in Russia.</p>
          <p>Here you can also see the European market environment. I guess I won't elaborate upon it because you, dear ladies and gentlemen, will have an opportunity to ask questions directly to the person in charge of this area in Gazprom, my colleague, Mr. Medvedev. And I would like to pass the microphone over to Mikhail Rosseev, representing the Department for Accounting, who will tell us about the main results and the main figures in our report.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear ladies and gentlemen. Continuing to consider the results of our operations of the Gazprom Group in Q2 2010, let us take a look at slide number 11. This slide in large figures describes the main factors which contributed to the financial result of the Group. As was the case in the Q1, the Q2 demonstrates very good contribution in terms of the revenue coming from the growing revenue in terms of the gas processing, as well as the sale of power and heat.</p>
          <p>The reasons behind the growth similar to the reasons which were considered in the case of the first quarter, for example, the revenue from the sale of the gas processing products, grew by 33%. And primarily that increase can be explained by the global prices being on the uptrend as well as the growing volumes. Effectively, this whole growth comes from the operations of the Gazprom Neft Group, which accounts for 84% in its share from our sales within this particular segment.</p>
          <p>The sale of electricity and heating grew because of the changes in the structure of the Group by 52%. That was the increase, primarily because of the fact that we included into our report in the H1 figures as well as the increase in revenue from the sale of operations of our other power companies, which is most notably OGK-2 and OGK-6. Out of this slide, you can also see that one of the line items which continued to make strong contribution to our results was the exchange rates within the financial line items. In this particular case, in Q2, thanks to the exchange rate, the differences we ended up were into RR 38 billion of a loss.</p>
          <p>And let me now pass over to the next slide and point out some of the operational costs. You can see up on the slide somehow the composition of our operational costs, the dynamics that demonstrate the changes and the main factors which stood behind it. Overall, the operational expenses in Q2 grew by RR 45 million which is 9%. At the same time, the acquisition of gas grew by RR 11 billion, primarily because of the growing expenses to acquire gas in the territory of Russia. The acquisition of oil grew by RR 10 billion, and that increase in terms of the volumes primarily brought about by the operations of Gazprom Neft Group. The costs covering the transit grew because of the Gazprom Neft operations by 42%.</p>
          <p>And if we are talking about other operation expenses, those grew by RR 12 billion. At the same time, well in this particular line item, the biggest contribution came from the increase of the reserve of 4 billion and costs of the maintenance, 2 billion, and power and heating, 2, as well as transportation costs also 2 billion. To a certain extent, the growth within this particular line item was compensated for by the decrease in the exchange rate differences primarily because of the revaluation of the receivables.</p>
          <p>Now please allow me to go over to the next slide which demonstrates information about changes in our working capital. A positive contribution something which, Andrey Vyacheslavovich, already mentioned, and in this slide, you can see the main factors which brought about this positive change. With respect to the receivables, it is necessary to note that it went down by more than RR 70 billion at the same time, bigger portion is the Gazprom consumers. So in the Russian territory, RR 42 billion, then in terms of the sales into Europe which went down by, RR 31 billion. We also received the rebate of monetary resources, RR 46 billion, which also includes the company's receivables, which was compensated for by the increase of the reserves of gas and the underground storages in terms of fair value and other effects.</p>
          <p>With this, please allow me to pass the microphone over to my colleagues from the Economics Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and I would ask you to switch over to slide number 14, which demonstrates the review of our debt provisions, which is something that I've already mentioned. Principally speaking, that the ratio of the general debt to EBITDA significantly went down where the company won, and we are not expecting any substantial changes within this particular figure by the end of 2010. The correlation between the net cash flow and operational activities in Q1, as you may see upon this slide, continues to remain at quite a higher level, which enabled us for the second quarter in a row to create positive cash flow.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the financial report, this is it. And I would like to also say a few words about important events in the activities of the company. First and foremost is that by the end of last year, the Board of Directors endorsed the dividend policy of the company in its new situation, including the point about the dividend payments from 17% to 35% from net profit. The parent company according to the Russian standards of reporting, and in this way we were able to raise the maximum level of payout. The principle of dividend estimation is demonstrated upon slide number 15. Also in accordance with this new policy, these net profits can be adjusted by the value of the revaluation of financial investments of Gazprom.</p>
          <p>Slide number 16 demonstrates questions which are attributed to Gazprom's policy in the area of environmental protection and the corporate social responsibility. For example, thanks to the implementation of the energy efficiency, energy savings program and the integrity programs in the gas transportation system, the CO2 emissions were reduced by 29% from 2005 to 2009. And another very eloquent example of the way the company complies with all of the environmental norms and standards is the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline which was very thoroughly analyzed from the point of view of not affecting the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea.</p>
          <p>I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we are trying to ensure the sustainable development of the business, paying strong attention, not only to the economic, but also to the social component. Gazprom to children is a key social endeavor of the company. Since the beginning of 2007 and until present, Gazprom has allocated more than RR 9 billion to this particular program. And as part of this program, Gazprom is building and renovating various sports facilities and funding various sports activities all over the country.</p>
          <p>And I would like to remind you, dear ladies and gentlemen, that information about the environmental component in the work of Gazprom is available within this special environmental reports, and there is a special section within the annual report of the company that is dedicated to the social corporate responsibility and all of these reports can be found on our website. And I would like to conclude today's presentation by telling you that before the end of the year Gazprom for the first time ever will publish its report on sustainable development which will contain information covering the two previous years, 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for your attention, and now we will be ready to answer your questions. And as part of our today's program 45 minutes for Q&amp;A. Please.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Nadia Kazakova [JPMorgan]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Nadia Kazakova, company JPMorgan. This question comes from JPMorgan, and the first part of the question is in the RR 47.8 million of the export contracts, which part is attributed to million cubic meters of the exported materials, which part this attributes to this quarter's component and which to the long-term contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for this question. It is very easy to give you an answer to it, because it allows me to dispel yet another myth about the work of Gazprom and Gazprom Export in Europe. And herewith, I would like to make an official statement that Gazprom, through its export division, which is Gazprom Export, in terms of the spot market in Europe is not marketing any gas. And at the same time, all of the contracts that we have is, long-term nature, including our dependent entities and affiliated companies.</p>
          <p>And amongst these companies, we find such as WINGAS, Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading, as well as Gazprom Germany. And it is only natural that within the environment of economic crisis and with spot prices being different from the long-term contract prices, we initiated a certain adaptation of our current contracts to the current market environment. And the price formulas within our long-term contracts remained as they were and they continue to be based upon the basket of refined products. But at the same time, a certain amount of volumes, together with our buyers, we are selling in relationship to this spot index.</p>
          <p>And it's a different matter where we have some of our marketing companies when operating in the European market, both buy and sell gas in the European main spot platforms and markets and this enables us to optimize both the sale as well as the acquisition portfolios that these companies have. I hope that I was able to answer your question.</p>
          <p>And we'll also hear a few words from Mikhail Rosseev in relationship to the reports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so summarizing what we heard from Alexander Leonidovich, I would like to tell you that within the consolidated reports, you may also see the revenue from the sale of gas, which is the revenue which does not include into itself the spot market operations, neither the trading operations, nor anything related to deliveries of real volumes. So the results of the trading activities are reflected in the separate line items without the actual delivery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Oswald Clint [Sanford C. Bernstein]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, there was a second question also as part of the first one which I would like to answer now as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our apologies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello? Could you please qualify whether the long-term price for 2010 that you showed as average price for export gas for Gazprom in Europe for 2010 is $308? This clearly is below the current reported prices. Therefore the question is whether the prices will go up in the second half to reach this 308 number that we see in the presentation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed, this is true that during H1, as well as in Q1 and Q2, prices remained below the average annual projected prices. The average weighted price in Q1 amounted to $293 and $289.5 in the second quarter. But already in the third quarter, the price went up to $318 and so the projected price of the fourth quarter is $327. And both of these price positions, the projected and the real one, include the gas which we are selling in connection to the spot prices. So the kind of price which you've mentioned in terms of the average weighted one for the year, taking into account the projected prices and volumes for the fourth quarter, will most probably be exactly this. Thank you. And now the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Oswald Clint [Sanford C. Bernstein]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Hi, Oswald Clint at Sanford Bernstein in London. Two questions, please. First one, just on the domestic gas business; I wonder if you can say how much profit was generated within that business in the first-half of the year or at least a percentage increase versus last year? And secondly, your CapEx in the second quarter increased, I guess, by the smallest amount in a long time year-over-year. Can you give us or remind us the full year CapEx guidance for 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will have Alexander Mikheyev, who is the Deputy Head of the Marketing Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not ready to give you the very exact figures, but we can tell you the following things. That this year, the gas sale prices which were established by the Russian government for the gas resources which are being sought from the volumes produced by Gazprom, enable us to ensure the loss-free sale and even earn some profit. And that is almost the first year when we have been working quite reliably and convincingly in as far as the profitability of the sale of gas in Russia was concerned. Further on, we expect that this figure on an annual basis will be improving, because the price increase dynamics, in compliance with the government decision, is something that we find acceptable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also we will hear a part of the answer from Vasily Smirnov, who is the Deputy Head of the Economic Appraisal and Pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So speaking specifically about 2009, during '09, for the first time during quite a continuous period of time, the company was able to earn net profit from the deliveries of gas into the domestic market according to our estimations. It is being defined by RR 8.2 billion covering the whole delivered volumes, while in 2010, because of the prices for gas staying the same, specifically considering the one that has already been produced and because of the slight increase in terms of the overall volume, this amount may go up to RR 110 million or to RR 120 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question was about the CapEx and the expectations for the CapEx figure by the end of the year. Please confirm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the second part of the question, which is about the CapEx, the investment program, as well as the program for capital expenditures, originally, it was adopted at the level of RR 766 million, which is the 2010 figure. And then considering the results of the H1, it was adjusted and further increased by about 80 million and so we expect that the capital expenditure program by the end of the year will stand at about RR 830 billion. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ilya Balabanovsky [Barclays Capital Securities]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Ilya Balabanovsky, Barclays Capital. So the question about the Bovanenkovskoye field, considering the current situation, is it fair to say that the Gazprom considering the possibility of delaying the development of Bovanenkovskoye field to the second half of 2013 and instead, an ability to further increase production by greater utilization of the existing production capacities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So answering this question, first of all, when planning our investment activity and the development of our capacities, we are coming from what the market has. Specifically, that we are developing our transportation or production capacities for the possibility of selling gas, expansive capacities, whether be it transport or production is something that we don't need. And so far, no decisions, specifically about the start of the development of the Bovanenkovskoye field, have been made. So far, we are going according to plan.</p>
          <p>But if, for example, we see that the volumes of gas do not meet our expectations, these are the kind of decision that we may make as a result of the overall debate and the adjustment of the investment program. This is a bit of a traditional question, one should admit, and quite general. So far, the investment program covering 2011 and the draft of it covering 2012, 2013 hasn't been adopted, and the Board of Directors is going to be convened to consider this issue by the end of November. And so I believe that, either for the next teleconference call, or at the next but one, we will be able to discuss it. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Igor Kurinny [ING Bank]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Igor Kurinny, ING Bank. The question is about the dividend policy of the company and in the presentation, it was mentioned that the profit of the parent company can be adjusted based upon the capital spending. And could you give us more details in terms of whether you are intending to adjust your profit in relation to the Gazprom Neft stock and if not, then when do you plan to make such a decision? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking about the changes in the dividend policy, it is necessary, and specifically as applied to this particular point, it is necessary to say that first and foremost, it was aimed at making the dividend policy based upon the level of profit, which is backed by the real cash flow. As far as the revaluation of the financial investments is concerned, and the fact that apart from Gazprom Neft, we have some power assets such as Mosenergo, we also value them and we also include them into the consolidated reporting.</p>
          <p>However, this year, the situation was such that because of the revaluation of Gazprom Neft and other assets, Gazprom ended up having the so-called paper profit, which was not backed by the real cash flow. And, consequently, through the decision of the general shareholders' meeting, we decided, for the purposes of estimating our dividend base, to utilize specifically the part of the profit, which is backed by the real cash flow.</p>
          <p>That could be a different situation that can allow for, in terms of the development of the market, and the revaluation of the financial assets can bring about a negative effect, meaning to say that it may bring down the profit, Igor, and consequently, bring down the volume of the profit, which may be backed by the real cash flow. And so in order to avoid such a situation and in order for us to be able to &#x2013; apart from the dividend policy, you know that this is the issue of the allocation of the net profit and it also includes the ability to direct part of that profit into the investment program. And so in order to be very clear in our definition of the capabilities of the company to implement the short-term program and strategy and the long-term goals and to more clearly navigate whether the notions of the profit which is specifically backed by the real cash flow. So this addition was included.</p>
          <p>And this is the kind of addition which the Board of Directors agrees to. But as far as the issue of the estimation of the dividend base is concerned, considering the results of 2010, this is something as an issue which will be worked on right after these results are made known. And secondly, we shall definitely be guided in our operations by the existing dividend policy, which already has been adopted. And thirdly, the decisive word, the ultimate word, rests with the shareholders' meeting. We, the Management Committee are going to propose the respective dividend, which are going to be estimated based upon the new dividend policy. But it is our shareholders and the shareholders' meeting which has the right to adjust this proposed figure.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thierry Bros from Societe Generale in Paris. I have in fact three questions. The three related to long-term contracts. First of all, your European buyers, E.ON, Eni and GDF SUEZ are asking for even more spot indexations. So can you tell us where you are here and what kind of level of spot indexation you gave them?  The second question is about PGNiG. Is this &#x2013; the new deal, is it only oil-linked. And third question is about the arbitration between Edison and Gazprom in Stockholm. If you had any comments, it would be welcome. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry we had a poor connection. Could you please repeat your three questions, one by one, so that we could also answer them one by one, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question is on spot indexation regarding your big European buyers, E.ON, Eni and GDF SUEZ. They've asked for increased spot indexation? What kind of spot indexation have you given them going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to disappoint you but we won't be able to disclose all of our commercial secrets at this point in time. The only thing that I can tell you is that, in the course of the negotiations with the above-mentioned three companies, we have reached agreements related to their request for the reconsideration of prices that they get. And so these agreements, which we have reached with them in accordance with the signed documents, cover three years, including the current year.</p>
          <p>And as far as the formulas concerned, I shall again repeat what I've said, which is we are not changing the price formulas within our contracts. It's just that some of the contracted volumes we are selling correlated to the spot index.</p>
          <p>But what I would separately mention is that, this volume or its share in our contracts is significantly smaller than what is being mentioned in various analytical as well as the yellow graph. And it is really to prove what I'm saying, because if we were to follow the advice of some of the agencies and which have introduced 50% indexing in relation to the spot prices, then this year in order for us to achieve the planned earnings, we would have had to export 173 billion cubic meters of gas, which the market doesn't need.</p>
          <p>The second question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so thank you very much. The second question is about the PGNiG deals that you signed at the end of October. Is this only oil-linked or is there any volume sold with some spot indexation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please repeat it again? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The deals that you've signed with the Polish company, PGNiG, the 2.2 BCM extra, is it only oil-linked or is there some kind of volumes on the spot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Polish transaction which you are talking about does not envisage any spot indexing. The only thing which makes it any different is that as far as the volumes are concerned, above the minimum contract volumes, a flexible system of discounts can be applied to them. So this is the system of incentivizing a take part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the third question is about the arbitration that Edison has initiated at the Stockholm Court. Do you have any comments on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have quite correctly noted this very rare case when our counterparties resort to an arbitration in as far as the pricing is concerned. And this can be explained by the fact that Promgas, as the company is a joint venture between Gazprom and Eni, and therefore, within our relationship there is an internal conflict of interest.</p>
          <p>As you may understand, we cannot subject to risk the main volumes under our contract with Eni, even make them dependent upon a contractual relationship with an important partner, but still the one who buys from us 2 billion cubic meters of gas only. And so I am confident that continuing its consultations and negotiations with the Edison company, Promgas will be able to find the solution without waiting for any legal settlement or any arbitration solution.</p>
          <p>Not everything in this particular issue depends upon us, quite a lot of things depend upon Eni's position. And personally I do not see anything extraordinary in this. This is a complex market and Edison is trying to utilize its right to resort to the Court of Arbitration to find a solution for itself. In a joint venture, it is like in a marriage, sometimes it is very difficult to come to terms.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for the detailed answers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. The time is flying really very quick in terms of the time set out for Q&amp;A. We are having the time left either for one long question or for two short questions. Please, the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Karen Kostanian [Bank of America-Merrill Lynch]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Karen Kostanian, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. So the question is to give a principle explanation with regard to the domestic market, because it was stated that the volumes grew by 7% and the revenue from the domestic market grew by a different figure. And so what is the explanation behind this discrepancy? And in terms of the export contracts, every three years export contracts can be reconsidered and so what is the volume of the export contracts which can be reconsidered, considering the domestic part of the deliveries for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Smirnov will give us an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much for this specific question, because many either misinterpreted or misunderstood what I was saying because I was not talking about the revenue, but rather about the net profit and to be more specific, the profit not from the gross sales but specifically the net sales. And like I said, and I'm again reiterating that for many years the company has been generating losses from its operations in domestic market and so the net profit which we were able to achieve in '09, it was minimal. Therefore, the 15% increase of the prices which occurred in July was 15% because the 15% increase in terms of the average annual period produces much more because in '09 the price increase was smaller. So we are talking about the current 2010. Therefore, it so happens that this whole additional revenue with the deduction of the profit tax moves into the net profit position. So here this particular dynamics is quite well explainable. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question was about the volume of contracts, export contracts, which can be reconsidered in terms of the three-year period that the company is pursuing, according to its expert policy. I would like to calm the analysts and those who are following our operations, meaning to say that after the market situation worsened, all of our main buyers, Germany, Turkey, Italy and France, have already used up their chance. Despite as you may well know, the gap between the prices in the long-term contracts and the spot indices, although sustained but demonstrates a very definite trend towards closing. And so in view of this, the volumes, which theoretically can be touched by the companies, which so far haven't made their claims but under the contract can do so, amount to less than 5% of our exportable volumes.</p>
          <p>And now, please the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from the line of Constantin Yuminov [Rye, Man &amp; Gor Securities]. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question was whether Gazprom is planning to divest some of its assets in favor of the independent producers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Being the person who is directly involved in the negotiating process, as well as the preparation of these transactions, I can provide you with the explanations so called from the horse's mouth. In the course of the preparation of the development plan for the fields which fall into the SeverEnergia portfolio, it turned out that this field has some very complex <mark type="inaudible" />, which is accompanied by some serious and quite voluminous oil <mark type="inaudible" />. And so with this in mind, considering the fact that within Gazprom Group, in terms of the specialty in our business, we have Gazprom Neft and also, considering the fact that Gazprom is the shareholder in Novatek company, a decision was made to sell at the market prices, to sell this particular asset to the joint venture between Gazprom Neft and Novatek, which is the Yamal Razvitie company.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, Gazprom was able to retain the right to acquire the gas from their field. And currently, we are completing a round of negotiations about the terms of the acquisitions of this gas, which will provide both the buyer and the seller acceptable conditions for mutual operations. So what we are talking about here is not a divestiture from a core asset, but rather about a transfer of a very complex asset to our related and affiliated parties. And using this opportunity, I'd like to remind us that Gazprom has no plans whatsoever to walk out of the list of the shareholders of Novatek company. Besides and as a result of this whole transaction being completed, this would enable us to enjoy very substantial investment resources. So there may not be any problem that we may have of divesting from any core assets whatsoever.</p>
