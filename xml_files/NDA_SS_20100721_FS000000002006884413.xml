        <plist>
          <p>It is a great pleasure to welcome you all to Nordea Second Quarter and Half Year Result Presentation this sunny day in Stockholm, and I will just briefly talk you through what will happen this morning, and then I will leave the word to Christian Clausen.</p>
          <p>Christian will kick-off with the presentation of the reports and the most important numbers, which will as usual be followed by a short Q&amp;A session with analysts and journalists combined, and then Fredrik Rystedt, Chief Financial Officer and Ari Kaperi, our new Chief Risk Officer will join Christian on stage.</p>
          <p>This entire session is webcasted, so please when you ask questions state your name and the company or media that you represent when you ask the question. After that Q&amp;A session, we'll split the groups so that analysts go with Rodney Alfven, Head of IR, and Fredrik and Ari down to Nordea <mark type="inaudible" /> where you can kind of dig into the numbers with the great lust of analysts, and journalists can have one-on-one interviews with Christian over in that corner as usual.</p>
          <p>So, with those very short words, I leave the stage to Christian Clausen, Group President and CEO of Nordea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, and welcome to Nordea on a hot summer day, I can say, and to a hot report. I will go through the report as usual, and give my comments. The key messages we are delivering according to our plans and the outlook we had from the beginning of the year, we see a continued strong customer business and record levels of new customers coming into Nordea and record levels of customer income. The results from items at fair value have decreased from the very high levels we had in Q1 and from the very high levels in first half year '09, and we have improved outlook.</p>
          <p>Let's give me the highlights here, and we see the income from the corporate segment is up quite strongly, it's actually up 10%, the income from the household segment is also up 7%, the total income is down as explained by the net items at fair value. I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>Number of gold customers is growing at a record pace &#x2013; 2.5%, 73,000 total customers, that is including the customers we took over from Fionia Bank on our acquisition in Denmark, but even excluding that number we're still talking about a growth in the number of the gold customers of more than 6% annually. Lending volumes are up 3% in the quarter, 9% in the year, and impaired loans are down, an improvement in credit quality.</p>
          <p>Let's have a view on the result highlights. Net interest income is actually holding up quite well, despite the fact that we have this very low interest rate level, so, which is of course impacting our deposit income and income from liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>Net fee and commission is a very strong development, it's reflecting very high business activity and it's very broadly based. Net result from items at fair value is lower and &#x2013; than the record levels in Q1. And we also see loan losses coming down, this figure is including the payment to the Danish State Guarantee Scheme. Excluding that, the loan losses are coming down to 187 million.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the half year we can see that the net interest income is still holding up well. We see that commission is going up by some 220 million, and we see net items at fair value coming down. So actually, these two items are balancing themselves out. And if we go to the operating profit we can see that it is actually holding up well. As we expected, from the start of the year we would see some lower income this year because the very strong results from the first half year last year was not expected to repeat it, but this is actually holding up quite well.</p>
          <p>Let's give some comments to each item. As I said, net interest income is actually increasing. Lending volumes are up, so customer interest income is up. But still we see a subdued level and that is of course a very, very low interest rate level. We see that is subduing our deposit income and also the income from the liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>The funding operations have been conducted in a very good way in the second quarter and the first half year. We see that we have raised nearly 21 billion in the first half year, 10.5 in the second quarter. We actually opened the funding market in June after it has been closed for several weeks with some very strong issues. So, funding costs for Nordea is still low compared to our competitors but you can say that they are of course higher than they were when we go back.  So the new levels we raised funding at is higher than the old funding that is matured.</p>
          <p>We can say that this figures represent that we have covered our funding well into 2011. We also prolonged the maturity, we are talking about a maturity of around four years now and the new funding rates in Q2 is done at a  maturity which is actually quite high, about six years on average.</p>
          <p>The net fee and commission income is up 13%, as I said, it's very broadly based. The savings area is still producing very well, lending commissions very well but also we have seen an increasing trend in corporate finance, and we had some strong transactions in Q2.</p>
          <p>The next &#x2013; the strong demand for our risk management products continues.  We see the yellow bars. We see that the customer income from capital market activities is going up 25%. And it's actually very stable. We see that the total number for fair value is down. But if we look at the two quarters in the first half year as one, we see an average around 450 and as we'll compare backwards we can see that's actually okay number. It was expected that we could not repeat the numbers from the very -- two very high quarters last year. So, all in all, a very strong customer result and somewhat lower and that is of course impacted in Q2 by the market turmoil we saw as a consequence of the sovereign debt crisis.</p>
          <p>Expenses are in line with our outlook. Our cost management remains firm. Expenses are up 6% compared to the same quarter last year, but we adjust for the currency effects, the strengthening of the Swedish krona, it's actually up only 1%. And if we take the quarter-on-quarter development, it's up here around 2% but if we take out the currency effect and actually also the investments in our projects, the underlying cost development is actually minus 1.2%. Credit quality is improving. We have declining loan losses, down to 35 basis points. If we exclude the payments to the Danish Guarantee Scheme, it's down to 26 basis points, with the decreasing loan losses in almost all areas, also in the Baltics.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans have decreased. The trend has been reversed now, and we see that still a very high number of our impaired loans are still performing. We also see allowances coming up, and this means that our provisioning ratio is increasing to 56%, which is a fairly good number. The capital ratios are strong, and they are maintained at a high level despite the fact that we have grown lending and risk-weighted assets. We have also generated profit, which meant that we are still at around 10% in core Tier 1 ratio. We are part of the CEBS stress test. It proposes no problems to Nordea. We will pass it, and we will actually only be marginally affected in even the worst stress scenario as CEBS is working with according to our own scenarios.</p>
          <p>So, the outlook for 2010. We have two changes. We have an improved macroeconomic outlook for the Nordic area, and we have an outlook that we expect lower loan losses. So, we repeat that the macroeconomic recovery continues. The global development is still fragile. So, there are uncertainties, but the Nordic market has improved quite a lot during the first half year, and we have an improved outlook there. Costs are still expected to increase at the same level as last year, and risk adjusted profit is going to be lower as explained already in the beginning of the year because of lower income and treasury and markets. And then as I said, net loan losses are expected to be lower. We see credit quality stabilize, and we think that will continue as macroeconomic recovery is proceeding.</p>
          <p>Let me go through some slides on our business development. First, the macroeconomic situation, we have an expectation that the GDP growth will be fairly high in all Nordic countries led by Sweden, Finland and Norway and Denmark in that sequence. Modest inflation and fairly good control over the public budgets, Norway of course in a league of its own. Sweden also turning positive and Finland and Denmark in quite good control also at a lower level than the Euro area and the U.S. So, all in all a stable macroeconomic outlook for the Nordic area.</p>
          <p>In the household segment as already mentioned we have a very solid trend. We have attracted 73,000 gold customers in the quarter, which is actually a very high number, underlying an increase of more than 6% annually. We improve our market shares, and we have a very significant number of customer meetings. I will come back to that. Of course these customer meetings are the ones that attract the new customers. And we also see good customer demand, with increased volumes as daily margins. So, the total income in the household segment is actually up 7%.</p>
          <p>The corporate activity is also very high. Corporate income is up 10%. We have improved business confidence and some demand for borrowing money. But also for other types of transaction like risk management and corporate finance and I -- we can conclude that our strategy of building the corporate relationships strategy is paying off extremely well. Especially in the top segment with the very large corporates, which is a specific growth area and a strategic growth initiative for Nordea, we see a strong development, a stronger position, increased share wallets, and we established as announced one month ago a new area to continue this good development, where we recruited Casper von Koskull, who will start a bit later this year in 1st of September. And we think this is an important area and that this development will continue.</p>
          <p>Some comments on other areas shaping our services in international is a good development. We see a strong number of transaction executed. Confidence is coming back, and we see a solid demand and very good result development with good development in margins and lower loan losses.</p>
          <p>Financial institutions where we gained market share, the activity in that segment is lower because of the financial turmoil in Europe, but we have gained market share in that area. And then, the new European markets, we see a very strong development as you can see, especially Poland, where we have income up 50% year-on-year. We will continue the growth in Poland as you know we are now ready to establish the first branches and during the rest of the year we will open some 40 new branches, maybe a bit more.</p>
          <p>The Baltics are also stabilizing, lower loan losses and we are turning profit in Q2 in Baltics again after four quarters with negative results. We also are strongly improved position in capital markets. As I already mentioned, we see that in the commission line, we remain the leading arranger of Nordic syndicated loans, and we have participated at a good number of corporate finance deals with good results. So, all in all the strategic initiative on improving our corporate finance area and capital markets area is also paying off.</p>
          <p>We have a solid trend in asset management even despite the turmoil we still see assets growing which is a very good development and we also see very strong inflow broadly based. Normally, we see inflows stopping up when we see financial turmoil in the markets, but this quarter we &#x2013; even despite the turmoil have a good inflow and widely diversified, very strong in institutional. We also see our European fund distribution showing very good numbers again.</p>
          <p>And Life &amp; Pension is also on track. Good growth in premiums. If we compare Q2 over Q2 last year we have a 30% increase in premiums and we can note that our market shares in Sweden have over the last few years grown from a very low level to 6.5%, which is also a good achievement.</p>
          <p>On Strategy, you probably remember, the last time we were here and the beginning of the year, we are pursuing a strategy of prudent growth. We will carefully navigate between the risks and the opportunities. And we said in January, the risks are out there and we have in Q2 been reminded there are risks, the sovereign debt crisis is of course and the consequences of that is still a risk. So, we will carefully navigate between risk and opportunities. So, prudent growth is the name of the strategy, and I will not go through that in detail.</p>
          <p>I will comment on some of the growth initiatives we have launched. We launched six growth initiatives and three efficiency initiatives you can say. In general, the comment is, they are all on track and they are delivering and you can also see that in some of our numbers. But a few comments will be that the biggest and most important initiative is of course our future distribution covering our whole branch network.</p>
          <p>We have converted 14 branches into the new format running them as a pilot and they're showing very encouraging results with an increased number of customer meetings and much more efficiency. Also the new customer acquisition project is working, and needless to say 73,000 new customers is showing off. So, we are actually in the new setup, having more meetings, attracting more customers and getting this full relationship with the top segment.</p>
          <p>Growth from Finland is also well on track. We have employed close to 100 new advisers and specialists and 28 branches are now subject to change, where we'll relocate them and refurbish them and make our service ready to serve more customers where they are.</p>
          <p>The Corporate Merchant Banking Sweden which is initiative is also developing very well. We see that in the numbers; increased share of wallet and a full focus on this. Customer driven markets business as mentioned is also showing clear progress and strong results. It is clear that especially in a situation like now after the market turmoil that all corporates need these risk management products, so the set up we have is very strong and actually servicing the customers here.</p>
          <p>Growth from Poland, very well on track as I said, income up 50% and we are ready to open the branches now and we will during the year as I said open approximately 40 branches.</p>
          <p>And on the efficiency side, it takes a bit more for the projects to deliver as planned, but we have the first deliveries on the market infrastructure on the derivatives and commodities was executed and we have a number of deliveries on the IT side as well.</p>
          <p>So, all in all we have green lights all over and we think that this is extremely important to actually make us deliver because what we said in January was that these initiatives will create the momentum that will make us meet our long-term target, and we are confident about that as we go by.</p>
          <p>So the key messages. We are delivering more or less according to the plan we set out in the beginning of the year, and we're quite happy about that remembering that actually Q2 was characterized by market turmoil and difficult conditions. This continued strong customer business is laying the foundation for the future with high income growth, good development in both lending deposits and assets under management. The inflow of new customers, the positive development in the capital markets area and corporate finance. The credit quality improvement is clear, impaired loans are decreasing, and we expect lower loan losses. So, the way forward is clear focused on prudent growth. This careful navigation between the risks and opportunities because the risks are still out there and full focus on executing on the growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks, and we will now be ready to take some questions, and I will be joined by Fredrik Rystedt, whom you have seen several times and Ari Kaperi whom you have also seen but now in a new position as Chief Risk Officer. Ari has been in the bank in 25 years and been in risk and credits in many years, but most recently for some years as member of Group Executive Management, he has been running new European markets, institutional business and shipping, offshore services and so on. So moved from the 1st of July to his new position replacing Carl-Johan Granvik. So welcome on the podium and you can ask him difficult questions. He is ready for that.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there will be a microphone &#x2013; two microphones actually, and I will kind of give you the word. So let's begin and start here from the right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, <mark type="inaudible" /> from Dow Jones. Quick question, with risk adjustment profits lower this year, can you give any comment on your goal of doubling risk adjusted profits from 2006?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The statement is the same as from the beginning of the year, we had a very strong progress last year more than 20% in risk adjusted profit and we expect that this year to be lower and we have repeated that we expect to deliver on the long-term target. The reason for the growth initiatives is exactly that they will give us the momentum, which you can say we already have, but they will support that momentum and make it possible to deliver. So it is more or less according to plans.</p>
          <p>It was since the launch in '06 the idea that over this period of seven years where we would double, we wouldn't be above and below and above and right now, we are above and we will then of course this year probably be a bit below the line, but we have this momentum which makes us quite confident that we have the potential in Nordea to grow at this pace. The number of new customers, the way we develop our businesses gives us confidence for that. Of course, there is always uncertainty in each quarter, in each half year, even in each year and of course, the conditions here in Q2 was not especially favorable in the capital market &#x2013; in the markets with the market turmoil, but we have the confidence that we will deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Credit Suisse. Two questions, first one is on commission income. Other on commission income is, so we see a very sharp increase there. Could you just tell us what's driving that? Second question is in Denmark, where asset quality is improving quite steadily if we exclude a Bank Package 1? Could you guys tell us about the environment? How quickly should we see things normalizing in Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can maybe start with the other commissions. It's &#x2013; commission contains a lot of different, of course, activities as you know, and other commissions is particularly advisory fees, corporate finance fees. So one of our ambitions &#x2013; strategic ambitions is of course also to build that part of our offering to our customers and it has, as Christian alluded to before, actually been very successful in this quarter. So it basically relates to those advisory and corporate finance assignments. Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Denmark, maybe you would say something about the credit there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you said, in Denmark we have seen a decrease in our credit policies excluding this Danish current year package. It's very sensitive to watch that the interest rate level, what is  happening on the household side in the Danish credit quality going forward or that's one element to be &#x2013; to bear in mind. Though on the corporate side, it's more or less the small and medium customers. Where we still see that there are lot of customers who have challenge in their business models, but for example in the agricultural side, we see a trend of improvement in the market prices and in the large corporate side. It seems to be relatively stable. So I would say that we have bottomed out the deterioration of the credit quality but still there are some issues to be aware of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got one question over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. First of all, asset quality there. Do you feel comfortable enough about the future to start dissolving collective reserves or is that too early? Secondly in Denmark, this cost, I think &#x20AC;58 million in the second quarter, should we expect that in the third quarter as well or is that partly just a catch-up effect? And third question, Finland, have we seen or have Nordea seen any large losses in Finland this quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess this was for me. Collective loan loss provisions, in this quarter actually we didn't release collective loan loss provisions so that the net change was more or less stable. There was a very, very  small increase but as we can see is that, let's say now when the credit quality is improving, ratings are improving, we will see, let's say, according to our models that release in many industries going forward if  the situation, let's say, remains. We are calculating our collective provisions according to our own model so that it's directly related to what is happening in the corporate ratings and if they improve, then we release our provisions.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; then there are some let's say, risk management adjustment made to collective provisions and there we are pretty conservative. We still see the fragility of this development so that we are little bit conservative on that side. On Denmark and this Danish guarantee scheme, actually the maximum burden for the banks is 10 billion Danish and that scheme expires now in the end of Q3. The maximum amount for us, if we are forced to pay the maximum, is in euros around 210 million. Now we have provided about 160 million so far. So that, in maximum in the worst case, we will see at least another 50 million in Q3, but then the program is expired.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Finland, it was your third question; in Finland, we don't see a lot of trade losses from bigger and medium size companies. But there has been in each quarter let's say one or two of these kind of, let's say, little bit larger ones which is keeping this Finnish loan loss level in the area of 50 basis points. There are no this kind of crucial bigger risk cases for the time being in Finland so that I am pretty comfortable in this situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you would just hand the microphone one step back there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Rickard Henze from ABG. I have a couple of questions regarding the lending growth. You're seeing 2 to 3% exchange rate adjusted lending growth in the quarter, quarter-on-quarter. What's your view on the second half of 2010, can you accelerate this growth? And secondly when you grow in certain areas if you like to comment on which areas that is, do you see any margin pressure in those areas or are the margins fairly stable despite you taking market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen a stabilization of the margins but we still have &#x2013; as I actually explained last time, on our margin grid, we have a requirement of what margins we take depending on the rating of the customer and the maturity of the commitment. We still believe that lending margins will go up, going forward because the cost of funding the lending is going up for our banks right now when old funding expire and the new funding is more expensive. The growth is actually widely distributed in our countries and our segments. I think the growth will continue and there might have been some catching up effects in first half of the year for working capital for companies, see more and then building up working capital. But we are still quite confident, we will see a demand for new lending going forward and we are ready to meet that demand. Competition is pretty fierce but as I said I am sure that in all bank space, new lending &#x2013; new funding cost, it will be clear that, that margins need to go up somewhat more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have two people up front there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Grabe, Handelsbank, and two questions. Firstly on the mortgage lending margins in Norway. They are down 7 basis points even adjusting for the six weeks notice period. If you can elaborate a bit about the reasons for that and also the outlook regarding mortgage margins in Norway.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to deposits. You state that increased competition, fierce competition is maybe not pushing you out of the market but at least leading to lower volumes, and in particular under the corporate deposit side. If you can elaborate a bit about the strategy going forward when it comes to deposit volumes and also how you assess deposits as parts &#x2013; as part of your total funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I maybe take this? If I start with Norway, there is no real comment on the Norwegian margin, we have of course fluctuations as always in the quarters, and this particular quarter is down. We don't perceive the trend to be negative on the Norwegian market.  So, it's not a change of trend or break of trend, it has been fairly stable in Norway. This particular quarter, it was slightly down, but I think that's not &#x2013; no major drama in that particular question. I think the deposit side is an interesting issue of course and our philosophy there is that deposits form a very good base of course of Nordea's total funding, and we assume that to be the case also going forward. However, of course, we always look at managing short-term wholesale funding versus deposits, and particularly those deposits that are more financial in nature. So when you see a deposit pricing that is not profitable for us, we may in occasions step back so to speak, but our overall philosophy is of course to maintain the market share but not of course be the price leader in that segment, to basically maintain our market share. And it will of course as it is now be an important part of our funding structure also going forward but the profitability is important for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can say that, the most important part, is, of course the stable deposits, the transaction accounts, the cash pools from businesses and so on. That we get when we attract new customers, that's not a price issue, it's an issue of having the customer's cash flow and that is the stable deposits. And what we may not fully get right now is when a customer goes out and asks for a six month deposit on a share price then we see right now in some marketplaces that actually banks are creating not much higher than the alternative and we don't do that maybe because we have the alternative of attracting loan funding in other ways and other banks may need the deposits &#x2013; those kind of deposits, but we have to know that they are certainly not stable, when they expire there will be a new bidding round. So actually this is a pricing issue and we are very observant about overpaying deposits.</p>

          <p>You actually see that when you look at the underlying, the sticky and stable deposits will actually grow and it was a pure financial decrease replaced by cheaper wholesale funding, much to that point.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi, Magnus Andersson at ABG. First of all on this lending growth that looks good and it really highlight the progress in CMB and capital markets. Can you say something about the competitive situation there during the last two years you say it's still fierce, but has it changed in any way in your view over the last couple of years of this crisis. And secondly, more specific question, you still keep around &#x20AC;50 billion in &#x2013; as a liquidity reserve, do you see any potential to reduce that in anyway in becoming, let's say six to nine months, given your view on the common market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start and then you can continue, but there are two trends, the first trend is that most corporate customers have learnt something of the development up to the financial crisis and that is they want stable banks that can deliver a commitment over time. So typically, a corporate have &#x2013; are concentrating their banking relationships to fewer stronger banks that were likely to deliver in good times and bad times. So that's one trend which is of course favoring Nordea. But the other trend is very recently in the last two quarters or so we have seen competition coming back again from weaker banks, you can say, being capitalized and also some international banks which are being capitalized. So suddenly we see some of the players we saw back before the financial crisis start to bid in on corporate lending again which is a bit, yeah, interesting, I would say. So that is another trend and therefore, competition is pretty fierce here right now, but the first trend, of course outweigh that a bit because I think most corporates have learned the lessons back from the '05, '06, '07 where you may not necessarily take the cheapest bank, you may want to have some in there which also hangs in when it gets tougher. So that's the two trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now liquidity buffer, I think it's fair say we have maintained a conservative liquidity risk approach throughout this crisis. We have had lots of long-term funding and as you saw here by Christian &#x2013; presented by Christian, we have extended that and part of that liquidity risk we're seeing so to speak is also been a big liquidity buffer and you have seen that in our liquidity risk framework, long survival periods and of course also AA rating and a very strong position. So it has been key and of course now looking forward, what is the most important thing is what regulation will come in the next six months to a year as you're so much aware of and the exact size of the liquidity buffer is not possible to define at this point of time. However, having said that if you look at everything out there, currently on the table on the regulatory side nothing would suggest that liquidity buffer is actually going to decrease for any bank. I think on the contrary, may even have to increase at least for other banks but we will of course revert back to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have time for &#x2013; let's say, two last questions then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Christian Hall from Swedbank. I had a question relating to the commission income within the corporate finance. If you can comment on the sustainability of that high number and if you could say, and maybe add something to the pipeline when it comes to the corporate finance business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are building, I mean, two years ago we launched a new strategy would build this area, it's part of our integrated corporate banking offer. So what we are doing, we're not building an investment bank, we are building a holistic corporate banking offer where we have capital markets, risk management products and corporate finance as a very important drivers. That development over the last two years has been very strong, very successful and now we think we have such a holistic offering. We have much more to do in that area and we are still doing it, putting forward our positions and I think we are gaining more mandates.</p>
          <p>And we have to remember we have actually relationship to all major corporates in the Nordic area. So obviously we are in there, so it is, of course, our strategy to grow that business. It is not straight line quarter-by-quarter of course, but I think when we look through the next few years, I am sure we'll see this business growing further because it's such an integrated part of the advisory business we do for corporates. So, I cannot answer what it will be next quarter, but I can say that the trend is clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we actually have two more question, one there and one there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a detail, I mean what's behind the very, very strong growth in the derivatives book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it's &#x2013; a pretty simple answer to it. It's basically the movement of the FX. So, I mean, in particular actually dollar and the SEK here. So what basically happens is of course that we have hedge positions so both sides of the balance sheet will grow in terms of &#x2013; on the sides when you have movement on the FX side. So if you recall for instance the second quarter of last year, we had the exact same kind of growth. And we have also shrinkages when currencies or interest rates move in that particular direction. So, whilst in Q2 of last year, the movement was predominantly a result of movements in interest rates, this time it's basically the currency side which is a typical shorter term impact. So, the increase is caused by FX movements basically on both sides of the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that affect risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has a marginal or smaller impact because you have a collateral position on both sides. So, in particular versus the corporate customers you have a collateral position, but of course that's marginal in comparison to balance sheet growth. So, it's not a major issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But this is not new. Swedish export industries have hedged their dollar, now when the dollar moves up and Swedish krona moves up, that has an effect, so as &#x2013; and liabilities go up. When these contracts expire, they will go down again. So this is obviously a part of our corporate business. The net effect is not large. So, this happens every time we will see dramatic movements in FX or, as Fredrik said, on interest rates where of course our derivatives position is actually positions derived from hedging the corporates balance sheet especially under FX, of course, the export income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then if you would pass the microphone down two rows, please, for the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I'm sorry to get back to the net gains line, but I was just wondering if you could clarify slightly more on the treasury net gains. Should we understand it so that is simply a component in the liquidity portfolio that have fallen somewhat in value, is that the main driver behind the sequential drop in net gains or is it other things that are more important? And if I could just ask also some completely unrelated question regarding credit demand from corporates. I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on whether you believe that in this cycle more credit demand than usual will be sold through the capital markets than through traditional bank lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could start. I would say that it's very simple for treasury; they are running our 50 billion liquidity buffer and our 25 billion equity and they have a risk mandate for that. In Q1, they made a very good result. And in Q2 it was not a good result and the reason is the financial turmoil, interest &#x2013; loan interest rates came down and credit spreads widened and of course that's part of the hedges they are doing. So I think that's the explanation. And the second question was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether in this cycle the capital markets will supply more of the corporate credit than in the other cycles therefore the corporate bond issuance will be more common than bank lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it actually &#x2013; I think it will grow. I think capital markets will grow in favor of bank lending in general and that's also part of course, our own strategy, building competencies in that area. That's also at least from what we can see at this point in time supported by timing and regulations. So it's at least likely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
