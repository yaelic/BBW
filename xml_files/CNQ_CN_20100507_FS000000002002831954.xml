        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources 2010 first quarter results conference call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead, Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending our conference call. We will discuss our 2010 first quarter results and also update our plans for the balance of 2010. Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our Vice President; Peter Janson, our Senior Vice President of Horizon Operations, who will talk about the operational progress we're making at Horizon; and Doug Proll, our Senior Vice President of Finance, who will discuss our overall financial position.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press release. And also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars, and production reserves are both expressed as before royalties unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>I'll make a couple of initial comments before I turn the call over to the other participants. The first quarter again saw Canadian Natural achieve strong cash flow of over $1.5 billion, which was about $0.5 billion more than our total CapEx in the quarter, and our first quarter is traditionally our highest spend quarter for drilling and development.</p>
          <p>As a result of course, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, net debt to book cap of 31%, well below the bottom of our range. Steve will cover more details of our drilling and development activities when he reviews each of our operating areas.</p>
          <p>Our production mix continues to focus more on oil than natural gas as we direct more capital to the higher return oil projects. In the first quarter, we realized 82% of our revenue from oil sales with a production mix of 64% oil. Our net backs, being revenue per unit of sales less the royalties and operating costs, continue to be strong with over $44 per barrel net back for oil sales and over 3.50 for gas sales. This reflects a continuous focus on reducing budgeted operating costs in all of our business units.</p>
          <p>At our annual shareholders meeting held yesterday, the shareholders approved the amendments to our stock option plan and the two-for-one stock split. It is expected our common shares will trade on the new basis around May 19 in Toronto and May 28 in New York. The directors declared a quarterly dividend, which amounts to $0.075 per share on the new post-split basis.</p>
          <p>We have allocated about $1 billion from our expected realized excess cash flow to augment our capital expenditures on a number of property acquisitions in our core operating regions of northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia. These properties will provide additional production volumes and cash flow after the acquisitions are closed later in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Before we turn the call over to Steve, I'd ask Allan to make some comments. Allan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We had an excellent start in 2010. We are delivering significant value over the upcoming year and will deliver for future years to come.</p>
          <p>The company's production in the first quarter showed strong results, placing us in line with or above expectations in our international operations and North American assets. We commenced a record drilling program in conventional heavy crude oil, drilling 150 wells in the first quarter. Heavy oil growth is strong.</p>
          <p>The company continues to leverage its large land base and dominant infrastructure in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. First quarter production results at Horizon indicate the company's move towards sustainable production. We achieved production at the high end of our guidance, and our team maintains its focus on reaching operational reliability.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on efficiencies and execution, maximizing the value of every dollar spent in both crude oil and natural gas. During the quarter, despite a reduction in natural gas drilling, we've been able to maintain reasonable operating costs. This demonstrates the efforts of our committed and dedicated team of people to promote efficient and low cost operations.</p>
          <p>Over to you, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter was strong, with a 10% production growth over Q1 2009, as well as strong, sustainable free cash flow, resulting in significant debt repayment, all in line with our projections for the year in which we expect to deliver 10% production growth, 11% cash flow growth, while only spending 72% of our cash flow, and having between 1.7 and $2.1 billion of free cash flow to pay down debt and make our already strong balance sheet even stronger.</p>
          <p>The results from our first quarter drilling program have been very good. As a result, our production performance overall is towards the high end of guidance. Progress has also been very good on our long-term developments, particularly towards achieving long-term reliability at Horizon.</p>
          <p>As always, we remain focused on cost discipline. Our capital costs are good, and we're delivering our projects at or below our expectations. And our operating costs are at the low end of guidance. And if not for the unplanned maintenance issues in January and early February at Horizon, Horizon operating costs would also be well within guidance, with March and April operating costs in the $32 range right now.</p>
          <p>Operations-wise, we're off to great start in 2010 and we have no reason to believe we will not be able to continue to deliver for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning in more detail asset by asset, first to gas in Canada; Canadian Natural, as you know, has the largest land base in Western Canada. We dominate the land base and infrastructure in our core areas. And as a result, we are the low cost producer. First quarter production exceeded the upper end of our guidance range, reflecting the success of our small, 45-well first quarter drilling program, and the strength of our gas assets. Our gas land base is very well positioned with strong assets and teams in the conventional, foothills, resource, and unconventional plays.</p>
          <p>As we stated in our last conference call, Canadian Natural's plan for 2010 is not only to preserve, but to strengthen our dominant gas asset base. As a result of the success of our first quarter drilling program, we have added roughly $75 million to our gas development budget to preserve additional land, as well as we made a number of acquisitions in our core areas that add properties to both our oil and gas asset base. Although we believe we will not see a robust gas price environment in 2010 or 2011 for that matter, we believe it's prudent at this time to preserve additional expiring land and to make these property acquisitions in our core areas, extending our land and infrastructure dominance.</p>
          <p>In the long run, we believe gas prices will return to more reasonable levels, and it makes sense to preserve additional high quality lands and pick up select properties that fit well and we can consolidate within our core areas. Both land expiries and acquisitions, as you know, are time sensitive and won't be there when gas prices strengthen.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural also dominates our heavy oil and thermal oil asset base in Canada. As you've heard me say before, we believe our heavy oil and thermal assets are the hidden gem in our portfolio, which add tremendous value, yet are unappreciated by the Street. Our thermal assets alone have 33 billion barrels of oil in place and over 6 billion recoverable in our defined plan. Our plan targets adding approximately 285,000 barrels of incremental heavy oil production in a very disciplined, step-wise, and cost controlled manner.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our progress has been good. And as expected, in our Primrose developments at Primrose North, East &#x2013; North and East, and Wolf Lake, production will average between 80 to 90,000 barrels a day in 2010. And since this is a cyclic process, we will see peaks and troughs of 60 to over 100,000 barrels a day. We've also allocated another $50 million to these properties for 2010 to drill another additional 22 wells, and increasing facility capacity, preparing for the increased production expected in 2011.</p>
          <p>Primrose East is our most recent incremental step on the road to 285,000 barrels a day. And as is well known, we had a containment issue in Primrose East in early 2009. Diagnostic steaming is complete and has been successful. We are now proceeding to surveillance steaming. The correction is expected to average roughly 16 to 20,000 barrels a day in 2010 as we slowly return to normal steaming activities. I'm happy to report the return of Primrose East remains on track.</p>
          <p>At Kirby, our next thermal project, we expect to receive regulatory approval in 2010. We will complete the detailed engineering design work and develop a more detailed cost estimate with a target of sanctioning Kirby in Q4 2010. We are taking a very disciplined approach to the engineering and construction of Kirby to ensure effective cost control with first steam targeted for mid-2013. In anticipation of Kirby's sanction, we have allocated an additional $10 million in 2010 to take advantage of some cost saving opportunities as well as proceed with some early civil work at Kirby.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, we will in 2010 continue with our program to convert the field to our highly successful polymer flood. We're on track with our 2010 plan to push the Pelican area on our polymer flood from 28% to 40% by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>One of the challenges we have had at Pelican Lake is the prediction of polymer performance, with actual performance exceeding expectations. To ensure we have the facility capacity required in 2011 and that we don't get trapped and ensure we could handle the production ramp from our 2010 program, we have allocated an additional $50 million in 2010 to make sure our facilities are ready.</p>
          <p>As you know Pelican Lake, is a world-class pool with 4 billion barrels in place and roughly 560 million barrels of resource recoverable with the polymer flood, a very large pool with very robust development economics. Pelican Lake continues to generate significant value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our primary heavy oil program continues to roll along effectively and efficiently. In this commodity and cost environment, primary heavy oil generates top-decile returns on capital and our asset portfolio. And importantly, it also generates the quickest payout and the largest cash-on-cash return.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we have drilled 150 wells. For the year, we'll drill 600 primary heavy oil wells, a record number of primary wells for Canadian Natural, roughly 25% more than we drilled in 2009. Our dominant high quality land base, infrastructure, and effective operations allow us to drill this size of program on a very cost effective basis, making primary heavy oil one of the best value generators in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to the North Sea, production has been steady and near the top end of our production guidance for Q1. As planned, we have started up the drill string in Ninian, with a plan to drill one well and complete three well interventions in 2010. We are on the first intervention right now. As well, we'll undertake some subsea work at the T-Block and upgrade facilities on all five platforms in 2010. In the North Sea, we're also preserving our capability to allocate additional capital and start up a second drill string later in 2010.</p>
          <p>In offshore West Africa, Olowi, and Gabon, we continue to drill off the B Platform and have brought on three of the first six wells from Platform B last week, with the fourth well anticipated to be brought on shortly. Although very early, the results from the first two wells do look encouraging. The initial rate on these sea wells is in the 8,000 to 10,000 barrel a day range, which is very encouraging. However, expect these wells to fall off quickly, down to the 3 to 4,000-barrel a day range. After completing the fifth and sixth wells on Platform B, we'll move the rig to Platform A with first production from Platform A targeted for Q4 2010.</p>
          <p>In C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, production is stable. However, Espoir will be shutting down as planned for an extended period in Q2 as we install additional compression at Espoir to handle increased associated gas production. This will impact Q2 production and is reflected in our guidance numbers. It's important to note that offshore West Africa has some of the highest return on capital projects in our portfolio, and along with the North Sea generates significant free cash flow for Canadian Natural.</p>
          <p>Turning to Horizon, we continue to make good progress, driving towards sustained reliability. There is no question the operation can and has delivered at or above 110,000 barrels a day of synthetic crude production and the design capacity. We did struggle in the first half of the quarter while maintaining plant reliability as we continued to work on operational kinks, equipment failures, and the compounding effect the cold weather had on our ability to quickly recover from equipment failures.</p>
          <p>Since mid-February, we've made significant progress in our ability to operate and optimize the Horizon operation. The production by month is as follows: January, 72,000; February, just over 84,000; March, just over 103,000; and April, just under 101,000 barrels a day. The issues we had in January and February resulted in additional maintenance expenses being incurred. And as a result, the operating costs for Q1 were outside our guidance. Our operating costs for March and April are running in the $32 a barrel range, and we expect with higher volumes in the second half of the year to maintain our operating cost guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're doing well and we're gaining increased confidence in our ability to operate the plant reliably as well as our ability to predict the likelihood of upcoming issues. With that in mind, we'll be proactively taking some selective planned outages in May to address issues that may impair the ability to operate at higher and more reliable levels and prepare us for a sustained run at designed production rates of 110,000 barrels a day for the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect May production to be in the 75 to 80,000 barrel a day range for May.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it over to Peter Janson, who was recently promoted to Senior Vice President of Horizon Operations in February; allowing R&#xE9;al Doucet, our Senior Vice President of Horizon Projects, to focus on our very important task of preparing and executing the Horizon Phase 2/3 expansion. He will give you a brief account of some of the activities he will be undertaking in May and what risks remain that could impact us in 2010. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Horizon operations were utilized in the month of May to complete a number of major preventive maintenance activities, including some component replacements in the oil preparation plan. During this period, we'll be addressing some of the risks that remain outstanding from the beginning of the year and our January and February events.</p>
          <p>Some specifics on what we are doing in each area as follows: in mining, we are doing a shovel preventive maintenance. We do one a month, and currently we have three electric and two hydraulic shovels in service. In the oil preparation plant, we're replacing one of two surge-bin feed conveyors, and we're changing out one of two screens. And these screens, we rebuild them; they're replaced on a four-month schedule currently. We're also replacing a number of valves on the taming boxes due to wear.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, there is a lot of activity in the oil preparation plant: cyclone valve rotation and pump maintenance, which is fairly routine. In primary upgrading, we are currently pigging our coker furnace tubes. It looks like we're getting 2 to 2.5 months of run before we go through a pigging cycle on a sustained basis. Our sulfur units, we have had a peak restriction due to a burner issue in one of our two trains, and that burner replacement and repair has been completed in the month of May.</p>
          <p>Secondary upgrading, we have had in the past a number of reliability issues with PSA valves in the reformer. This has been resolved. We no longer have a concern there.</p>
          <p>In utilities, we are having our boiler annual inspections. The controls testing is underway. There is a gas turbo generator outage and maintenance, and we have some power line and breaker repairs that we'll undertaking in the month of May.</p>
          <p>So coming out of these outages, the expectation is that we should see a slight improvement in peak production capacity as both sulfur units will be at peak performance. Recall back in June of 2009, we peaked at 121,000 barrels a day. I'd like to be able to do that again and more frequently. We continue towards sustained 110,000 barrel a day SCO [Synthetic Crude Oil] capacity, as Steve has mentioned. In February of this year, we had eight consecutive days at or above 110,000 barrels. In March, we had ten consecutive days; and then in April, seven; and then another 12 days at or above 110,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>I do need to, however, balance the optimism by highlighting some of the residual risks we still carry in the operation. In the mining area, we have increased maintenance on mobile equipment, which is resulting from longer haul distances associated with blending our ore. Dozer availability does need to improve.</p>
          <p>In the oil preparation plant, maintenance planning and execution strategies need to be adaptive as the wear rates do seem high. Overall availability of the OPP is a key factor in long-term sustained production. We need to keep the coker full.</p>
          <p>In primary upgrading, longer term coker heater firing and burner management is required to control the coking effect and the decoking and pigging cycle in the heater tubes. Secondary upgrading, we're monitoring CO reliability on the pumps. And we do have vibration on our hydrogen plant forced draft fans that we continue to monitor.</p>
          <p>In summary, the single most important factor going forward in Horizon is our ability to foresee maintenance requirements, and then plan and successfully execute the work. If we miss those, there's a direct correlation to production and increased costs due to maintenance.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. As you can see, we've got many issues we've faced, but we quickly mitigated most of those, and we've got a proactive plan here going ahead, which I think reflects the strength and dedication of our operations team.</p>
          <p>It's important to remember that Horizon is a world-class asset with over 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. We have targeted increased production through Phases 2 and 3 to 232,000 barrels a day, and with further expansions in Phase 4 and 5 to just under 500,000 barrels a day or 0.5 million barrels a day of light sweet crude, with no declines for 40 years and virtually no reserve replacement costs. Horizon definitely is a world-class asset.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we continue to complete work on tranche two of our Phase 2/3 expansion. And additionally, we're well on our way to completing our detailed lessons learned from Phase 1 so we can incorporate any cost reduction or effectiveness measures into future expansions. Along with this, we'll complete significant engineering work on future expansions and prepare a more detailed cost.</p>
          <p>It is our expectation that we'll have a more detailed cost estimate by Q4 2010 and a better understanding of any modifications we may make to our execution strategy. This work will be completed to give a better certainty on costing and in various environments.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is committed to the expansion of Horizon to 232,000 barrels a day, and ultimately just under 500,000 barrels a day of light sweet crude.</p>
          <p>As always, Canadian Natural is very focused on cost control and creating value for shareholders. And we will be sanctioning the expansion of Horizon, but only when we can be assured that reasonable cost certainty can be achieved. We're not there yet.</p>
          <p>It's clear that Canadian Natural is in a very strong and enviable position. Horizon is a world-class asset that is and will continue to add tremendous value to shareholders. Our thermal oil &#x2013; heavy oil assets can add similar value in the magnitude of Horizon, yet in more manageable sizes, and in my opinion are the hidden gem of our portfolio, and in this low cost gas price environment generating even greater value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our light oil assets, both internationally and in Canada, as well as our primary heavy oil assets in Canada continue to generate strong returns. And in this low gas price environment, our strategy of maintaining a well balanced portfolio and the fact that we're the low cost producer will ensure that we are able to weather a sustained period of low gas prices.</p>
          <p>Our teams are strong throughout the company. And as Doug will point out, our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. Our capital program is very flexible, giving Canadian Natural the ability not only to maximize the value of our well balanced portfolio, but also capture any opportunities that will present themselves in this environment.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is in a great position. And in today's environment with our team, our strategy, and our assets, I believe Canadian Natural is better positioned than ever before.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn it over to Doug to update you on our financial position and our prudent financial management.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning. In the first quarter of 2010, as John mentioned, Canadian Natural generated over $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations and spent in capital expenditures just over $1 billion, allowing us to continue to reduce our long-term debt to $8.9 billion at the end of March. Year over year, we have reduced long-term debt by $4.2 billion. Debt to book capitalization is now 31%, debt to EBITDA 1.3 times, resulting in a strong and healthy balance sheet. This is good news to our shareholders and debt investors as we have witnessed significant financial market volatility this week not seen since 2008.</p>
          <p>Our commodity hedge program remains active. On the crude oil side, we have 200,000 barrels per day collared for the second quarter with floors of US WTI 60 and $65. We also have 150,000 barrels a day completed for the second half with floors of US WTI of 60 to $70.</p>
          <p>On the natural gas front, we have 620,000 GJs per day with AECO pricing floors of 4.50 and $6.00 for Q2 and Q3, and 220,000 GJs per day with an AECO pricing floor of $6.00 for Q4. The details of these positions are included in our press release and are also posted on our website. We believe these positions combined with our focus on cost control, our capital expenditure flexibility, and our balance sheet strength will ensure that we can complete our capital programs, build our inventories of lands and prospects, and allow us the confidence to focus on mid and long-term projects.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural continues to grow and diversify its production base and focus on being the low cost producer, while at the same time building a strong and flexible balance sheet and providing returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and value enhancement.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will return you to John.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, gentlemen. As you can see, we are on track for another very successful year. And as always, our balanced business plan and focus will be directed towards achieving shareholder value in what seems like an almost continuous volatile marketplace that we deal in.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, I would like to open up the meeting for any questions that people may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, guys. I had a question on Kirby. As you start to move down the road on pricing that out, as you look at the various components, do you think that the overall returns are going to be most impacted by lower material costs, labor inputs, or just construction efficiency and process efficiency, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew. It's Steve here. Obviously we're very focused on costs and cost control and certainly at Kirby, and where we see the biggest impact here is twofold. It really is going to come from construction, which is going to be driven by engineering and being well prepared before we start. So we're very focused on getting the engineering correct and at a very high level of completion before we start. And we believe with that and being very focused on the control and monitoring of the project, we'll be able to control construction costs. But really construction is where you get the cost overruns; but it starts early with the engineering. If you don't have the engineering right, then you have a very difficult time getting construction right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, thanks. And recognizing that the look-back study isn't 100% complete, are there some lessons that you've learned so far that you're incorporating into the Kirby design?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one of the lessons that we learned is that even though in Horizon we had a high degree of engineering complete before we started, we found that the more engineering we had and the more Canadian Natural direct involvement in construction, the better control we had on costs. And if you look at Primrose East, which is a good example of that, we had a high level of engineering done and we had much more direct involvement of Canadian Natural personnel in the construction. And Primrose East was built essentially in the same time and had much better cost control. So we're going to take that lesson into Kirby, and we're going to try to apply that going forward at Horizon.</p>

          <p>Thank you. You provided some comments on the $1 billion of property acquisitions. It sounded like it was a mixture of natural gas and oil property. I just wondered if you had any more color in terms of either reserves acquired, how much of it is more just acreage acquisitions, and the types of plays. It sounds like it's a smattering of things within your core areas, but if you did have any more detail, that would be appreciated.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Arjun, we don't really disclose too much on normal property acquisitions because it's ongoing business for us. These are a number of acquisitions. Within our core areas, I would say it's about a quarter oil when you add them all up, and mostly in northwest Alberta and northeast BC, as John mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>On the gas side, which I suspect you're more interested in, they do have a range of plays and mostly deeper, tighter plays which may be called conventional. There is some unconventional plays in some of those acquisitions. But overall, I'd classify it as more of a conventional play type. It does allow us to dominate the infrastructure. There will be some consolidation for us in a number of these areas where we're going to be able to drop operating costs and control the future much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like on the natural gas point, maybe I was trying to feel better about &#x2013; the cost structure has come down enough and you're going to continue to build your property base. Is that &#x2013; obviously gas prices are low but there is an offsetting cost reduction that seems to have happened as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think on the cost side, we're probably as low as we're going to get. I don't think the suppliers and service companies can go much lower, so we feel confident where we are and we feel confident in our ability to execute. Really I'd just tell you that we believe that long run, and we think we have the balance sheet and the portfolio that we can look at the long run a little more than maybe we could five or six years ago, we believe gas prices will come back to reasonable levels. It might take two, three years before that happens. And when that does happen, we will have a very dominant position, a very dominant land position, a high quality land position that we're able to execute on. And so this is just a proactive step consolidating our infrastructure, land base, and everything that goes with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's terrific. And then just switching gears to Horizon, I think in the earnings release, you mentioned very good production costs numbers for March, including natural gas of 32.50. It sounds like in your absolute cash costs for the quarter, there must be some amount therefore that's not recurring. If I simply take your total cash costs and divide by the March production, you get to a number higher. How do you all gain confidence? So many of the other operators had so many ongoing issues. How do you gain confidence besides these being just newer assets that you can sustain those lower cash costs numbers that you allude to for the month of March in your press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we feel fairly confident. Obviously, we have limits to that confidence because there's always an issue that can happen at Horizon. It's a very complex plant. But when we ran in March and April and we ran at those levels for periods in November of last year and then June and July of last year as well, we know what our costs are. So it's really a matter of if our production volumes are there, our costs will be there, and we think we can actually over time drive them even lower. That is mainly because we're a newer plant. We're more heat integrated than any of the other plants and we have new equipment. And that's why we're seeing capital costs that are lower as well. We're trying &#x2013; we'll probably on the sustaining side that will increase as we have to buy more trucks and shovels as they layer out, but right now it's very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of driving them lower, is that just more volumes de-bottlenecking and so forth, or can the absolute cash costs actually come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think probably both. And maybe I'll get Peter to talk about it a little bit, but obviously if we can get better on planned maintenance, our costs on maintenance are actually lower to do the same work if we can see it coming ahead of time. Do you want to talk a little bit about the difference between planned and unplanned, Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, thanks. The planned activities allow us to prepare materials and people, and therefore we only need to man up the number of people required for a planned activity; whereas unplanned activity does create a bit of chaos in that you tend to drive manpower numbers up. You tend to expedite materials, and that does drive the cost in some cases more than double of what would otherwise be expected on a planned basis.</p>
          <p>And the other one point I would want to make is as we bring a unit down, because we are tightly heat integrated, it actually costs us more energy to continue or sustain the operation with a partial plant outage. And so there are in fact a double hit. You can think of it as a double-whammy when we do come down.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Steve, just following up on the &#x2013; it looks like on the natural gas acquisitions, it was about $750 million. You mentioned that you spent about $75 million incrementally on those assets that you acquired. Is that something you expect to get a return on at today's gas price, or is that just purely investment to hold the acreage? You're spending a lot of money here two to three years ahead of when you think natural gas prices might recover. Have you lowered the bar on what is the breakeven gas price you need to get a return?</p>
          <p>And I guess also, is any of this in anticipation of the royalty change in Alberta beginning next year and trying to get ahead of the pack here and picking up what might be more economic properties looking forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. I think maybe I wasn't as clear as I should have been. That $75 million incremental capital spending on the drilling program is really on our existing assets. So basically after the first quarter, we had a drilling program to conserve land and some strategic wells. The results from that program are much better than expected, and so some land that we were thinking maybe we'll let expire has more value, and we are going to drill that land to preserve it. I would say that in most cases, almost all those cases, all those things are projects that give us a return at $5 gas price. Now all things being equal, we wouldn't drill those wells if it wasn't expiring because our oil properties generate even a higher return, so it just wouldn't get the capital allocation. So everything we do that generates on the gas side gets us a return at $5 gas. Now we're not $5 gas today, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just the thought behind making such a huge investment two to three years ahead of when you think gas might get back above five where you can get a return, why not wait? Or is this just stuff that you think might go up in price as the rest of the industry anticipates people jumping in here? And again, how much of this is perhaps associated with the royalty change that will be coming in Alberta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say on acquisitions, it's the same as expiring land. They only go by once. So when gas prices return, these acquisitions won't be there. Somebody else will have bought them. So we'll have another player in our core area that we have to compete with, and the land will expire. Then if you want to buy it back, you have to buy it back probably at higher price. Part of it, the drilling program, I'd say a small part, maybe 20% lift in the drilling activity is due to royalty changes in Alberta. They are positive and that was reflected in our program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess just finally here, having spent $1 billion in the first quarter, how much more do you think, with the excess cash that you've got here, how much more do you think you might be able to allocate to similar type acquisitions versus share buybacks and others? Specifically how much more do you think you might be able to spend on acquisitions here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a hard call to make, Bob. I think our view is, and we've said this all along, is that with our price outlook, we thought our abilities to buy properties would be fairly low. I can say this. There is a tremendous amount of properties that have been put on the street, and we've looked at a lot of them. And most of them we don't bid on, or if we do bid we're not even in the running. So we always look if it's in a core area, and so there could be more but it's pretty hard to predict. All I would say is it would have to meet all our criteria and our hurdle rates, and it has to be opportunistic and strategic.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got about &#x2013; just under I'd say 28,000 BOEs a day of production, and about a quarter of that is oil.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. You mentioned strong well performance at Ninian in the release. The last public data I was able to see you show in January, I think it was running around 17,000 barrels a day. I'm just wondering if that has gone up at all from there and if you guys see that field remaining flat through the 2012 timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ninian obviously is a large pool. It's under waterflood and very high water cuts. It's on a decline. We had a strong performance mainly because the uptime was much better than we anticipated in the first quarter, so it had a good reliability. Ninian will on its own decline probably at about 15% per year unless we do activities to optimize the waterflood and drill into wells and do some well interventions, and obviously we're going to do some of that here in the second half of 2010. So I think we'll be able to hold production if you take out the turnarounds that we're going to have here in the summer at Ninian Central and Ninian South. So that will hit production in the second and third quarter.</p>
          <p>But overall, the actual production capability I think we'll be able to maintain for 2010. In 2011, depending on how much capital we spend, it can either stay flat or it will decline. I don't see much growth though in production volumes at Ninian.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And then last one for me just on Olowi, good news on the first three wells here on Platform B; just wondering if you have a sense after those wells now what that field might peak at for you guys and when you would see that occurring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think earlier when we talked, Mark, one other time I thought we might make 12,000 barrels a day as a peak. We've actually been above that here with these wells coming on, but that's flush production. So I still think that a peak sustained rate might be around 12 to 15,000 barrels a day versus 20,000 barrel/day, which we thought when we first started this project. So Platform C definitely has hurt us on volumes and reserves.</p>
