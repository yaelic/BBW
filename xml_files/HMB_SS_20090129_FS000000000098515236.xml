          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hennes &amp; Mauritz Full Year Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you all, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand over to Mr. Nils Vinge, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for calling in and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's full year results. The slides used during the presentation are found on our website, hm.com. With me today is our new CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, and Kristina Stenvinkel our Head of Communications and we will answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the fourth quarter, I'd like to make a brief comment on the start of our new business year. The continued downturn of the economies has influenced sales of December and January. The developed should be viewed in the light of a strong first quarter in 2008. In December, sales including VAT increased 2% in local currencies while comparable unit sales decreased 7%. Sales in local currencies in January are estimated to have increased 8%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the Slide, Fourth Quarter 2008. In the fourth quarter, sales excluding VAT increased by 15% to 26.3 billion. The increase in local currencies was 8%, while comparable unit sales decreased 3%.</p>
          <p>Profitability remained high with a gross margin of 62.4% compared to 62.1% in the same period last year. The gross margin was the highest ever in a fourth quarter, as U.S. dollar exchange rates and lower price reductions had a positive impact on the margin.</p>
          <p>The operating profit was 6.8 billion corresponding to an operating margin of 25.9%. Profit after financial items increased by 14% to 7.1 billion and the net profit was almost 5.1 billion corresponding to an earnings per share of SEK 6.15 for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Thanks to successful collections and active pricing we succeeded to increase our market shares. This was accomplished in an environment where retail sales were hampered by the global business climate.</p>
          <p>Our long-term initiative to strengthen the organization in support of our continued strong expansion with high profitability has initially led to slightly higher level of expenses. We entered the quarter with a low level of stock-in-trade of good quality. The new, more flexible logistics strategy has enabled an even more efficient usage of the stocking trade than before. The stock-in-trade at the end of the quarter was satisfactory.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we opened 129 stores and closed nine. The expansion of the store chain went hand-in-hand with the continued development of the online catalog sales and other new initiatives.</p>
          <p>Despite the global economic slowdown, the year of 2008 was yet another strong year for H&amp;M. Sales excluding VAT rose to 88.5 billion or 13% above last year's level. In local currencies the increase was 11%.</p>
          <p>Comp store sales decreased 1%, although on very tough comparables as like-for-like sales increased 5% in 2007. Gross profit was 54.5 billion and the gross margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 61.5%. Without the Group's hedging of the internal flows of goods of the subsidiaries, the currency translation effects would have been 400 million higher of which the major part arose in the fourth quarter. An intense activity level with new regions, new markets and new customer offerings has resulted in a slight increase of expenses.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was 20.1 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of 22.7%. The profit after financial items was 21.2 billion and the net profit was 15.3 billion corresponding to earnings per share of 18.48.</p>
          <p>The net addition of stores was 196. On top of this, 20 stores were added through acquisition, and in the end of the year the total store count was 1,738.</p>
          <p>The foundation of our success and strong profitability are appreciated collections, our deep knowledge and understanding of the fashion industry and our striving for constant improvement. During 2008, we expanded to new markets; the greatest happening was the successful entry into Japan, which is further evidence that our business concept is global.</p>
          <p>Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Oman saw their first H&amp;M stores, which were opened on a franchising basis. We continued to further develop new initiatives like COS, FaBric Scandinavien and H&amp;M Home. Online sales in Germany and Austria were supplemented with catalog sales which were very well received.</p>
          <p>We continued to open new stores and a level of refurbishments remained on a high level and when we refurbish stores, we raise the standard of them. Attractive stores create an inspiring environment for our customers, further strengthening H&amp;M's competitiveness.</p>
          <p>We continued to enhance the efficiency of our revenue session. We opened a new logistics centre at Hamburg that serves the stores in Germany, The Netherlands and Austria. Eastern Europe, Finland plus the online and catalog sales outside the Nordic countries are supplied out of Poznan in Poland. Again there is still further potential to streamline the logistics in the years to come enabling us to keep growing efficiently in our many markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at sales per market, we have continued to gain market shares in a challenging business climate. Germany is still our largest market with sales that exceeded 25 billion last year. The retail market has been difficult and we have seen competitors going out of business. H&amp;M has done well in light of this. The net store increase was 20 and expansion will continue this year. Sales development of online and catalog sales has been very promising in Germany as well as in Austria. France is our second largest market by now and is one of the countries in which we opened most stores. We opened 16 new stores last year; in 2009 we will continue to grow.</p>
          <p>Sales in Sweden, Norway and Denmark have been slower but on tough comparables. The U.K. has developed better than expected and we continue to grow. The picture is mixed in Southern Europe, where Portugal is doing very well, where our sales growth in Spain and Italy has slowed down, although from a very high level.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's expansion continued in the U.S. where 24 H&amp;M stores were opened. We continue to strengthen our presence on the West Coast for instance by opening a number of stores in Seattle and in San Diego. In the Middle East there were 18 H&amp;M stores in seven countries at the end of the year. 15 new franchise stores are planned to open next year and Lebanon will be a new franchise market.</p>
          <p>Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been very good. This year we will open our first stores in Beijing. The entry into Japan has been a huge success. The Tokyo openings were H&amp;M's most successful openings ever with record sales during the first two months.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at some key figures. The stock-in-trade increased 7% to 8.5 million, a level which we are satisfied with. The stock-in-trade in relation to sales was 9.6%, historically low level. This is a consequence of the investments in logistics which along with other things such as active pricing have led to a more efficient allocation of goods.</p>
          <p>Cash from current operations increased to almost 18 billion. Investments increased to almost 5.2 billion following a record high number of new stores and refurbishments, establishments of new market in new markets, the development on new initiatives as well as the new head office and the new district facility.</p>
          <p>Liquid funds and short-term investments increased to almost 23 billion from 21 billion a year ago. The Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of SEK 15.50, an increase of 11%. The return on equity was 44.3%.</p>
          <p>It goes without saying that H&amp;M has been affected by the global business cycle, but H&amp;M stands robust with a very strong financial position. We are prepared to seize opportunities that derive and to invest in future growth.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will continue to attract customers in new as well as in old markets and to good offerings, new collections, new concepts, and new products. In March, we will open our first two stores in Moscow. In January, we signed another contract in the Russian capital and our first contract for St. Petersburg scheduled to open in 2010.</p>
          <p>In May, we bring H&amp;M to Beijing, the rapidly growing region with a population of some 17 million. We plan to open more stores there during the year. Together with our franchisees, the first store in Lebanon will open during the year and in Israel in 2010.</p>
          <p>As much as we expand to new countries, we continue to develop our customer offerings. H&amp;M Home, fashion for your home, will be launched at the end of February. H&amp;M Home is a broad and varied assortment with textiles for the living room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen.</p>
          <p>Initially it will be available online and via catalog in the countries where we have online and catalog sales. This brings designer collaborations, as with the world renowned designer Matthew Williamson together with whom we designed a colorful collection with a high level of fashion.</p>
          <p>Expansion of cost continues. We plan to open eight more stores this year including a store in Paris and continue to aim for growth in the number of stores of 10 to 15% with maintained high profitability.</p>
          <p>In 2009 this corresponds to a plan net addition of 225 new stores. The expansion will mainly be focused on the U.S.A., France, Italy, Spain, The U.K. and Germany. We also plan to increase sales in our existing stores. Thank you for your attention and we're now happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Robert Miller. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Redburn Partners in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you give us a bit more detail on how the hedging situation worked in period? Because I know from the &#x2013; your comment about the P&amp;L, that the effect would have been SEK 400 million if you hadn't had the internal flows working against you. Was that on top of the 287? Or are we talking about a different number? I mean which parts of the P&amp;L would that have appeared?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's on top of the 287 million in translation effects, would have been 400 higher, that's with the gross profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean which quarters would that have appeared?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mainly in the fourth quarter when the Swedish krona weakening happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. So does that help to explain why, even though you had the dollar and markdown working in your favor, that the Q4 gross margin was only up 30 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So could you tell me that this &#x2013; what your view is on markup then, at the moment? Are you investing in any reduction in markup because of the nature of the retail environment? Or is your average selling prices and ticket prices flat on a like-for-like basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We prefer not to go into our pricing strategy and if we are doing markups due to the retail environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In which case, can I just ask one more? With regards to your stock, your stock number looked very tight at the end of the year especially given the year-on-year currency shift at your balance sheet date. Do you think that had an impact on your like-for-like performance in December? Because when I compare you to other value retailers, or fashion value retailers, whether it would be Primark or whoever, your December performance actually was quite a bit worse than some of those competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No we don't think that it's affecting like-for-like figures. We have historically also been on even lower levels in 2002 and 2004 and produced like-for-like figures around 3%. So that's definitely not the reason. We are happy with the level of this stock-in-trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure you are, yes. But you're happy with the like-for-like performance in December, because it did look like a relatively poor performance against the key sort of industry competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course it could always be better. But given the fact many of our competitors, or more extensive competitors have sold off heavily, we're satisfied with our sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Fh&#xE4;rm. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is &#x2013; SEB Enskilda in Stockholm. I'd just like to go back to &#x2013; we discussed this morning in Stockholm the question of the actual breakdown of the gross margin changes. And sorry for taking this up again, but could you please just for the record state what you like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we have said, the gross margin of 62.4% in the fourth quarter, it has been affected positively from the U.S. dollar and also through less price reductions compared to last year's quarter four and also, as mentioned earlier here, the effects from the currency hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said this morning that you thought that the impact from markdowns was worth about 70 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's &#x2013; yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So how do I interpret that? Does that mean that you had a positive impact on the change in gross margin worth 70 basis points year-on-year from not having to reduce your prices as much as you did last year? Is that a correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a correct interpretation, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. And then on the dollar would you care to put a estimated number on the same change year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer not to comment and put a figure on the U.S. dollar effect. And the reason is, of course, that we don't want to comment that for competition reasons, how we treat the effects from the U.S. dollar in the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions if I may.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One at a time, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. I mean, firstly, just looking through the sales trends by geography in the fourth quarter. It looks as though Scandinavia and Czech Republic looked particularly weak and Poland looked particularly strong. Could you give us just a bit of commentary on the particular sales drive or your pressures you were experiencing in these three markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Start with the Czech.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Czech market, yes, it has been a tough market for a while for several reasons. One reason is some local things that the government decided in the Czech during 2008. For instance, rent levels were increased for a lot of people from old regime levels to market levels. And that, of course, affect a lot of consumers on the Czech market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other market you asked about was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Scandinavia and Poland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Scandinavia has been, for many years, a very strong retail environment, and are now &#x2013; and in this environment, of course it's a lot tougher for all of us and we suffer on this as well. And last one was Poland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Poland, there has been, for several years, a strong retail development in that country. And, of course, that is connected to the increase in purchasing power it's too, big figures for the last three, four, five years. So, of course, the purchasing power is going up on the Polish market, or has done it for the last four, five years. So the retail environment has been really, really strong in Poland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic. And second question is just on the currency gain you had in the final quarter. Could you just give us the currency component within your fourth quarter cost growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost growth in local currencies in Q4 was 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, 10% if you mean the S&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Okay. And finally, just given the slightly slower December sales performance, is this likely to adversely impact the gross margin as well as through first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say it again, please? I didn't really understand the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just given the slightly weaker December sales performance, how should we think about the impact on the gross margin in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer not to comment on trading gross margins, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions, if I may. I just wanted to ask you about your CapEx, because obviously in recent years, for understandable reasons, CapEx has risen as a percentage of sales. I just wondered if you could give a sense of how much of the CapEx related to new initiatives or new markets and launch of home textiles and so on? And what is likely to be the sort of run-rate of CapEx going forward as a percentage of sales, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to CapEx, we prefer not to speak it up in what is new initiatives, what is existing store, what is store expansion, et cetera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you think that &#x2013; obviously, CapEx has seen a step up. I mean are you expecting that same level of CapEx to be sustained for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The CapEx for 2009 will most probably be around five, SEK 6 billion. And that's of course according to our plans, when we are highering our standard in our stores to increase the attractiveness in our stores, the customer experience. And according it that way to strengthen H&amp;M's competitiveness in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you. And just second question. I just wanted to ask you, I know you don't like to give too much detail away on your own pricing, but how are you seeing the sort of industry pricing environment at the moment? I mean, are you finding you're having to &#x2013; or you are sort of raising prices more than the rest of the industry? Or is the whole industry moving entry point prices up in anticipation of higher dollar purchase prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's very &#x2013; a lot of focus on pricing more than ever in quite challenging environment, as you know. But for in our case, the &#x2013; on comparable items, we've had flat prices in Q4. Going forward, of course, I cannot give you the details for competitive reasons.</p>

          <p>Hello, Sanford Bernstein from London. Question if I may on the gross margin outlook that you see going into 2009, quite a number of moving parts, the ForEx adverse effect. But, potentially, are you finding that Chinese manufactures and Asian manufactures would be more amenable considering the declining volumes, exports to the U.S. for example. Are you taking advantage of any particular weakening in currency, for example in Turkey, and moving your geographic sourcing mix to different countries? And what do you see as the different impacts into the gross margin trends for &#x2013; especially for the second part of the year, if I may ask?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it was a long question. But I can say to all your questions, yes, of course we look at all these factors. And in this challenging environment there are also a lot of opportunities. Of course we are on our toes to make the best on them. But exactly how it's going to affect our gross margin is, of course, impossible to say. And again, it's the price to the consumers that really drives the gross margin. It's not the other way around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may ask a second question on the inventory? You're confirming that inventory levels and the quality of the inventory getting into the first quarter is actually better. So that &#x2013; basically this implies that there would be lower end of season, end of fall/winter season sales volumes in the first quarter of '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct that the stock-in-trade level that &#x2013; we are satisfied with that of course. And, as already said, we are through the logistics decisions we have done, made a situation to where we can use the lower stock-in-trade. But when it comes to give you a forecast for Q1, where we are heading with the price reductions, we don't comment on the current month. And also that is, of course, dependent on what is happening on the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I understand that. But I would expect that at the end of November the stock-in-trade would include both fall/winter and spring/summer products. So it's a mix between the fall/winter and the spring/summer products, also better in comparison to the previous year?</p>

          <p>Okay and thank you. We are happy with the development. And this is something we've tried in some different places, some countries, I think London is one place. But our experience so far is the divided works best when it is together with the other concepts of the group.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering &#x2013; hi there. It was my impression at the press conference earlier today that you were still targeting books for like-for-likes for the year. And Mr. Eriksen indicated that that would be volume driven rather than through pricing. So that, I assume, indicates that you're looking for a flat pricing for the current year? And following on from that, is that a strategy you will follow in countries that have had negative currency impact, i.e. markets like the U.K.? Is that your pricing strategy there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a long question and there was lot of interpretations in the questions. So regarding our target for 2009, it's true that we aim for a positive like-for- like. And whether that would be price or volume-driven, we didn't really tell you, but that was your interpretation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean Mr. Eriksen said quite clearly that he was going to positive volume growth, didn't he?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my question is, specifically, if the like-for-like run-rate in the new financial year continued at this level, would you be prepared to cut back on your level of investment in order to protect your cost of sales ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've already in Q3 mentioned that, on like-for-like stores for instance, the S&amp;A, OpEx expenses, we have full control. They actually decreased the last quarter. And when it comes to expansion, new initiatives, we are going according to our plans during 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we would therefore expect further deterioration in cost of sales this year on the current level of like-for-like sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's hard to say. But in general on total level when it comes to S&amp;A expenses, as also Rolf mentioned during the press conference in the morning, there might be a slight higher level than the historical 37 to 38. But we don't see any dramatical things in that because we are investing for the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just secondly then, you mentioned Q3, and looking at my notes for what was said at Q3, you said historically H&amp;M is not much impacted by the economic cycle. And that view seems to have changed. Is that because your view of the cycle has changed? Or because your view of the business' potential performance in the cycle has changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's clear that we said we haven't been as struck by economic macro effect as many other competitors and &#x2013; but, of course, we are affected. And I would say at this time, we are a bigger company. We have the greater market share. So for that reason others are more affected. But we also see a lot of opportunities. And I think I mean if you look at the result from Q4, many other retailers would be happy to have.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi. This is SEB Enskilda in Stockholm again. I just wanted to follow up and ask you on the store expansion plan for fiscal 2009, whether you can just outline an approximate distribution between the quarters actually? I believe last year was &#x2013; it was slightly more skewed towards the second half. And I was just wondering if you could just outline the sort of seasonal patterns within store growth for fiscal '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I understand your question but we prefer not to give you that exact guidance as it's very difficult for us to know exactly what quarter they will look.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But &#x2013; okay. So even if you don't want to break it up into quarters, would it be a fair assumption to say that we will see a similar pattern as last year in terms of half year expansion plans, i.e. slightly less new stores in the first half and slightly more in the second half? Or will this turn around?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If we are really on the approximation level, let's say, that first half year will be a little less than the second half year, it maybe &#x2013; might be around 40, 60 or something like that.</p>

Are you basically saying that  the gross margin would have been 40 basis points higher for this past year and by the sounds of it at least 100 basis points higher for Q4 had it not been for the hedging policy?

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, it's Andrew Hughes, UBS in London.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have a question on just clarifying the hedging policy across the group. The hedges that you mentioned in the statement, the internal flow of goods, is that separate from hedging dollar purchases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's a different hedging from the purchases. But, in fashion retail we have risks relating to, yes, let's say weather and fashion et cetera. And those are really difficult to hedge away. But according to our group finance policy we are hedging all those, both externals and internal current signals relating to our garments and that is what we have done. And in this situation when most of the currencies used in our selling countries has been much &#x2013; been strengthening during the Q4 &#x2013; the effect of course will be this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering why you don't internally just hedge profit flows and you are actually hedging the flow of goods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it's more or less the same thing that we are putting them on the order, when we are placing the order.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's according to the OECD transfer pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh right, okay. Okay. And just a couple of other things, one was just on the dollar. When will the dollar stop being a benefit for you, which quarter might we expect that? And well I'll let you answer that one first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please rephrase the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was when will the dollar stop being a benefit for your gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It already starts to fade away of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's in the current quarter, it will start to fade away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and finally just a question on your interest receivable. Should we expect that to fall dramatically in the current year given lower deposit rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course some, of course the interest rates will be of course affected, by how much that's impossible to say today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, yes. It's JPMorgan again in London. I just have a couple of follow-ups actually, in the statement that you mentioned you think you can get more efficiencies out of your logistics centers in Poland and Hamburg and I just wondered if you could elaborate on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, we've been talking a lot about this before. It's in its start-up period of course in a new, it will take some time before up and running at the efficiency we plan to. And of course in Germany we've been having double costs leaving the own DC quarters and going into the new ones, so of course there are lot of potential for efficiency gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's mainly about sort of increased utilization and stable benefits basically coming through. Okay, I, and also I just wondered if you could talk about if the like-for-like sales continue on this sort of weaker trend, how you're planning to sort of flex your cost base going forward this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is very simple. We have a tight cost control and very strong consciousness culture in the company. I think Q4 is good proof of that. And as Jyrki has said in comparable stores we actually reduced the costs in the quarter. So I don't see any reason for that to change going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Exane in London. Just one quick question on gross margin, I apologize for bringing it back to it. The Q4 gross margin was up 30 basis points, you said that you had few markdowns which contributed to 70 basis points, you had a positive impact from the dollar. I'm just wondering where the negative comes in. Could you explain that for me, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we explained it. That it's the negative effect from this currency hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought that was a positive you didn't get as opposed to a negative. Sorry I misinterpreted that. So, it is the euro negative rather than anything else, yes?</p>

          <p>Hi, it's ABG Sundal Collier here. I know you had one hundred questions about the gross margin, but if you just for the hedging of 400 million you had a gross margin that comes to 64% I assume and then you had some positive gains I mean with the dollar and a benefit, but looking at the gross margin you're giving us it's quite at a very strong level despite the current situation you have with negative like-for-like and so on. And going forward I don't &#x2013; I assume that of course you can't predict how markdown activities will be in the market but you have some competitors out there now saying that the gross margin could be kept fairly stable if they are not calculating with extraordinary markdown activities as this whole situation is easing by imagination so on, transportation cost down 70%. And why should we be so concerned about the gross margin, are you concerned or do you think that underlying gross margin except for markdown activities that it can predict, can be quite stable at '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
