          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Las Vegas Sands Corp. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Maria and I will be your audio coordinator for today.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and we will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  At this time I would now turn the call presentation over to Mr. Bill Weidner, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maria and good afternoon, everyone and thank you all for joining us today.  On the call with me are Mr. Sheldon Adelson, Chairman; Brad Stone, Executive Vice-President; Rob Goldstein, President of Venetian Las Vegas and The Palazzo; Scott Henry, Senior Vice President, Bob Rozek, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Briggs, our VP of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin I need to remind you that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws.  I would also like to caution you that the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements.  Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP measures.  The definition and reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release.  Please note that this presentation today is being recorded.</p>
          <p>By now you all should have received our press release detailing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2007.  We again put quite a bit of detail into our release today, so we will keep our prepared remarks top line, beginning with some highlights for the quarter,  a discussion of the Macau market factors as we see them and then moving on to a few</p>
          <p>concluding thoughts and then we'll move on to your questions.</p>
          <p>In Las Vegas The Venetian continued its solid performance throughout the property.  Fourth quarter gaming volumes were up in both the non-baccarat table drop and slot handle.  Our hotel ADR RevPAR statistics were also strong during the quarter, with both ADR and RevPAR reaching record levels for the fourth quarter.  Our entertainment offerings continue to mature, our upgrading and re-merchandising of the property have been increasingly successful and we carried much momentum into the soft opening of The Palazzo on December 30th.</p>
          <p>With The Palazzo now open, we are extending our successful convention-based business model to a far larger 7,100 room asset base and an 18 million square foot integrated resort complex, which is the largest destination resort in the world, a resort featuring dozens of fine dining destinations, world class entertainment options and luxurious shopping at both The Grand Canal Shoppes and The Shoppes at The Palazzo featuring Barneys of New York. We're enthused about that platform for growth, which also captures the efficiencies manifested in our master plan here in Las Vegas going forward.</p>
          <p>And now turning to The Sands Macau, we remain pleased with the performance of our Macau peninsula property.  Our VIP gaming volumes remain strong, while our mass gaming volumes continue to reflect, as expected, the increased competition from the new entrants to the market place on the peninsula, as well as the competition created by our own Venetian Macau on the Cotai Strip.</p>
          <p>Our mass drop came in at approximately 775 million.  It is important to recognize that that level of drop still represents the largest portion of the current mass market of any single property in Macau, with the exception of The Venetian Macau itself, including all of the new <mark type="inaudible" />Macau peninsula properties.  The Sands new 238-suite hotel</p>
          <p>tower aimed squarely at the high end of the mass market has helped the Sands to remain the leader in mass-market play on the Macau peninsula.  We remain confident that the expanded Sands' product offering with more amenities like our 25th floor club and club gambling tables will be a formidable competitor in the Macau peninsula for years to come.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to observations to the Venetian Macau and with the steady, consistent execution of our vision to lead the transformation of Macau to the destination of Asia.  The big picture, everything is working.  Any concern that the elements that make Las Vegas so successful as an international resort destination somehow wouldn't work in Macau have been resoundingly dispelled.  First, visitation, nearly 9 million visitors have experienced the Venetian Macau since it opened approximately five months ago, including more than 70% of all visitors to Macau in the quarter ended December 31.</p>
          <p>Second, hotel performance, our strong early hotel operating performance continued to ramp up throughout the fourth quarter, with ADR reaching $224 for the quarter, occupancy reaching 88.1% in the quarter and RevPAR reaching $198.  Third, entertainment, we've had a tremendous reception for our entertainment offerings from throughout the region, including the sell-out NBA China games, Black Eyed Peas and Beyonce.  On Thursday of this week we expect a sold-out performance once again for The Police featuring Sting, who will make their first ever performance in Macau at The Venetian Macau arena.  Upcoming acts include events like Celine Dion and Team</p>
          <p>USA Olympic basketball.</p>
          <p>Fourth, group meetings and convention business.  After an outstanding start this business continues to gain positive momentum with significant multinational groups, including HP, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Coca-Cola, Shell and Bank of China hosting multiple follow-on groups meeting in our first five months.  Recently a convention exhibitions magazine, <mark type="inaudible" />, named The Venetian Macau, as voted by its subscribers, the best MICE [Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions] hotel in Asia.</p>
          <p>We now have more than 30 trade shows on the books for 2008, including for the first time some important shows sponsored by China's China Center for the Promotion of International trade, CCPIT, who control a substantial majority of the trade show business held in the exhibition centers throughout mainland China, some 2,800 trade fairs.</p>
          <p>Fifth, solid retail sales figures at The Grand Canal Shoppes, with 270 stores and more than a half million square feet of retail space now open and more on the way, retail sales have been strong and continue to grow.  According to a recent CLSA survey of 1,200 Macau visitors, some 82% indicated an intention to shop on their visit, a far cry from the gambling-only Macau of yesteryear.</p>
          <p>Six, gaming volumes, both our VIP and mass gaming volumes have been healthy, reflecting the acceptance and appeal of our product in the marketplace.  Solid and building performance in all six of these areas reflects the transformation of the market itself is coming on strong and the catalyst for that transformation, the Venetian Macau, is paving the way</p>
          <p>Those six indicators of Venetian Macau's success are clear, but let's take a quick look at some of the external market indicators that confirm that transformation.  According to the Macau Census and Statistics Service, the average stay per visitor increased to 1.6 nights in October of 2007, up 33% from the 1.2 nights per visitor in January of 2007.  That's a very telling statistics.  Also according to that same Macau statistics services, while visitation growth in the market for the year-end December 31 was a very respectable 22.8% increase, visitation growth from the relatively wealthier countries on a per capital basis was up much more dramatically than visitation from Japan, Korea, North America, The European Union, all growing more than 35% a year and visitation from Southeast Asia up 81.2 in December alone.</p>
          <p>It's abundantly clear that visitors to Macau are increasingly coming from further away, staying longer, bringing more money with them and spending more of that money on non-gaming activities and Macau has barely scratched the surface of this huge marketplace.  But as dramatic as this transformation is, we're clearly in the very early stages.  We are quite literally just getting started.  So what's next?</p>
          <p>First, continue investments in Macau and the region's transportation structure, more frequent Cotai jet ferry service from Hong Kong Harbour to the Pac-On temporary ferry terminal on Taipa at the foot of the Cotai Strip, followed by direct service from Hong Kong International Airport directly to Pac-On.  These services will enable increases in visitation to Macau and to Cotai Strip and a more satisfying customer experience for the visitors to the Strip.  In addition to ferry services, additional buses and planes will be placed in service to bring new first-time visitors to Macau.    These will also serve to drive visitation, increase customer satisfaction, as well as elevate the status of Macau as a leisure and business destination.</p>
          <p>Since 2004, Macau Airport has introduced Malaysia's Air Asia, Singaporean Tiger airlines, Philippine Cebu Pacific Air and in the past week alone Jetstar Asia, AirAsia and AirMacau have announced new routes serving Thailand, Bangkok, Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur and five cities of Japan, including more direct flights from Tokyo, where they are now running two 767s at capacity.</p>
          <p>Second, additional marketing and entertainment activities.  Our marketing and entertainment activity, sports such as soccer, basketball, tennis, boxing and martial arts, the world-class entertainment attractions like Beyonce and The Police will continue to put Macau on the map as the destination for leisure and travel in Asia.  These high profile events are just the beginning of a series of activities, including the opening of Cirque du Soleil's <mark type="inaudible" />, a custom-built theater at The Venetian Macau this summer, the appearances by Team USA, America's 2008 Dream Team, as they make their final preparations at the arena at The Venetian Macau for their competition at the 2008 Olympic basketball tournament. These kind of events will cement the position of Venetian Macau as Asia's first Las Vegas-style multi-night stay destination resort.</p>
          <p>Third, the steady expansion of additional dining and retail attractions included in The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Four Seasons Macau.  We now have 250 of a total of 330 stores open at The Grand Canal Shoppes, representing over half a million square feet of retail shopping area.  We expect additional retailers to open stores at a steady pace as we move toward the launch of 98 additional shops in the 211,000 square foot shops at the Four Seasons Macau, which will feature prestigious fashion luxury brands, including <mark type="inaudible" />, Armani, Cartier, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermes, and others.  The shops at the Four Seasons will directly connect to the shops at The Venetian Macau and will debut summer of '08.</p>
          <p>Fourth, the opening of the Four Seasons Macau.  The Four Seasons Macau with its iconic global brand will be the second destination on the Cotai Strip and will add its worldwide cachet and extensive global marketing network to the Cotai Strip this summer.  As additional world class destination resorts are completed in the Cotai Strip with the amenities to increase multi-night visitation, a larger percent of the Macau gaming and non-gaming market will be earned by the true destination resorts on the Cotai Strip, just as destination Las Vegas Strip properties have over time earned the lion's share of the gaming and non-gaming revenues and profit of the Las Vegas market.  As this increasing critical mass of destination product attracts more air service, ferry, rail and bus infrastructure, the Cotai Strip will become Asia's Las Vegas.</p>
          <p>So to the six factors we can now measure, visitation, hotel performance, entertainment, group meetings, retail sales and gaming volume, and the four important things we see coming that will drive the transformation of Macau and contribute to ongoing growth in the marketplace, all of these bode well for the validation of the success of the vision for the future of Macau as the destination of Asia.</p>
          <p>One final point, in December we were able to generate more than 60 million of adjusted property EBITDAR at The Venetian Macau and while a portion of that result was driven by a favorable hold, we clearly don't have the full level of EBITDA generating power from our hotel rooms, retail and entertainment offering.  Each of these continue to build and we are clearly feeling good about the trajectory that we are on.</p>
          <p>So that includes the highlights.  We continue to steadily execute across the board and lead the transformation of the largest gaming market in the world into the greatest business and leisure destination in Asia.  It's truly an exciting time for our company and is therefore an ideal time for us to present a more detailed look at our operating plans and strategies than on these regular quarterly conference calls. We look forward to presenting these more detailed plans at an investor conference next Monday the 11th of February beginning at 11:30 a.m. Pacific Time and hope that you will join us for that event either in person here in Las Vegas or by webcast, which will be accessible via the Internet from the Investor Relations sections of the Las Vegas Sands website.</p>
          <p>Before we go to Q&amp;A, let me throw out a few concluding thoughts.  First, in Las Vegas, The Venetian is performing well and the 3,068-suite Palazzo will be ramping up to full power as its full suite of amenities comes online through the quarter.  On the Macau peninsula, the Sands continues to be the resilient market leader in mass gaming volumes on the peninsula and as we re-position the Sands to continue to compete against the wave-upon-wave of competition on the peninsula, we will continue to work to capture additional operating efficiencies and focus on maximizing the Sands' market leading cash-on-cash return.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the Cotai Strip, we'll continue the process of learning more about how the various profit centers of The Venetian Macau, rooms, retail, entertainment, convention, trade show, VIP business, mass table games, slots, impact one another as we continue to grow our revenues, learn how better to control costs and maximize income as we complete additional infrastructure and product features, like the super luxury retail outlets at the Four Seasons and a purpose-built Cirque showroom to drive traffic to the resort and attract the multi-day visitor from further away through Macau's increasing international air connections.</p>
          <p>We will seek to convert book business, tour and travel bookings, convention business and contracted trade shows to operating profit as we ramp up occupancy, ADR and continue to grow our VIP mass casino volume, while all executing our construction plan to fully develop the potential of the Cotai Strip, Asia's Las Vegas destination.  As we complete our destination-integrated resort at the heart of downtown Singapore, we remain confident that the execution of these plans will lead to superior return for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that opening series of statements, we will now open the phones for our Q&amp;A, so that our management team can bring you up to date fully on the details of our presentation today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Lehman Brothers.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.  Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I have a few questions.  First one I guess is for Brad, just looking at the EBITDAR margins at The Venetian Macau, if you adjusted last quarter for hold, it looks like they were about flat and I'm just wondering how we should think about that going forward?  I know it's a big endeavor to kind of get costs in normalized &#x2013; at normalized levels there, but are we going to see this kind of flattish for the next few quarters or are you seeing things now that would indicate that that might ramp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think personally in looking at the margins we did hold about 2 points low what we had expected on the mass business at The Venetian and we expect to see that, those are the normal holds you traditionally see as a property opens and of course we held slightly below where we expected to hold.  We held 2.72 on the rolling program at The Venetian, so roughly a difference of about $32 million in EBITDA at a 60% margin after gaming tax.  I think it's important to recognize we're learning a lot at The Venetian Macau, as Bill indicated in his presentation.  I'm pleased to see, guess in one sense I am frustrated to see, but pleased to see a lot of opportunity for us to work on the margins as we figure out the various business segments, as we figure out exactly the staffing levels needed to efficiently operate that property.  So I think you're going to see a gradual ramping up once we adjust for revenues and hold percentages and the like, I think you're going to continue to see a more efficient sales of the room product, which will drive revenue, at the same times we're working very hard at our staffing levels, looking at what entertainment venues work and how to price ourselves.  I mean as Bill said, the good news on the entertainment side, it absolutely works, you'd fill the place.  Honestly, if we look back we missed some opportunities to maximize our revenue because we see more opportunity to sell tickets at a higher price for certain events.  So we're learning a lot each time we have an event, each time we enter a new market, as we get the ferries going, we just see lots of opportunity to take this operation as the pioneers we are right now and improve those operations and see those margins grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And anyone can take this next question.  I was wondering I know you don't give guidance, but if you can just give us some kind of update on what you have been seeing in January, particularly since there have been -- in Macau, since there have been news reports, which have reported revenues and market share numbers and I'm sure you've seen those and certainly these reports have indicated that you've lost some market share in January versus December.  So I was wondering if you could address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sheldon Adelson.  Actually <mark type="inaudible" /> is coming out with every two weeks market share.  I'm going to propose we have an organization come out with daily and then hourly market shares for the business and maybe it will be more meaningful.  I think we're getting to the point where the whole thing is ridiculous.  I mean these people that are coming out with minute-by-minute market shares and then make investment decisions on that are the kind of people I wouldn't want to handle my personal money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Having said that, can you give us any...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Having said that, we don't intend to.  January is part of the first quarter of '08, so when we book the quarter, we'll talk about January</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just a housekeeping question, I was just wondering if you could just tell me for the quarter the average square foot that was open in the mall and then your revenues per square foot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to report any January numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, for the quarter, for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felcia, we were at...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you the average <mark type="inaudible" /> -- the average number of stores or the number of stores ending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the quarter the square foot that was opened in the quarter and the revenues per square foot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's -- I can't answer that question.  It ramped up from zero to about 220 stores, so we have to figure a daily average of the number of stores in the square footage and we didn't think anybody would really want to know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I thought because I have -- I thought you gave the data for the last quarter, so, just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felicia, we did give the data for the last quarter.  Where we are at January, sorry, or today is about 500,000 square feet of space open.  For the first quarter, pardon me, for the fourth quarter we had an average of approximately on a weighted average basis in the neighborhood of 300,000 square feet opened for the entire quarter September 30 to December 31st.  And respect to talking about sales per square foot, we may very well be able to talk about sales per square foot sometime at the investor conference, but today we're not prepared to talk about that in any detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't done the arithmetic on it and we'll do the arithmetic and we can answer that question off-line, if you like</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly have the math on a week-to-week basis, on a store-to-store basis, but the key is going back and figuring out how many days of the week a store is open and then how many weeks of the quarter that it's open, so all that math needs to be put together and we'll have some of that stats next week in more detail</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we could give you the opening day, we could give you the closing day and we'll give you the ramp-up during the period, but we haven't done the calculations on the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I look forward to hearing that next week.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Larry Klatzkin with Jefferies.  Please proceed</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.  If you can do minute-by-minute that would even be better, then we could just &#x2013; that's all we can spend our time doing.  Question one, has the ferry gotten going?  How is that?  Congratulations getting the ruling in your favor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The ferries are up and operating.  We're offering about every half-hour service during the day now and my conversation end of day Monday with the fellows there in Macau, we now have qualified captains and crews to be able to do 24-hour sailing.  All we wait for now is the approval of the additional slips in Hong Kong, so hopefully in a relatively short period of time we'll have ourselves to the point we have enough equipment and the approvals for 24-hour sailing, so we can do night cruising.  It's ramping up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This week we just started back in business again about five or six business days ago and it's beginning to ramp up to the levels that we were before we had to close down.  We're very confident that that service is going to prove to be superior and the fact that you can go directly to The Strip and in minutes be at our door, I think it will do very, very well as we get into full-service operations, add more ferries.  Once we ramp up in the next three to five months with every 15-minute service I think we'll have an excellent generator of thousands of bodies to the Cotai Strip</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Well great.  And the other question I have is just the timing -- schedule of the all the protects and the budgets as you see them starting with the Four Seasons.  Brad, what are you looking for, for an opening date we should use in our models and what budget?  Maybe you can just talk about maybe the Shangri-La and the budget with Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The first project that's going to open is the Four Seasons.  We're scheduled after June of this year <mark type="inaudible" />.  It's in the summer, but we're looking to June time period.  The budget is roughly $1.1 billion.  That includes the Four Seasons itself, that includes the service department complex, the 39-story tower immediately adjacent.  That includes the Four Seasons Mall, that also includes our mansions at the Four Seasons, which is very high-end suite product, 19 gorgeous suites with their own infrastructure that supports a very premium end of the market.  Like I said, that will be the main project will be open in June, the private mansions are at the end of the year and the service departments are sometime in the first and second quarter of next year, but those sales opportunities are beginning now.  Parcels 5 and 6, that's known as the Shangri-La, St. Regis, Sheraton and Traders complex, that's roughly going to come in at about 6,600 total rooms, made up the mix of the various brands.  It's a huge building, just about 13.7 million square feet.  Right now I'm just going to give the construction costs, which include the actual construction, the what we call the built-in FF&amp;E, including guest room furnishing and designer's cost, it's roughly about $3.3 billion.  We're still working on the final FF&amp;E budget, the pre-opening budgets, so that'll probably add an area of about probably another 3 to $400 million in that project.  That is opening the first phase of it, which is the Sheraton tower and the Shangri-La Traders tower and almost the entire podium, that opens in May of '09 as we talked about on prior calls.  And then the St. Regis and Sheraton hotel towers are roughly in the fourth quarter of '09.  That's the time period for that.  Turning to parcel 7 and 8, we're waiting.  We have our piling rigs on the site.  We're waiting any day now to get our permit to commence piling.  The project does include the Swiss Hotel, Fairmont Raffles, Hilton, Conrad  complex.  This complex is about 6,200...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's again about 6,200 total rooms.  This is a larger building yet, about 13.9 million square feet. Again, similar statistic, the hard construction cost, which includes the designers, the non-owner FF&amp;E, meaning non-slot machines, etcetera, is about $3.7 million, roughly 266 bucks a foot and that we're looking to open at the end of 2010.  It's an aggressive schedule, but we think we can make that.  We have site consolidation, unlike that which we have at five and six...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The one phase opening that entire project and again we're just waiting for the permits and hopefully we will start piling this month.  The rigs are there, the contracts are let and we're ready to go.  Parcel 3 we're still in the title and design phase, although we hope to start piling in the second quarter and that is about a 4,000-room project with InterContinental, Holiday Inn and Cosmopolitan, which is part of the Far East consortium. About right now the current design is about 6.4 million square feet.  Hard construction costs and this is a broader estimate than the others, the other ones are closer to home because we have a much more -- we have pretty extensive design on the other projects.  Currently we're looking at again for just the construction, architecturals and non-owner FF&amp;E about $1.65 million and that we're looking to open up in the second quarter of '11 and again hope to start piling that this spring, so it's roughly the same timeframe as the <mark type="inaudible" />.  And then Singapore, the Singapore project, I was there last week.  It's an unbelievable project, it's going to be magnificent.  Saw a model room.  This project is 2,700 rooms.  We talk about the size of the building because you hear what the government allows us to build, that's roughly a 5.5 million square feet, 5.7 million square feet, but the actual building, including land that doesn't -- space that doesn't include in that calculation, the building is actually about 9.1 million square feet.  Currently we're looking at the hard construction costs of roughly $3.4 billion.  This facility is coming in at roughly $372 a square foot and it's a magnificent building.  I went through the whole process of constructing it.  It's going to be something else and that is slated for the end of '09 and we continue to hold it at schedule at this point in time.  We've said in prior meetings there's challenges in Singapore in terms of the construction work, getting materials and everything and some of the site conditions we encounter, but we're looking very positively towards this property and believe we're going to get a favorable ruling in the amount of units that we're able to put on this project.  We've met with the government and we'll probably talk about that next week at our investor conference.</p>

          <p>Next one is The Palazzo Condominium. That project, as you can see looking at The Palazzo is going up right now.  We're going to end up with about 1,035,000 net saleable square feet.  It's hard construction cost, just about, it's all in construction costs is just under $600 million and again that's looking for the completion in the fourth quarter of '09.  Lastly, Bethlehem, we start standing steel this month.  We've done extensive groundwork.  All the foundation systems are in.  We start putting the podium up this month and that's 304-room project with 5,000 slot machines initially and again our hope is that the Pennsylvania government &#x2013; I'm sorry, 3,000 starts, 5,000 fixed screens, Sheldon corrected me, 3,000 at opening and six months later we'll go to 5,000, but we're building the property to encompass the entire 5,000.  It has a couple hundred thousand square feet of retail space, an arena, total square footage on that is about 2.4 million and the hard construction price on that is about 552 and once you put all the licensing in and other issues it's probably more in a range of 800 to $825 million.  And that project will open up in the second quarter of '09 and the hotel tower will be about two months behind that.  So that's that question.</p>

          <p>Thanks.  I wonder if you could talk about anything changing at Venetian Macau in terms of commission rates?  I know you won't comment on January results, but can you talk about changes that may be implemented in February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  In February given the competitive nature of the commission situation there at Macau, we have now offered to our junket reps the program that is called the 60-20-20 program.  And that, the adjusted commission rates on the 60-20-20 program were higher than the commission rates that we are offering on a pure commission basis, as the expected whole percentage of 2.8%, I think it's approximately 1.22 is my recollection.  And so we have offered a bit more competitive junket structure.  The good news of that is the share of it in the downside if we don't reach our expected whole percentage, although they get more the upside if our whole percentage is above 2.85.  So yes, we have adjusted our commission structure and we have adjusted the offering to the marketplace in terms of the independent representatives</p>

          <p>Sure, can you talk about in terms of response to that in the marketplace and whether you expect others are going to have to move commission levels up now that you have moved to this kind of commission structure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think others already have.  I think we were the outlier on the low side during the month of January, so to convert to this it took us a while to convert to this kind of program and getting additional chips, etcetera, but we targeted February 1st and we are now in place with the new commission structure as of February 1.  We don't know exactly how that</p>
          <p>has manifested itself yet because these are the slowest days of the year as you approach Chinese New Year.  We would expect to have a much better idea during the Chinese New Year time and we're expecting a very robust business during that period of time beginning the 6th or 7th of February.</p>

          <p>We're not believers of selling properties and bringing in partners while the property is already half-done and then saying that it was a good thing to do.  If your property has got good promise and good potential, you ought to stick with it and not sell it off to get some money.  I think it's pretty cheap at 1,300 bucks, if they're going to do business,  they'll be able to sell it at several thousand a foot.</p>
          <p>If I can alone, talk about &#x2013; I just want to make one comment about our presentation and that is that &#x2013; my nose is stuffed, so I'm sounding.... That is, that there's good news here, I mean that's on a broad-brush basis.  The good news is that there is no more waves of competition on the peninsula coming up.  There are no more developments that we know of that are being planned, Stanley Ho isn't doing anymore developments in the foreseeable future and none of his sub-licensees are doing any more developments there, so the good news is that the market has grown from 2002 from 2.7 billion US dollars to 10.3 or 4, whichever number you believe or whichever number is accurate for 2007.  That's almost a four times multiple over a five-year period.  Now you're looking at the growth, I believe it was about 8 million in 2001 or so, give or take about the same year and this past year we ended up with 27 million visitors.  Now for those doubters who think that there is a prospective market in China both to grow in terms of gaming volume and to grow in terms of visitor volume, I think that the facts clearly belie and contradict the doomsdayer's proclamations.  The validation of the integrated resort concept on The Strip, it has been resoundingly proven that each of the elements, each of the six elements that Bill mentioned, are clearly on a one-by-one basis on a very, very strong ramp-up basis.  The issue of the convention center, we've got 100% repeat business coming out of the exhibitions and almost I think it's a 100% repeat business coming out of the groups, what we call in-house groups, that is conferences and meetings, sales meetings, dealer meetings, etcetera.</p>
          <p>The group market is validated resoundingly.  The hotel market is also validated resoundingly and we're, as I mentioned in the last call, we're figuring out which of the components, either the non-contracted FIT, let's call it FIT, the contracted tour and travel business, the casino rooms, etcetera, etcetera, we're figuring out which of those &#x2013; well not the casino, which of those cash generation rooms are best for us and we're adjusting the relationship with the tour operators, with the airlines, etcetera, etcetera.  And when Bill talked about the number of airlines coming in he didn't mention the number of cities, for instance, in Japan.  There are five cities.  I don't know all of them.  I know that Tokyo and Osaka are the big ones and there are a number of other cities, but it doesn't take large population cities to fill up a couple of planes a day.  So more and more cities are being serviced, as I predicted, that the lift will accommodate the demand and that's what's happening.  The entertainment and the arena is one thing, that's proven itself.  Getting 15,000 people to come to a show and pay a price in the arena is validated, clearly and unequivocally.  Getting &#x2013; and so we're looking to fine-tune, pick-up those touring shows and the right kind of entertainers as that goes on.  The room revenue, we think that eventually as we've fully ramped up and get all the pieces working together like the cogs in a wheel, we will ramp up to a figure that I believe will match or exceed that which we've gotten over the last couple of years here in Las Vegas.  So those -- on a broad-brush basis, those are two very good signs for the future that the more critical mass we get on the Strip, the greater the service of new customers bringing more money, staying longer, gambling more and spending more on the non-gaming activities.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to add one thing to what Sheldon said as we are taking the call here.  I was there last week and I was standing in the tower of the Sheraton, tower five and when you looked across the street you see The Venetian, you see the Four Seasons complex getting completed, you look at the City of Dreams, the site we call site 4, which is in my evaluation pretty impressive looking property, you see 5 and 6 and you know you get it.  You see it and it's about to happen.  We're just within a year of the critical mass that Sheldon is talking about, making that one of the most important places in Asia and that's before we add sites 7 and 8, before we add site 3.  So just couldn't help but get a chill as you looked across there and so this is a powerful, powerful critical mass of product being constructed right there across the street from our Venetian.</p>

          <p>Hi, two questions:   One, could you just give us some more color on Hengqin Island, what kind of progress you're seeing there and then second what are your conference convention sales reps telling you right now about the outlook for '08 given discussion of a slowing economy in 2008?  This is for the US, but then also separately on the Macau convention market, what are you seeing there just as you start to book out into '09 and '10 from a utilization perspective?  What is your gut sense as to how high that could go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start with Hengqin Island.  Hengqin Island, we continue to pursue Hengqin Island, we continue to communicate with the guys in Zhuhai and Guangdong Province.  It is China and it takes a measured, patient step-by-step process.  So that's the primary message that we're being told by the mainland Chinese, so we're taking it a step at a time, a piece at a time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that leaves the convention part of the question to me.  Means I'm the giant rat -- sorry, MICE.  Here in the United States, I've been saying this for years and people are concerned -- people are always concerned about whether or not the slowing of the economy, if in fact that's happening, if it will continue to happen, is going to impact conventions.  And I've said repeatedly that the one thing that people cannot do in order to stay competitive in their own business, in order to be in their own business, get up to date, see new products, have new discussions about new technology, etcetera, et cetera, they can't afford to stay away from their dealer meetings, their sales meetings, their trade shows and the association, both trade and professional conferences.  If in fact -- these things are so big, you can take a 50,000 person trade show and have a 20% drop, which was the maximum that was experienced within 30 days of 9-11, just 20%.  Right?  That means 80% of them are still coming and 80% of a 50,000-person show is 40,000.  We'll have 7,000 rooms of which we only allocate about 4,000, 5,000 to groups and we'll certainly fill up with 40,000 people coming.  If you have a 5,000-person company group or a sales meeting, everybody has to go because they work for the company and they have to show up and the company assures it.  We don't think that -- there's enough demand to keep our Las Vegas rooms full.  We are the largest convention facility.  We have more convention meeting rooms, breakout rooms than the entire city of San Francisco, or the entire city of Los Angeles.  People that have larger shows have nowhere else to go and the attraction of being under one roof all at once and never having to leave the property is a very compelling and very difficult to turn away opportunity for meeting planners.</p>
          <p>In Macau I would say that in my experience, over 35 years in the show business says that many, many groups are afraid to book in the first 12 months because no project in their mind ever gets ready on time, they don't expect us to be ready reasonably as we projected and when we book the show.  So now the people that have gone there, the word has gone around to the show community and the meeting planning community that we are there with the best facility in Asia and pretty soon we'll have as many as somewhere -- I don't know the exact number, between 800 and 1,000 meeting rooms.  800 and 1,000 meeting rooms.  If 330 is the biggest single complex anywhere in the world, 800 and 1,000 be just awesome.  So it will be the only place in Asia, if not in the world, where someone can have tens of thousands of people sitting down at one time and the good news about it is that all of the trade shows that have occurred, 100% of them have repeated.  And we had, Bill didn't mention Deloitte Touche, they sent one of their Chinese province groups for one group event, I think it was 800, 1,100 people.  Now we've got one or two others from China at Deloitte Touche, from Japan, from Korea, from Thailand, from India and from I think Taiwan.  So I mean that's the way that it's going and I think it'll only be a matter of time before the exhibition center is sold out, but hopefully we'll never be able -- hopefully we'll sell out the groups, but I'm not sure.  I mean at this time I can't say that -- we'll be adding so many rooms, that -- so many meeting rooms, so many sleeping rooms, we've got a long way to go before we sell all of it out.</p>

I know it's sensitive because it's pending stuff, but I guess it's similar in a way to Pennsylvania, the City of Massachusetts would be bigger, but clearly you feel like you have the bandwidth because you're moving forward with it, but where is the strategy?

Somebody just gave me a piece of paper that talks about there's more than five cities open in Japan and Macau is launching a flight each to <mark type="inaudible" /> Fukuoka, Okinawa, Nagoya and Hokkaido and of course there's Osaka and Tokyo there and I think I heard somebody say something about Yokohama.  Also Korean Air, Air Korea is going to start shadow flights between Macau and Korea, so that is going &#x2013; that speaks to the issue of bringing in multi-night overnight stay market and higher gaming budgets per passenger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is that the average length of stay increase from when we first opened the property, one of our operating challenges was, we didn't put like minimum stays on weekends and the like and we had a tremendous amount of transactions coming out of the Hong Kong, <mark type="inaudible" /> market and so we do at times, put certain minimum stays obviously as we have more group business.  That business tends to stay several days, so it's really evolved, number one, as we've moved into more group business that has generated more longer -- overnight stays and even our FIT policies and tour policies at times dictate minimum night stays.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then just to go back to your earlier comments on the United States conference convention business, Sheldon, you mentioned a lot of details in there, thank you very much for that, but I guess is it fair to say that where you sit you're not seeing much of an impact in conference and convention bookings?  Is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the opposite, Joe.  I think what's fair to say is that if you walk to The Venetian Palazzo and you see the size of this complex and the demand for our space, no matter what happens to the US economy, we have no idea, a lot of it's what's going to happen to the economy, the demand on the <mark type="inaudible" /> convention side is very, very strong.  If you look at this complex now, it's pretty amazing to see what it offers to the convention meetings business.  I think it's just the opposite.  Our business will get stronger if we want it to be stronger in that segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key for us at this property is because of that infrastructure we have many markets we can go to.  A lot of people in this town are a lot more dependent on the tour and FIT market.  We certainly have that.  We constantly look to tweak and change our mix of business and we're in a fortunate position to have the most important meetings product in the world in this building.  It's having the best of the best at your disposal to pick and choose when you want to open that tap and close that tap is what we have here and in the past it's been more of a challenge of turning off the group business to go after the FIT and if we do see some weakness in the FIT market, more likely honestly to happen because of the economy, we have the strong group business and as Rob mentioned that demand to fill our rooms with it and just change the mix to a more group-intensive mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the risk of sounding repetitive, I've been saying for years that -- well, I'll say this now:   Not all operators, not all gaming and hotel operators or destination resort operators are created equal.  Some are created more equal than others.  Our fundamental strategy, convention based is what differentiates us from other properties in all of our developments.  The reality is that midweek you don't get everybody coming because people have to work.  Now there are a lot of people that are retired, a lot of people take vacation times at different times, so there's a lot of FIT and tour and travel market out there.  However, they don't pay as much as the convention market pays.  It's very compelling.  Somebody works for a company who has got to get the information they need to do their job.  That is a business expense and that continues, so we're just created more equal than the other guys because they never -- they always deride it, they always demonized our convention strategy and look who is laughing last.  Our ADR was the highest in the history for rooms, for sleeping rooms and the highest in the history of the hotel industry.  Our occupancy rate was the highest in the history of the hotel industry.  The amount of money we took in, the same on an annual basis.  We've set the records.  Now we don't see any reason that businesses don't have to upgrade anymore.  As a matter of fact, they have to upgrade.  In some cases when things are not going very well, the guys that really get hurt from the general economy are the guys that go out there and cater to the mid-market, that don't have a convention based security to know that tomorrow's rooms are going to be filled.  And if the economy starts to hurt people and it's always very sensitive in the United States, if the economy goes bad and people start tightening their belts, the operators that are going to get hurt are the people that cater to the mid-market and to Mr. Joe Sixpack.  We're catering to the luxury market and the high-end and the convention market.  We know -- I know, 35 years of being in that business that that doesn't end, it just continues.</p>

          <p>That, Dennis, relates to our inter-company lending arrangements between the US and in Macau and that's just really an accounting convention because it's an inter-company account, we have to take that to the P&amp;L rather than taking it to equity.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have to tell you about this anecdotal information.  The anecdotal information has it that there will be no new licenses issued in '09.  At the end of '09 there will be a new chief executive and I think that the Chinese government and we can't state this as a matter of fact, but our relationship with him indicates that, if anything, there will be a contraction of some of the licenses.  Some of the bottom -- the older individual non-known what I call sub-licensees of Stanley Ho, like the Golden Dragon, not the Golden Dragon -- and Greek Mythology and some of these other places if there is a new chief executive being appointed, I think that -- I'm hoping of course that some of those sub-licenses will be closed.  Now I have nothing -- no statement to base that on except the feeling that when we talk to the Chinese government that they indicate to us that they feel there have been too many licenses out there.  The good news is there doesn't seem to be anything on the horizon between now and then to open and so we're going to make every effort to see that they don't -- that this doesn't expand at all.  Now -- so we're going on the basis there will be no new '09 licenses.  Dennis, you and I haven't talked for many years, but it's good to hear your voice again.</p>

We're building in Singapore dollars, but when we earn money, we'll earn money in Singapore dollars, but when we convert it, it goes way up in terms of dollars.  So I think maybe if you want &#x2013; if I were an analyst I'd probably make the adjustment for the exchange rate.  It's tough to predict two years out, but it's on a maybe.

          <p>Today it's about 1.42, so we're down about 23 basis points, which comes to about a 15% number.  So when we convert, we could look forward to converting Singapore dollars, we don't see anything that'll weaken in Singapore exchange rate.  So that's good news for us.</p>

          <p>I think there will be some at the bottom line they will be combined because of all the operational synergies and the way the businesses are managed, but I think on the top line we're still kicking it around internally, but there is some discussion of presenting separate top line statistics for The Venetian and then for The Palazzo.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.  Good afternoon.  If you could just clarify a couple of comments on the call.  Brad, with the budgets you were giving for the various properties, do they include or exclude land and then it sounded like there would be an -- you talked about it for 5 and 6 a little bit more on each project for FF&amp;E?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They exclude land and I said that they don't include pre-opening or what we call owner's FF&amp;E, which is things like slot machine, payable games, computers.  It includes kitchen equipment, it includes anything built in and it includes all the furnishings for all the 6,000 plus rooms and suites.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Brad, there is no incremental land cost for site 2 or 3.  We captured that already in the...</p>

          <p>I heard that once, but sites 2 and 3 have already been captured in the Venetian.  It does include land costs for sites 5 and 6...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're not figuring &#x2013; it's a good point, something that bears talking about. What we are not figuring is Far East contribution to our cost of land, which we  haven't billed them for.  So we're either going to get credit on what we built or he is going to give us the money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the land costs, it has not been clarified by the government what you will pay or are you kind of comfortable with what you are going to pay on the rest of the sites there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Land costs, remember, you have to understand what happens in Asia.  Land cost is based on the square feet we build on the building, so it is imputed into cost of building, so you don't really buy land, you buy the right to build the square footage you are going to build, so your costs are based on a category of built space times a formula.  That is the way it works.  So land costs are then computed by what the final approval and the final development of the building is and while we're at it, because this premium thing is so confusing or how land costs and things are computed, plus I noticed in your report you're talking about selling of malls.  Understand that the Cotai Strip, any mall built on the Cotai Strip, for example, can be sold, can be sold at almost any time because there is no prohibition against malls when they pay an additional premium.  The only difference between the mall and static state and the time in which it's sold is you have to pay additional premium based on whatever the profit is of the mall itself, so malls are in an entirely different category than service departments or condominiums.  the Cotai Strip, by its approval process by the government, anything on the Cotai Strip cannot sell a strata title.  That strata title only relates to residences because residences aren't allowed on the Cotai Strip, so malls can be disposed of, malls are then revalued at the time of the sale and a higher land premium is paid for the mall and they're transferable really pretty well at any time.  The regime relating to the service departments we're still working on in terms of developing a regime where long-term leases or rights to use maybe sold in a different form than perhaps an individual title, like a condominium.  But I just wanted to clarify the point about the malls themselves.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really helpful.  It's hard to get straight info out of Macau sometimes. And then, Bill, you mentioned a 60-20-20 or did I mishear you on the commission structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a sharing risk, 60-40 or 60-20-20, whatever way you want to...</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Sheldon, it sounded like based on your comments about <mark type="inaudible" /> selling early that if given a choice you wouldn't sell The Palazzo mall, pre-sell The Palazzo mall again and you wouldn't be willing to sell your Macau malls until they really prove themselves to get the highest price?  Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, it's not a fair assessment, so just let me clarify that.  It looks like it's obvious, but The Palazzo mall, we had a 30-month true up.  That means that we're not selling -- the final price isn't arrived at until 30 months from the time we transfer the first day we transfer.  So we already got -- we already got the future built into that deal and so as far as the &#x2013; well you're asking about Palazzo.  The bottom line is that I don't think I would pre-sell any more malls because it's not a question of where we put the mall or whether or not it's going to succeed.  It's only a question of if there's a ramp-up time, how long will the ramp-up time be, three months, six months or will it -- because in our mind there is no issue.  We've already proven it with The Venetian.  The Venetian is Asia's first integrated resort.  Anywhere else in the world we build an integrated resort it's going to be the first in that part of the world, whether we do it in South America, we do it in India, we do it in Europe, we do it in Timbuktu.  It's going to be the first and only integrated resort and people are going to come to it because human beings are human beings, every adult wants to be entertained and there's an awful lot of people around the world that would like to go to Las Vegas, but can't go to Vegas because of the distance to travel and why should they do all of that if we bring the mountain to the customers.  No doubt in our mind that the mall is going to succeed and whatever we do is going to succeed and if you can't see that, I mean if it can't be seen by anybody out of The Venetian Macau, I guess it'll just have to wait a little more.  It's already happening.  The December run rate is in excess of what some analysts had projected, 60, 61, 62 million EBITDA run rate for the month of December is a satisfactory run rate as far as the projections of all the analysts are concerned and not all pistons are firing at the same time.  As each of the pistons fine-tuned and they all fire at the same time, like an eight or 12-cylinder car, fine car, then we believe that the cash flow coming out of that it'll be an opportunity maximized.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well Thank you again for listening to our conference call.  I mean obviously we're very excited about what's going on and about the trends that we see not only in terms of what's happening at The Venetian Macau, what's happening in our building here in Las Vegas and what will be happening to Macau as we finish more critical mass on the Cotai Strip.  As the ferry operations ramp up, as more airplanes fly into Macau, there is nothing but a terrific upside in that marketplace and as we begin to see our building coming out of Singapore and as we recognize the value of additional capacity in that marketplace, we're very bullish about the future.</p>
          <p>So thank you again for listening to our conference call.  We look forward to talking to you again and more importantly we look forward to talking to you on Monday to go through a lot more detail, a lot more numbers, so we can get a better handle on exactly how this thing is going and the timing of the process of ramping up into the future.  Thanks again for listening to our conference call and we look forward to talking to you again.  Have a good day.</p>
