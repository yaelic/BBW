          <p>Okay, hello; this is Julia Bates, Director of Investor Relations at JPMorgan Chase.  Thank you for joining us this morning.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to let you know that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements and references to non-GAAP financial information measures.  Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ.  For further information on these matters, please refer to the firm's filings with the SEC and to the notes at the end of the slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody, it's Mike.  We'll get started now and if you could all refer to the presentation that's on our website, the slides we'll go through.  So starting with a quick recap, I won't be redundant here with what I'll say later but a quick recap of some of the big points in the quarter on slide one.</p>
          <p>So as you know, we had net income of $2.7 billion in the quarter.  That's earnings per share of $0.28.  The EPS number is after the $1.1 billion or $0.27 TARP preferred repayment as well as the FDIC special assessment, which was $0.10; that piece being booked in our corporate segment.  Normal and higher FDIC operating expenses you'll see referred to throughout the businesses, but that's the regular cost.  This $0.10 item is the second quarter special assessment, again booked in corporate.</p>
          <p>So behind the results were record revenues, $28 billion for the quarter.  That was a record for the quarter and also amounted to a record for the first half of the year.  As well pre-tax pre-provision profits, $14.4 billion for the quarter, and were a record for a quarter and a record for the year.  So that's on the back obviously of some very strong results in our Investment Bank, which we'll cover in a few minutes, but also just broadly strong results in many of our businesses.  Obviously with others, consumer lending in particular, faced with some challenges, but I'll skip over that until we get to the business slides.</p>
          <p>But commenting for a second on capital, obviously the very strong capital ratios, much better than what we talked about where we were giving you the 'no-worse than' numbers earlier in the quarter when we finished the stress test, but ended the quarter with 122 billion of Tier 1 capital, and that's a 9.7% Tier 1 ratio and a 7.7% Tier 1 common ratio.</p>
          <p>Also in terms of balance sheet strength, we now have $30 billion worth of loan loss reserves.  That's a coverage ratio of loans of about 5%.  We'll obviously talk a lot about credit on the call later on, but we feel very good about the overall reserving level.  We've brought these levels up a lot in anticipation of deterioration and well aware of some of the trends you see in non-performers and so forth, but all fully contemplated in the  way we think about that $30 billion reserve number for what we have ahead of us.  Also obviously we repaid $25 billion in TARP capital in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And lastly before we get into the businesses, it's just important to also point out that we're doing everything that we think we should be doing to help the country to get back on the road to recovery here; so have done a lot in the trial modification space and foreclosure moratorium space, both helping advise on what the best practices are there and getting underway with it in a big way ourselves.  So we've got 138,000 trial modifications approved in the second quarter, representing about $3.5 billion worth of mortgages, and we'll see how those perform over time.  That brings the total of foreclosures avoided to about $600,000 (sic) [600,000].  And obviously, subject to safety and soundness, we continue to be an active lender on the back of the very strong capital we have.  And so that's 150 billion of new credit extended in the quarter across the board: consumers, corporations, non-profits, municipalities and small businesses.</p>
          <p>So now if we just skip past slide two, which just gives you the numbers that I just referred to, let's go straight to the Investment Bank on slide three.  So you see the Investment Bank had profits of 1.5 billion on revenues of $7.3 billion, and I'll just pause here for a minute and just point out the first point here, Investment Banking fee revenue, $2.2 billion.  That's a record for us in a quarter and a record for anybody at any firm in any quarter in terms of investment banking fee levels, so very proud of those results.  It's inclusive of very strong and record equity underwriting volumes and fees of $1.1 billion.  And I'll just ask you to flip to it now but the next slide just shows you the number one year to date rankings in essentially all the major underwriting categories on a year-to-date basis globally.  So that continues to be the case and very proud of it and obviously the number one ranked year to date on fees and a number three ranking in global announced M&amp;A on a year-to-date basis.  So I'm very, very proud of the client franchise and the Corporate Finance business and the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>When you move then to the markets businesses, I'll just make a general statement that across the board, we saw the benefit of strong levels of client activity and continued wider spreads as a general matter.  You did also see in the Equity Markets and Fixed Income Markets businesses the negative impact of our spread tightening on the valuation of some structured notes in each of those businesses.</p>
          <p>But now just looking at each business separately, Fixed Income Markets, $4.9 billion, and that is strength across the board; rates, FX, commodities, emerging markets, and so forth all performing well.  And I'm going to show you a slide that gives you the remaining positions in leveraged loans and risky mortgage assets that we've been talking about for many, many quarters now, but the net effect on those were modestly positive, P&amp;L marks on those positions in the quarter, so we're going to comment on that in another second.</p>
          <p>Equity Markets, 700 million of revenues, and again strong client results, especially in prime services, but weaker on the trading side, the positioning side in the business.</p>
          <p>Moving then down to &#x2013; I'll go right to credit costs.  So credit costs, we had $871 million of credit costs.  That's charge-offs of $433 million, a 2.55% charge-off rate in the quarter, up a bit from last quarter.  And then the allowance, we added $438 million, bringing the total allowance to almost 8%, 7.91, to loans in the Investment Bank.  Obviously, we did have the negative trends in the charge-off rate but it has been &#x2013; we reserve as we downgrade things.  So we think that 8% level of reserves is totally appropriate despite the movement higher in some of the non-performers there.</p>
          <p>And so with that, let me move on from the P&amp;L for the Investment Bank to &#x2013; past the league tables which we talked about to slide five, which is the key risk exposures in the Investment Bank.  So here we've collapsed onto one page the details around what we've talked about for many, many quarters now of what we called our key risk exposures in these two spaces.  I'm just going to recap where we are now since in the future we'll probably stop talking about this as a generic matter and only bring it up when there's something relevant to or noteworthy to bring to your attention.</p>
          <p>First, on leveraged lending, if you recall, we started with $43 billion on a pro forma basis with Bear Stearns back in September 2007, and that's on a notional basis.  Now we carry a remaining amount of market value of $3.3 billion, and that's carried at roughly $0.42 on the dollar, so those are marked down values for what remains.  Obviously exposure came down nicely in the quarter; and the P&amp;L, as I said earlier, was modestly positive net of hedges on this remaining amount, so obviously much smaller exposure and unlikely to be a noteworthy topic of conversation in the future.  But before closing that out, I wanted to point out where we stood.</p>
          <p>Next, mortgage related, this going back to its peak was $48 billion in December 2007.  Here, we have about $12.6 billion remaining, flattish quarter over quarter.  In this quarter, we are modestly positive again across the board here. And so what I would say about this is about half of it, a little less than half relates to normal ongoing client business inventory levels.  And the other half is positions, legacy positions that we like where all of this stuff is marked, and we'll just take the stuff that is legacy and slowly liquidate it out over time.  Again, we'll talk about it in the future where it creates relevant P&amp;L conversation, but at the level of marks we have now in a quarter where it's been very quiet for us, that's where we stand on those two areas of exposure, dramatically down from where we started, and so moving forward into business as usual there.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide six, Retail Financial Services, I'll just quickly hit some of the drivers of the results in this business.  Remember we talked about this in two buckets, the Retail Banking or branch side and the Consumer Lending, which includes all the mortgage lending activity and servicing activity and mortgage portfolio we hold, auto, student loans, and so forth.  So on the top Retail Banking, I feel very good about the underlying growth dynamics again in our business.  We've got deposits of $348 billion, up a bit quarter over quarter.  That's despite us not chasing rates, so we are priced appropriately we think in our deposits.</p>
          <p>And I just will make one point here that we do expect to see some declines in the second half of the year in these levels as we deliberately reprice downward some very high priced Washington Mutual CDs that were put on the books for 12 months in the fall of last year.  So that will be a dynamic that will see a little bit of downward pressure on that number in the second half of the year.  But otherwise, I feel very good about the underlying growth stats in Retail Banking and you'll see the P&amp;L in a second.</p>
          <p>And then on Consumer Lending at the bottom, I'll just point out and you can read the numbers for yourself, but of the total $150 billion of lending we did in the quarter, about just shy of $50 billion of it came through these consumer categories that you see here that I just referred to.  But remember, I think the noteworthy piece is that our mortgage volumes of 41 or so billion dollars is definitely affected by our decision to steer clear of broker originated volume.  So that's certainly a difference from where we have been a year ago and in prior periods. But for several quarters now since we made that final decision to move out of that, it has been a differentiator.  We're picking up less volume and you'll see that on the next page when we talk about Consumer Lending.</p>
          <p>So now moving on to page seven, total P&amp;L for the Retail business, a $15 million profit if you look at the circled number on the left; and then walking down the retail banking piece of that made just shy of $1 billion, $970 million, obviously the substantial increase year over year, $296 million in profits, largely driven by the WaMu acquisition.  So clear evidence there that you see WaMu delivering the profitability that we expected and talked about, and as well some profit lift on a sequential quarter basis as well.  We do have a little bit of higher credit cost there related to the Business Banking business.</p>
          <p>Moving down to Consumer Lending, obviously a disappointing loss of nearly $1 billion offsetting the profitability of the Retail Banking side; so there in terms of what's going on versus last quarter, this quarter we had very modest positive gains in our MSR risk management results versus making about $1 billion in each of the prior quarters, so this quarter more in line with usual expectations and what we talked about there.  And then credit costs, the big driver, $3.5 billion, which includes 1.1 billion of addition to loan loss allowance, so I'm going to in a second go through those portfolio by portfolio.</p>
          <p>So now if we just move on to slide eight, let me just &#x2013; I wanted to just take &#x2013; there's a lot of talk about with the impact of foreclosure moratoriums and modifications and what it means to some of the credit stats you all look at.  So as I said at the beginning, we're active and going to continue to be in modifying mortgages.  I think it's the right thing.  We do it where it makes sense to us and it makes sense to our clients and for good economic reasons here, but a little bit of a misunderstanding maybe about some of the ways that this impacts.  I'll let you read most of this, but just make a few points.</p>
          <p>On the left, we definitely saw, as all did, a buildup in loans that were delinquent in all the delinquency statistics given that we suspended foreclosures during the moratoriums in the fall and spring of this year which are described on that side of the page.  What I would say is that those will sit there longer in the delinquency bucket, so in prime and subprime, you see elevated delinquency stats.  But we don't expect it to have meaningful accounting or income statement impact because as we came out of those moratoriums, we had originally written down those loans and then made adjustments to the write-downs to take account of the longer timelines to move them through into real estate owned and foreclosure if appropriate or modify them.</p>
          <p>So then our modifications, again I said at the beginning we had approved 138,000 modifications for the second quarter here, but those don't have any meaningful impact on our second quarter stats.  And that's because we have to see three monthly payments under the terms of the new modification before we'll re-underwrite that loan and it comes out of delinquency.  And in the meantime, and there's an example here, it just continues to roll through delinquency buckets as it otherwise would have per the contract of the term.</p>
          <p>When we do see &#x2013; if we do see and we hope to see good success with these modifications perhaps next quarter and in future quarters, we'll talk about just the success rate.  But given that these are largely speaking payment reduction modifications that are done, re-underwritten with real income stats and so forth, we are hopeful that we see some good rates of success in the trial periods.  But when we do modify, you just see the description at the bottom of how we take into account when we adjust our reserves at the time we modify the expected remaining losses including an assumption for recidivism or re-default.  So that's the way it really works, and we can spend more time offline if folks want to spend other time, but it's not a material impact to any of the stats in this quarter was the point for today.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to be very quick going through the next three slides, so I'm just going to make some common points.  So the first point is that obviously when you look at home equity prime and subprime, you're going to see the charge-offs continue to trend higher versus prior periods.  And in a couple of cases prime and subprime, we up our future guidance.</p>
          <p>But the second point is that across each of these portfolios, so I just want to say it once, they flow into the early delinquency buckets, and the dollar value of loans that are sitting in the early delinquency buckets has started to stabilize looking back over the last 60 &#x2013; 90 days across the board.  And so that's a new trend versus what we've seen previously.  And obviously that would be &#x2013; we don't know if it's going to sustain itself; but obviously if it did, that would have good implications for future loss trends and could mean that we could be getting near to the end of needing to add to reserves in these portfolios.  Just something to watch and point out, we don't know what the future holds obviously, but an observation of what's going on in the early delinquency buckets across the board.</p>
          <p>So on slide nine, I will quickly hit numbers here, so you see in the upper right charge-offs of $1.265 billion in home equity in the quarter, up a bit from last quarter, but the pace of growth slowing down a little bit.  And we continue to have our forward guidance of quarterly losses trending to &#x2013; down at the bottom last bullet, trending to about $1.4 billion a quarter over the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>Doing the same thing on slide 10 for prime, upper right box, you see $481 billion of net charge-offs, up more substantially from last quarter in percentage terms but similar in dollar terms, and quarterly losses upping the guidance here to something maybe 100 million higher to the range of 600 million or so over the next several quarter, whereas last time it was 500 million.</p>
          <p>And then finally on subprime on slide 11, 410 of losses in net charge-offs in the upper right in the quarter, and quarterly guidance trending to about 500 or so; that used to be 375 to 475 for people keeping track at home.</p>
          <p>So one last point before I move off Retail on to Card, I just want to make a comment on the WaMu credit impaired portfolio that we acquired from WaMu, marked down at the time we did the deal in the fourth quarter.  I just make the point we have no slides in here and no news is good news on that front.  What we're experiencing is losses that are coming in consistent with our original assumptions, so I'm seeing nothing to suggest that we have any need for further impairments based on what we see right now.  So I just want to make that point, and obviously we'll bring that to your attention in the future if ever we do start to see trends that are worrisome.</p>
          <p>In Card, let me just move now to slide 12, obviously a disappointing loss of $672 million in the quarter.  Credit cost, the big story, $4.6 billion of credit costs.  Most of that is charge-offs.  We did add 250 million to loan loss reserves there.</p>
          <p>For Chase, the Chase portfolio versus the runoff subprime WaMu portfolio, the Chase portfolio was a charge-off rate of 8.97%, up about 200 basis points as we said last earnings call in this quarter versus the first quarter, and obviously very high but coming in as expected.  And looking ahead to next quarter, think of that number being in the 10% range.  And really beyond that, it's going to be a function of where the economy and unemployment goes.</p>
          <p>And the WaMu side, behaving consistent with the trend forward that we'll talk about on the outlook slide of trending towards the 18 to 24% range of losses that we talked about for that runoff portfolio.</p>
          <p>Next point on Card is just charge volumes, so you see charge and sales volumes, sales being just the spend piece on cards, declined 7% year over year.  That number is starting to stabilize.  We look at it weekly, but 7% down year over year together with us being less active in promoting balance transfers equates to downward pressure on our outstandings, so you see 148 billion end of period outstandings on the Chase side versus 150 last quarter contributing to some revenue pressure in the business overall.</p>
          <p>I will just say here it relates to revenues but one comment to make that in the quarter, we did on the card securitization side take actions to support the securitization trust that caused the regulatory assets, the risk weighted assets for cards to come on balance sheet for regulatory capital purposes.  I'll show you more about that later when we do capital.  And that also did negatively impact revenues a bit in the quarter, and so revenues in Card would otherwise have been essentially flat quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Commercial Bank on slide 13, we had net income of $368 million, up a bit year over year, WaMu making a bit of a contribution here, and up 30 million quarter over quarter.  I will point out circled numbers, $106 billion of ending loan balances, so we do see reduced client demand on the lending side in the Commercial Bank there to do extend credit, but demand is definitely coming down.  We're seeing that affect on the balance sheet footings.  Revenues in the business are $1.5 billion, up substantially year over year; again, part WaMu and also driven by record non-interest revenues up inclusive of record investment banking revenues in the Commercial Bank in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Credit, similar trends to what we've seen before, 67 basis points of charge-off rates, and some additions to loan loss allowance, bringing that to just shy of 3%.  So again, we see the trends as we expected of normalizing credit late cycle, things moving into non-performer status, and credit costs, charge-offs trending higher, but reserves positioned well in anticipation of all that.</p>
          <p>Next is Treasury and Security Services on slide 14.  Here, I just say it's steady consistent results here in the business, $379 billion of profits, up from last quarter, some seasonal strength there.  Liability balances, 234 billion, down a bit quarter over quarter and year over year; we're seeing some normalization in flow, liquidity flows, liability balance flows on the client side.  And assets under custody down a bit year over year and up a bit quarter over quarter; that drives the revenue side here 1.9 billion in total, flattish on the cash management side and a little down in the security services side given the lower levels of assets under custody in given markets and lower activity in the securities lending side.</p>
          <p>Last business on slide 15, Asset Management, net income here similar story to TSS, steady results here, $352 million of profits, up a good amount quarter over quarter and down only slightly versus the prior year, so recovering as market values on assets under management recover.  So $1.2 trillion in assets under management, down just 1% on a year-over-year basis and up 50 billion quarter over quarter; the slowdown in assets under management flow still 125 billion for the last year and 3 billion for the last quarter.</p>
          <p>And then I guess the big point is that investment performance is what drives results in this business over time.  So you can see in our supplement and see on this slide towards the bottom that we have continued good investment performance; mutual funds 80%, ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years and so on for the past three and past one year when you read through that.</p>
          <p>Corporate on slide 16, so take it piece by piece, obviously a lesser level of write-downs on our private equity positions, so you have 6.6 billion of carrying value in private equity written down and tucks for a net loss of the $27 million in the quarter.  Outlook continues to be for challenging valuation levels in that piece of things, but an improvement from where we were over the last several quarters.</p>
          <p>Then the Corporate segment, you see about $1 billion of after-tax profit here.  Here, I'll just simply say that we had a couple of items, trading gains in our investment portfolio, $820 million.  That's separate and above the net interest margin we get from running a higher investment portfolio.  That net interest margin was high and will continue to be high so long as we sit where we are, which we currently expect to.  But the trading gains a little bit, certainly they're volatile or this is an abnormally high level.  I will point that out at 820 after tax.  We did sell some MasterCard shares, 150 million to the positive.  And this is also where we booked the FDIC special assessment, $419 million after tax.  You take those yourself to normalize what that Corporate line would be, but it's nearly $0.5 billion in profits.  And again, that would be driven by our positive spread on the investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 17 is Capital Management, so here very proud of these numbers: Tier 1 capital, 122 billion; Tier 1 common capital of 97 billion.  Again, Tier 1 capital ratio is very strong at 9.7% and Tier 1 common at 7.7.  As I said on the Card page, this includes the consolidation of $40 billion of risk weighted assets in the quarter related to the Card business.  So you can see on the bullet that just projecting forward to the impact of the consolidation of off-balance sheet vehicles pursuant to the FASB changes that are coming January 1 of next year, our rough estimate is that the remaining impact could be about 40 basis points when you look at the other off-balance sheet items and other accounting that would go along with that.  But ultimately obviously there's ongoing interpretation around those rules, so things could change between here and there.</p>
          <p>Page 18 just shows you the loan loss reserve piece.  This is a loan loss reserve of 29 billion.  There's another billion related to lending related commitments in the 30 billion I talk about earlier.  And you just see the expected trend of loan loss to total loans trending higher earlier and as non-performing loans come up as the downgrades that are anticipated along the way evolve, you see the ratio of reserves to non-performing loans come down.  But still, we show those ratios for Consumer, Wholesale, and firm-wide at the bottom, and very comfortable with where we sit there.  But obviously future economic conditions are going to dictate whether we are in fact near the end or not, but we believe we could be getting close.</p>
          <p>On the outlook slide, page 19, you've got the Investment Bank.  Again, we don't know what the future holds.  The uncertain environment obviously continues.  There are still risks out there and trading can be volatile, so no real guidance for you there.  Make your own assumptions.  Retail, I just recapped what loss projections that we talked about in each of the main portfolios.  We do expect continued underlying growth there.  On the Card Services side, you see the 10% loss rate for next quarter plus or minus that I talked about for the Chase portfolio and 24%. 18.4 is where WaMu is going to go.  But we do expect continued pressure on revenues given lower consumer spend levels having an effect on outstandings.  Commercial Bank, the underlying growth is good.  We like being in the market share there.  We do have strong reserve but credit trends will continue to normalize.  Treasury, Asset Management, nothing really to point out; you can read for yourself.  And Private Equity and Corporate, I just hit the key points there.</p>
          <p>So with that, operator, I'd like to just throw it open to questions.</p>

          <p>Largely stable, I mean you hit on it a little with the runoff in some of the portfolios, compression in some of the investment portfolio and the Investment Bank trading type of assets.  That's the real change quarter over quarter from first to second in net interest margin and a little of a decline in dollars overall.  I'd expect it to be flattish best I can tell looking ahead from here to the third quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The Consumer Financial Protection Agency, it's being formed, but we've seen the directionality if you will of where we they go related to the changes made in the Card business.  I know these are moving parts, but is there a way to paint a more rosy or less ugly picture in terms of profitability and revenues and available credit and things like that on the go- forward for where the CFPA could take things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jamie.  That agency is just being discussed, and these are very important points.  We are big supporters of proper consumer protection.  And in particular, we probably were some the first to point out that the mortgage business was half regulated and half unregulated, and that's where a lot of the problems turned out.  So we do think that a lot of work needs to be done there.</p>
          <p>The credit card, we think there should be less regulatory agencies, not more just for ongoing ease, control, and things like that, so we're worried that the more agencies and the more politics and bureaucracy around it.  And the credit card bill itself, that was &#x2013; we think of all the things they did, we thought some were completely appropriate.  We already had the best practices in multiple of those areas, but we think it went a little bit too far.  So it will entail credit card companies in general we believe cutting back on credit they give both at the lower end of the cycle and the amount &#x2013; at the lower end of the curve, and the way they do credit.  You'll no longer be able to do fixed cards. You'll no longer be able to do bunch of things.  It will reduce credit and it will at least reduce profitability we believe in the short run, meaning the rest of this year and mostly next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, in card, any theories on why the delinquencies are improving?  Is it concentrated in the 30-day delinquency bucket less so than in the 60 and 90-day in credit card?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's in those early buckets.  We're starting to just see &#x2013; it's the same as similar commentary to the home equity and mortgage space.  But again, it's early, John, to draw big conclusions from that, but early buckets starting to look more stable as is consumer spend.  Spend in card, what we see is declines at 7% year over year that you see in our charge volume, kind of indicative of where spend is overall, and you're starting to see it stabilize at that kind of level.  So weaker than where it was versus a year ago but better than the worst point and trending a little bit more stable; but again, we don't know how long that holds on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then you see delinquencies improving but the outlook for charge-offs to be up another 100 basis points next quarter.  It seems that bankruptcies are becoming a bigger percentage of the charge-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real reason is that the balances are going to be going down a little bit.  All the charge-offs will be about the same.  Balance will be going down a little bit.  The front end obviously is notoriously fickle.  But part of that, at least in my opinion, relates to the fact it's the rate of change of unemployment and new unemployment claims.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think once unemployment levels off, you may see that number actually start to come down a little bit.  We don't know that, but there's good reason to believe that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and on the reserve build, Mike made the comment that the degree of reserve build is declining with a 5% ratio.  What metrics will you guys be looking at to stop building reserves and see the end of reserve building?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Glenn (sic), it's going to be &#x2013; it's your notion of what your expected embedded losses are.  So it's going to really be dictated from here on things like, as Jamie just said, where does the unemployment rate stabilize or does it keep changing, and the same with broader economic trends as it relates to the corporate side as well.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They need that stuff to stabilize a bit before you get to a place where if you think your losses are peaking out there looking out a year and beyond, you get to the point where you can consider that to be the &#x2013; given how strongly reserved we feel we are, that would be the indicator that we're at the end.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>That's a tough line for us to forecast.  It moves around a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tough for us, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you have any feedback on the CVA issues on that line and whether those should be reoccurring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CVA, DVA, very complicated obviously.  In the credit portfolio, we manage the change in value of derivative assets and liabilities, counterparties, and our own credit spreads.  That collective CVA/DVA impact was a couple hundred million positive in the quarter.  But in any given quarter, sometimes they neutralize; sometimes they don't.  But there was a modest positive in there in what was managed in credit portfolio.  But the preponderance of the negative was the accounting asymmetry where we hedge some of our traditional accrual book loans, the 70 billion of retained loans in the Investment Bank, excess held positions, and so forth.  We have hedges that are mark-to-market instruments.  And with tightening credit spreads in the quarter, those dropped in value with no offset because of the accrual loans don't get marked and so that negative was partially offset by CVA/DVA.</p>
          <p>It's a function of spreads.  It's very hard to predict that line.  All I can do is explain it to you one quarter to the next.  You can look at the long-term trend and put a placeholder in there and we'll explain it quarter by quarter</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Do you have reserves in addition to those hedges?  Are those loans that also have reserves against them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  This question is about the subprime and prime buckets and some of the expected loss rate guidance being ticked upward a bit and the disconnect between that and what I'm hearing about what you're seeing in the early delinquency buckets.  Maybe you can just help us reconcile why you still feel that you need to raise the out quarter's loss guidance if you think the delinquencies are stabilizing here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, the roll rates in the later buckets affect ultimate losses as well as severity of loss.  So it's forming better views about what's already in the pipeline and how it will behave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect unemployment to get worse, so we built that in a little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough, so it's a little bit like the answer on the Cards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, though on Cards, we have a lot of visibility into next quarter as opposed to this.  This is more erratic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And just to go back to the Investment Bank credit portfolio hit because of the hedges, so really the way to look at that is that you had hedge ineffectiveness which was compounded in terms of the bottom line for the unit by the fact that you had a pretty large increase in loan losses in the hedged portfolio.  Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the one line, it's revenues only; but for the total economics, exactly right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right because we saw that loan loss rate move up quite a bit to about 2.5%.  Did you have some large specific losses there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's one...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...but that's going to be idiosyncratic, and the fact is the reserves are very high.  It's hard to imagine you're really going to need more reserves.  But the actual losses, NPAs will go up and the actual losses will bounce all around the place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the final question I have is on the credit enhancement that you talked about for the card securitization.   Can you give us an idea of the order of magnitude in terms of the increase of your funding costs that you're seeing there because of the need to credit enhance more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not that so much, Guy.  We put new receivables in and issue notes that are zero discounted, so it depresses revenues.  So it's just increasing credit enhancement in those trusts from about 11% to about 14% creates a revenue <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not saying that it's the underlying interest cost at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are all existing deals.  And of the new deals we've done, obviously some were down at LIBOR plus 300, 200, 100, or something like that.  It's just the accounting for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the economics are ultimately different in terms of you're willing to accept more credit loss on those securitizations.  Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're confusing apples and oranges.  The securitizations are purely an accounting thing where it cost us a couple million dollars this quarter because we did the enhancement.  Whether we finance the balance sheet or not is purely what's the cheapest way to finance the balance sheet; I mean it's unlikely in 1/1/10 going forward we will be doing credit card securitizations at all.</p>

          <p>Hey, just three things, actually, one on the Card.  Are you &#x2013; obviously in 1/1/10 going to be bringing over onto GAAP assets &#x2013; it's already in wrap, right.  But the GAAP assets, the card securitizations, is your comment suggesting that you're going to be funding it with deposits, you're not going to be doing incrementally more securitizations going forward?  And can you give us some color on whether or not you're going to bring it over at fair value or at face value plus a reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we just fund the balance.  I don't think you fund it with deposits.  We simply make a decision on how to fund it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More likely than not, the firm will just fund it because it will be cheaper than doing securitizations.  And as you know, we have a lot of liquidity and funding capability, and I think the requirement is it comes over at fair value.  Basically there will be an addition to reserves below the line, so we reduce capital, which is why when it goes on the balance sheet, it doesn't change reduced weighted assets but it reduces your tangible common equity.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay.  You talked about the mod programs and the moratoriums not having an impact on the results in the quarter.  Is that just on the P&amp;L, or would NPAs have looked different without the mod program and the moratoriums?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On mods &#x2013; on moratoriums, the point is that loans that would otherwise have gone to foreclosure left delinquencies and been in REO have been stuck in the delinquency bucket.  So delinquency stats, delinquency levels, later buckets like 90-day plus are just going to be elevated for a period of time until those suspended foreclosures get worked through, so that's just a timing issue.  You've got a little bit of a double-up inside the later buckets there, but no economic impact because we write our assets down in those later buckets to what we think we'll realize when we sell them.  So that's stayed true throughout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You will see foreclosures go up when this is over.  The P&amp;L has already reflected it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the modification side, it's no impact on anything yet because if you're 60 days delinquent and then you start a modification, a modified loan, and make your first payment, if it's less than your contractual payment, you will still roll to the 90-day bucket in the delinquency stats.  So there is no &#x2013; and that's what that example on that page is intended to display.  If you successfully complete the repayments under your new modification, your loan would then be successful as a trial mod and then become an official rewritten loan, and then it would come out of delinquencies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Sorry, then on home equity, I get this question all the time about how you're assessing &#x2013; and not just you, but everybody who's got home equity how you're assessing reserves against that &#x2013; if the first lien is getting modified.  If you've got customers where the first lien is getting modified and you've got a second on that first lien, does it impact your analysis on how much you have to reserve for your second lien?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and it's all given the loss given default, but some of them are 100% losses that we recognize as charge-offs.  In some, we have a valid second lien which we expect to be paid off.  It's really different in different circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the borrower has to be delinquent though before you do any kind of reserving against the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, except remember, the reserving we're looking forward and forecasting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly on capital, your comment, your one ratio, 7.7, you said in the last call that you had that targeting somewhere around seven.  I realize that we're not out of the woods.  I realize that regulators haven't had official comments on whether or not they're going to change capital requirements.  But can you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the capital, where you're letting it &#x2013; where you'd be willing to let it drift to?  What is going to influence your thinking on dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the seven, I wouldn't call it a target.  I think what we were really saying is that we expect it to be around there.  I think after that to get out of TARP and stuff, we were asked to raise another 5 billion in common equity, and this shows you why we didn't really think we needed to, so we're growing what I would call excess capital.  And we don't really think that there's a reason to have much more than 7% or something like that, but we're going to wait and see what the rules are because obviously those are going to change.</p>
          <p>The dividend, before we do a new dividend, we'd really like to see the change in delinquencies and charge-offs in the economy so we'll have a little more certainty going forward about the environment.  We still have a huge stock purchase program and we're going to be opportunistic.  We think we can buy a lot of stock back.  We have the wherewithal to do a good job for shareholders and still maintain a fortress balance sheet.  We'll consider that at any point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, it depends on what the stock price is.  When our preferreds were down at $0.50 to the dollar, I wanted to buy those back too.  But because of TARP, we weren't able to do it.  Look, I'm not going to tell you what price we're going to do it.  I'm simply saying that a rational person would say at one point you might actually do something like that depending where the stock goes and what your options are.</p>

          <p>Hi, Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I have a question.  I'll call it the three Cs, and that would be your exposure to the corporate space.  If I'm reading this right, NPAs and wholesale loans jumped 2 billion in the last three months, and your exposure to CIT and your exposure to California, so just generally credit quality on the wholesale side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CIT will be basically immaterial.  Corporate NPAs are going to go up.  Remember, you reserve for those as the credit get downgraded, so it's really reflected in the 8% loan losses of the large corporate.  In California, are you talking about corporate or consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just general, I mean how do you think about California, your exposure there, whether you want to be more exposed or less exposed?  I guess the IOUs weren't that much for you.  To the extent that California gets much weaker than expected, how do you think about that in terms of your outlook with regard to your consumer loans in the state and any other exposure you might have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in business in California forever, so we're not going to be guessing about the next six months.  We're building branches.  We're still underwriting mortgages and small business loans and all the things that we need to do.  Our standards like loan-to-value in certain markets are a little bit lower than 80% just to protect ourselves from numbers going own,</p>
          <p>California has always been very resilient.  In fact, we see little signs.  A lot of the MSA markets there, they have actually had up prices in home price the last couple of months.  It's a positive.  They've been going down for the better part of two or three years.  You could argue that California is starting to see a little bit of return.  And in terms of building the business, we're going to build the business and not guess and pull in and out because we think it may or may get worse or better in the short run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to &#x2013; I'm repeating a question from before, but if delinquencies might be stabilizing but your losses go higher, so you're saying the severity of loss is getting greater?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In part, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just generally speaking, I can't tell if you're guiding for much less reserve building or not from your comments so far.  In other words, if you say 12 months from now things should be getting better, then you'll bring it down.  Are you there yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the second you see things really stabilize, we won't need any additional reserves.  That could be as early as next quarter.  That could be some time next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be some additional reserve builds in the next two quarters, but it's possible that we actually start to see an improvement, that that would be wrong.  30 billion is a lot of reserve.  We're 8% in Investment Banking, almost 3% in Commercial Banking, and we're huge numbers across everything else.  The second you see things start getting better, those will be excess reserves.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Most of my questions relate to mortgage.  With respect to comments you had made on the different origination channels, it looks like your correspondent channel actually picked up.  I'm wondering if this is just repackaging Ginnie Mae loans or what the duration of the strength in that channel is going to be.</p>
          <p>And then I've got other questions with respect to &#x2013; there's a lot of discussion in terms of &#x2013; I know it's early stage, but how successful, how difficult it is to modify loans.  There's an article obviously in the paper today about Sachs, and &#x2013; you've modified more than your competition.  Can you give early color on terms of the difficulty and the early experience with that?  And then I have another question on hedging strategy and commercial after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CNT [Correspondent Negotiated Transactions] went down to the extent that we got rid of broker related CNT, but it went up to the extent that the traditional correspondents, banks and stuff like that, picked up share.  We don't have any other details for you now, but we can probably get them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the correspondent line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The correspondent line; modifications are hard to do.  You hire hundreds of thousands of people.  We've opened up a lot of offices and we've written new systems.  It's a complex process.  Unfortunately, we have a backlog.  We're trying to whittle that down.  Think of when you look at mods.  Separate mods before which are more traditional, people deferring payments, putting them on the back end, from the new mods where you actually have a reduction in payments or a reduction in principal.  It's very early to tell.  We're hopeful it will be good but it's very early to tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, with respect to your hedging strategy on your MSR, is there any chance &#x2013; your outlook in terms, is that more rate influenced for this quarter or duration?  I want to separate the two because if your modification efforts are successful, the duration might expand separate from just a rate hedge.  Does your hedging strategy stay constant?  Are you more reflective of the hedging strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So use this as a baseline, okay, the MSR is short duration.  It's short volatility, and it's short the mortgage basis.  We're constantly adjusting future assumptions, but we think about the whole portfolio by product: 5s, 5.5s, 6s, Fannie Maes, FHAs, mods, et cetera.  We're always doing that, and the baseline is to be hedged there but obviously make decisions about when to unhedge some of those exposures, and I mentioned the three major ones.  And yes, things like mods obviously will change duration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We try to incorporate that in what we do.  We're not taking big &#x2013; we're not punting on the MSR and taking big bets on it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not suggesting you are.  But anecdotally, what I'm hearing is the mods could have a tremendous impact on the devaluation of the MSR, and I'm just trying to get your feel for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure and believe me, we will adjust for that.  So I think...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our forward assumptions do the best they can in terms of how the asset is going to behave to predict that so that we can hedge it the best we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even if you hedged 100% of those things, you still are going to have a swing by hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter because obviously what actually happened and what your model predicted will always be different.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the Commercial side, how much loan modification is going in that channel because your assets are going down?  Your revenues are going up.  What type of modifications are going in that channel?  What type of market share are you gaining in that channel?  And then what's the cross-current in terms of the fee share with the Investment Bank as well?  That's my last question, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really in the Investment Bank where you're referring to modifications where you have change in terms and conditions and fees and extensions, and it's negotiated one by one.  It's a good thing.  We get paid to do it, all the fees in the Investment Bank, but it also helps the companies.  You get paid more in the short run, and you have to do it deal by deal, and that includes stuff that's non-performing.  It includes stuff which is in default.  It includes stuff which is not even near default.  And very often the credit gets better because they do things to make the credit better so that they &#x2013; you get the lenders to modify the loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in the Commercial Bank, there are higher levels, particularly in the mid-corporate space, of activity tapping into capital markets.  So the Investment Bank &#x2013; I'm sorry, the Commercial Bank's piece I think of Investment Banking fees or fees they were associated with were 300 million or so, running north of the $1 billion run rate we talked about when we did the JPMorgan/Bank One deal for the year to date.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys, thanks for taking my call.  Just a couple of follow-up questions on questions that I guess have already been asked.  In terms of your comments relative to exposure to CIT, were your comments reflective of your exposure to small business and the retail sector?

        <plist>
          <p>...to those companies that they deal with that have some issues.  I'm sure there would be something there, but I wouldn't think that would be a major thing.  Remember, even companies in bankruptcy continue to service accounts and things like that.  Obviously if we have clients who are involved in that or participation, when we looked at that, we think we're fine but we'll be engaged trying to minimize the impact of that.

What about the pricing side of things?  You're not alone in this, but the loss right now at least exceeds your net interest margin.

We'll do the best we can, but it's beyond that in anticipating how to reshape the business as we deal with the credit environment we're currently in and then deal with the legislative changes and business practice changes.  We will get a business that over the horizon that I was just referring to earns a good return.  And it will be whatever size business on the lending side can generate a good return on capital.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It won't be next year.  The way to look at it is a big part of that business is fine.  It earns a decent return.  We don't have to make a lot of changes.  And then there's a chunk of it, 30 &#x2013; 40%, we're going to have to make some real changes.  A reasonable expectation is that revenues are stressed a little bit next year.  Charge-offs are high and the money &#x2013; the business loses money.</p>

          <p>And the legislation itself all things being equal, and it's very hard to look at it all things being equal because part of it is how all the competitors respond to it, and it's already in my number about losing money because that will cost 500, 600, $700 million next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great; following up on a different topic, you talked a little bit about the MSR valuation and hedging.  I mean, as you look at the rate environment as we enter at least the third quarter, is there anything about it that would cause the kind of swing you had in the valuation adjustment?  I guess it's hard for to us know from the outside how to think about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be really clear.  If you hedge 100% of your models and you do your models well, you are going to have a swing of a couple hundred million a quarter no matter what, but it will net out over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We call that the MSR risk management revenue.  You can see that in our press release.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just how actual pay-downs and products act versus what your model said</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was $81 million positive this quarter.  But as Jamie said, you look back over time and on average, that's in the range of plus or minus several hundred million bucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In addition, we sometimes make decisions that make that number bigger or smaller.  There are times when you're not going to hedge mortgage basis or volatility.  That could be right or wrong.  There may even be times when you don't hedge all the duration as a business matter.  So assume if you're 100% hedged, you have a couple hundred million swing, and it could be a lot more than that depending if we change how we position it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things, within the Investment Bank, and I guess I'm specifically wondering about prime brokerage, in the industry, we've seen assets contract, and there has been a lot of disruption, but it seems like things might be getting a little better.  Can you talk a bit about whether competition is increasing at all there and whether you're seeing at least a stabilization in redemptions and your outlook there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen a small increase in prime broker in the last quarter or so.  But our ongoing assumption is that you're going to have a lot of competition.  Investment banking is a very competitive business, and there's no reason to think that we're going to be a beneficiary from people having problems in the future.  So all the big competitors are still there and they're still very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and this is a tough question to answer I know.  But along these lines, seeing the level of equity origination revenues in the quarter and looking forward, we've had a lot of FIG [Financial Institutions &amp; Government] refis.  From an investment banking capital raising standpoint, what can realistically be done as an encore?  Is there enough demand on the investor side and supply from the corporate side to keep supporting investment banking levels near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're talking about next quarter, it's awful hard to answer that question, but I think if you look &#x2013; and obviously, we're still in a pretty big recession.  But the quarter before, there was huge fixed income.  This quarter is equity.  I think there will be a lot of people who are raising debt and equity or preferreds to recapitalize and refinance their balance sheets.  And obviously it will be lumpy, and whether the market is willing to accommodate big supplies of those things, but it has also been a global phenomenon.  When you look at it globally, it's possible you'll continue to have pretty active investment banking fee markets as people try to change and fix their balance sheets and get ready for new environments.  Your guess is as good as ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in the corporate segment, let's call it trading gains on the portfolio, is there any way we should think of that going forward, or is that just going to a wildcard like fixed income trading revenues tend to be in the Investment Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You think of that as pretty much excess revenue.  It's generally positive over time, a little bit of volatility, but at this level, it was much higher than normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of that portfolio is held for A-of-S, so it doesn't have a trading gain or loss.  And obviously because of the markets, we took advantage of buying certain things in there that we obviously were right to buy, but they had to by their nature be put in the trading portfolio.  It will be a little volatile.  We don't expect big gains like that, put it that way.  You saw last year when Fannie Mae went bankrupt and we had to write down the preferred, it was a big loss.  So this is the flip side.  We did buy the bank preferreds and stuff like that that had to go into trading portfolios.  This is just the flip side.</p>

          <p>Okay, and I know this isn't necessarily as big an issue for you guys specifically relative to the industry, but everyone is still concerned about commercial real estate and how it's performing.  You haven't really mentioned it as being a problem in the quarter &#x2013; or in the quarter highlighted.  Can you give any color as to how you're seeing general trends in the commercial real estate market?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will give you a general comment.  Commercial real estate in the United States America is going to get worse consistently over the next several quarters.  That should not be a surprise to anybody.  Of course, real estate is idiosyncratic because you have good developers.  You've got good underwriters.  You have good down payments.  You have good equity.  If you can build a good building and you're in a good place, all those various things.  We've got two major real estate exposures.  We have what we call CTO, which is multifamily, it's small loans.  It's performing fine, and it's actually...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two credit card related questions.  One is you addressed to some extent in terms of saying that you expect pressure on the margins.  But I guess I'm wondering if you look out two or three years in the credit card business, how seismic a shift in the business model are we looking at in Cards going from a borrowing vehicle to a payments and transaction vehicle? I mean is it your expectation that two or three years from now, the pre-provision profits will be more or less similar as a percent of outstandings to what they are now, or are we looking at something really different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Half the business won't change at all.  I think it's a mistake to look at it as spend or borrow because a lot of people do a little bit of both.  Certain airline cards and stuff like that, I don't think they're going to change that much.  It's more spend, there's a little borrow.  There are parts of the business which will change forever.  You're not going to have fixed rate cards.  You're going to have much lower people offering to do balance transfers.  You can't offer low rates to certain customers because you can't.  They'll almost be sitting out there forever under the new laws.</p>
          <p>My guess is at the end of the day, the business will be smaller, I don't know, 10 or 15%, but it will return to normal profitability because otherwise you wouldn't be in the business at all.  Obviously some of the borrower business will be gone forever.  I think that people will have to be required to do less subprime, which we don't do, but I think in the business, there will be less of that.  It may take a couple years to get back to that place, but it will be a decent business again.  We have particularly competitive advantage because we think there's an enormous advantage having branches, customers, cross-selling.  We know that credit acts better if &#x2013; credit card acts better if you have a deposit account.  Hopefully you'll see us come up with some great new products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And partners, business, and rewards associated with it will be a big deal as well, and we like our position there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second question is if you look to your database, you must track it by county and zip code and all that.  And if you look at some of the markets where you've had chronically high unemployment, the stress regions in the Midwest or what have you, and where you've had say double digit unemployment for a year, two years, three years, at some point do the losses start coming down just because you're not extending credit to business in those areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've disclosed this before that credit card losses have a direct and highly correlated to both unemployment and to home prices.  And obviously, home prices and unemployment have a direct correlation too.  So where you've had chronically high unemployment, you've also had chronically high losses.  I do believe at one point when unemployment stabilizes, losses stabilize and even start to trend down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have enough places where we see that stabilization to give the read, but we believe that to be true.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With more careful underwriting, you'll see the benefit of that.  You already see, for example, in auto loans, which have a much shorter duration, so you can actually more quickly adjust underwriting that there has been an improvement in credit, all things being equal.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.  With respect to equity trading, I guess your results relative to I guess the one conflict reported to date, a bit softer.  You brought VAR down.  They brought VAR up.  Could you just give some more color around that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First I will tell you I don't really pay much attention to VAR because I think it's artificial.  It's a good single point measure, but that doesn't tell you the risk you took all quarter or things you did.  We had good cash, good derivatives, good primary issuance, great primary issuance.  And on hedging and stuff like that, we're on the wrong side of the market.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.  I guess with respect that we saw private equity write-downs versus write ups and some others just given the strength in the market; any more color there?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we just do it.  It's all idiosyncratic so it's position by position valuations.  It's hard to make a general comment compared to anybody else on that score.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough, and then just lastly, Mike, in terms of home equity delinquencies stabilizing, I guess you're very hesitant to give an outlook there.  As you look at other metrics beyond just 30-day delinquencies, I guess any way you're leaning in terms of is this seasonal or is this actually real improvement?  Are you seeing any kind of different trends by geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, like we said, only hesitant in that I don't have the ability to see into the future.  So we are seeing and it has been pretty steady now for several months, the early bucket delinquency related stabilizing.  And you see we didn't up our near-term loss guidance in that portfolio.  So for what that's worth, recent trends have been decent in home equity.</p>

          <p>The only thing I'd mention is no generally, but the only thing I'd mention is that in looking at the Washington Mutual deposits, there's some very high rate timed deposit money that will likely roll off where it's not related to an existing retail branch customer.  We're not going to be chasing or holding onto those kind of hot money deposits and paying a price to do it.  So that will obviously affect the levels of NIM in the retail business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was pretty good as we talked about going back to &#x2013; the deal closed late September, right, so when we talked about it during our October earnings call, it was the early read that we had immediately stabilized the behavior there and then with the stuff that's gone on in that business.  So for the core activity real retail clients, it's behaving nicely.  As I said, there is a chunk of the deposit base there that is non-affiliated, non-client, just attracted by the rate.  So that's going to behave a little differently but we're fine with that.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  We've got a couple of news stories in the past couple of days about the continued difficulty in getting jumbo mortgage money and how that's impacting some of the high cost real estate markets.  Can you guys just speak to your jumbo origination trends and how you're underwriting at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a very good question.  There are some people out there with much lower jumbo rates than we have.  We are doing them.  We've been very conservative, but we'll probably be a little more aggressive going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're working on it.  I dealt with that one, Nancy.  We basically are just following the government's process, so we made an offer.  The government didn't take us up on that offer.  So in the natural process, we've allowed them rather than go through and negotiated or rather a pretty convoluted appraisal process, have allowed them to just take it to a public auction given what their announced intentions are.  We don't know anything yet on the timing for that or how exactly they'll carry that forward.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys; most of my questions have been asked and answered and just one thing quick.  I know you're very reluctant to comment on an outlook for trading revenue, but can you just give us a sense on two things?  On customer trading, especially on the fixed income side, are spreads still in the month of July remaining abnormally wide from a customer trading standpoint?  And do you get the sense that you're picking up broad based that you are picking up market share in your various fixed income trading businesses?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the second question first.  Yes, I think we picked up share over time.  It has actually been reflected in some analyses we do when we look at client share and fixed income because throughout this whole crisis, we've been open.  We've been making markets.  We've been trading.  Obviously, some people weren't and spreads have been coming down.  Obviously, they were very high, even ridiculously high.  Nobody has the right to expect they would stay that high.  Our ongoing assumption would be that there should probably be decent client volume and spreads are going to come down, and we see it happening in various products already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Spreads are going to come down in the third quarter reasonably quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they came down over the course of the second quarter and at best, we would assume competition comes back and knocks them a little bit tighter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandel with GIC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was wondering if you all can comment on compensation expense on a linked quarter basis as revenue linked quarter was up and comp was down about 10%.  And if you could, include the comp trends in the Investment Bank where the ratio was also down, how you're thinking about that now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so we do it fairly consistently the way we have always done it, and it's a risk adjusted measure.  So that number can bounce around any particular quarter depending how the revenue is earned and things like that.  Like anybody else, we're going to be competitive in Investment Banking comp.  We have a very good business.  We're very proud of the results there, and that number will jump around.  We don't &#x2013; we do it every quarter.  It's not like we do a high number in three quarters and a low number in the fourth quarter.  It's probably more level than other people would actually do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron, we don't know the second half of the year obviously and that's when we figure it out for good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was different in the mix of revenue this quarter that would have led to a lower comp on the same overall corporate revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ins and outs, Ron, I would just say it's when we look at it on a six-month and year-to-date basis, we're comfortable with where we sit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you suggesting that we should really look at the six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think a six-month level, as Jamie said, underlying approach is very much risk based, so comp to revenue is not a great proxy but it's the best you all can do.  So I'd take the first six months as a way to approach it for second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in non-comp, were there any particular things we should think about there, any particular cost cutting measures that might affect the second half or expense trends that might increase?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I just wanted to ask about overall revenues and strategy.  Obviously you hit a revenue record this quarter.  But clearly you're working as a background where a lot of your customers, corporates and individuals, are deleveraging and loans are shrinking.  So I mean, really what are the opportunities with growth over the next couple of years?  Will total revenues potentially fall over this period?  And are there any businesses in particular that you'd like to see your market share improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point is we want our market share to improve in every business.  I don't think it's a bad thing that corporate loans are going down because a lot of those loans are going down because people are accessing capital markets and that's a good thing, and we do business with that too.</p>
          <p>In terms of building the business, we don't &#x2013; just as a business matter and a more philosophical statement, we're going to have great bankers calling on great clients doing real business the best way we can do it.  We open branches.  We do our marketing, and the revenues are going to bounce around.  You can forecast GDP and unemployment globally just like we can.  So that's your job to do that.  We're going to build the business relentlessly day in and day out with great products and great services and great people.  Profits and revenues will be what they are.</p>
