          <p>[Starts Abruptly] Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan will approve a new formula for export tariff for heavy oil 10-10-10 program. LukOil is one of the major producers of heavy oils. We produce over 1.5 million tons and, of course, we will have a considerable upside there, and our program aims at increasing the production of heavy oils to 3.5 million tons and perhaps even 5 million tons because getting a 10-year break from export tariff tax provides increased efficiency for our company. And we cannot say that the government is not doing anything for the oil companies. The processes are underway. Sometimes, these processes are also positive.</p>
          <p>The next slide is the changes in our cash flow figures. As you can see, the cash flow figure increased by over 50%. And today, the company has considerable free cash resources that are required to develop it and also to pay out a high level of dividend.</p>
          <p>The main CapEx breakdown, as you can see, the main article of CapEx &#x2013; I'll put it this way, the main area of capital investment is oil production and gas production, which is a considerable chunk of our CapEx. And as you can see, the overall outlays are at about the level of last year. At the same time, we are growing our operations both in Russia and abroad. And the costs relating to the production in the Caspian offshore area are on the rise, getting ready to launch the Filanovsky field and putting on stream the Korchagin field. And starting in the second half of this year, you will see that there will be a considerable increase in costs for international projects, that is to say developing fields in Western Qurna. Our other costs are stable at a stable level, and they are in line with the investment program that has been prepared by the company.</p>
          <p>Of course &#x2013; we are moving on to the next slide &#x2013; the positive financial position is ensured by these operating results. As you can see here, over the year, the company reduced net debt by 17% by over $1 billion against the backdrop that we are paying out a high dividend, we are carrying out a major investment program and are also buying back our own shares. And this stable financial position makes the company very robust, very strong, able to weather the volatility that we observe in the market to meet all the challenges that were set for the company in our strategy.</p>
          <p>The company announced a record-setting dividend payout that will happen very shortly. The dividend yield at present, at the level of 4.7%, 4.8%, is again a record figure in the company's operating history. And we hope that the dividend, as was announced, will grow considerably next year, that is to say the company is laying a solid groundwork for the capitalization growth and meeting the needs of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The company maintains a very strong competitive position in the industry globally as you can see in terms of free cash flow, in terms of net income per barrel, in terms of lifting costs. The ROACE figure, the company has very strong results and enjoys a strong position.</p>
          <p>And to conclude my presentation, as I've mentioned in the quarter's presentation, we started the year on an optimistic note. Traditionally, the first quarter is the best because there are a number of good factors that are at play, some volumes carried over from last year that are registered in the first quarter, that have meant the first quarter is good in terms of oil prices, but at the same time, the groundwork made in the first quarter will make it possible for us to look into the future with confidence in terms of the entire 2012. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Dinh (06:13). Welcome to Hong Kong. Thanks for the presentation. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Dinh Quang from CIBC (06:25). I have two questions. The first question is related to Asia, to China. I know you're expecting to increase your output from Uzbekistan significantly over next six years and that gas output will be related to the China market. So we want to hear more from you about your strategy toward Asia and, particularly, to China market going forward. And also, we want to know more about the gas deals with Chinese companies and the pipeline arrangement.</p>
          <p>And my second question &#x2013; if you can allow me to finish my full question, okay. My second question is related to your financing needs. As we know &#x2013; we understand this has a huge CapEx requirement in the next 10 years. And at the same time, you intend to maintain a reasonably low gearing level, and also, you just mentioned that you want to further increase your dividend payout dramatically going forward. So within that context, we wonder, is there any possibility for you to raise new equity capital from the stock market? That's the two questions from me. Thank you.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:58) <mark type="audio gap" /> (8:17-10:18) it's true that we expect that we manage to stabilize the situation in Western Siberia. And the annual production volume indicates that this level will remain. And starting this year, there will be a slight increase. Better to say, our current forecast, we <mark type="ph" /> don't <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:44). The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:47) continues to decline, but I believe that the process have partially stopped.</p>
          <p>Regarding gas, we have a clear gas strategy that has three components. First of all, the foreign component, as you understand, it has its own scenario. We're going to speak about it tomorrow. It has its own taxation system and its own pricing mechanism. There is a gas program in the south. You know that the south is the most interesting region in Russia in terms of gas pricing because they have the highest network gas prices, with sixth and seventh level, and the program that was set for the Caspian Sea will be implemented. Furthermore, we conducted a very successful prospecting operations in the two blocks, the Sarmatskoye field, which proved that these two parts of Sarmatskoye is in fact one huge field. And most likely, we will be able to grow our gas production in the south of Russia. And we also have our own capacity.</p>
          <p>Regarding the production in the north of the country, here, we have an agreement with Gazprom that is in effect. Given the fact that the level of production there is stable and the taxation level is also low and the cost of production is very low, these fields have a considerable upside. We are currently continuing additional prospecting work, and there is a strong likelihood that we will be able &#x2013; in addition to dry gas, we also see a potential for liquids, light oil and condensate. Better to say the gas production program we believe is very effective for our company, and the proposals regarding the MET changes will still keep this production very profitable. And even if there is a further increase, there is a considerable differential in the taxation system between oil and gas. And that is why gas is a very promising product for our company.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (13:34-14:00) use the surplus that you will generate in terms of income, free cash flow and so on. Your words into God's ear, as they say. It is true the first quarter was better than we expected, but at the same time, we have to understand that there is &#x2013; when I presented not great results for Q4, I mentioned that you will see that in the first quarter the income that was not generated in Q4 will be transferred to Q1. These are some volumes that we generated in that quarter that was transferred to the first quarter, a favorable ratio of ruble to the dollar, and this made it possible for us to reduce our profit tax.</p>
          <p>But the second quarter is not going to be as rosy in terms of prices because the oil prices are going down. Well, we are hedging considerable volumes, so I don't think that there will be a considerable impact. Most likely, we have to bear in mind that the increasing dollar and the weakening ruble will result in a higher profit tax; it has to go up. And I can tell you right away that Q2 results would not be as great as Q1. But at the same time, I hope that they will be better than our peers.</p>
          <p>Regarding using free cash flow, it is defined by our program. First of all, paying higher dividends, this program will be implemented. And next year, I expect considerable increase in dividend payout relative to this year unless there are major catastrophes in the market. And secondly, a question was asked earlier regarding increasing debts. We will be able to maintain the debt level at a low point. And we'll be honest, we are buying our shares back. We continue this practice in the second and third quarter, we will be able &#x2013; the buyback that we will carry out in that period, it will be a considerable chunk, <mark type="ph" /> available (16:13) volume of shares. That is to say, we are considering a profit in favor of shareholders through dividends and through the buyback program. Despite the good results, the market prices are low, and buying back LukOil shares perhaps is the most attractive proposition for the management of our company.</p>

          <p>Everyone that is on the line on the webcast, you can ask your questions through webcast. We will not be taking questions over the phone because when you sit in the room, it's very difficult sometimes to understand what has been asked. So I would encourage everyone to send their questions by e-mail and through our webpage. Do we have any more questions from the room, because I will switch to Internet questions?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:21-17:29) in the last few weeks, major work has gotten underway. Perhaps this will also be a major theme in your presentation tomorrow, can you mention the main highlights of this budget in the next couple of years?</p>
          <p>It is true I'm going to speak about that in details tomorrow. I can just say that at a recent Board of Directors' meeting that took place two days ago, our strategy was presented and a report was given on the company's international operations. And a major part of this report was work on Western Qurna. Specifically, LukOil completed the PCA contracts with all the contractors, that is to say we contracted virtually all the volumes of work, and the contractors undertake obligations in terms of volumes and timeframe and deadlines. And of course, they provide financial guarantees. A considerable number of the contractors are Asian partners. And we started the drilling of the first two wells. Drilling work is going full speed, and we have virtually addressed all the questions with the state authorities of Iraq with respect to the South Oil Company and the Ministry of Oil of Iraq.</p>
          <p>We are in negotiations with a number of potential partners who would like to enter this project. Perhaps it is early to speak about it, but there is considerable interest also on behalf of some Asian companies. And most likely, before the end of the year, there will be some positive news that you will hear. The project is underway, and the management outlook obviously, have stated that they hope that at the end of 2013, 2014, they will start producing and that will make it possible for our company to generate interesting results.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (20:00-20:15) when can we expect the return of $1.8 billion spent in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> $1.8 billion (20:25) is being spent in the <mark type="ph" /> United States (20:28). <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:26) it's already been done. In the results of the second quarter, you will see in our financial statement that the funds already have been paid back, and this amount will be used <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:54) that these funds will be used for buy back of <mark type="ph" /> all our (20:59) shares. It's a part of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:03).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a question from Alexander Burgansky, Otkritie Capital. Do we have any other questions from webcast right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, tomorrow will be big event by LukOil, and so <mark type="audio gap" /> (21:25-44)...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the question regarding the fate of the shares &#x2013; of the treasury shares that were bought back. As you may know at present, a new taxation law is being implemented including the civic code, and these questions are being raised in the context of that work. We have to wait for this tax code, for the entire package of legislative initiatives to be put together approved by the Russian parliament because there isn't a provision in taxation to cancel such as because there were no huge volumes &#x2013; there are a number of taxation issues arise. It is very likely that one of the ways <mark type="ph" /> to lose (22:29) these shares would be &#x2013; actually, there are partial cancelations. This possibility exists, but we just have to be patient and wait a little bit.</p>
          <p>And we make it no secret that such shares can be used to establish an incentive system for the managers of the company, a special bonus and incentive system. This program is currently being developed by the decision of the board together with our consultant, Ernst &amp; Young. And I believe that by the end of this year, this program will be approved because the existing phantom shares program will end in December, and we will have to propose to the board and the Shareholders' Meeting a new program. We believe this has to be a mixed program that would make it possible for the managers to buy some shares and to obtain some shares from the company so that there is a stronger incentive for the managers to ensure the value of the company and the interest in increased capitalization of the company. The recent practice showed that phantom shares are viewed by most as an additional premium that entails no obligations. If somebody spends his or her own money, it is quite likely that he's going to work in a different way. This is the new ideology that is being used. Some shares that are currently treasury shares will be used to establish special incentive system. [Ends Abruptly]</p>
