      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our annual meeting. With two starting points, two remarks. The financial crisis doesn't look to have deterred a lot of bankers that I see here. Healthy and wealthy bankers, welcome to all of you.</p>
          <p>The financial crisis has not impacted on our business and we're here to demonstrate what is the theme of our presentation. We have a resilient, growing, cash generating company to offer to all of you. Today Luigi, who is our Chief Financial Officer here, will present the robust set of 2009 results, which we have delivered to all of our stakeholders and stakeholders despite the challenging economic environment world wide. We are pleased to report continued growth in our profitability, improved balance sheet strength which has enabled us to provide stable, high-yielding dividends for all of our shareholders. After Luigi's presentation, I will take you through the key points of our 2010, 2014 plan with details on Endesa outlined by Andrea Brentan, who is acting as CEO of the company.</p>
          <p>Also I'm pleased to confirm that together with Luigi, Andrea and myself, we have here our Chairman Mr. Piero Gnudi, there he is, Mr. Borja Prado, the Chairman of Endesa, a lot of directors of the company and board members. The divisional managers will be available of course to take on any questions you might have during the presentation.</p>
          <p>Now, let me start with the presentation here. There it goes. I would like to start by reminding you the position that Enel has achieved in the international energy markets. I'm proud to say, Enel is now one of the largest European and International electricity and gas player.</p>
          <p>The transformation we have undergone in recent years has given us five core strengths, which I believe position us very well for the future. We gain a leading position in our core markets thanks to our strong domestic business, combined with our International expansion strategy. We continue to demonstrate strong operational performance across all markets, with focus on efficiencies. We have significantly strengthened our financial position thanks to our successful rights issue and recent bond issuance.</p>
          <p>With the successful integration of Endesa, we have completed the transformational path of the Group, which will enable us to fully focus on our future priorities. Our technological and geographical mix gives us strong resilience against economic cycles, and therefore we are well positioned to develop future organic growth opportunities as market conditions improve. The Group robust performance in 2009 is evidence that we are delivering on our strategy despite challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>With this accomplishment, Enel continues to look towards the future. We have developed the strategy that will present new opportunities, which we believe will place Enel at the forefront of the industry over the next five years.</p>
          <p>Now, in particular, our vision can be summed up in the five key priorities that you see indicated in this chart. First, we will maintain our leadership position in our core markets, where we have developed an integrated presence along the energy value chain. In particular, we will focus on our domestic markets, Italy and Iberia as well as Latin America, Russia, Slovakia, Romania, France and all of our existing geographies in renewables. They will continue to be the target of our select investments, aimed at maintaining our cost leadership and the best practices sharing.</p>
          <p>Second, as far as consolidation and integration is concerned, we will leverage on organic investments to enhance our leadership position, as well as on a relevant synergies program to extract value from our operations.</p>
          <p>Third, we will continue to invest in efficiency improvements and cost-savings initiatives, keeping service quality for our customer base of more than 61 million customers worldwide a must.</p>
          <p>Fourth, renewables will continue to be a key pillar on our strategy. We will strengthen our footprint through the integration of Endesa's renewables assets into Enel Green Power, as we will explain later during the presentation. Moreover, we will continue to promote new technologies, investing in particular in carbon capture sequestration, hydrogen, solar, smart grids, emobility while preparing the grounds for the forthcoming nuclear era in Italy.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, we will continue to implement initiatives aimed at ensuring our financial stability, cash flow improvement, CapEx optimization and asset disposals will allow us to confirm our commitment to reduce net debt and maintain our A credit rating.</p>
          <p>To discuss all of these items in greater detail, let's start with our leadership in strategic markets.</p>
          <p>Enel has selected the market highlighted here as a key to the execution of the strategy. To maintain our leadership in the areas of thermal generation, supply and distribution of energy, the Group will continue to invest in improving the mix of technologies and the quality of services to the end customers. Moreover, we will enhance the technological standard of the networks leveraging on innovative solutions such as smart grids.</p>
          <p>As of today, Enel benefits from a technological mix which is already about 45% CO2 free. In this regard, we will continue to utilize a unique combination of assets across geographies with the aim to invest both in free CO2 technologies and innovative energy sources. Thanks to this mix, Enel is already prepared to cope with past 2012 CO2 challenges.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to our second key priority, consolidation and integration. Our cumulative investment program has been fervently revised as respect to the old plan, mainly due to a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. In this program, we'll continue to include projects which we consider key pillars of our margin growth even in an unfavorable economic cycles. These projects are mainly in Italy's things like clean coal and gas mainstream facilities, renewables and some initial nuclear initiatives.</p>
          <p>In Spain and Latam, focus on renewables and efficiency projects for the plan. In Russia, CCGTs and gas extraction in networks. In the areas where we are already present, maintenance investments will continue to prioritize service quality and customer care. Let me also underline that this program, in case of further slowdown in demand, will offer us flexibility at the tune of three billion euros for project that can be either cancelled, postponed, without compromising our profitability during this plan.</p>
          <p>Moving on to integration, let me underline the integration program with Endesa is noteworthy in terms of speed of execution and total benefits achieved so far. In fact, as of the end of 2009, we have already recorded about 500 million euros of synergies, real ones &#x2013; hard ones, which is about 13% better than the original target, by the way.</p>
          <p>We also involved, in this program, 14 areas of improvement, both at Enel and Endesa, and more than 30 initiatives in which we are currently working on assessing potential for further improvements. With that in mind, I'm pleased to confirm on commitments to increase our 2012 target to more than one billion euro of higher cash contribution generated from our EBITDA and CapEx optimization.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the third pillar of our strategy, operational excellence. We will continue to focus our efforts on both working capital optimization and operating expenses. At the end of 2009, we reduced our cumulative working capital by 600 million euros, which is 448 million higher than the first nine months of the year. We also achieved, so far, an EBITDA improvement of about 430 million, of which 200 million are recurring. This cumulates at about 830 up to 2011 &#x2013; 830 million, I mean.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we continue to remain committed to developing this program which not only improves cash flows but also serve as an industrial tool to implement best-in-class processes, such as international best practice sharing, procurement activities, customer management and lean operations, amongst other. On top of this, let me underline that Endesa is also developing its own Zenith program which will deliver about 240 million cash available by 2012.</p>
          <p>Let's look, now, at the fourth key priority, renewables and innovation. After the recently-announced integration of Endesa's Spanish renewable assets into EGP, we have completed the process of consolidating all of the Group's main renewable activities into one single unit. In particular, I'm proud to state that we have created a robust industrial player, which will have a key role in both the economies of Italy and Spain.</p>
          <p>The numbers indicated in this charts give you a clear picture of what EGP is today, one of the world's largest renewable operators in terms of production and installed capacity. EGP will build up its future on a diversified geographical presence with a unique mix of large-scale renewable technologies, not only wind and mini-hydro but also geothermal and solar. The combination of all of this results in a good hedge versus regulatory changes and ultimately in the stability of cash flows that sustain growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, EGP has further increased its flexibility, enhancing its pipeline from 21.7 gigawatt to 30.6 gigawatt, therefore creating to itself an important chance to capture new opportunities. An additional expansion of 3.5 gigawatt is already planned during the plan.</p>
          <p>Following slide &#x2013; well, this is something I'm particularly proud to report back to you, innovation. Among our aims, I want to underline our commitment in continuing to develop all technologies connected to the CO2 capture and storage, oxycombustion, high-efficiency coal plants, hydrogen and thermodynamic solar with the Archimede project.</p>
          <p>On top of this, we believe that the future of the world will rely more and more on the proactive management of electricity grids. That is why we decided to be the pioneers in the deployment of digital electricity meters. The future will be continuing deployment of digital electricity meters, mainly in Spain and Latam, implementing smart grids and demand side management, enabling e-mobility and developing nuclear projects.</p>
          <p>My take in this is that electricity power is the solution for most of our demand in growth of economies and welfare. And for that reason, we strongly support research and development projects up to the point of allocating one billion euros to support innovation in the next five years. Once again, it is Enel's goal to be at the forefront of the deployment of possible industrial initiatives to improve the quality of life of our communities and to enhance our long-term profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to our final key strategic priority, financial stability. First, financial stability for us basically means delivering cash flow optimization and the disposal plan that we are committed to back in March 2009. Let me recap what we have already done. The combination of the sale of the Italian high-voltage grid, 80% stake in a gas low-pressure network, 50% stake in our upstream gas project in Russia, as well as other minor disposals in Latin America, have allowed us to raise 3.2 billion, both in terms of cash and the net debt deconsolidation.</p>
          <p>Also, we confirm our commitment to generate about 7 billion of cash or further net debt reduction by the end of this year. In addition to the disposal of the minority stake in Enel Green Power, which I will discuss in more details in the next slide, we continue to work on the disposal of the Spanish high-voltage grid. At this regard, let me update you by indicating that we have opened the data room and the due diligence process that is undergoing is almost close to finish. Therefore, I do expect the disposal to be completed before the end of June &#x2013; this June.</p>
          <p>With regard to other non-strategic asset disposal, we have started the tender offer for our operation in Bulgaria and we have already received for that specific very well-performing asset unsolicited indication of interest. Also, we have just signed the agreement with Mytilineos Group to sell the Endesa's Greek operations for a total consideration of 140 million. Other peripheral assets are earmarked for disposal, and this will be disclosed, when appropriate, during the year.</p>
          <p>Let me move, now, to the disposal minority stake in EGP. I would like to confirm that this is our intention, here, to dispose of this stake by the end of 2010, by 2010 at the latest. Obviously, the latest includes the earliest and we'll do our best in this regard.</p>
          <p>In particular, given our current market condition and the overall market conditions, we believe that an IPO represents the preferred option for maximizing value for shareholders. In fact, we're now working on the filing of the offering documents which should occur by the end of April. This may be the reason why a lot of bankers are showing up this morning. No surprise, welcome. The beauty parade will be starting soon. After this, the listing of EGP in Milan and Madrid will be implemented during the year.</p>
          <p>In parallel with this process, we continue to maintain contacts with potential strategic investors with an industrial vision. I stress, with an industrial vision, we're not looking for financial partners. At this regard, let me underline that, while we cannot exclude potential opportunities arising from the above contacts, the above-mentioned contacts, we're now opening the IPO process maintaining &#x2013; still maintaining the potential combination of the two options.</p>
          <p>Now, before handing over to Luigi for the 2009 results, let me summarize the impact of all the strategic actions that I've just tried to report back to you.</p>
          <p>Combined actions on the Zenith program, the synergies between Enel and Endesa will contribute to cumulative consolidated operating cash flow of about 65 billion euros through 2014. This cash flow will support our investment program, the debt service and the dividends paid to the Group's minorities and to Enel's shareholders. In terms of dividends, let me confirm that we will continue to distribute 60% of our net ordinary income.</p>
          <p>The balance between free cash flow from operations and the positive contribution of our disposal plan will lead to a net cash available for the debt reduction of about 12 billion by the end of 2014. All of this will allow the Groups to target a consolidated net debt of about 39 billion by the end of 2014, while maintaining our A category essential to our strategy.</p>
          <p>Let me hand it over to Luigi for the results and all of the details of those results. Luigi, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before going into the 2009 number in details, let me underline not only the robustness and resilience of our results but also the strong and active management undertaken during 2009 focused both on reduction and requalification of our net debt. You will see the effects of all of these later on in my presentation but I would like to emphasize that neither debts nor liquidity is an issue for this Group.</p>
          <p>Also, let me remind you that, in the first &#x2013; second half 2009, Endesa results are fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis. But now let's have a look at the numbers. First, I am going to give you some financial highlights, then I will take you through the 2009 financial results ending with our current long-term debt maturity profile.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA net of non-recurring items, increased by 10.5% to about 15.6 billion euro, or 2.3% up considering second half with Endesa consolidated at 67%. 2009 Group net income of about 5.4 billion euro includes mainly the positive contribution of some extraordinary items for a total amount of about 1.4 billion euro. The most significant ones are the following. 970 million euro Acciona put option, 295 million euro capital gain related to the assets sold to Terna, 68 million euro capital gain related to the SeverEnergia stake sold to Gazprom.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you, again, that these amounts are not to be included in the ordinary income and therefore are not to be considered as part of our dividend. Excluding extraordinary items, Group net income is approximately 4 billion, 9% up versus last year.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to the following chart, EBIT increased by 12.7% due to higher EBITDA partially balanced by higher D&amp;A for changes in the consolidation mainly of Endesa, OGK-5 and Muntenia in Romania.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges decreased to 1.7 billion euro. This is mainly the effect of higher income resulting from the fair value of Acciona put option for 970 million euro recorded at the end of this &#x2013; during this year, lower interest charges of 362 million mainly due to lower average debt and lower cost of debt, which was 5% at the end of December.</p>
          <p>The Group's tax rate increased from 9.2% in 2008 to 27.8% in 2009. On a normalized basis, 2009 tax rate would be equal to 32.6% or 1% less than last year.</p>
          <p>Before going through the EBITDA composition, on chart number 16, you will find an update on our hedging strategy, in particular on forward electricity sales. In Italy, we have hedged 100% of our 2010 production at an average base load price of 75 euro per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>As regards 2011, we have hedged 20% at an average base load price of around 75 euro per megawatt hour and we have also a contracted portfolio of no price-sensitive customers, which are about to be automatically renewed during 2010 for another 20% at premium price against market conditions. That is again 75 euro per megawatt hour. This is the results of ordinary rolling over commercial condition we are recognizing to our customer base.</p>
          <p>As far as Spain is concerned, we are 100% hedged for 2010 and about 40% for 2011, improving the total amount hedged versus last year that, let me remind you, at this point in time was only 25% for 2010. The average price for 2010 is in the range of 50, 55 euro per megawatt hour and for 2011 is higher than the Spanish forward curve.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we are about 70% hedged for 2010 and 65% for 2011. Finally, in Slovakia, we are 100% hedged for 2010 and 55% for 2011, nearly doubling the amounts hedged versus last year. This has been obtained at an average price equal to 53 euro per megawatt hour for 2010 and about 57 for 2011.</p>
          <p>All of this will help to explain our EBITDA evolution in chart number 17, which gives you an overview of all of our operations. I will go through the EBITDA of each of our division in detail starting from GEM, Generation and Energy Management Italy on chart number 18.</p>
          <p>The generation margin increased by 243 million euro, mainly due to forward contracts and a more favorable fuel mix, which have more than offset the decline in volumes. The improvement of 78 million euro in trading margin is the result of favorable gas sourcing, mainly recorded during the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>The margin in the ancillary services has decreased by 211 million euro, largely because of lower electricity demands. Additional items are negative for 322 million euro and they refer to the capital gain of the assets sold to Trento last year for a total consideration of 328 million euro.</p>
          <p>Let's, now, briefly look at the fuel cost evolution on the following chart. Net of ancillary service, the UE margin in the domestic or thermal generation increased to 28 euro per megawatt hour from 23 euro per megawatt hour in 2008, so 5 euro per megawatt hour up, mainly due to our forward sales, commodity hedging activities and the start of the operation of the clean coal second units in Torre Nord in the unit close to Rome.</p>
          <p>The overall generation unit margin net of ancillary services is about 46 euro per megawatt hour versus 37 of last year, mainly thanks to the increase in the hydro production.</p>
          <p>In the annexes you have details of the EBITDA evolution regarding our market Services and Holding division, while I'm now highlighting our domestic Infrastructure and Networks division on the following chart. Well, EBITDA totaled almost 4 billion euro in this division with an increase of about 7% versus last year. The main items are the following.</p>
          <p>The increase of 39 million euro in the energy price &#x2013; in the energy margin, mainly due to positive price components; lower connection fees of 58 million euro, mainly due to the unfavorable economic environment. In the future, we will not be anymore affected by this reduction since the authority has recently introduced a mechanism that recovers distributors from possible losses they might incur in 2010 and in 2011 having as a reference the connection fee amounts of 2006.</p>
          <p>As far as other is concerned, bear in mind that we recorded 295 million euro capital gain from the sale of the high voltage grid to Terna.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the following chart on international operation, well, here we have an EBITDA of about 1.4 billion euro with an increase of 36% versus last year, or 30% net of the capital gain of the disposal of SeverEnergia, which is equal to 68 million euro. The results of this strong performance are substantially the following.</p>
          <p>In the Centrel area we continue to see an increasing contribution from our Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne, which in this year has totaled 100 million euro of positive variance versus last year. Let me also stress the total EBITDA of this company has been equal to 826 million euro at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Russia contributed for 176 million euro in the period, of which 68 million euro related to the SeverEnergia capital gain, as I said before, and 100 million euro to the OGK-5. In OGK-5, the unit energy margin improved both in power and capacity markets.</p>
          <p>But, before moving on to the following division, let's have a quick look at the Russian activities on the following chart, number 22. OGK-5 reported in 2009 an EBITDA of 183 million euro, or 50% up versus last year. This is basically the result of a higher unit margin due to higher tariffs, increasing capacity payments and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Endesa results in the following chart again. First of all, let me remind you that the numbers we report in these slides included the decrease in the Iberian operation result from the application of the Enel Group accounting principles.</p>
          <p>Let's analyze the business now. In Iberia, the hedging strategy with customer that has supported unitary revenues at level of about 60 euro per megawatt hour, the removal of CO2 clawback as well as a very competitive unitary electricity cost have substantially offset the decline in generation volumes showing an &#x2013; basically a zero growth or in line with last year.</p>
          <p>In Latin America in the Generation business, the unit margin improvement in Chile, the higher sale price in Colombia and the higher hydro outputs in Peru more than balanced lower prices in Argentina and Brazil. Taking into account all of these effects, Generation business EBITDA grew by about 14% versus last year.</p>
          <p>In the distribution business, the combined effect of some negative regulatory changes in Chile, coupled with a negative currency conversion rate, have been partially offset by the positive contribution of Brazil.</p>
          <p>And, now, let's review Enel Green Power on chart number 24. Before entering into details, let me underline that these are EGP figures on a stand-alone basis, which differ from the ones reported in Enel's financial statements due to some consolidation adjustments and other effects.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight, again, that EGP results have been very positive, showing a 6% increase versus 2008. More specifically, the growth components are, 52 million euro from Italy, mainly driven by higher production, 14 million euro from the Americas, a slight decline in Iberia, mainly because of the decrease in the average energy price in Spain, and 8 million improvement in the other operation in the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>And, now, we remain focused on Enel Green Power, let me spend few words about the integration of the Spanish assets that we have just announced this morning, and I am on the following chart. As you know, we have substantially completed &#x2013; or started to finalize the integration process of all the Spanish renewable assets into one single entity in Spain.</p>
          <p>In this regards, we have outlined a reorganization that you see represented in this chart. In particular, the Iberian assets will be managed through a company 60% controlled by Enel Green Power and 40% by Endesa, and fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis by Enel Green Power. The new company will manage all present and future renewable activities in the Iberian market.</p>
          <p>This successful implementation process will allow Enel Green Power to enhance its position in the Spanish renewal market capturing also higher EBITDA and organic growth opportunities, mainly thanks to the new pipeline now headed up. We believe that such reorganization shows our capability to generate value through integration and exploitation of synergies.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned you'll see in the next chart that our overall net debt stood at about 50.9 billion euros at the end of 2009. The main items on net debt evolution are the following, on the negative side we recorded mainly the acquisition of a further 25% stake in Endesa for about 12 billion euros including 100% debt consolidation and the renewable assets sold to Acciona. On the positive side, first the rights issue for 8 billion euros, about 3.2 billion euros from the delivered asset disposal and about 2.2 billion euro from the extra-peninsular tariff deficit reclassification.</p>
          <p>To conclude, let me give you a quick update on where we stand in terms of maturity profile of our long-term debt. Well, the successful European and US dollar institutional bond, as well as the retail bond issuance, just finalized, has led us to achieve the desired effect of diversifying our credit investor base, shift the focus from bank loans to bonds as a long-term structural way of financing our long-term assets, lengthening the average maturity of long-term debt and securing an adequate fixed/floating rate ratio.</p>
          <p>In addition to our well-spread maturity profile, our liquidity position is supported by the availability of committed credit line aimed at serving management of working capital taking also into account cash and cash equivalents, our Group liquidity position amounts to 21 billion euros.</p>
          <p>Also, let me add that 7 billion euros of these committed credit lines currently available are maturing in 2010. This is why we are already considering their renegotiation in order to use them as a backup treasury tool with no intention, whatsoever, to finance long-term activities.</p>
          <p>Finally, the expected cash in from disposal and the tariff deficit accrued by Endesa will further strengthen our consolidated liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now let me hand over to Fulvio Conti for the strategic plan 2010-2014.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luigi. Let me now move into our strategic plan by division. I think, first, we have to discuss the assumption. We have indicated to you back in March last year a demand assumption which has not yet shown to be the right one. We are revising it to reflect the current market consensus. As you might remember, we projected for 2009 a demand growth of adjusted 0.3%. Indeed, it was beaten by actual. Actual was minus 4.5%. I concede that that has happened but this has not deterred our performance. Even though we have reduced the volumes, we have increased the results.</p>
          <p>Now, on the new demand assumption that you see reported over here, which I do believe is meeting market consensus, is considering a gradual recovery moving from a bare minimum recorded in 2009. This recovery trend has been confirmed, by the way, by the first two months of the year where we have seen demand increasing to the tune of 2% in Italy, 3% in Spain, 7% in Russia, and so forth and so on.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the Italian operations first. This is very, very important for all of you analysts that you've been asking the same question over the last 10 years, and I've been responding to you Italy is an island and I will continue to report to you that Italy is an island. Let me explain the reason why it is an island.</p>
          <p>The Italian wholesale power market is influenced by the evolution of gas price and by the remuneration of the investment in power generation, spark spread, all of you analysts, you know better than me. Gas oversupplies conditions of 2009 did not have any impact on 2009 power price in Italy. As a matter of fact, the decrease in power price against 2008 was only a direct consequence of the drop in the oil price, being Italian gas price based on long-term supplies directly linked to oil pricing. We do not expect major changes from this point of view in the future years.</p>
          <p>As European gas spot prices which, as you know, have been suffering significant decrease in 2009, are not impacting the Italian long-term gas supply contracts, spot market in Italy accounts for only few percentage points out of the total consumption. The Italian generation mix is also characterized by few &#x2013; very few coal plants, ours. And very expensive technologies, like oil and gas plants, our competitors.</p>
          <p>Since 2003, about 23 gigawatt of new CCGT capacity has been built or refurbished in Italy. Now, 50% of the Italian generation is based on CCGTs. This obviously compares negatively versus countries like France and Germany, where cheap sources like nuclear and coal ignite generation is accounting for more than 70%.</p>
          <p>In short, once more, one more year, let me repeat, Italian mix drives the generation cost of our country above Western European prices. It's a fact of life, my friends. Even though the CCGT investment is closing to an end, as a matter of fact, recently built CCGTs plants continue to have a fundamental role, as working &#x2013; as they are working as <mark type="inaudible" /> capacity. And as a consequence, being most of the time marginal technology in the system, they had to take the price for it.</p>
          <p>Based on the current forward oil price, standard CCGT pure variable cost will stay in the range of 60 euros per megawatt hour. And this will be, again, in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Power price are usually aligned to cost. Since CCGTs have been built in the last eight years, it is reasonable to expect that the Italian price will remunerate also the capital cost of these power plants as opposed to, for instance France and Germany, where most of the thermal power plants are all fully depreciated. This is why, one more reason, we believe that a robust spark spread premium is foreseeable in the Italian market, versus Western European markets.</p>
          <p>This behavior of the market has been confirmed by the last 12 months. On a rolling basis, you take the last 12 months and you seek through what has been the spread. Well, no surprise, the spark market during these last 12 rolling months, delivered a base load spark spread above 17 euros per megawatt hour. I don't think I need to define what a spark spread is to all of you.</p>
          <p>In the medium long-term, we expect Italian power prices to be aligned to full cost of a new CCGT delivering sound, clean base load spark spread in the range of 16, 18 euros per megawatt hour. And this is the 11th year I'm debating with you this point.</p>
          <p>Coming to our activities in the free retail market, we are strengthening our position both in the power sector, where we maintain a market share of around 70%, and in the gas sector, where we have grown to a market share of around 15%. Our strategic focus will be to increase our customer base by more than 1 million customers per year leveraging on residential clients, small medium enterprises and leveraging on dual energy sales all of this grand resilience and margin protection. And this will be achieved thanks to continuous improvement quality and efficiency in operations.</p>
          <p>Regarding Infrastructure and Networks, we will continue to be focused on OpEx and CapEx optimization and high quality standards. This will go together with maintaining our leadership position in technological innovation. Through smart grids we will enable renewables integration, energy efficiency program and electric mobility.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to the international operations. Our core geographical areas are Slovak Republic, Russian Federation, Romania, France and these countries are going to remain key in the deployment of our CapEx program. In particular, in France, we'll continue to expand our nuclear activities by participating in the EPR projects with EDF, with a total investment of about 275 million euros during the period. In addition, we will continue to increase our supply market share with a target to sell almost 11 terawatt hours by 2014.</p>
          <p>In Romania, we'll continue to invest, to improve quality standards of the electricity grid being focused on customer satisfaction and sharing of the Group's best practices.</p>
          <p>Let me be a bit more specific about Slovak Republic and Russia. Let me start with Russia first. In Russia, we will invest about 1 billion euros over the period, mainly in improving our generation mix through the building of two new CCGT plants for a total net capacity of 800 megawatts. These new plant will partially benefit from a very competitively priced equity gas coming from our upstream division SeverEnergia. We expect to deliver the first gas out of SeverEnergia by 2011 and to ramp up production of equity gas up to six billion cubic meters a year at peak.</p>
          <p>By the way, let me also announce that we have decided to create a corporate unit fully focused on developing upstream gas for the benefit of the whole Group. And this year it will also manage operations of SeverEnergia asset and we have Marco Arcelli who is leading this unit for us. On the regulatory side, the new long-term capacity payment mechanism will allow us to remain committed to our profitability target, even in a challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>By the way, as I say, energy consumption is increasing 7% for the first two months of the year. This is a good sign. This is because the payment based on capacity install and not on energy production. Based on capacity, not on production gives us an additional push towards that country.</p>
          <p>Let me underline that the Russian market continues its path towards increasing gas price to the net back level, which is expected to be reached by 2015. And we take a conservative view about it. In particular, as of today, average market gas price stands at euros 47.6 per thermal cubic meter &#x2013; 1,000 cubic meter, sorry.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the liberalization process is well on track, and today 60% of the electricity market, excluding residential consumptions, has been already liberalized. Within this framework our investments in new CCGT will benefit of the higher margins in a market where prices are and will be settled by gas open cycles, less efficient technologies. In summary, Russia will continue to be a key market for us and delivery of growth will be mainly the result of commitment to efficiency CapEx.</p>
          <p>Let me move to Slovak Republic, so Slovakia. In Slovakia we are completing the upgrade program on Units 3 and 4 of the Bohunice nuclear plant, increasing capacity from 858 megawatt to 956 megawatt. By the end of 2010, the plant's capacity will be further enlarged up to 1,000 megawatts.</p>
          <p>Investment for the completion for Unit 3 and 4 at Mochovce nuclear plant continues to be a key priority. We expect the first 440 megawatts at Unit 3 to become available at the end of 2012 and the remaining Unit 4 during 2013. Our total capacity addition with these two new groups will be 1,000 megawatts.</p>
          <p>Our planned global investment in Slovak Republic for the period is about 2.8 billion. All of these actions will allow us to reduce capacity constraints in that specific area and, therefore, to strengthen our position in the Centrel region. In addition, we will continue to reduce outages and optimizing maintenance to maximize the competitiveness of our generation fleet.</p>
          <p>To conclude on Slovakia, let me underline how this acquisition represents a good example on how integration and consolidation is generating value for our stakeholders. Let me remind you that in about three years we have more than doubled both the EBITDA and the enterprise value of this company.</p>
          <p>Let me comment now on Enel Green Power operations. Well, renewable energy has experienced relevant growth over the recent years in the entire world. As you know, at the end of 2009, there have been 1,230 gigawatt of renewable capacity installed worldwide. We expect this growth to continue in the future, to take place in all geographies. Europe, North America and Asia, we will lead the path.</p>
          <p>With particular reference to North America, the Obama administration is generating a very strong impact on the development of this business. And we and Enel North America are already taking benefits during 2009 of this new policy. Having said that we strongly believe that a well-balanced technological mix is preferable to a mono-technology portfolio, I will continue to purport the case of Enel Green Power as a well-positioned company to attract and appeal investors.</p>
          <p>Enel Green Power relies on the wind and solar photovoltaic to push growth and on geothermal and hydro to capture opportunities, while we'll continue to generate robust cash flows. Furthermore, our asset base could provide a strong and stable cash flow and to our pipeline will give an optionality lever.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in a time featured by credit market's tightness, our growth over the period will be funded by operating cash flows. More specifically, our investment will be mainly focused on increasing wind and solar capacity, reaching 9.2 gigawatt in 2013, 2014, with a total investment of more than five billion euros, 5.1 as a matter of fact.</p>
          <p>Innovation, again, will play a particular important role, a key role; in particular in the field of thermal, solar and concentrated photovoltaic. Things like the Archimedes Project will prove it. EGP will spend on its own, in addition to what we are spending as a group, about 50 million euros in R&amp;D projects. On top of this, we'll complete our vertical integration process in the field of solar photovoltaic, mainly thanks to the long-term industrial partnership with Sharp.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude that Enel Green Power is for Enel, the company that represents means to deal with general favorable trend for world &#x2013; renewable worldwide. In other words, to us, Enel Green Power is one of the key drivers which will generate future growth for the entire Enel Group.</p>
          <p>Now, let me over to Andrea for detailed focus on Endesa strategy. Andrea, would you take the floor please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me give you an outlook now regarding Endesa's operation in Spain, in Iberia and in Latin America over the period 2010-2014. And let's start by looking at Iberia, in particular Spain at the major market drivers that will characterize the next period of time.</p>
          <p>Demand will grow at a lower rate than before the crises. We're planning for something like 2% per year, compound, over the period, so that the levels of demand of the pre-crisis times will be reached before the end of this period.</p>
          <p>There will be a continuous addition of high amounts of renewable capacity to the system. What we have in our plan is something around an addition of some 2,000 megawatts of new renewable capacity per year, over this period. Thermal gap, as a consequence of these things, will probably remain at low levels to 2014. And based on our fuel scenarios, the prices, the spot prices, the pool electricity prices will increase mildly to reach a level of some 55 euros per megawatt hour in 2013, 2014.</p>
          <p>Let's now look a little bit at the main drivers in regulation. In generation, life extension, or better the extension of the operational licenses of the plant will have to be granted over this period of time. Nuclear capacity is a crucial technology for the Spanish system as far as competitivity is concerned, as far as security of supply and of course sustainability is concerned.</p>
          <p>Regarding the domestic coal promotion, we'll have to see to it that the final approval, which is now due by Brussels on the decree which has been published, minimizes market distortion and includes a fair compensations for the technologies involved.</p>
          <p>Then also during this period and as soon as possible, new capacity payment levels for thermal capacity, which is needed to back up renewable capacity, will have to be put in place. Concerning distribution, the decree of 2008 will have to be put completely in place, whereby remuneration scheme will be based on the actual needed investments.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, this will be the period of implementing the main principles of the famous deficit decree of 2009, and that is, first of all, a quick securitization of the past deficit and also the right increases of the excess tariffs. So that, starting on January 1, 2013, there will be no generation of new deficit.</p>
          <p>increases of the excess tariffs. So that, starting on January 1, 2013, there will be no generation of new deficit.</p>
          <p>Taking into account all of this, our strategy to address this challenging environment, will focus on regulatory management, of course, a continuous improvement of our efficiency, the confirmation of our integrated strategy in generation and sales. The renewable part has been already abundantly covered.</p>
          <p>I said continuous focus on efficiency is very important. Actually it is crucial to confirm over the period our good performances. I'd like to mention a couple of our major projects in this respect. The first one, our distribution efficiency improvement project, which aims at a target of a cash cost per customer below 90 euros by 2014 through a CapEx optimization, through an OpEx optimization, through a streamlining of our organization and a streamlining of our workforce. Of course, a very important part of this project is the joint digital meter project which we have undergone together with Enel.</p>
          <p>The second project I'd like to mention is our nuclear performance improvement project, whereby we target an availability of our nuclear power plants by the end of this period of 91% as well as achieving security indicators among world top positions and becoming the reference operator.</p>
          <p>There are a number of other very important projects. The synergy projects, which have been already their quantitative aspects presented, the application of the Zenith methodology to reduce our costs which has already allowed us to target for the year 2012 a saving of 239 million euros a year, the continuous systematic effort of best practice sharing, which is going on between Enel and Endesa, and in particular the provisions that have been taken to optimize our overall position in various fields of energy management.</p>
          <p>Let me expand a little bit on our integrated strategy in generation and sales. On the left side of the picture, you can see that our plan is to increase by 3.1% per year over the period our sales, by keeping our leadership position, our 42% market share in the liberalized market to 78 terawatt hours in 2014 while our generation is planned to grow at 2.5% a year over the period, to achieve 64 terawatt hours in 2014.</p>
          <p>We will maintain, of course, our cost leadership position in the sector in Spain over the period. We have had a very good, let's say, position in our margin optimization, which will continue through, let's say, first of all, the continuous rollover of our solid and very wide sales portfolio and at the same time, the effective hedging of our positions while optimizing our energy purchases on the pool.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea, today our planned output for the current year 2010 has been completely hedged and at the present time, approximately 40% of our foreseen output for next year has been also completely hedged.</p>
          <p>If we now go to the next chart, let's take a look at our generation development through the period. We will be adding capacity to the system by completing the two combined cycles of Besos in Catalonia and of Tejo in Portugal, which are today at a very advanced stage of construction. And on the islands, we will be adding 550 megawatts. Most of them also are already under construction.</p>
          <p>Our generation costs will continue to be very competitive. In 2009, 58% of our production of our generation came from low cost and no CO2 emission technology such as hydro and nuclear. This will continue over the period. And as a matter of fact, we project for 2014, a 56% out of these two technologies.</p>
          <p>Also, our ordinary regime fuel cost, which has been 19 euros per megawatt hour in 2009 versus 24 for the sector, will continue, thanks to our very competitive mix in generation but thanks also to our competitive fuel contracts, to our competitive gas contracts in particular, which have competitive prices and which have a very good flexibility as to the use and the destination of the gas. And of course, we will continue to enjoy and to manage our high value, clean developed mechanism for CO2 emission rights.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Latin America, where there will be a &#x2013; there is, as a matter of fact, a very positive economic and financial outlook. As a matter of fact, the general &#x2013; the countries where we operate there have had a lower impact of the economic crisis than the other countries and have started already a decisive recovery of the situation. Also, inflation is expected to be stable there, under control, as well as, in general, currencies will be stable. So that on an average basis, we are planning for an average 4% a year growth in demand there, which compares very favorably to most of the other countries.</p>
          <p>Also, regulation will continue to be stable over there and particularly in generation, where, in these countries, the mechanisms of the price remission give the correct price signal to the market, where there is availability of long-term supply contracts, as well as many opportunities to sign short, long, medium term energy supply contracts and where, in general, the right capacity payment schemes are in place. And also in distribution, there is a stable regulatory framework which provides attractive and stable returns and also incentives to achieve operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Our strategy aims at growing organically in this stable, low risk and attractive environment, focusing on efficiency improvements and with the approach to the various countries that I will briefly discuss in a minute.</p>
          <p>But before going into that, let me underline once more the stability, the low risk, of our future margins over there. Starting with the left side of the picture, which represents the fact that today, our planned production, our planned generation for this year has been hedged, has been sold to a level of approximately 70% whereby the similar level for 2011 is 65%. And distribution on top of having a stable regulatory framework, but we have performed already in most of our operations there, the tariff revisions, which are now known, for a rather extended period of time, such as in Colombia for our operations of Codensa and in Ampla in Brazil, where the next reviews are due not earlier than the end of 2013 or beginning of 2014.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that our presence in distribution in Latin America is concentrated in the metropolitan areas where the growth is particularly high and where the potential for drops is very much mitigated. And during the period what we plan for distribution is to add some two million of new customers organically.</p>
          <p>Let's now go into the countries. In Chile, Colombia and Peru, let's say in the Pacific side of our presence there, our strategy is to continue to grow organically, confirming our leadership position, focusing on efficiency improvement and continuing to develop our generation project pipeline.</p>
          <p>Let's start with Chile and, first of all, our thoughts to all those living there for the terrible earthquake that took place on February 27, our thoughts to all our colleagues. Fortunately, there were no injuries or casualties among them. They have been able, at least, to restore in Santiago full operation in few days after the earthquake.</p>
          <p>Concerning the physical damages, the major damages we had in our Bocamina I coal power station, which is in the city of Coronel, which is not far away from Concepcion, where we have, let's say, physical damages to the cooling water system and to the chimney. And we foresee to need, let's say, between three and four months to put that in order. But we have in place a very good insurance package which will allow us to minimize the impact of such a situation on our P&amp;L and on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In Chile, we will be adding capacity for 370 megawatts with the Bocamina II coal power station, imported coal power station, which is at an advanced stage of construction today and which will have a capacity of 370 megawatts. And, of course, during the period, we will continue to develop the large Aysen hydro power plant of a planned capacity overall of 2,700 megawatts in the south of the country. In distribution in Chile, our sales will grow at an annual compound rate of 4.3% over the period and we will add, over the same period, something less than 200,000 new customers organically.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, first of all, in generation, we are developing the Quimbo hydroelectric power plant, which has a total capacity of 400 megawatts, out of which 200 are due in this plan to come on stream before December 31, 2014. And in distribution, our sales will grow at an annual compound rate of more than 4%, adding something less than 500,000 new customers organically, to our customer base.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Peru, in distribution our sales will grow at an annual compound rate of nearly 5% and we will be adding something more than 200,000 new customers organically during that period.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the other two countries where we operate and let's start with Brazil. We fully confirm our interest in the country. Brazil is an interesting, vast expansionally market with a stable regulation in place. All rumors in the media concerning a potential sale of any of our operations there are therefore absolutely false. We will concentrate over the period, on growing organically, particularly in distribution, improving our efficiency in operations and starting the development of a generation project pipeline.</p>
          <p>In distribution, in Brazil, we plan to grow at a rate of slightly below 4% a year adding, over this period, more than 1.1 million customers organically. And in generation, we expect an annual average output in this five years period of something more than 5 terawatts, up to 2014.</p>
          <p>Concerning Argentina, we shall maintain our present operations in the country, which have a limited exposure. Currently, our accounting exposure is of 255 million euros. The country represents, today, something like 1% of the EBITDA of the entire Enel Group. We will continue at aiming at a self-financed business over there. Therefore, Argentina represents a limited exposure operation with, for the future, an upside potential. We will concentrate there on managing the very critical regulatory issues that exist.</p>
          <p>In generation, we expect an annual average output in this five year period of something like 16 terawatts. And we will be adding to our distribution something more than 100 new clients organically at the growth rate average of 3.4% per year.</p>
          <p>And to conclude this presentation, let me give you the key figures concerning our investment program and our EBITDA guidance. The investment plan has been adapted to the new demand expected growth scenario and the level of overall investments during the period has been set at 10.5 billion euros, out of which 35% for expansion and the rest for maintenance.</p>
          <p>Out of this total, something like 59% of these investments will be assigned to the regulated business, in order to continue to expand and to strengthen our networks. I also want to mention that during the period, we will continue with our portfolio optimization and as an example, we just announced the disposal of our Greek operations.</p>
          <p>In relation to EBITDA guidance, Endesa will perform with a steady growth, driven by an increasing contribution from the regulated business. EBITDA will grow from 6.8 billion euros in 2011 to 7.5 billion euros in 2014. This represents approximately a 3% per year growth rate since 2009 on a homogenous basis. And with this, I have concluded my presentation and back to our managing director.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Andrea. Thank you. One more chart to go. The final one. Resilience, growth, cash generation. These are the three themes of our presentation today. So let me conclude with this final chart that sums up what we have been trying to purport our case is all about.</p>
          <p>We are showing to you, over time, that we can deliver. We can deliver results even during tough times like the one we have passed through, 2009 and to some extent, we're still continuing to see in some of the economies where we're present. Deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions is not a factor which should deter our growing path to shareholders' value and it will not. We are committing to a successful deliverance of results, growth, during 2010. And we are here to undertake new commitments for 2011-2014. I would like to underline that the focus of the coming year will be, again, a resilient performance, sustainable dividend policy and a deleveraging, the reduction of our net debt.</p>
          <p>We have never failed to beat our targets and your expectations. I have a personal track record that I will not give it up. I will continue to deliver and I'd rather giving you conservative guidance, than being repentant of coming over here and tell you that I've failed. I have had ten years of experience, never failed, 100% score and I want to maintain this.</p>
          <p>Let me thank you for your attending this meeting this morning and let's open the Q&amp;A session right now. Luca, it's your floor.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Before starting the Q&amp;A, let me remind you that this event is being recorded, including the Q&amp;A session, for the sake of posting it to the website. Also, we have a live webcast now, and therefore, I will be collecting questions from here in this room, but also from colleagues lively connected. So we are ready to start, we have a question there, Antonella?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, hello. My question is mainly on your CapEx plan. The CapEx plan overall is being reduced, but if I look at 2010, 2011, the short term here it remains pretty stable. So I just would like to understand if you cancel some projects, there are other projects, other growth projects that have been introduced? And also, if you can comment on the flexibility of the CapEx plan? If we can see lower CapEx in the shorter term? And the other question is really on your financial structure in the long term. You have a very long and fixed debt. At the end of your plan, you will arrive at two times EBITDA &#x2013; net debt to EBITDA. Do you think this is really your aim, or before getting there, there will be something else? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the last question. I mean would you be patient for a couple of years to repeat that question later on? There is still time ahead of us and I want to seize opportunities, but I'm not adventurous in doing these things. So for the time being, we have completed our transformational path and we are now devoting or integrating the single assets and weight the assets in our favor. That's what we want to do. Got more through less. Seize again. Easy said, a bit more complex to deliver.</p>
          <p>On your first question, you know more than me because you have been &#x2013; for the 10 years, we have been together on this trip, what the industry is all about? The industry is high intense capital, long lead times and delivery. So, it will be foolish and you should not believe those who can tell you that they can throttle up investments on a short term. You can plan reduction if demand is not following your expectation. So my commitment here is to continue to invest in 2010 and '11 on those investments which will give us anyhow, no matter what happens to the consumption level, extra margins because we are beating competitive players. We are beating our competition. If we invest in Russia in combined cycle, no one else is doing it.</p>
          <p>If I can deliver more efficient and higher output out of my plant, I will be taking the advantage of the less efficient open cycle and continue to make money even if the market goes down. So it's a matter of being transparent. I'm telling you that the flexibility is there. We can postpone investments if we see that the demand is not growing. Because it will not make any sense to continue to invest in a plant if you know that you don't need that capacity.</p>
          <p>Now 2010 and 2011, with all due respect, for whoever is doing my business here, whoever comes in the street and tells you that they can throttle on this on already committed investment, will be foolish. So 2010 and '11, basically, take it as they are and then you will have decline on investment. We do see, even during the presentation we indicated to you, that the 29.7 billion euros of investments altogether can be further reduced by at least 3 billion without compromising the 2014 expected landmark of 19 billion, because those will be CapEx which will be coming in stream in 2015, '16, '17 for the next plan.</p>
          <p>So bear with me. I think we have enough of a strong case here to maintain our current investment plan and to offer you that kind of 3 billion flexibility because we have accounted item by item, depending on this scenario of the evolution of demand. And we will be ready to implement that flexibility, should the case be. For the time being, our base assumption is not that, you don't need to. But should the case be, we will be able to do it. I hope that I answered your question.</p>

          <p>Okay, next question? We have a question there? Matija?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Matija Gergolet from Goldman Sachs. I have three questions. The first one was more on the strategy, particularly with regards to Endesa. If we look at your numbers, yes, your Group will be two times net debt over EBITDA. I think that Endesa, looking at your projections, is basically going to be debt free in 2014, assuming that you have tariff deficit securitization.</p>
          <p>We have seen today a first deal between Enel, say Italian group or the Enel Green Power and Endesa Renewables. Should we expect more in the future? And if you can also comment about the minorities out there on Endesa, with a five year view? Which is your business plan view.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regards to your &#x2013; well, actually Italian CapEx, I was looking at the 2.7 billion CapEx plan you have for expansion for Italy. If you can comment what is included there, specifically if you have Porto Tolle and if you have any nuclear CapEx included in the period, even if small, just to give us a bit of flavor about your thinking about nuclear in Italy?</p>
          <p>And last question for the CFO, just looking at the exit year of the business plan, if you can help us on what are you assuming for normalized tax rate and what cost of debt are you assuming for the exit year of your business plan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matija. Endesa. Endesa, as you've seen during the presentation, is obviously considered by us an important pillar. It is the, let me say, acquisition that we have wanted to achieve to make this transformational performance of Enel, long term. And as such has to be considered as a long-term indefinite acquisition that we want to continue to expand in their respective markets, namely in Iberia and Latin America. And that's why Andrea has commented to you what kind of strategy he's following in the individual markets and what kind of CapEx program he is dedicating to it.</p>
          <p>I don't see no reason why we should change that path, including, as we have already stated, I will continue to state in the future, to maintain Endesa as a listed company in the Madrid Stock Exchange, with minorities being obviously more than welcome to continue to accompany Endesa in its growth program and expansion. Further consideration given to the structure will obviously have to take into account the basic principal of Endesa's independence and Endesa's flotation in the stock exchange market for the future. And due respect will always be paid by us to the 8% minority stakeholders in that company.</p>
          <p>When it comes to CapEx in Italy, yes, there are some expansions. Again, our idea is to capture the most of the margins. And you will have seen from my area presentation, it is very important to us to complete our coal, clean coal technology program. So, we'll be finishing &#x2013; we are finishing with the Porto &#x2013; the Torrevaldaliga Nord, sorry, program. And at the same time we'll be, during the year, initiating our Porto Tolle conversion.</p>
          <p>If demand falls down again, as it has happened during 2009, we will have to reconsider that. But today, with the assumption we are taking, we're taking the view that we will be starting the project for Porto Tolle during the plan period. This capacity will not be seen during 2011/14, because it will come on stream later on. But you need to press on with the investment if the demand is supporting that case.</p>
          <p>When it comes to nuclear, I've been preaching for nuclear my entire life. And I will continue to do so. Now, we have been favorably impacted by the decision of the government in Italy to restore nuclear as a given technology for our future. And I will see this as a golden opportunity for Italy to recover a full range of industrial framework and activities to benefit operators and consumers as the example of nuclear renaissance in some countries. Think about United Kingdom. Think about what we're doing in Continental Europe, in places where they're now extending life of existing nuclear plants or reconsidering new plants, like in France, like in possibly in the Central Europe countries, like Slovak Republic where we are building, both in France and Slovak Republic, new power plants.</p>
          <p>There is no point of withholding nuclear from being a player in the technological and generation playing field of Italy.</p>
          <p>Having said all this, are we spending massive money during our plan? The answer is no. We are not. We are not yet, even though the long lead time of nuclear plant is not for this plan. It's not for the 2011-2014 plan. You will see limited amount of expending because we will need to fill our engineers with projects, with engineering, pre-engineering, feasibility studies, siting assessment, all of these things which are important to move forward into the spending in the next plan.</p>
          <p>The next plan will be 2015-2019. And this is when you might be seeing nuclear spending at that point in time. So it's a marginal, really marginal spending out of this. Now, Luigi?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. Well, let me start with your question about the normalized tax rate. Well, when it comes to 2009 numbers, we have reported an average tax rate, a nominal tax rate of 27.8%. The difference between 27.8 and 32% that I mentioned during the presentation is due to the impact of a couple of items, namely the Acciona put option which is not tax effective and the capital gain on the assets sold to Terna. So, if you take out the impact of these two assets, then you end up with 32% normalized flat also for the coming years.</p>
          <p>With regards to the assumption of our financial charges or the financial rate, well, we are assuming something slightly higher than 5% on average. You have also to consider that 80% of our total net debt is now fully hedged or at fixed rates. So therefore, we do not expect any major changes on this side.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Marco Corsiglia, Intermonte. I would have a few questions about the domestic generations in 2010/2011. First of all, the average cost of fuel. How do you expect this to evolve in light of the increasing contribution of Torrevaldaliga Nord?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the ancillary services. Is it possible to have the contribution in 2009? And how do you expect this to evolve in 2010/2011?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on the hydro contribution. How do you expect this to evolve in 2010 in light of the current level of the basins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll try to give you a collective answer, because I think it's important to also see the opinion of Gianfilippo Mancini who is heading &#x2013; or Roberto Renon, who are heading the generation side in Italy. Let me start with the last one, because this is the one I treasure most.</p>
          <p>We take, whenever we plan, a 35 years average precipitation. To give you an idea, we are assuming for 2010, '11, '12, '13, '14, that Italy or Spain or whatever country, will take the same precipitation that in average you have received over the last 35 years. Now, it happens to be the case for 2009 to have received more water. God has been sending more rain than expected. It happens to be the case that the first two months of the year, God is still sending more rain than expected. God is beating the statistics. Should we plan different statistics for that? No. Of course we have a plus. Of course we have an upswing. But this will be for God to decide. So, hold the breath and see the outcome. You will see more positive results maybe.</p>
          <p>On the individual fuels, think about -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the remark regarding ancillary services and I will leave to Gianfilippo Mancini the answer with regards to the fuel. Well, the reported margin on the ancillary services at the end of 2009 has been 600 million euros, showing a decline of 200 million euros versus last year. We believe that this is a floor because we are basically &#x2013; we passed through 2009 with a decline in demand. And clearly when the demand declines, this type of business is not performing as normal. So, we believe that this is a floor. So 600 million euros has been the margin reported again at the end of 2009. Then I leave to Gianfilippo for the fuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. On fuel costs, we reported on 2009 an average cost of our thermal production a bit above &#x2013; a little above 50 euro per megawatt hour. Our expectation for 2010 and 2011, according to the forward prices for commodities and our scenario for commodities which are quite similar, are in the range of a few euros below that figure. And this is mainly due not to the price in commodities, but due to the fact that we expect to have very strong contribution in terms of reduction of cost from our Torre Nord power station particularly, where we will report additional 10 terawatt hour of production as compared to 2009 at an average cost, variable cost in the range of 20 euro per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>So, we will basically see 20 euro per megawatt hour in cost of generating electricity through clean coal power station, roughly 30 euro when you go to conventional coal and, as we said before, we foresee a price for gas which leaves the cost of generation for CCGT in the range of 60 euro per megawatt hour.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have Alberto Gandolfi there. Will you please stand up? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Alberto Gandolfi from UBS. I have three questions, please. First one, on slide five you were showing your CapEx reduction. I see your maintenance is going down from 3.2 to 2.4 billion despite the asset growth and despite the depreciation of about five billion. So can you comment how you're going to achieve these? Is it sustainable? And wouldn't it be detrimental at some stage to your EBITDA and cash flow generation, particularly on regulated activities? Secondly, can you please elaborate on how much pre-tax profit and how much net income you think you're going to lose from your seven billion disposal? And are you considering that when you're providing your target?</p>
          <p>And lastly, again on generation in Italy in particular, I think you probably were pretty flat on carbon deficit in 2009. So can you talk about what you're assuming long-term in terms of carbon deficit? What's your surprise you're assuming? And can you also give us a little bit more color about impact from the new green certificate legislation? Probably you could lose four or five euro megawatt hour on the power price in Italy. And if you can also give just some details about what Italian power price you are expecting for 2013, '14? In Spain we heard from Mr. Brentan talking about 55 euro base loads. So can you give us Italy and Slovakia? And if you can give spark spread in Italy, would be great. Sorry for the detailed question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think you already have received some of the answer, Alberto, and particularly on the pricing of Italy. I think we didn't be shy in telling you what the current pricing we see for our sales. And if you want to have it repeated, Luigi will repeat it to you. To be honest with you, I see no problem with CapEx. We have scheduled the maintenance CapEx as we usually do, taking into account all our need, and particularly networks. We of course need to continue to invest in quality. This will be the same as in Spain and Latin America and Romania and Italy, as you would expect. Just to give an idea, in Italy this will be one billion euros of CapEx. Mostly these are maintenance CapEx.</p>
          <p>The quality of the investments is different though. This is why we have synergies between Endesa and Enel. This is why we have gone smarter into identifying those investments which are required. And we continue to deliver incremental quality even though we're passing through severe storms in Catalonia or in Northern Italy, and we continue to consider cost efficiency program being part of our going smarter into maintenance. So, don't worry about it please. We're taking into consideration all the importance of maintaining our CapEx program in line with the expectations of the engineers.</p>
          <p>For the pre-tax profits of all of the disposal, of course we have taken into account those in our projection. It's elementary but it's worth repeating it. We have identified the targets and we have taken out and our projection those numbers. But if I will be giving you the numbers right now, I will be telling you the names and the addresses and possibly even the value that we consider. There are a lot of bankers over here that will be spoiled if I give the value of the assets that we're selling, because they will be not deserving their fees for the quotation of Green Power, whatever. So hold the breath and guess yourself what will be the outcome please.</p>
          <p>Carbon deficits, it's an intriguing question. I will again ask you folks to give the technical answer to Alberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I will remind the price for the coming years. Carbon deficit, basically in Italy what we are expecting is to report over the period 2008, 2012, therefore phase 2, for phase 2 a deficit in the range of 30 million tons roughly, maybe a bit more than that. And out of that we're happy to report again that our activity in the carbon market and in the reduction of cost through our compliance strategy allows us to have an average cost of coverage in the range of four euros per ton, which is quite low. We already covered also 2013 year. When it goes to price maybe, Luigi, you want to add something? We're seeing today in our scenario a price for phase 3 which is in the range of 25 euros per ton. This is our expectation which is incorporated in our strategic plan.</p>
          <p>You had maybe another couple of questions regarding the Italian market. If I remember, you were asking about the legislation of green certificate, whether we expect an impact on price. This is quite controversial, yet we will see in the following months what the market will deliver and the spot price will show, what the change in the legislation introduces and the fact that we will not have cost to be paid in the generation side in the range of 300 million euros per year.</p>
          <p>Price of electricity foreseen for 2013, according to the scenario we have in commodity prices and considering spark spread, which is the one that Mr. Conti mentioned before, which is something in the range of 18 euros per megawatt hour and also considering the fact that starting from 2013 we expect the price of CO2 to be fully incorporated in the price and see an increase in the prices of electricity there in order to reflect all these elements. Spark spread of 18, the opportunity cost, which equals the cash cost for CO2 from 2013 and therefore, we might end up to a price which is above 80 euros per megawatt hour. This is according to the commodity scenario we have. I think that's all.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Anna Maria Scaglia from Credit Suisse. I was, I have two questions, if I may. One's on Green Power. On page eight, you report increasing capacity. I was wondering if you can give us more visibility in terms of countries and technologies because last year you gave out this plate, so it would be very useful and maybe also, if you can comment on the financial structure of the company? And the second question is regarding Endesa CapEx plan. On the 10.5 billion, can you please give us the split between what's going to be invested in Latin America and in Spain? And finally, just to come back to the question before on CO2, can you confirm, maybe I misunderstood that the price of &#x2013; your cost of CO2 for 2013 is 4 euros per ton? Thank you.</p>

          <p>You want to take this last question, Gianfilippo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually there is a misunderstanding. I'm sorry if I didn't make myself clear on that point. The fact is that we have many activities in carbon strategy and in compliance strategy by which we source our right. And then we also have an active role in trading our rights in a way we aim to reduce our net costs of CO2 for phase 2. This leads us to have a net cost of CO2 of four euro per ton. This is the actual cost, not the market cost, of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the Green Power, I must admit that I would love to give you all the details, but we have started a proceeding for the flotation of the company and we've been given this, I would say instructions by our lawyers that we should not go into any detail, because this will be subject to the prospectus filing. Therefore, you will have to bear a few more weeks. Let me put it this way, before some of these details will be of course possibly made available during the formation of the process of the prospectus filing with the stock exchange authorities. I'm sorry to report from a legal standpoint that I should withhold any of the information that I have. This is the fact of life. It will not be in public.

        <plist>
          <p>Roberto Letizia from Equita. Sorry if I go back to the marginal issues, but &#x2013; and the previous demand of Alberto, but the issue of the green certificate, currently, are you still including in the price assumption for '14 the effects of the cost of green certificate or not? Then on the cost and in margins, but the indication of cost of gas of 60 euros per megawatt versus the indication of 75 euros per megawatt selling price would suggest a spark spread of 15 euros for '11. Is that the one you're assuming for the '11 target? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, very briefly, cost of green certificates, we have taken it out of our cost in the business plan according to the legislation which has been introduced last November in Italy. And price of electricity, yeah, that's correct. If you assume a cost of gas in the range of 60 euro per megawatt hour and electricity price of 17 or something, you have that spark spread basically, over year or so of the business plan.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Enrico Bartoli from Main First. Three questions, if I may, one is regarding Spain. If you can give us an indication of the assumptions in terms of spark spread that you're assuming your business plan for Spain? And you're talking about the possibility of the introduction of a capacity payment. If you can update us if you have some discussions with the government and the likelihood of this measure actually to be taken.</p>
          <p>A second question is related to Russia. If you can give us a hint of the evolution in terms of capacity payments that you assume in your business plan compared to the 4,000 megawatts, euro per megawatt that you had in 2009. And finally, I don't know if you can answer this question, but just a hint of the percentage of Enel Green Power which is assumed in your 7 billion of disposal in 2010. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask Andrea to answer on the Spanish. Here we have Carlo Tamburi on the international side if he wants to complement my answer on the Russian capacity payment. Capacity payment, let me start with that, in Russia is under drafting by the government. They are obviously seriously concerned that there is not enough investment flowing into the country to support what they consider, at the government level, extremely important and strategic for their economic recovery and growth. Therefore, starting with that assumption, they finally decided to beef up the capacity payment for the new investments and at the same time we are putting forward the case that we need not only to support new investment but also those investments for refurbishing the existing capacity which will be to &#x2013; which will be necessarily as important as the new capacity being offered to the Russian market.</p>
          <p>You might have seen some of the statements issued by the Prime Minister, Mr. Putin, recently, praising the foreign investor and citing, making mention of Enel as a positive contributor to that effect. This is because we try to "negotiate" good capacity terms for us, as you might be aware. We are investing the $1b in two new combined cycles that will have to come on stream by 2011/2012. And we want to make sure, no matter what, this capacity payment will be available to support even higher margins than the one we are using.</p>
          <p>I will not give you the exact amount right now, for the simple reason that of course we are "negotiating" with the government right now. And I don't want to give negotiating tools to the government right now. When it comes to Spain, would you please take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Let me start with the second question, so the second answer. Capacity payments. We have actually had very strong contribution in putting this debate on the table. So the subject is now &#x2013; has now been debated, is being debated. It's absolutely known and it is generally accepted that because of the strong increase of renewables and their nature of not being, let's say, totally predictable in the timing and the amount of their production, thermal capacity is absolutely needed by the system, as not only per se, but it is also needed to basically back up and make it firm, I mean the production out of renewables. So the debate is, let's say, advanced.</p>
          <p>Now you've seen probably a couple of days ago the Director General of the Spanish Ministry of Industries, here in London, and he actually talked about that and he acknowledged that need. He also, let's say, added that in the form of capacity payments or other equivalent means. So we don't know exactly, I don't know exactly what other equivalent means. But that is encouraging to hear from the Director General such a statement.</p>
          <p>On the other side, you also have seen that in the so called Salgado document, the Vice President of the government there in Spain, up to the year 2020 the hueco termico, the thermal gap, the hours of the thermal power plant, in particular of the combined cycle, are, let's say, even set at a lower level than it is today whereby, in the same document, renewables are set to grow at a higher pace so that also there is a clear evidence that something has to be done and will be done. And you can also consider that the famous decree on coal, domestic coal promotion, has already some elements of capacity payment. So building on that it will be possible to arrive to the second capacity payment, to the total capacity payment.</p>
          <p>Concerning the first question about spark spread. So I will give you a general context for this and then I will give word to Pepe Bogas who is responsible for Endesa's Iberian operations. So in 2009 the competitivity has been in the following ranking. First, imported coal. Second, combined cycle. And last, domestic coal. And in particular Endesa on, let's say, combined cycle, has had always positive spreads due to its very competitive gas contract portfolio and also due to the fact that it works in a number of places where there is restrictions.</p>
          <p>Now Pepe will elaborate on the future. But we basically see in the five-year period a trend very similar to what has been happening in 2009. Now there are many ways, of course, to calculate the spark spread. And you always have also to take into account the fact that our production is actually hedged against the subjacent price, sales price on the market which is, of course, higher than the spot market. Pepe, over to you.</p>

          <p>Okay. First of all, I say that Mr. Conti said that we don't need to explain what means clean spark spread or whatever. I should say that I never have understood really what does it mean. But in any case, if we use our fuel cost and we use also our CO2 cost, we are talking about something around 10 euro per megawatt hour, between 10 and 15 euro per megawatt hour in the future.</p>
          <p>If we use a convention that we use in Enel, I should say that taking into account our fuel cost and also taking into account the future of the CO2, we are reducing that around 10, more close to 10 than to 15. That's the difference. So in the future what we are seeing in Spain is something between 10 and 15.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question? Okay. We have a question there, Roberto. Would you please stand up, Roberto? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Roberto Ranieri, Banca IMI. A few questions, if I may. The first one is just to make a clarification on Porto Tolle. It is not clear for me if Porto Tolle will be fully operating in 2010 or partially operating in 2010 and would be fully operating in, sorry, 2014, so would be fully operating in 2015. And in that case, if we can have a rough estimate of the contribution of Porto Tolle, additional contribution of Porto Tolle to the EBITDA, long-term EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Second question is about efficiency. We were talking about the Zenith project and efficiency on working capital and also on OpEx. I'm wondering if this kind of efficiency &#x2013; this kind of a project could be extended all over the plan and beyond. Third question is on regulation in Latin America. Could you please give us your idea on tariff revision in Brazilian activities and if you have any perception of risks on &#x2013; and which are &#x2013; could you please quantify, if any, those risks in tariff revision in Brazilian activities? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. The number of questions received so far and the speakers tend to indicate that we only attract interest to Italian analysts. Is there in the room any non-Italian analyst who want to raise a question? All right, great. Welcome. Thank you. So you'll be the next in line, sir. I'm saying this because next time I will stay back in Italy as opposed to travel all the way up here. We'll make another cost saving program right away.</p>
          <p>The other point of Porto Tolle, just to make it clear, I say it in two languages, in Italian and in English. [Foreign Language] To repeat this in English, Porto Tolle will not be shown in our P&amp;L because in our schedule it would not be physically available by the end of 2014. We're still waiting for some concessions and licenses. And we have planned to receive those by the end of the year, possibly start engineering the plant in 2011, which makes it impossible to have it up and running by 2014. I hope this clarifies the issue once and for all. On efficiency and regulation, please, which is then, Andrea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure. Concerning regulation, as I said before, I mean we are in an advanced, stable, transparent environment in most of the countries in Latin America where we operate. That's a good base. It's foreseeable, the behavior, I'm not saying the behavior of the regulator is anything like weak, but it is foreseeable and it is uniform so that we can plan for our operations.</p>
          <p>On top of that, as I said before in a chart, in all of our distribution operations in Latin America but one, being the only exception Argentina, the last tariff revisions have been done quite recently. But of course during the period there will be some of them. For instance, one in Brazil who, if I remember well, is Coelce, will have to take place sometime at the end of next year or beginning of the following year. So definitely we have taken into account, based on our past experience, what is the probable move of the regulator in that respect but we have also, of course, planned our actions and namely our efficiency actions so that we are going to be able to counteract the new situation for sure as we have been able to do in the past.</p>
          <p>And now I don't know whether Paolo Bondi or &#x2013; I think that's more or less the overall picture concerning your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I just add something about efficiency. Well, in the numbers that we have seen this morning, we do not &#x2013; we have not yet incorporated a project which is called, again, Zenith, which will be developed in the Endesa house which has an impact of something in the region &#x2013; as a target, something in the region of 240 million euros by the end of 2012. Therefore, this is again another step ahead in spreading around our efficiency program. It's a continuous improvement strategy. And I think this is one &#x2013; an additional sign in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have room for two more questions so I think you can start now. You can have your chance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris Rogers from ICAP. Firstly, thank you for coming to London. It's made life much easier. If I may ask a question with a bit of a global nature, you've outlined the advantage you have from lower-priced carbon credits, particularly through the clean development mechanism. But there've been two controversies recently, firstly with the recycling of credits and secondly with the European Commission potentially wanting to not allow industrial gas carbon credits to be included. What is the risk for you there and what might that do to your financial outlook should there be any changes?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you've mentioned you're committed with Endesa to keep the minority interest. What are your thoughts with the minority interest in the Latin American businesses? Obviously it does lead to complexity, increases cost as well, having to maintain those. Would you prefer to perhaps buy those out or are you committed to leaving those minorities outstanding? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two interesting questions. I'll try to articulate an answer that will try to tell you what we are at &#x2013; at the moment.</p>
          <p>When it comes to CDM, CER-EUA, I think here the principle we try to follow is one of economic logic. The theory of marginal capital is at work. It's been invented by a London-based Professor Marshall 150 years ago and is still proving to be the right &#x2013; the only &#x2013; one of the few paradigms in economic systems that is working.</p>
          <p>Why should we limit, being CO2 emission conceived to be a global issue, the geography associated with what the efforts are to reduce those CO2 emissions? If we can get, we can source sizable proven, proven, audited project to reduce CO2 or other gas, greenhouse gases in places where you can have cheaper, with $100 you can have more emission reduction. There is no point in trying to convince us that it's good for the Europeans to do it in the Hertfordshire or in Tuscany as opposed to doing it in Mainland China or South America. And this should be credited to us because these are genuine projects which are audited and fully, let me say, considered by the international institutions to be helping the climate change fighting.</p>
          <p>So I will continue to insist that logic should prevail. Common sense should prevail, even in the thick atmosphere of Brussels bureaucracy and politicians. For that we'll continue to pursue our strategy. And again I will turn to our people here, both in Enel and Endesa, who are actually working very well in and have been pioneering this system of sourcing cheap &#x2013; cheaper CO2 certificates by promoting investments in those countries which are Annex III of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p>I think even the Copenhagen meeting is proving the need to do something real and common sense-based as opposed to just pursue ideological schemes that do not work. So I'm reasonably confident this will continue to be our case in the future. Having said all of this, I stop here.</p>
          <p>Minority stake of Endesa. I continue to see the benefit of having minority shareholders in our Company. This is giving us additional discipline to maintain Endesa in the right track because we also have to pay attention to the need of a number of known Enel investors who are seeking in Endesa, both at Endesa corporate level and to the Latin America situation, where we have Enersis and Endesa Chile being listed. And then we have many different subsidiaries of Enersis or Endesa Chile or Endesa Latin America, with different partners country to country.</p>
          <p>Do we need to rush into shuffling up everything to make additional chaos? I don't think this is going to be a wise decision. So I'm holding my plan to carefully look into the &#x2013; from the bottom up to the top, ways and means to streamline the operations to the benefit of Endesa shareholders and to the partners who actually have invested in this company. It has to be very carefully planned and implemented. So no rush, but definitely it's at the utmost attention in our house. Okay? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have time for one final question. The lady down there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes. This is Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I have a question. I understand you cannot speak very much about the Enel Green Power. But I wanted to understand the process until the listing. Do you depend on integrating the Endesa assets first or is that very advanced already? Could that delay the process and perhaps the IPO is moved towards the second part of the year?</p>
          <p>And if that is the case, in case there is market volatility and the whole IPO perhaps could not take place, could you have a plan B for other disposals to be done in 2010? And specifically, I'm based in Spain, so there has been quite a lot of speculation of you potentially selling the Endesa Gas assets. I wanted to know if there is anything behind that or not. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the Green Power quotation, it is important to have, what we have achieved already, a single point of reference for the renewables activities within the Group. During the presentation I think we have confirmed to you that we have reached conclusion on that by having the two Boards, both Endesa and Enel, approving the getting together of all of the Spanish assets into one single lump, which is the organization of Enel Green Power controlling 60% of the company called ECYR, which receives the contribution of the 50% of the Eufer, the Spanish investment that we were &#x2013; we're still partner with Union Fenosa or Gas Natural in these days. So this is already done.</p>
          <p>And this is the reason why, having done this, now we can start the proceeding of going for the filing of an IPO prospectus during the month of April. And from there on we will be possibly looking at opportunities to float the company in &#x2013; during, say, the latest, June, or in September, October, depending on market conditions and the combination of a flotation and the industrial partner with someone else. And this industrial partner or someone else being possibly someone who will have the opportunity to give us additional market clout, which will give us the opportunity to use our newly coming technologies, like highly concentrated solar, like the hybrid hydrogen photovoltaic system in countries and places where land and sun are abundant.</p>
          <p>So the combination of all of this will lead us into the final decision. What you should be aware, the process has started. I will not give any answer to the previous question on what will be the amount of money. And I have no answer to do about &#x2013; uncertainly about the fact that there is a strong appetite from both, industrial, sovereign funds, private investors and markets altogether to take a stake into this company. And this will convince us of being on the right track to collect those funds from this quotation or disposal by the end of the year at the latest, the latest.</p>
          <p>Now, having said all this, if that doesn't happen, what will we do? If that doesn't happen, it's not obviously our base assumption. It will happen. But if that has to happen, we will have higher debt at the end of the year. But still, in my view, if you project the numbers the right way, still comfortably sitting on an A+ rating.</p>
          <p>Having said all of this, again, we continue to dispose of some other assets. There are no speculations on that. We'll continue and progressively finish the high-voltage grid disposal in Spain. We're seriously considering the potential opportunities given by other deals which have been consummated in Spain about the gas distribution network and which we also performed in Italy. This has proven to be the right thing for us to sell in Italy 80% of the distribution of the gas company, retaining operatorship and cashing in the proceeds of the sale. Same logic could apply to our Spanish distribution system for gas. We're considering seriously that opportunity. When appropriate we'll be commenting to you the outcome of the decision. Okay?</p>
