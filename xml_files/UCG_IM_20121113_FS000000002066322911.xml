          <p>Good afternoon. This is the Chorus Call Conference Operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group's Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Federico Ghizzoni, UniCredit's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon and welcome, everyone, to our call. The format today of our presentation will be slightly different. On top of the quarterly figures, we'll show you also some update about the progress of our Strategic Plan one year from its launch. So we'll have a slightly longer presentation. I apologize for this, but I think it would be very useful to all of you.</p>
          <p>Before going to the slides, obviously, it's clear to everybody that we are coming from a very difficult &#x2013; still difficult third quarter. It has been particularly challenging in Italy, even though after the intervention and the action put in place &#x2013; the measure put in place by ECB we are seen some easing of the sovereign risk.</p>
          <p>In any case that the overall performance of the group have been quite resilient in spite of the very high provision that we had to do due to the macroeconomic situation, in particular the profitability has been supported by our geographical diversification and effective cost cutting measures. And we start to see the first meaningful positive effect &#x2013; impact of the Strategic Plan actions in our results.</p>
          <p>So, let's go now to the presentation, starting as usual from the key message, slide four. As you can see, the group net income recovered in the third quarter to &#x20AC;335 million, significantly up from the results of the second quarter. The nine months result stays at &#x20AC;1.4 billion. Also, the net operating profit held up quite well, thanks to resilient core revenues, strict cost control and the slightly lower loan loss provision in the quarter, although as we see they will still remain &#x2013; they still remain very high.</p>
          <p>We successfully continued to reposition and strengthen our balance sheet with a further improved liquidity position and strong capital base. Our direct funding is up 1.1% in the quarter. Funding plan has been completed. Actually, we're already working in view of the 2013 plan. As you can see, the plan for Italy has been completed 120%. Risk weighted asset down &#x20AC;23.6 billion since December 2011, of which over &#x20AC;16 billion came from the CIB runoff portfolio since the September last year.</p>
          <p>And finally, the Basel 2.5 Core Tier 1 ratio stands at a solid 10.7%, fully-fledged &#x2013; Basel 3 fully-fledged at 9.3% above the expected situation looking at the plan that was supposed to be 9.1%, so we are ahead of our plan.</p>
          <p>Briefly, slide five, net profit and net operating profit. Again, as I said, &#x20AC;335 million is the net of the quarter, including &#x20AC;39 million coming from buyback, &#x20AC;1.4 billion is the result of the year up to now, including also in this case &#x20AC;517 million of buybacks. The net operating profit is up quite well, down only 3% in the quarter to &#x20AC;575 million. The first nine months stood at &#x20AC;3 billion, including the positive impact again of buyback.</p>
          <p>Just have a look at the net operating profit breakdown. As you have just seen, the net operating profit is down only 3% quarter-on-quarter supported by resilient revenues, effective cost cutting, as you can see, and lower, but still high loan loss provision. The loan loss provision, even though down 5.2% for the quarter, we are growing 13.2% in the first nine months, primarily due to the general deterioration of the situation in Italy.</p>
          <p>Moving further, page seven &#x2013; slide seven, on the total revenues. Revenues trend shows overall resilience again despite a further decreasing of the interest rates with the Euribor remaining at historical lows, weak loan demand and, most important, with an approach to have from our side very conservative in term of risk policy in order to improve the quality of the overall portfolio. So interest rate down, weak demand on loan, our strict approach also in terms of pricing, by the way, has contributed to decreased interest &#x2013; the net interest income. Opposite, as we look Poland and Central-Eastern Europe, we continued to see a positive trend, especially in countries like Russia, like Poland itself and also in Turkey where we see an improvement of the spread.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide eight with a more detailed look to the net interest income. Again, I would like to stress the fact that the trend is negative influenced, once again, by the very low level of rates. The Euribor has never been so low since many years and weak demand in term of loans all across Western Europe. Different is the situation in Central-Eastern Europe and in Poland. It is our area of growth. Here the net interest income is growing 4.4% quarter-on-quarter, so remarkable result is growing 2.6% year-on-year. Confirming this slide that is important today to our diversified geographical presence and to be present in emerging market like Central-Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Volumes, slide nine, on one side the customer loans. The customer loans are slightly increasing. In reality, if we take away the so called market counterparties, like Cassa Compensazione e Garanzia, Euroclear, et cetera, the real loan trend is negative, is down, more or less &#x20AC;6 billion, &#x20AC;7 billion quarter-on-quarter, except CEE and Poland where we see an increase of 1.4%. Positive is the trend, once again, in term of deposit, we are growing 0.7%, 7.1% year-on-year. The trend both on the loans on one side and deposits on the other side, and as we will see later on, has contributed significantly to reduce the funding gap of the group and to improved the liquidity position of the group.</p>
          <p>I go back to the net interest side. I think this slide aims to give you our capability to react to the declining trend in term of interest rate. As you can see, quarter-on-quarter, Euribor is down 34 basis point, is down almost 120 basis point year-on-year. Nevertheless, thanks to a very strict action of repricing, we have been able to contain the decrease of the rate to customer only 15 basis points. So we have lost 15 basis point versus Euribor that is down 34 basis point.</p>
          <p>Same on the side of deposit, we have been able to reduce 5 basis point rate to customer with Euribor that has reached &#x2013; I suppose in this case, the Euribor is low since many quarters. And on the deposit side, the issue of mark-up is obvious and evident.</p>
          <p>Fees and commissions, they are slightly up, 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. The slide speak by itself. So we have problem on the Investment Service fees and commissions. Here the reason is very simple, customer are very conservative. They tend to invest in simple products like bonds or certificates of deposit. So, there is no possibility to have high risk return in term of fees and commissions. Growth in the commission we get from transaction and banking services. And despite of the low volumes, in term of loans, also financing services are keeping a good trend overall, especially year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I will move now to the cost side. On the cost side, it's very tangible, let's say, the impact of our Strategic Plan. We are down 2.9% in the first nine months of the year, so year-on-year minus 2.9%. We are down 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. We have to stress here that we have a different trend, if we confront Western Europe with CEE. Western Europe is down at 3.9% year-on-year. I think it's a very good achievement. We are up 1.1% in Central Eastern Europe. And this is below the expected target, really, the budget and the multi-year plan, it was about 4% or 5% increase, so in reality, we increased 1.1%. We are not shy of showing a 1.1% increase because we keep investing in the region. Again, it's the area of growth for the group and it will be crazy to not invest in this area because, again, it gives to us important return and is the area where we see the better development for the group.</p>
          <p>The trend in term of cost is confirmed also by the trend in term of FTE. We keep declining, as you see on the slide, page 13. We have decreased 450 people also in this quarter, 3,300 people all together since September 2011. Also, here I would like to stress that we have reached an agreement a few weeks ago with unions. Substantially, we will be in the position to continue the reduction of people that were supposed to leave the group following the agreement of 2010, then suspended because of the pension reform in Italy. We are talking about 2,600 people that are not included in these 3,300 that we show here. These people will go out between 2012, 2013, and 2014. So, we have an additional guarantee only in Italy, 2,600 people in the next couple of years basically, including this one.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the cost of risk. As you can see, this slide shows very clearly that on one side cost of risk for the quarter, yes, is down in term of provision, 5.2%, but it's clear that this doesn't show yet that there is a trend. So let's look to the growth year-on-year that we have, 13.2%. So the quarter is down, but the trend is still unpredictable and, in the case year-on-year, quite negative. Clearly, from this slide, you can see that the problem for us is in Italy, where we have 188 basis point of cost of risk.</p>
          <p>Different picture in Germany and Austria, both at 48 basis points, and also very positive trend in Central Eastern Europe with 118 basis points. So, again, Italy is the issue. And we can look now to the trend in terms of gross impaired loan. Here, as you can see, the non-performing loans are up 1.8%, other impaired loans, 5.7%. The total is an increase of 3.5% with a decrease coverage ratio from 43.8% to 43.1%. I will explain in the next slide the reason of this declining of the coverage ratio is almost linked entirely to Italy. And so let's move to Italy to better understand.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 is the same slide, but only for Italy. Again, as you see, gross impaired loans are up 5.2% with a different trend in NPLs, that are growing 2.6%, other impaired loans 8.5%. And going to the coverage ratio, it's down from 41.2% to 40.2%. With a different trend if we look other impaired loans where in reality we increased slightly the coverage ratio. We are down 70 basis point in term of &#x2013; sorry, we are down 120 basis point on the Italian NPLs coverage ratio. The reason are now substantially two. One, we have seen other impaired loans increase by &#x20AC;2 billion mostly because of few big ticket inflows into past dues. And since the coverage ratio past dues loans is lower than the one of non-performing loans, the overall coverage ratio decreases. So this is the first reason.</p>
          <p>Second reason is we have seen some bad loans written-off or sold. Bad loans are sold with a higher coverage ratio. In particular, one single large ticket has been sold with a coverage ratio of 90%. In addition, we have seen a new performing loans &#x2013; non-performing loans coming in with a coverage traditionally lower because we expect the coverage ratio is higher. So the combination of past dues with lower coverage ratio and this combination of written off and new NPLs that you have seen in the quarter, combination of both brings down the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, I would not make any specific comment. It's the situation in term of asset quality country by country. So, as you can see, again, Italy is the most critical country. Let's move to the balance sheet structure, sorry, nothing to say. It's a slide you are familiar with.</p>
          <p>Page 18, just to stress the leverage ratio that is further down to 18.9. I think it's one of the lowest in Europe, for sure. Also, not too much to comment on page 19, except maybe the further improvement of the interbank position by &#x20AC;21 billion.</p>
          <p>One comment about our portfolio structure, page 20, as you can see, we have &#x20AC;92 billion of treasury bonds in our portfolio, 46% Italian, 22% Germany and the rest spread with many different countries. So the total Italian risk of the total product portfolio is only 46%. Again, this puts us in a different situation versus our Italian peers.</p>
          <p>Funding, page 21, as I said already, the funding plan has been completed. We are now working on 2013. We have done 120% of the Italian funding plan. We are pretty satisfied of the successful execution of the plan. We never experienced problem to get money from the market to the time the offer &#x2013; the demand has been much higher compared to our offer in all the diversified products that we have requested from the market.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the capital side, first a view on the risk-weighted asset trend. They are down significantly year-on-year, but also down quarter-on-quarter. We have reached &#x20AC;436 billion from &#x20AC;447 billion in particular, good is the trend in market and good is the trend in credit. Also good is the &#x2013; let's say, the composition on risk-weighted asset inside the group, 35% in Italy, 24% in Germany, 26% in Central-Eastern Europe and Poland, 7% in Austria, so very well diversified composition of our risk-weighted asset portfolio</p>
          <p>Capital ratios, slide 23, up &#x2013; quarter one up 28 basis point to 10.7%. On the capital ratio under the EBA rules, we are at 9.9%. Basel 3 fully phasing, 9.3%, above the expected target of 9.1%. It was included in our plan. So I think a good trend in term of capital.</p>
          <p>The last slide before going to the multi-year plan is about Italy. As you can see, this is a slide you should be familiar with because already several times we put this slide in the presentation. As you can see, talking about the commercial banking in Italy, still we see revenues going up, 4.9%. And this is the pure commercial banking of Italy. So in spite of our GDP that is going down 2.5% probably <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:16) still we are able to grow internal revenues in Italy. Operating cost significantly down, 7.2%, with a gross operating profit that keeps growing double digits, 24%.</p>
          <p>So if we start with the gross operating profit, the trend is comfortable. It's helping to absorb the increasing level of provisions. As you can see, growing 11% in Italy year-on-year with a profit before tax that goes negative to &#x20AC;71 million improving from &#x20AC;545 million negative one year ago. So good trend in terms of gross operating profit. LLP we discussed already and we know that is the problem we have to tackle looking forward.</p>
          <p>With this slide, I would stop the presentation about the quarterly results. Let's now move to the Strategic Plan. If you remember, we were in front of you one year ago presenting the 2012-2015 plan. We were hoping at that time and believing also that the macroeconomic environment was going to improve even though slight slowly. What you have seen in reality is quite different. We have seen rapid deterioration of the economic conditions all across Europe, in Italy, but also in the rest of Western Europe.</p>
          <p>So this has changed and putting challenges on us. Nevertheless, we have worked very hard for the implementation of the Strategic Plan, trying to compensate with further action where we have suffered in term of loan demand that is down across the group, higher loan loss provisions, higher cost of funding coming mostly from the Sovereign risk in Italy, and also some side effects that coming from, for example, the welfare and fiscal reform in Italy that has been introduced during 2012 by the current government.</p>
          <p>So we had more difficulties to face. But if we look, as we will see now the result, we are quite comfortable, in particular, we have been able to strengthen and to improve our balance sheet position. We have strengthened considerably our capital through the right issue, for sure, but also through a number of several actions still ongoing. We have started successfully the simplification of the group to improve efficiency. We have put in place very effective cost management procedures that are bringing results. Business we're focusing in CIB and CEE is ongoing. Of course, in this case, the idea to focus our attention for CEE, for example, on the three, four core countries has been very successful. And Italy, as we discussed already, the restructuring is undergoing in spite of the cost of risk, which is higher than expected.</p>
          <p>But let's have a look to some slides. We'll go to slide 28 first. Here you can see the trend in term of funding gap. So if you look third quarter 2011, we started with a funding gap of &#x20AC;108 billion. We are down now to &#x20AC;65.6 billion, 70% coming by the Italian network contribution. So a 40% decrease in a very challenging and demanding period of time. So I think it's a successful story, particularly you can see is all concentrated in Western Europe from &#x20AC;103 billion to &#x20AC;59 billion. In Central-Eastern Europe, we are substantially stable.</p>
          <p>Also, the loans to direct funding ratio is improving from 124% to 113%. As well the improvement is mostly concentrated in Western Europe. Also, in this case, I would like to remind the situation in Italy, when we started with the plan, the loan to deposit ratio was 157%, we are today at 133% and the target was for this year 140%. So we have accelerated in improving the ratio especially in Italy.</p>
          <p>Let's look maybe page 31, capital, again, I'm repeating myself, but we have reached a level that is quite comfortable. And especially, if we look at Basel 3, 9.3% versus 9.10%. Thanks to, for sure, the right issue, but also the optimization and strong focus on reducing risk weighted asset, so we have reached a level that has been one of the best in the Eurozone among the Eurozone banks.</p>
          <p>Page 32, risk weighted asset, I would stress here the decrease of &#x20AC;23.6 billion since December 2011, plus a reduction &#x2013; it's a reduction of 5.1% substantially, so quite significant. And if you see most comes from CIB, so the restructuring, let's say, of CIB is really bringing to us good result, not only in term of revenues but also in term of risk weighted asset decreased &#x20AC;26.9 billion that substantially is offsetting the negative effect of Basel 2.5. So this comes from CIB.</p>
          <p>Cost, as well we'll not spend too much time. I would have a look only to the right side of the slide. If you see Western Europe, before the implementation of the plan, we were basically stable in term of cost, with an acceleration as soon as the plan has been announced. From September 2011 to September this year, we are down in Western Europe, 3.9%, almost 4%, up 1.1% in Central-Eastern Europe with a strong deceleration versus the past. We're growing in the last &#x2013; the previous three years almost 6% in spite of the confirmation of the investment in the region as I already said a few minutes ago. I will not discuss too much &#x2013; we will not touch page 34.</p>
          <p>Let's go to FTE same page 35, we've already given to you the numbers. The trend speaks by itself. Page 36, you have some indication of the agreement we have reached with the unions. As I was saying, we have 2,600 people that will leave the group in the next couple of years. 225 already left through the joint venture with Hewlett-Packard. 600 further people are in discussion with what we call the Newton project. It's a project of outsourcing of some IT operation. But it is also useful to remind that we have reached also the agreement to utilize people with much higher flexibility. This give us the possibility to insource some activities that today are outsourced and this is bringing to us progressively &#x20AC;100 million of further saving.</p>
          <p>Last I would focus on some activities ongoing in the networks. This is the page 37 is what we are doing in the Italian networks. As you can see here we have two message I would like to give to you. One on the closing branches, we have done already 142 branches. So substantially we are very close already to the number given to you in the Strategic Plan. But most important that the conversion of branches from a fully fledged branches to Cash Less and Cash Light branches is progressing very well. This is not a small change because we are talking about 2,500 tellers.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we started with 92% of the branches in the beginning of 2011, so called fully fledged. So doing all services cash and non-cash, we will end up by 2015 with 26% of branches only fully fledged. So, big change in the network that brings also investment that we are doing in multi-channels and the integration of the channels among this size to serve better our customers.</p>
          <p>The transformation of the network is ongoing and we started also in Germany and also in Austria with benefit in term of cost and hopefully also we are sure in term of revenues. In term of revenues, one focus &#x2013; sorry, in terms of business refocusing one word about CIB. We are on track on the run-off portfolio. We are down &#x20AC;16 billion since September 2011 from &#x20AC;43 billion to &#x20AC;26 billion and also on track in trying to improve the profitability of the division all across the group and as well in Italy.</p>
          <p>As you can see the number of customers with the RACE, which is our metrics to measure our profitability, net of cost of risk, the number of customers with RACE above 3% is growing for 73% to 75% of the total customers. So it's working. And if we look to CEE refocusing, as I said, that the focus on the four major countries Turkey, Czech Republic, Russia, Poland proves to be good. In this country we see increase of revenues higher than the average in the region. We see a gross impaired loans ratio pretty low, 5.8%. And we see loans to direct funding below 100%. So, there is a space to further growth and to further push in terms of loans growth. So, we concentrate and we are concentrating in these countries, we keep opening branches, especially in Turkey. Today, we are approving, the board, the merger between Slovakia and Czech Republic and we will continue to push any possible way to streamline our operation in the region.</p>
          <p>So I will conclude now here our presentation, just a few word to recap. As we said, the group is showing resilient performances in spite of the difficulties of the period. Our profitability is definitely supported by our geographical spread and effective cost cutting measures. We have successfully repositioned our balance sheet. We have a very strong capital position and a very comfortable liquidity position. The funding gap has been reduced, and the funding plan has been completed. And in term of Strategic Plan, the measure implemented are many, and the result for the group are quite significant and already visible. So thank you very much. Now, we move to the Q&amp;A question. And as usual, myself and Marina Natale, we will &#x2013; we are ready to reply to all your question. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to you all. I have few questions over four topics, ROT and risk-weighted assets, capital, asset quality and liability management. On the first one, how much of your return on tangible equity is due to higher risk weighting from penalizing disclosure of NPLs in Italy versus other countries, and how much of the premium risk weight do you think is due to this factor?</p>
          <p>The other thing is that you keep on delivering on risk weighted assets fall, how much more do you think you have got to go in optimizing your risk-weighted assets? You are one year ahead of your targets on core capital ratio. What does this mean for the way you manage the group and for the dividend policy of UniCredit this year?</p>
          <p>On capital, can you give us an overview of the countries in which you operate on the constraint that local regulators put to the repatriation of capital from the subsidiaries of the group to the parent company? On asset quality, slides 43 to 45 <mark type="inaudible" /> (37:37) in Q3, neither on the new flows and on the recoveries. What do you actually see in Q4, and what path are you preparing for in 2013? And finally, on liability management, you've been aggressive on your management at the beginning of the year, other peers have continued to launching operations on this. How much more room have you got to optimize your funding structure? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You put five questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrea, you got the benefit to be the first, so you asked five questions. But now onwards please try to keep limited to two questions, honoring the request. Otherwise we'll not manage to answer to everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start from the end because I don't remember the first. So, background, in the case asset and liability management, in this moment, we've basically finished our program. So, we don't see 2013 a similar approach. Obviously, we'll try to find all possibility to improve our mix, but 2013 would be much less, for sure, than 2012 in this respect.</p>
          <p>In term of asset &#x2013; in the term of bad loans, if I remember, you put the question about the future. I think that we cannot expect &#x2013; you have to divide as usual Italy and the rest of the group. The rest of group, we are expecting situation quite normalized, so no major change versus today. We are quite comfortable with the quality of the portfolio in Germany, Australia and Central Eastern Europe plus Poland. Italy, I'm repeating what I said already three months ago, I think that it will be difficult to imagine, let's say, the situation improving significantly for the next two or three quarters.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that at least until mid next year we will see the situation in the system improving. Obviously, whatever is possible from our side to do to limit the migration from credit and bonds to impaired loans will be done. We are now reviewing completely again our portfolio and to see if our organization is good enough to try to match, let's say, the challenges that we have in front of us. We will do a number of actions. But, overall, from a macroeconomic point of view, I don't see for some time, at least until mid next year, any meaningful improvement.</p>
          <p>Then you put a question about falling risk weighted assets. Well, we have to say that on one side we keep working on our target to reduce the non-core portfolio. Here, the trend is to accelerate if possible rather than opposite. If we talk about loans, well, we have seen poor demand starting from summer. We will see if demand will come back or not. I'm not expecting anything exceptionally good looking forward.</p>
          <p>But, clearly, good loans are available to do it and they must be good enough in term of risk. They must be good enough in term of price. In this moment, I'm not prepared to any compromise in term of quality of lending and in term of quality &#x2013; in term price of our lending. So we will continue to be very selective, maybe also sacrificing something in term of revenues. But in a moment like this one, quality is first.</p>
          <p>Then there was another question about capital. Let me see, repatriation of capital. I don't know. To be honest, we have never tried so far to repatriate any capital, also because we were looking to see the effect of Basel 3 on our banks. As you can see &#x2013; probably you're referring mostly to Germany, but keep in mind that Germany showed the Basel 3 kick in. Germany would be the most affected in the group because investment banking business is booked and managed from Germany. So, what we see looking forward for dividends? If we look at the recent past, we've not seen any problem to distribute dividends from Germany and the other countries. I don't remember the number one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was related to the higher risk weighting of Italian banks in general. What is the connection in your view to the more broad disclosure of NPLs? And how much of the high risk weighting you think is linked to this higher disclosure of NPLs in Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this moment, I don't recall the right numbers, I remember that three months ago, we have done exercise internally to compare ourselves to European peers in term of calculating, for example, probably coverage, let's say, coverage ratio and applying the rules of Bank of Italy to other geographies substantially would have been in line with the European average.</p>
          <p>So this means that in terms of provisioning and classification of impaired loans, the rules in Italy are quite strict. Our risk weighted asset, that is no clear evidence from everybody how much will be the impact. We know that in some products, like mortgages, Bank of Italy is more strict than other Central banks. So theoretically speaking, normalization of the rules should help the Italian banks, but, at least, we have not seen any specific number in this respect. So it's more like a guessing rather than an effective number to discuss.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Ms. Francesca Tondi of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thanks for your time. I will stick to two questions as well. And I apologize in advance, I don't mean to be confrontational, I mean it in a very constructive way. You say you find you're on track on your business plan. And I'm a little bit missing here the point, so if you could help me. If I'm looking at your revenues for the first nine months and I take out the gain on the debt in Q1, you annualize &#x20AC;25 billion. Your target from business plan next year is &#x20AC;27.6 billion, your short nearly 10% there.</p>
          <p>If I'm looking on loan loss provisions, you're averaging 123 basis points in the nine months. The target is 90 bps next year. You just told us it's unlikely you're going to see improvement until perhaps later in the year, that again makes a difference of probably at least &#x20AC;1.5 billion, so you're running quite short there. You are doing better on cost, you're annualizing &#x20AC;15.1 billion. That's &#x20AC;200 million better than the target next year. You probably will continue to go down, but it just doesn't seem enough to get you to the level where you were hoping to be for next year. So, can you please just tell us a little bit more where can you tighten more, what can you do to actually improve that trajectory?</p>
          <p>And the second question somewhat also relates to that. You've been talking of more rationalization in Central Europe, the merger of Czech Republic and Slovakia is helpful. But can you do more, especially in the tail? I can see, for example, Commerzbank has been selling Bank Forum, Ukraine. Erste is also discussing that. What more can you do? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think you do have a lot of potential here. So I mean it in a very constructive way. But with the stock trading up 0.4 tangible book, I think the market is telling you that they want to see more work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for the questions. You were not confrontational. I mean, I think we are mixing up a bit, let's say, the financial target versus the action that we're doing in vis-&#xE0;-vis the pillars of our plan. It's clear that we are down in term of revenues. And as I said, when we started this presentation about the strategic plan, I said that we have a problem in term of volumes. So we are down in term of revenues. And it's also obvious, as I said, that we are up in term of loan loss provisions. This I think is due mostly to not to the failure of implement the plan, but to the external macroeconomic conditions.</p>
          <p>We are not &#x2013; just to clarify this issue, we are not coming with the review of the plan in term of financial target. For now because I think that we have still too high level of unpredictability in the medium term in order to review the plan. We will see later on. Our objective today was to show that what is in our hands is progressing well and in some areas also better than expected. Obviously, the plan is a target all the time you &#x2013; and, we think we can do for sure or we try to do better in term of cost. We have a number of activities ongoing, trying to improve the results of the group versus the plan.</p>
          <p>We have approved a couple of months ago, for example, this large project, Newton, that should bring to us in the next 10 years &#x20AC;1 billion saving. In terms of cost this was not included in our plan, for example, plus other activities ongoing. On the revenue side, in this moment we are suffering, obviously, quite a lot. As I said, the volumes are down much more than expected. We'll see if 2013 will give some signal of recoveries or not, same in term of provisions. So we will try to accelerate on the plan. That for sure, we cannot compensate on a short-term what is the negative effect of the revenue side and on the cost of risk side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when do you think you can update us more perhaps on the more cost <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:14) because clearly the gap is getting bigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this moment, again, I think we have to wait and see if the market will stabilize, especially to understand when this recession will be at the bottom and we start to see some recovery. At this moment, especially in Italy, it's really difficult to imagine. We have an election in between, so not immediately for sure. We will see some months from now. Going to CEE, yes, I'm confirming that we have a number of, let me say, discussions, ideas ongoing. I hope we'd be in the position to announce something in the near future. More than this I cannot say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Same, it will be possible technically from late January. So, let's see three months from now and we'll decide. The position in terms of liquidity is good, but as I said, the market is what it is, and so it's better to take decision last minute rather than decide in advance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Giovanni Carriere of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two quick questions. On page 17, when you showed the dropping coverage ratio for Italy, I know there seems to have been sales and write offs. Are you able you give us, if you want, an adjusted coverage ratio, at least the size of the NPL sale? Because all we can track from the outside is the <mark type="ph" /> advent ratio (52:00). And obviously, the drop is large given that, as you've shown in slide 45, the inflow of new NPLs is accelerating.</p>
          <p>Number two, the trend in NII, both retail Italy and CIB Italy, are quite weakened. They don't seem to be consistent with the data on spreads and yield that you show us in slide 10. Is it because you have changed the transfer prices you're applying to Italy or actually the underlying trends in Italy are significantly worse than what you have in slide 10? And then lastly just really detail, it's not a question, Russian NII in the quarter was up 17%, is it real underlying improvement? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, starting from Russia, Russia business is very simple. So substantially, it's, let me say, corporate business. So I would say that this increase is mostly entirely a real business. I don't know the exact details, but it's real. Russia, just to give you an idea, is the second best performer in the group this year in term of results. So we are very satisfied about what's going on out there. So, it's real business and is good business.</p>
          <p>In term of NII Italy, well, transfer price, we have a very, let's say, stable policy here. We are not subsidizing the business, so the transfer price is in the hands of the CFO, and in this manager &#x2013; in the interest of the group not in the interest of any single business, so maybe this is affecting the results versus other peers, I don't know.</p>
          <p>What we see in Italy is, as I said, from our side, volumes are down and this is for everybody. We have a &#x2013; we are repositioning our portfolio. Once again, we are trying to move to the best customers in term of writing &#x2013; reducing our exposure from writing from six up to nine, and we have seen some results also in the last months. So, there is a reduction of volumes also due to this action of reducing the most risky customers.</p>
          <p>We are very strict in term of pricing, as I said. We want to avoid situation of having our, let's say, portfolio priced too low and losing money, something that is happening today with some lending done in periods like 2007 and 2008 when the liquidity was very cheap and the spreads for customer as well, but now we are suffering. So we want to keep our price to a level that at least our cost of equity is paid, and strong attention on quality.</p>
          <p>As we said, <mark type="ph" /> we could do (55:36) maybe more in term of volumes, but in this moment, we are concentrated on quality of our lending. So, this explain the trend in Italy. Then the reality is also that there is no demand on medium term, long term, and there's only, let me say, substitution of what is going to expire in this moment in term of short term.</p>
          <p>Finally, UniCredit is very active on capital market business. If we look the large corporates in Italy, there is a quite significant decline on the loans stock. That's simply because we have been very active in the corporate bond issue. We are now number two in Europe in term of bond issue. We have issued 120, I think. I don't remember now the number. So we are number two in Europe and this clearly contributes in some way to the reduction of the volumes for the large corporation. Recently, we've been the first bank we have issued bond also for a medium size company following the new law introduced by the Italian government and probably we try to push other companies to diversify their source of funding, so moving from loans to bonds. For the NPLs coverage ratio, maybe give the microphone to Marina to explain with precise numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the coverage of impaired went down 103 basis points over the quarter. And the two main contributor of these dynamics are for 53 basis points a mix effect, as already commented, and 64 basis point the coverage within the non-performing loans. The mix effect, again, has been mainly driven by positive growth out of the total amount of impaired stock, while on within Sovereigns and non-performing loans, as already commented, we have a specific client left the perimeter. This client with a coverage of 87%, by leaving that has diluted the coverage of non-performing loans. So, within the perimeter of the contribution, I would say, of these clients has been almost 30 basis point within non-performing loans in term of dilution. So, to give you the sense of the main dynamics there.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Giovanni Razzoli at Equita SIM. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody. Very quick questions. The first one is again on coverage. I was wondering whether do you feel the pressure as kind of regulatory pressure to increase your coverage ratio in Italy? Or if you do feel the necessity to increase the &#x2013; revise the valuation of the collateral, so that in the Q4 we may see some increase in the coverage ratio in Italy?</p>
          <p>And my second question is again on the cost. You've mentioned and detailed a lot of actions you're implementing to offset the negative trend in terms of revenues. I was wondering if relative to your business plan targets in 2013, the new elements are represented by the &#x20AC;100 million of savings you mentioned in the page number 36. And from the benefits of the outsourcing contract, the Newton project that you have quantified in &#x20AC;1 billion in 10 years? Thank you. If these are the two new elements relative to the business plan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of coverage, let me say, regulatory pressure not specifically to us. It's clear that all central banks in this period are watching what banks are doing. We feel comfortable with our coverage ratio right now, but in term of revision of collaterals, if we do it we may have some positive surprise for UniCredit, because good part, for example, of the real-estate collaterals UniCredit has never been reviewed, but if we would do it, we will increase our collateral rather than the opposite, and probably something we will do looking forward.</p>
          <p>So, I am not concerned about the revision of collaterals. Let's remind everybody that the way Bank of Italy is requesting Italian banks to cover their impaired loans is different from other regulators. In term of restructured loans, for example, we do impairments, banks from other countries don't do. And this is why I said at the beginning of the Q&amp;A that if we would apply the same rules we will be &#x2013; we UniCredit &#x2013; they're exactly at the average of the other European peers.</p>
          <p>So I'm not expecting, let's say, a specific request from regulators, but what banks are doing in this period of time is obviously under scrutiny. Newton is large set of initiatives that we have presented to our board. I think it was July this year, has never been, let's say, properly disclosed to the market because it was a set of actions in different areas related to IPC and corporate centers. Certain numbers already started. When we will have &#x2013; we are very confident that the number can be achieved, otherwise why to go in front of our board.</p>
          <p>I think it's better to communicate concrete results when we will have concrete results, because it's a short-term, medium-term plan. But again, these are undergoing. In some areas, it is also quite, let me say, revolutionary because we need also innovation and new ideas in order to keep cost down and to simplify the overall structure of the growth. So as soon as we will have concrete numbers, we will come back to you. But the plan is there, it's ongoing, approved and we're working on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one, as I understand the macro hedge you have in place, what was the effect in terms of interest income support? And the second &#x2013; well, for the third quarter or possibly for the full year. And the second question will be, if you can talk about the asset quality in the Italian corporate sector and, in particular, in the SME sector beside the big ticket you have seen this quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, Marina.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About replicating portfolio, so you know that &#x2013; and as replicating portfolio I meant the net amount of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:18) not contractually linked to market parameter. So for which we are putting in place an hedging strategy. We realized &#x20AC;350 million approximately in this quarter and if we look at the full year P&amp;L it's &#x20AC;935 million. So these are two figures for hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the asset quality, I will say that if we look at the corporate sector, including also small business, I would say that last corporate doesn't show in Italy any specific criticality. In our case also small business is by far under control and in term of quality better than expected. So far we don't see major criticalities. What we see &#x2013; where we criticality it is more on SMEs, and let me say mid-corporate. Also, in this case, it depends on segment, sector of activities. It depends also a lot on the kind of activity &#x2013; on the export side.</p>
          <p>So the companies that are exporting, overall, they show a much better result than the one that are pure domestic. They have better cash flow. They depend much less from banks because the cash flow is better. And they are growing because they're exporting in market, growing faster in this moment than in Italy. So I would concentrate &#x2013; we will concentrate the attention on SMEs/mid corporate because it's the area where we see the real problems. On the individual side, mortgages, the situation as well is quite okay. So we don't see significant increase in term of impaired loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So can you &#x2013; how much of your total SME would you say are this export type that you're citing more or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look the geographical exposure, UniCredit, I would say that 70% of our business is in North Italy and there a large part of the companies are doing export.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we never &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; at least, I don't have this number, but I think that something between 30% to 40% of the companies they are active exporters in our portfolio. Just to elaborate a bit more, we have launched recently, what we call, UniCredit International, it's a plan to bring for the first time abroad Italian companies that have never been on the export side is a project that is giving very good results.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of the year, we have brought for the first time 6,000 new companies. We are today number one in the export business in Italy. We want to consolidate in increasing our position in the sector also leveraging on the international presence of UniCredit. Anyway, for sure, minimum 30%, maximum 40% should be the range of companies doing exports.</p>

          <p>Yes, I have three different questions. The question number one is, you mentioned about this book of &#x20AC;48 billion of ring fenced loans, and you also talked about that there has been a run-off of &#x20AC;16 billion of these loans. Does it mean, just as a clarification, that the existing size of that ring fenced book is now &#x20AC;32 billion give or take the fence? And this is my first question. And then I have another two other questions totally unrelated.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>&#x20AC;48 billion risk weighted asset &#x2013; we can be precise maybe later on, but something between &#x20AC;32 billion to &#x20AC;35 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Then the second question is related to an answer you gave or an explanation you gave earlier on about your willingness of &#x2013; be, on one side, not to compromise on quality and not to compromise on price on loan. If that is correct, it means that your loan growth is going to be very low, because the good credit will want in this market and can obtain in this market a good price. You should not prepare to compromise on quality and you're not prepared to compromise on price, I don't see how you can grow your loan book at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other thing -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The good credit start to get &#x2013; be able to get good conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Either from you or from BNL or Intesa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree, but not completely. Meaning, first of all, we have &#x2013; when I say price, I mean also not necessarily rate one, rate two of customers. So we have customers rate at four or five, six that is where we stop in considering good credit let's say, in this moment, needs loans and let's be very open, the capability of banks to serve this customer is not in this moment so high. So hypothetically, there is space for growing loans. As I said, in this moment, we don't feel the need to compromise because price is very important. It's a matter of discipline that you have to learn in our network.</p>
          <p>Then, obviously, our way of calculating the profitability is not limited to the price or to the loans. We have a KPI that is about return and net of cost of risk, but is also KPI given to all relationship manager that includes also the cross-selling. So, we look also the overall return of the relationship. Also, here we don't &#x2013; we try to limit our business with customer that shows an overall return below a certain level. Customers with a very top rate, yes, you're right they can go to several banks, but again customers in this moment they are as well very carefully in not looking only to price, but looking also all they have in front of them. So, not necessarily they turn to banks. They have the best, best price. This is quite obvious in period like this one.</p>
          <p>Finally, on our side, we are quite active. I mentioned this already in &#x2013; tried to push companies to diversify their source of funding, because one of the major problem that I see in the Italian industrial sector versus other countries in Europe is the excess dependents from banks. So, we need to create more effective, broad terms, capital market business. We may lose or something in term of net interest income, but we can get something you return in term of ratings that means less risk weighted asset because the increase of risk weighted asset is also linked to the deterioration of the ratings. And we can have in any case still fees and commission and leverage on cross selling.</p>
          <p>So, volumes, again, they are down now. We will see in the near future. But it's not so automatic that if you are demanding in term of price you lose the best customers. In any case, to avoid adverse selection of customers is clearly recommendation that goes to our network when it's really indispensable, provided that the overall relationship is showing a certain a level of profitability, specifically, so we can accept lower level, but these are more exceptional levels.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then a final question, if I may. Thank you. And then a final question, if I may, is on the what you said earlier on about the dividend and what you are implicitly accruing inside your Tier 1. And you said that you're accruing the average of the last three years of dividend and because there has been a 10:1 share split and I know one in two capital increase. I mean, I have &#x2013; I could come to different version of that kind of Algebra. Can you tell us what is the implicit dividend that you are factoring in in your Tier 1 and explicit this average of the last three years, which it's kind of prone to interpretation?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. One is back to the coverage point in Italy. If you can elaborate a little bit in how long you think you can go, basically? And if you can go significantly below 40%, considering that probably most of the past due loans today will end up becoming Sovereigns, which, obviously, will require higher coverage.</p>
          <p>And on this point, if you can give us a little bit of color basically on which is the percentage of NPLs with collateral and the split of types of collateral between real estate and personal guarantees? And then, the second question is on the net interest income in Italy as well. Obviously, you've been talking about loan repricing, which is something naturally other banks in Italy also talking about, but can you do anything on the funding costs? I'm thinking about shortening the duration of some your funding instruments, be the retail or wholesale? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somebody here was joking was about the question, when you said, how far, how down we can go, one said to zero I think. This is not the answer. Now, I say seriously, the coverage &#x2013; again, I don't want to give guidance, but I think that we are comfortable at the end with this level, and I don't see substantial changes looking forward, one way or the other one. So, in the next &#x2013; I'm talking about the next two or three quarters, so we should maintain the coverage at this level also because going back to a question put before in term of collaterals, we feel we are okay right now. So no meaningful change is expecting in a short period of time. The composition of collaterals...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't publish this quarter. So we publish on the half year in the table of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:41) accounts, the composition between the different capacities. So if you look at June <mark type="ph" /> coverage (1:17:54), these things are still reliable, no big changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on funding costs, well, as in this case, I don't know if we provided this number. So let's say that the funding cost is line with our expectation. Meaning, we had quite difficult start &#x2013; first half of the year when Sovereign risk reached a very high level. We have seen constantly the funding cost going down in the second half of the year with a couple of cover bond for Italy being issued quite recently, the prize that has been 100 basis point below the BTP level. Now, what is good for us is the trend on the deposit side because on the deposit side we have to keep in mind that most of the deposits, or better to say direct funding to deposits and retail bonds, most of the deposits are still deposit at sites, so with interest paid below 100 basis point. So the trend on the deposit side is comfortable in term of liquidity, but also in keeping down the cost of funding under control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you were asking about the duration of the funding plan that you had on page 21 of the presentation, where you had a breakdown in term of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:45) of the &#x20AC;31 billion. And I don't have here the overall one, but on average we have four years &#x2013; between four and five years of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:00) include network bonds is between four years and five. So which is <mark type="ph" /> the design of the duration (1:20:11) of the overall plan.</p>
          <p>Let me add also that, for sure, to this year and next year are going to mature <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:24) in the fourth quarter. And for the next year we have &#x20AC;24.9 billion maturing. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:33) capital bonds of senior covenant, and, for sure, also the new issue will be lower than those which we did during the first of part of the year that will be at higher rates than what is maturing since our maturing issues are older by three, four years. So, again, which we're at the lower level of rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the other side, the major effort that has been done to reduce the funding gap has been done in Italy. If I remember, then we reduced <mark type="ph" /> &#x20AC;35 billion (1:20:59) or even more billions, the funding gap here improving. Deposits are keeping volumes under control in term of loans. So this is generating less needs of funding for the Italian operations. So the most expensive funding in term of volume, in term of need is decreasing. We don't have this problem, obviously, when we go to the market through Germany or Austria, because the cost is definitely different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So net-net -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are not using at this moment cross border funding because of the ring-fencing situation in Europe. But, hopefully, especially for banking unions, we'll kick-in. UniCredit will be one of the bank that will benefit for sure in term of P&amp;L from more freedom we can assume if banking union will become in term of transfer of funding from one country to another one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So net-net, I mean considering that the rates are very close to zero already and assuming no changes on that front, I mean do you consider Q3 run rate in Italy in top line some sort of a decent run rate for the future, everything put together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not, I was thinking now. Not in a short period of time. I'm not expecting big changes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Andrea Vercellone of Exane. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions on my side. The first one is on Basel 3. Thanks a lot for the update. I just wanted to know how much of the 137 basis points impact is a day one impact, and how much of that is actually phased until 2019? And the day one impact, is it all RWA driven i.e. in other words, can you give us the number?</p>
          <p>Second question, again, on net interest income. Instead of isolating a specific country, a specific division, we have seen net interest income for obvious reasons declining every single quarter for yourself and for your peers. We've had a conference call before yours, which wasn't so optimistic on any improvement in Q4. Having seen the number for October I imagine, do you believe that you're more likely to witness a downwards &#x2013; a further downward trends in Q4, or you think it could go up? Thank you &#x2013; at group level, I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For the second question, I'm not, let's say, particularly optimistic about Western Europe, about Italy specifically. But the position of UniCredit is a bit different compared to the other bank you were mentioning before, because we look to Central-Eastern Europe and Poland, where still we see net interest income obviously improving. On the Western Europe and specifically Italy, I don't know if we are at the bottom. I don't see significant, for sure, improvement or I don't see improvement for the current quarter. Again, demand is still low and once again our approach is quite conservative. Our mix is different anyway compared to Intesa, because Italy for us is 40% of the revenues also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but you have already also reported similar trends in Germany and Austria, which was quite unexpected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I am saying, Western Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Italy, for sure, is &#x2013; we don't see any signal of picking up. Germany and Austria is a different situation, is more a problem of companies cash rich rather than a problem of demand because of recession. But, obviously, also up there, we cannot see significant changes fourth quarter versus third quarter. Different is in Central Eastern Europe where the positive trend is confirmed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, clear.</p>

          <p>For Basel 3...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On risk weighted assets, I would say that the impact which is kick-in from inception is almost 10% of the 137 basis point, I would say, 15 basis point. And we are giving to you the total amount of 60 risk weighted assets driven, but the remaining portion is driven by capital deduction, so all the other components which go against capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one clarification. Do you believe that these deductions are going to be day one deductions? I'm referring in particular to unrealized losses on bonds &#x2013; well, mainly that because minorities are phased, ETAs are phased. So I don't really see what is left to deduct on day one in terms of capital, to be honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that you're right. There are phasing of result as long as the impact is not going to be the whole &#x2013; from the beginning of the application of Basel 3. So we will see also, if it's in for the deduction of capital.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question is from Ms. Anke Reingen of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, Madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Anke from RBC. I just wanted to &#x2013; sorry, I could &#x2013; didn't understand the numbers on Basel 3. If you could please repeat them? But then I actually had two questions please. The first is on costs where you have made significant progress, but I just wondered if you're willing to give some more guidance where you expect this could turn out in terms of a cost income ratio. You are 60% at the nine months stage. And I think your target implied like 55% for 2013 and 50% for 2015. Now, I understand that's, obviously, somewhat changed, but I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand where &#x2013; which target cost income ratio you were thinking of? And then just coming back to the macro hedge, is there like a maturity you might be worried about, or is it too prolonged? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Basel 3, you need the ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I'd say, you're asking the total impact. Total impact is disclosed in our presentation, 137 basis points. My comment was that a portion of risk-weighted assets impact is almost 60 basis points, half of this impact. The remaining part is deduction from capital. And your question, which has been raised, was how much is going to materialize at inception, starting from January 2013. And the comment has been that, I would see, only 10% of the total impact will materialize at the first year, so beginning 2013 &#x2013; end of 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of cost income, say, on a short-term basis, we see the cost income under pressure, clearly, in the sense that we have the cost income that is stable, growing due to the revenue side rather cost in Western Europe. In CEE, we have the opposite trend. So the cost of income is improving, but the weight of CEE is not enough to compensate what's happening in Western Europe. So I don't think we will have &#x2013; we will see significant changes looking short-term. We continue to be more or less around this level. If we talk about 2015, is really too early to say now and in this market three years is a long period of time. We will see. Today, I'm not feeling in the position to give you any guidance for such a longer period of time.</p>

          <p>On hedging, if I understood correctly your question. We are accruing the hedging. And we &#x2013; the question was could we extend the hedging, for sure, we can extend the time of expiring of the <mark type="ph" /> data (1:29:55) which is going to happen at condition, which will not be the same. So we might not have the same impact at P&amp;L as the one I have described before. I apologize, but we're running late. So probably there is room for only the very last question and we have to close.</p>

          <p>Hi, good evening, and thank you for your time. My question is, before you gave us some prudent comments on the top line, on NII, when I look at your balance sheet, there is a line which is cash and cash balances, which went from &#x20AC;31.5 billion in 2012 to &#x20AC;6.1 billion in September 2012. So there is a significant drop. And I assume by the look of it that you have probably reinvested some of the overnight deposits that HVB had with the European Central Banks. So I don't know when this has been done. And in case, if there is a positive impact coming out of this on the top line, as I assume there would be, and on this basis what is your guidance on NII? And what can we quantify as a positive impact to offset deterioration in margins and whatnot? Thank you.</p>

          <p>The positive impact is not yet in the figures in the sense that, here we have only a shift of the total amount. As you can &#x2013; if you look at the presentation on page 19, you will see at the bottom, there is a note &#x2013; a footnote, whereby we are explaining that &#x20AC;21 billion approximately have been shift from overnight deposits, which were posted in cash and cash balances to compulsory reserves, i.e., in loans to bank. So before we have now lower level of net interbank, but looking at the Basel, which is on the central graph, you see that are more or less stable, the figures, we include in the interbank and also the component of the cash and cash balances.</p>
          <p>So at the end, here, it's &#x2013; I would call it sort of reclassification of the liquidity you have mentioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we shouldn't expect any impact on the top line, basically?</p>
