          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Here with me are Eduardo Solorzano, our President and CEO of Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico and Federico Casillas. I would like to begin by saying that I think results were very good, as we faced both a challenging economic environment and a comparison versus a very good quarter for sales for last year. In the short term, though we had a quarter of mixed results from our different business formats, we had some good trends like in the case of expenses. Despite the additional cost associated with the bank, the general expenses grew 12.3% versus 14.4% increase in sales. Return on equity for the last 12 months to March, plus 26.6% while return on capital employed was 29.1%. Also, before I turn it to Eduardo, I would like to remind you that starting this year, we are reporting a nominal figure for both years, 2008 and 2007.</p>

          <p>Rafael, thank you very much and good afternoon to everybody. I think that not only the quarter was challenging, but the economic environment for the rest of the year is full of uncertainty. But Rafael, we have to admit that this doesn't come as a surprise, it is something that we have assumed when we built our business plan for 2008 and it is also something that, as you say, give us an opportunity, an opportunity to differentiate more, an opportunity to become more relevant to the consumer and an opportunity to build customer trust. And I have to say that I feel good about customer trust. Customers have been more cautious on their spending, but they continue to come to our stores and we continue to see a very good trend in term of customer growth. During the first quarter, customer increased 6.6% in comparable stores versus first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding average ticket, while we are generally not treated by lack of growth, we have to concentrate on reaching our goals without such increase, and so we need to grow by gaining more customers, improve our value proposition to become more relevant for them and ensure good execution and efficiencies. Whenever the recovery comes, we will be already have more customers with us, and we will be in a good position to serve them better, and to leverage efficiencies.</p>
          <p>And as Rafael said, <mark type="inaudible" /> for the different formats as they have been for the last 12 months now. As you know, the formats that have been more effective have been Suburbia and Vips and probably the <mark type="inaudible" /> of our self-service formats have done and are not well reflected in the results.</p>
          <p>The mix of sales and the different &#x2013; of the different performance of our formats certainly impact results, something for the good and something for the bad. When a format like Suburbia or the restaurants perform much better, like in 2006 or much worse like in this quarter, it certainly impacts consolidated results. More importantly, it measures such as gross margin where there is greater difference between the formats.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I still think that we have a promising growth opportunities in Mexico and I'm convinced that the short-term challenges will only make us a better company. Now, let me go into some of the different activities that we have at our stores and restaurants.</p>
          <p>The first one has to do with improving our price differential. We rolled back prices for over 1,000 items at Supercenter and Bodega Aurrera. In March, we changed our menu, introducing certain concepts such as price reduction with upgraded menu, soft drink refills and breakfast packages with juice and fruit included. We also had credit programs such as 18-month interest-free special sales in selective GM merchandise I mean categories at Sam's Club from February 29th to March 2nd, with a very good result both in traffic and average ticket.</p>
          <p>Another of our main strategies for the year is to win in fresh. A fresh is a key category for the weekly shopping. We reinforced our freshness commitment in Supercenter, Bodega and Superama, called Doble Garant&#xED;a de Frescura or Doble Garant&#xED;a for freshness. If a customer comes in, buys some and go home and is not satisfied with the product, the customer can come back to the store, we return the money and we also give her or he another product free of the same type that she or he was looking for.  In the case of Supercenter, we launched an advertising campaign around this commitment, which was supported with in-store improvement in layout, new fixtures and a 360-degree communication campaign with TV, radio, billboards, etcetera.</p>
          <p>Aiming to make the most of all seasons and also reinforcing fresh, we had a very good <mark type="inaudible" /> sale. We focused on price differential assortment and inventories, good exhibition and communication to our customers. We also launched a new private line of frozen fish filet with very, very good results. As an example of customers focus, Sam's had replaced your old TV promotion to switch our members from QTVs to LCD plasma technology, that's posted a 15% growth on the electronics category.</p>
          <p>And regarding the innovations, we will be launching a design contest named <mark type="inaudible" /> Suburbia, a plate of worth combined that Suburbia has created, targeted to Mexican apparel design students. Winner design will be presented in one of our private labels for next season.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have some initiatives with regards to our social responsibility objective. As you know, one thing that we consider important is sustainability and sustainability also help us to offer better assortment. We have our first in-store sustainability event with a special exhibition of sustainable growth in Supercenter and Superama. We have hotspots with organic growth, compact fluorescent bulbs, water savings and biodegradable <mark type="inaudible" /> products. Also in February, we opened the first restaurant using sun energy to heat water, this is a bit as you may address.</p>
          <p>And in late January, Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico <mark type="inaudible" /> and the Secretary of the Economy formalized the SME development program with the purpose of including more small and medium-sized companies within our supply chain. Pilot tests were conducted in Mexico City and also in the state of Mexico, Tabasco, Nuevo Leon, and Jalisco. I am very proud to let you know that for eight consecutive occasions, we were recognized as a social responsible company by the Mexican Center of Philanthropy, CEMEFI, and the Alliance of Social Responsibility in Mexico, AliaRSE.</p>
          <p>And now let me leave you with Federico.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Eduardo. Starting with sales, we continued to see good growth in customer count with a 13.4% total increase during the quarter. In terms of comp stores, all self-service formats had increases in number of customers, being the greatest at Bodega Aurrera and Supercenters, for Suburbia and Vips <mark type="inaudible" />. And regarding average ticket, the best performer was Sam's Club that had positive growth and the weakest was Suburbia.</p>
          <p>Regarding the different regions, the best performing during the quarter were Southeast, Southwest, and Central region. Gross margin, as Eduardo mentioned, was affected by the performance of the different products. In the case of self-service, we saw an increase in gross margin versus last year, which was offset by the under-performance of Suburbia and Vips.</p>
          <p>Rafael has already talked about the growth in general expenses. This improvement allow for operating income and EBITDA to increase 70%, greater than the 14% increase in sales. It is important to mention that without the bank operations, operating expenses declined 32 basis points and operating margin increased 43 basis points from the last year level.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at some balance sheet items. As of the end of the first quarter of 2008, our cash position amounted to 8,614 million pesos. This figure is equivalent to $809 million. During the first quarter of the year, the company invested 1.6 billion pesos, equivalent to $154 million in fixed assets and repurchased 19.6 million shares for an amount of 753 million pesos, equivalent to $71 million. Regarding inventories, we had a 0.8% increase, that's with last year's first quarter. Our installed capacity grew 11.6% and sales 14.4%. Accounts payable to suppliers decreased 5.5%, still we have one more payday during the quarter. Without this effect, we will have posted a 6.7% growth in accounts payable to suppliers.</p>
          <p>Now, I will leave you with Rafael Matute.</p>

          <p>I would finally like to mention that this year, the dividend will be paid on the second quarter. This is on April the 18th. Shareholders can opt for a cash payment of 59 Mexican cents per share or a stock payment of one share for each 77.12 shares that they own. Shareholders that decide to receive the payment in stock must notify the decision before April the 15th. Thanks again, and I'll remind you that we will be available to receive any calls -- the questions that you may have regarding this conference call. Thank you.</p>
