        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Martin, and best wishes to everyone on the line for the New Year. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings conference call. And I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Monsanto's Chairman and CEO; by Terry Crews, our CFO; and by our Chief Technology Officer, Rob Fraley. Also joining me is Laura Meyer, my colleague in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we're webcasting this call. You can access it at Monsanto's website at monsanto.com. The replay is also available at that address. And for those of you who would like to go to our website, the slides for this call are posted on the Investor Information page.</p>
          <p>We're providing you with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures in the slides and in the earnings press release.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-K and today's press release.</p>
          <p>Today's conference call features our fourth annual review of our R&amp;D pipeline results. In addition to Rob's remarks, I'll take you through the first quarter results. Hugh will provide a strategic and operational outlook, and Terry will address our increase in guidance for the 2009 fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the first quarter, as shown on slide four. Gross profit rose by 49%, which more than flowed through to net income as both SG&amp;A and R&amp;D as a percent of sales were lower as compared with the first quarter last year. This coupling of growth with financial discipline resulted in ongoing earnings of $0.98 for the first quarter compared with $0.45 of ongoing EPS in the comparable period.</p>
          <p>While we anticipated certain discrete tax events that would take the full-year tax rate to roughly 30%, several of those occurred earlier than anticipated. This resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in the quarter.</p>
          <p>From an operations perspective, the first quarter is all about Latin America, as we highlight on slide five. Across the region, gross profit rose by more than 80%, with Roundup gross profit doubled and Corn Seeds and Traits gross profit rose by more than 50%.</p>
          <p>From a Roundup perspective it was a standout quarter driven by Brazil, where our significant levels of prepayments for Roundup in the last year's fourth quarter flowed through at the higher sales from both volume and price increases.</p>
          <p>Latin America as a whole continues to shift to premium corn seed hybrids, and that combined with a richer trait mix in Argentina and Brazil specifically contributed to the gross profit improvement in the area.</p>
          <p>Based on our early read, we are on track to gain corn seed market share across the region, even as we are taking a cautious approach to credit through the second season in Brazil. These market share gains are expanding our leading seed footprint in Latin America, just as the region is emerging as a new player in biotech traits.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we expect to sell 1.5 to 2 million seeds per acres of YieldGard Corn Borer this fiscal year, at the high end of our original expectations. In Argentina, we likewise have sold more than 2 million acres of the newly improved double-stack corn. This is also above our original target, and the double-stack was roughly half of everything we sold in the DEKALB brand in Argentina this year.</p>
          <p>The pace of regulatory approvals in Brazil underscores the response we're seeing globally to the need for more grain. As we closed out the calendar year, we received Brazilian regulatory approval for Roundup Ready Corn and Cotton. We have seed production underway in the second season in Brazil so that we will have Roundup Ready Corn inventory to sell there in the fall of 2009.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the El Salvador government issued its first permits for biotech corn experimental trials, underscoring the importance and the value of the timing of our Cristiani seed acquisition in Central America.</p>
          <p>Moving from a world area to a segment look at the numbers, gross profit growth came both from Roundup and from Seeds and Traits, particularly corn and soybeans. Looking first at Roundup on slide six, the branded net selling price was up in every world area, as reflected in the gross margin list. The first quarter saw prices above our targeted 16 to $18 band, in line with our forecast that pricing would remain above that band for the full year.</p>
          <p>Volumes were down slightly, in part because of the drought in Argentina and in part because of a return to a more normal selling pattern in the United States. This year, we would anticipate that well over half of the volume in the U.S. will be sold in the third and fourth quarters, as we experienced in fiscal year 2007.</p>
          <p>Remember that in fiscal year 2008, early buying ahead of an announced February price increase pulled U.S. volumes into the first and second quarters.</p>
          <p>If you would turn to slide seven, gross profit for Corn Seeds and Traits improved by 41%, with a three point margin lift. In addition to the strong performance in Latin America, the U.S. also saw an uptick in Corn Seeds and Traits, in what was the very start of the upcoming shipping season.</p>
          <p>As we note on slide eight, soybean orders have been early and aggressive this year in the U.S., and the start of the sales season has reflected both higher volume and greater value in our early shipments. Soybean gross profit rose 31% as a result. While not a significant piece of our first quarter results, all indications are that the Roundup Ready soybean trait in Brazil appears to be on track to approach the 60% penetration mark this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Improvements in vegetable gross profit and margins in the quarter were a function of the addition of the De Ruiter business, even after the inventory step-up from that acquisition.</p>
          <p>As you'll see on slide nine, for the Seeds and Traits business as a whole, gross profit increased 37% and margins were up more than three percentage points compared with gross margins in the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to free cash flow, given the late harvest for corn in the U.S. and the corresponding extension of our prepayment deadline, free cash flow for the quarter was 124 million compared with 740 million at the end of November 2007. You see this as well on the deferred revenue line of the balance sheet, which was down 590 million in the year-to-year comparison.</p>
          <p>As Terry and Hugh will discuss shortly, the order pace and the level of prepayments for the U.S. market picked up in December, underscoring our commitment to market share growth in corn and soybeans.</p>
          <p>So at this time, I'd like to turn the call to Hugh, who will give a strategic outlook for the business.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Scarlett. Let me also wish you all the very best for the New Year. As you know in agriculture that New Year really starts in September, as Latin American farmers tuned up their planters and North American growers rolled out their combines. No one in this call will be surprised when I say that as we started our fiscal year 2009, the world was rapidly realtering its priorities in the face of a huge global economic downturn.</p>
          <p>While no business is recession proof, agriculture tends more than most to retain its intrinsic value in difficult times. Farming is a process that over time rewards foresight and patience and tends to punish the sudden impulse. To succeed, farmers have to make their best economic decisions based on consistency of performance and their own brand of portfolio management.</p>
          <p>As we saw with our stellar results in Latin America in the first quarter, even in these uncertain times farmers buy the best. Fundamentally, our ability in tough times to grow market share, increase trait penetration and lift the financial commitments is the difference to being a technology company in an agricultural industry dominated by commodities and unfortunately by commodity mentalities.</p>
          <p>These first four months of this fiscal year have been some of the most contentious that I can recall, given the level of concerns about our ability to sell world-class technology in a time of economic uncertainty and very aggressive competitive pressures. Through all this, my drumbeat for our team has been simple.</p>
          <p>We've created a category of groundbreaking technologies that are highly prized for the value that they deliver on the farm in good times and in bad, year after year. So we'll manage our operations for the long-term view and the decisions and tactics that we're implementing today feed this strategy through 2012.</p>
          <p>Our philosophy for growth remains simple. It's not particular or unique, but it is effective. Our objective is to optimize the variables of market share, price and trait penetration. So when you look out to the coming U.S. growing season, none of this is certain in the first week of January, but we do have some indicators. So today, here's what we know.</p>
          <p>First, in terms of volume, after a late start because of the delayed harvest, our order patterns for corn accelerated in December and have continued to be stronger than normal in the first week of January. Soybean orders continue to outpace the prior year. As we started the New Year, our orders represented more than 90% of our targeted sales in corn, in both DEKALB and American Seeds, and over 100% of our target in soybeans, again for Asgrow and American Seeds.</p>
          <p>Our order patterns, which suggest a stronger year for soybeans versus our original expectations of 70 million acres of beans and 90 million acres of corn, but it is far too early to declare acreage projections. For now, suffice it to say that we conservatively forecasted more corn and less soybeans and the toggle between the two will affect the final market share numbers.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of trait penetration, the trait mix in corn has improved yet again, with a 15% increase in triple-stack orders for our DEKALB and American Seed brands. And both brands will have more than 70% of their portfolio in triples versus 65% last year.</p>
          <p>As further validation of the value of innovation, our corn seeds customers look to have lifted their triple mix to 50% versus 40% last year. We continue to anticipate that there will be 34 to 35 million acres of Monsanto triple-stack planted this coming season, a 17 to 21% increase in triple penetration.</p>
          <p>Third, in terms of price, we stayed true to our pricing-to-value philosophy. The proof in the pudding, I think, is in the level of prepayments, that's cash in hand across all of our channels for both corn and soybeans. As of December 31, the prepayments were running 50% ahead of last year's. This signals strength in pricing as well as some volume increases.</p>
          <p>Against these factors we have a competitor whose strategy appears to be market share at any price. A fresh survey from late December shows that half of the growers who would typically purchase a competitive brand have been offered free corn seeds, and a quarter of those growers were offered free or discounted soybeans as the loss leader if they bought the competitor's corn.</p>
          <p>As the innovator and brand leader, we've chosen a price for the value that we've created and for our rich pipeline that's poised for commercialization. As we've triangulated volume, price and trait penetration, 2009 now looks to be our ninth consecutive year of share gains for corn in the U.S., with one to two points in DEKALB and one in American Seeds.</p>
          <p>Our original target was two plus points for DEKALB and one point for American Seeds. In the drive for optimization, we've chosen value per acre over deep discounting per share. The result, which has been true to our optimization philosophy, will be a more than 25% growth in gross profit for corn seeds and traits for the full fiscal year, with roughly a three point margin lift for corn year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In soybeans, after a long history of flat market share, our Asgrow brand will breakthrough with a one point market share gain this year, as the first one to two million some acres of Roundup Ready 2 Yield make their way onto farmers' fields.</p>
          <p>This year, more than any that I've ever seen, points to the difference between being a leader with sales innovation and a follower with a short-term commodity chemicals mindset. Pricing is a strategic decision for us and the value of the platform that we're selling today sets the stage for the technologies that we will be rolling out from now through the middle of the next decade. The relationship between value, market share and technology is particularly meaningful today, as Rob gets ready to unveil our fourth annual pipeline review.</p>
          <p>Across our crop platforms the story is the same, expand the footprint for our recent technologies and explode the penetration of our biotech traits. Our ability to earn the right to your investment is predicated on our ability to translate groundbreaking innovation into game changing products that deliver more yield for farmers on the same land at a lower cost.</p>
          <p>Even as we drive through the noise of blocking and tackling in a more challenging economic and a more challenging competitive environment, we've delivered a stunning first quarter based on performance in Latin America that's unmatched in agricultural industry.</p>
          <p>As a result, we lifted our guidance to the $4.40 to $4.50 range for ongoing EPS for the fifth consecutive year of 20% plus earnings growth, at the same time that we expect our free cash flow to now top $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>So as Rob will so eloquently argue, we're at the apex of yet another breakthrough in our technology offerings. As a technology and brand leader, we will stay the course, take our ninth consecutive year of corn share gains, grow our total Seeds and Trait gross profit by at least 15%, enrich our overall margins and set the stage to grow yet again with <mark type="inaudible" /> gains and blockbuster traits like Roundup Ready 2 Yield, SmartStax and the coming drought tolerance.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call over to Terry then for a financial view of our changing guidance for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hugh, and Happy New Year to everyone on the line. In the face of uncertainty over how the Latin America farmer would handle currency fluctuations, commodity prices and access to credit, we've delivered substantial increases in sales, gross profit and net income and have continued to invest in the future, all while controlling spending and working capital without resorting to restructuring.</p>
          <p>From this solid first quarter, as we show on slide nine, we can look forward and project an increase in our full-year ongoing EPS guidance to the 4.40 to 4.50 range. This equates to a lift of more than 20% over 2008 ongoing EPS, and our fifth consecutive year of 20% plus growth. And it continues to move us toward our commitment to more than double 2007 gross profit in 2012.</p>
          <p>As Scarlett and Hugh have noted, the strong start to the Latin America season is an enormous positive. And all signs point to the makings of a premium corn seed business there through our 2012 strategic plan. Our prudence in incenting prepayments for Roundup and repatriating cash early in the first quarter out of Brazil has paid off in our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>That said, we remain cautious from a credit perspective as we go into the second season in Brazil. We're confident in our market share objectives, but if necessary we will pass on the sale rather than chase risky debt, particularly for the Roundup business in Brazil. As Hugh mentioned, we now have several key indicators for the start of the critical U.S. growing season.</p>
          <p>As CFO, the one I've watched closest is prepayments. And on an apples-to-apples basis as of December 31, our prepayments in the U.S. for corn and soybeans across all three channels are up more than 50% compared with prepays at the end of December last year. The most significant piece of this is price, as you would expect for the technology and market leader. But volume is also a contributor given our market share expectations.</p>
          <p>That level of cash gives us the confidence to continue to expect share gains across crops and across channels, even as we face excessive discounting in the marketplace. There's a lot of noise in the marketplace right now, and it's important to keep in mind whether it's seeds or Roundup, our pricing is to the channel.</p>
          <p>Retailers ultimately decide what they charge the farmer and they can raise or lower the price of a bag of seed or a gallon of Roundup as best fits their business, without it affecting the net average selling price back to Monsanto. Given our strong start to the year, our first quarter has been much stronger than our historical patterns. From today's vantage point, EPS on a quarterly basis will continue to show our strongest results in the second and third quarters.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter will again be a small loss and a larger loss than what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008. This growth rate recognizes the substantial nature of the increase in the first quarter while maintaining a growth rate for the second and third quarters of approximately 10 to 12% over EPS in each of those two quarters last year.</p>
          <p>While we expect to see solid growth in our U.S. Seeds and Trait business, we would anticipate a lower Roundup profitability in Brazil and Asia in our second quarter. Free cash flow is expected to exceed our original $1.8 billion target, in line with our lift in earnings guidance, and assuming roughly $1 billion in capital spending. The first quarter level of free cash was down compared with the prior year's first quarter because of the timing of prepayments.</p>
          <p>You should expect to see us build our free cash position as we move through the next three quarters. On the working capital side, financial discipline again was key this quarter. And receivables as a percent of sales over the trailing 12 months declined to just under 15% versus 18.5% of sales through the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.</p>
          <p>Our DSOs in Brazil were the lowest in the company. And also inventories were flat at 25% to sales for the total company.</p>
          <p>We continued our steady repurchase of shares in the first quarter with another $75 million repurchased. As of December 31, we completed our initial $800 million authorization and have already started repurchasing shares against our second $800 million three year authorization.</p>
          <p>While the markets will ultimately sort out the number of acres of corn and soybeans grown in the Americas this year, Brazil and Argentina are likely to be on pace with 30 to 35 million acres of corn and 90 to 95 million acres of soybeans.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our forecast was for 90 million acres in corn, 70 million in soybeans and 8 million in cotton. The odds are high that these projections will be wrong and market share will move as the denominator moves. With our footprint, our technology reach and our pipeline of new products, our job is to leverage our innovation to drive yield regardless of the location or the crop.</p>
          <p>As always, we're relatively indifferent financially as to which crop is planted. A one million acre shift between corn and soybeans in the U.S. equates to 1 to $0.02 per share in favor of corn.</p>
          <p>In short, this has been a very good start to a year that started with a great amount of economic uncertainty and concerns about farmer liquidity and profitability. We have the bulk of the Latin America season already in hand and have seen our business perform well there across the board, while maintaining our tight credit policies.</p>
          <p>We now have a line of sight to a ninth consecutive year of market share growth in U.S. corn, combined with ample grower access to the leading trait technologies. We've protected our pristine balance sheet while still generating significant levels of free cash that we'll return to shareholders through a combination of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>We're confident enough to point to an increase in EPS guidance but cautious enough to know that we have to manage our operations, our spending and our working capital carefully in order to maintain our market leading position, advance our technologies and meet our commitments to you.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Terry, and good morning everybody. Sometimes in the focus of the day-to-day, it's easy to lose sight of the landscape of what's to come, set against the backdrop of what's been achieved in plant biotechnology within Monsanto.</p>
          <p>For the fourth consecutive year, we can report that our biotech pipeline progress is accelerating.</p>
          <p>If you would refer to slide 11, I'd point out to you several milestones in what was another truly exceptional year. First, six projects were either advanced phases or were added to the pipeline. Particularly exciting is that for the first time ever two projects moved from Phase 3 to Phase 4 after only having been in Phase 3 for one year. This would be the leading edge of our standard 12 to 24 months for that phase.</p>
          <p>Now as exciting as the movement in phase is, the projects that did so were even more compelling. Specifically, Monsanto has now submitted a regulatory package to the EPA for SmartStax, which will become the new standard in the marketplace as the most durable and highest yielding product for total weed and bug control in corn. We're the first company to request a refuge reduction for insect control, both above and below the ground. And as we start the New Year, we've submitted the first regulatory package for drought-tolerant corn to the FDA, widening the gap on the first-mover advantage for this blockbuster family of traits.</p>
          <p>I would view both of these as the tip of the proverbial iceberg in R&amp;D. Below these high level accomplishment is the R&amp;D engine that is fueling our future. This year we tested thousands of genes in hundreds of thousands of field events in hundreds of locations. And true to our research philosophy, we tapped into more than 1,400 technology related agreements, an increase of 40% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now all of this progress in biotechnology is underpinned by the power of our breeding program. In R&amp;D, just as it is in the marketplace, consistency of performance is key. Perhaps said another way, one year's worth of data doesn't make a yield trend. And it's worth reiterating then as you look on slide 12, that on a three year rolling average, we've demonstrated on farm an 8.8 bushel per acre competitive edge in corn and nearly a one bushel advantage in soybeans. What's new on this slide is some of our first data on our breeding efforts in cotton. And you will see that the new varieties we have ready for the Deltapine Land brand in 2009 out yielded the best that both we and the competition had to offer.</p>
          <p>I was in San Antonio just two days ago speaking with growers at the Cotton Beltwide meeting, and I can tell you that the interest in these new cotton varieties is quite high. And perhaps most notable on slide 12 is that black bar in the southern tier. We now have a variety that has out yielded triple nickel, the 555 variety that was the backbone of Deltapine land's success prior to our acquisition of them. And as we turn around the cotton business in the U.S., these breeding gains are going to be crucial to our success.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 gives you another visual of the depth and breadth of the biotech pipeline. Additionally, you'll see that we've added two new products. One is for the stack insect and weed control product in sugarcane, developed in conjunction with CanaVialis prior to our acquisition of this leading breeding group in Brazil. The other is the second generation of the insect protected Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans, which is being developed exclusively for the Brazilian market.</p>
          <p>As Scarlett noted, the pace of biotech trait approvals in Brazil is quickening, and that underscores the value of a research program that targets Brazil's unique agricultural needs.</p>
          <p>So let's start the in-depth review with two products that are entering the commercial realm. The first is Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans, as shown on slide 14. With the European Union import approval in hand, U.S. growers have the full freedom to plant this game changing technology. This year's varieties have already been selected and the 1.5 million acres for the two maturity zones that we have in hand are already spoken for in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The reason for this is clear if you turn to slide 15. We are consistently delivering a yield advantage of 7% plus in just the limited number of varieties we'll have available for the 2009 growing season. In 2010, you'll see the full force of our soybean breeding program combined with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait, as we explode through the majority of the maturity zones and bring 5 to 6 million acres of product to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Roundup Ready 2 Yield has been the perfect marriage between breeding and biotech. On its own the yield advantage is huge and this will ultimately drive share over the competitive Optimum GAT product that is late to launch and fails to offer farmers an added yield benefit.</p>
          <p>Strategically, Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans becomes the platform for stacking dicamba herbicide tolerance, a bevy of oil traits and our yield genes, the latter of which I will discuss in a minute. We and we alone are changing the face of soybean production and value creation for growers.</p>
          <p>I often say that Roundup Ready 2 Yield is to soybeans as SmartStax is to corn. Both our platforms have the greatest durability that become the base trait package for everything else you see listed for our corn and soybean pipeline.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 16, one of the key components of SmartStax is the second generation of YieldGard Corn Borer for above the ground insect control. This product has demonstrated a 4% yield advantage over our first generation product.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, the EPA has already approved a refuge reduction to 5% for the second generation product, and this performance is central to our refuge reduction request for SmartStax. So while it won't be a commercial product on its own, the second generation YieldGard Corn Borer foreshadows the enormous grower benefits that will come with SmartStax.</p>
          <p>As we turn on slide 17, SmartStax is delivering unprecedented insect control against corn rootworm and caterpillar pests. Coupled with the potential for a reduced refuge, the collective performance advantage of SmartStax should boost total farm yield by 5 to 10%.</p>
          <p>The SmartStax launch in 2010 will widen the already substantial performance advantage we have in corn. Importantly, we will have at least a two year lead over the earliest estimated launch of DuPont's Optimum AcreMax based on their most recent public comments.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the other products that have moved phases and are thus one step closer to commercialization. Today's announcement that the key FDA regulatory filing has been made for the first product in the drought family is breakthrough news for us and our collaboration partner BASF. The data on slide 18 speaks as to why.</p>
          <p>We've seen another year of higher yields under drought conditions. And through five years of testing, we've met or exceeded the 6 to 10% yield improvement target. Over the next year, we will make additional regulatory submissions and our field work will focus intensely on the best germplasm and trait combinations for dry land corn production.</p>
          <p>Our higher yield in soybeans also developed through the BASF collaboration made the jump into Phase 3 this year. We'll be expanding the testing of lead events in the coming growing season. But we can point to another 6 to 7% yield advantage with this new trait.</p>
          <p>You can see the visual difference on slide 19 that brings this product one year closer to growers. This yield technology will eventually be stacked with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and dicamba-tolerance across our broad soybean germplasm base to create the first triple-stack product in soybeans.</p>
          <p>Now we've not had a phase advancement in cotton for a while. And the performance of our -- the combination for weed control of our two-way product that you see on slide 20 is stunning. Cotton farmers will have the unparalleled choice in weed control through the combination of tolerance to either dicamba or to glufosinate. And this product is to be stacked with Roundup Ready Flex for a third level of weed control.</p>
          <p>Not only did this new product shown in the picture withstand the onslaught of herbicides sprays, but it did so at yield parity to conventional cotton. This product will give cotton growers more tools to improve weed control and to target resistant weeds.</p>
          <p>One of the surprises of this year's pipeline is the addition of a project dedicated to sugarcane. Prior to the acquisition of Alellyx and the CanaVialis sugarcane breeding company in September, we have been working in partnership with them to develop a product with Roundup Ready and caterpillar insect protection.</p>
          <p>As we note on slide 21, the first yield trials in greenhouse studies have allowed us to add this product to the pipeline with the potential to create value through less insecticide use and higher yields. The impressive breeding and biotech abilities of CanaVialis will enable us to quickly test yield and stress genes to add to this weed and insect control platform in the future.</p>
          <p>Now a number of products have obviously stayed in phase as we continued to test the product concepts and lead events. Two of those in corn also being developed through the BASF collaboration are worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>The first product dedicated solely to yield in corn is being tested in our pipeline to determine which events are the most commercially viable, and hence warrant more aggressive field trials in the 2009 season. As you can see on slide 22, several of these events are either already at or close to achieving the product concept target of a 6 to 10% yield gain.</p>
          <p>Finally, our nitrogen utilization trait was able to repeat its performance of providing a yield advantage as nitrogen applications are reduced below standard application rates. As we show on slide 23, we demonstrated this concept in 2007 and built on that base in 2008 by using 60 pounds of applied nitrogen, significantly below the test standard of 200 pounds. The result was an 8% yield bump that, combined with the lower input costs, would be a priceless tool for farmers.</p>
          <p>Expanded testing in 2009 should provide the additional data needed to advance this exciting product into Phase 3 next year. Now we'll be presenting a broader range of projects at our R&amp;D road shows in New York, Boston and London this week and next.</p>
          <p>Financially, as shown in slide 24, we continue to see significant valuations for the products in the pipeline. Because of our generous sharing philosophy, the farmer derives value from the technologies regardless of commodity swings, as he or she has during the first 12 years of the use of biotechnology in crops.</p>
          <p>The pipeline we are showing you today has the potential to deliver value at the farm gate of some $5 billion by the year 2020. By any measure in the technology world, not just agriculture, this pipeline is of unparalleled breadth, depth and value. And importantly, you don't have to wait until 2020 to see that value in our financial results, as we summarize for you on slide 22.</p>
          <p>We have reduced the promise of research to practice with two new product launches and four phase changes that bring those products a step closer to commercial reality. Our competitive edge has widened yet again. As you noted, our salespeople aren't just selling the corn seed to be planted in 2009. They are selling the platforms for the next wave of technology that will rewrite the book on farming around the world.</p>
          <p>We look forward to seeing you in our more in-depth reviews over the next two weeks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scarlett for your questions. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick two-part question. The first is that in Rob's slide on the pipeline, drought tolerant corn seems more or less equal with SmartStax in Phase 4. So does that mean that drought tolerant corn could come to market in 2011? And the second part is on your balance sheet you have a line of grower production accruals that went from 172 million to 654. Can you explain what that is and what the significance of it is?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Jeff, I appreciate your enthusiasm there. We just submitted the very first regulatory approval for drought tolerance to the FDA. We have got a lot of work to do on all the international approvals for this product. So I think the standard timing we have laid out in our phases is the benchmark we should use at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And relative to -- this is Terry, Jeff. Relative to grower accruals, that really is the accrual that we have for the seed that we're growing to sell our contract growers. And it is up just because we would anticipate more sales, therefore, grew more bushels that we owe to growers. And secondly, the higher commodity price has taken it up some. So it's a normal increase that we would see in our business for this time of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A question on glyphosate. There were some major glyphosate contracts that expired at the end of '08. Did those contracts get repriced higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to think what expired at the end of '08, P.J.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., I think you're probably referring to some of our supply agreements and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...they've expired at various times. Some of them have been renewed, and we obviously can't discuss the pricing of them. I think that what I would want to leave though, you with is that the reason we're seeing the increase in glyphosate is due to the branded business. It's largely been a Brazil business. So I just -- even though I can't really give pricing on those contracts, what I can say is that the growth in our business is still driven by our branded business, largely driven by our Brazilian branded business in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I was looking at '09. And I was thinking that some of the supply agreements, if they get repriced higher, that's what gives you the confidence for '09. Because if that's not the case, then if farmers are buying less fertilizers, could they be buying less herbicides as well and would that have an impact on your business in the U.S.?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we would expect our U.S. Roundup business to still be strong. And again, the growth that we're talking about for this year is still driven by our branded business. But if you think &#x2013; looked at what we're doing, I think we're up about $300 million of GP in the first quarter largely driven by Brazil. To get to the range that we've given, we're talking about another 2 to $300 million in the rest of the year. And that's largely going to be driven by our U.S. business, and it's still, again, largely driven by our branded business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly on the glyphosate issue again, what is the average glyphosate price to you, net back to you, do you expect in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to be above our band of 16 to $18. We'd like to get through the U.S. season before we say where it's going to be and also the second season in Brazil, which we would expect to be down. But we probably still are looking something in the 20 type range, would be what I would expect for the full year.</p>

          <p>But, I want to -- I do want to emphasize, we would expect glyphosate to come back down to the normalized range of 16 to $18. So this is the benefit we're seeing &#x2013; from where we're at today, this is the benefit we're seeing from Brazil at the start of this year.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Nils Wallen sitting in for Mark. I just had a question with regard to your pipeline. This year it seems you had two major families move forward in phase. And how would you characterize the rate of acceleration in your pipeline? Is it improving or is it simply that we've seen all of the R&amp;D efforts hit critical mass in the last two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would definitely categorize, as I tried to in my comments, that the rate of pipeline advance is accelerating. And that's driven by the incredible discovery engine that we have. We're testing more genes in more transgenic crops, in more test sites and locations than ever before. Our collaboration with BASF on yield and stress is introducing a whole new wave of innovation.</p>
          <p>So I would say both in terms of the productivity of the near-term commercial product launches with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax and the projects that we've moved into Phase 3 and Phase 4, as well as the early stages of the pipeline where we're starting to see an increasing population of yield and stress product concepts, it's definitely accelerating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is this a factor of scale or is it a factor of new technology to expand the R&amp;D process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really going to be a combination of both. I mean, we've expanded scale in terms of our breeding and testing. We've expanded scale in terms of the addition of new crop platforms in both vegetables and in sugarcane. And we've clearly dramatically expanded the infusion into the pipeline with the BASF collaboration and a large and extensive both internal R&amp;D program as well as licensing relationships with many, many institutions outside of Monsanto.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two part question with regard to timing of seed orders. In the corn side, Hugh, I think you mentioned that you witnessed some acceleration in December and January. Is that a function of the late harvest or have you been compelled to make any price adjustments there, perhaps you can elaborate? And then on the soy side, what is driving the early order pattern at Asgrow? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Kevin, for the first part &#x2013; and I'll ask Terry to step in. But in the first part, yes, it's driven by a late season. So in the midst of everything else we have been facing, we had a late spring, very wet, flooding in the Midwest that pushed planting back. So crops came off the ground later than usual. And I think that combined with some of the uncertainty, in the countryside, we saw order patterns running a little bit later than usual.</p>
          <p>We've seen a little bit of flip flop this year versus last year in that, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, beans are running ahead. Bean acreage is probably going to be up and corn acreage is probably going to be a bit softer. So we have seen the bean book selling a bit faster than the corn book.</p>
          <p>And I think the Asgrow &#x2013; your specific question on success in Asgrow and what's been driving that, it's performance. And the work that Rob and the breeding team have done within Rob' s organization, we're seeing that yield benefit translate and then share gains. And I think it really augers well for the future for Roundup Ready 2 Yield, because with finite acres and fixed ground if you can deliver 7 or 11% more yield in the same acre, I think that's really going to drive performance in the coming years. But it's the reemergence of recent programs within beans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you've been working hard in recent years to integrate Delta and Pine Land. It sounds like you're making good progress on the technology. What is your outlook for market share for the coming planting season in cotton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't given a market share number yet for cotton. I think generally, you should continue to view 2010 as a turnaround year still for us in cotton, because a lot of the breeding gains that Rob referred to won't be in the marketplace yet. So really, I don't think you'll see the breeding improvements that we've made in the cotton portfolio until we get into 2010. And that's also the point at which we'll have, I think the right mix of the double stack of Roundup Ready Flex with Bollgard II.</p>
          <p>So I would still -- I don't have an exact market share number for you for Delta and Pine Land just yet, because that season's a little bit later than corn and soy. But I think you should look more to 2010 as a turnaround year.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investors. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys, and Scarlett. I just have one question. Could you talk about where your market share was in corn and soybeans last year and where that share might go over the next, say, three years with the new technologies that you're going to be putting into the market? And how much of a game changer do you expect the drought gene for corn to be in regards to your market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, thanks for the questions. I'll start with the last piece and maybe ask Rob to say a few words. I think drought has the potential to be a real game changer, and the good news is getting the regulatory filings. So the first question was, is this accelerating? And the way I look at it, it's less of an acceleration, it's more of a certainty. And having that improve the -- having that increased certainty once you get the files in is a really big step. So I think regardless of where commodity prices are, a company that has the opportunity to improve efficiency of production, where water is a challenge is a real competitive edge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Peter,, in terms of the drought tolerance, we're just talking, that's a product that we've just advanced in phase. It would appear in the marketplace at the outer end of the timeframe we've talked about in terms of doubling our GP. So the impact in the short-term will be less than the other projects that I've talked about.</p>
          <p>And I'd just point out how significant SmartStax will be though during this period, because SmartStax will launch in 2010 and will have significant yield and convenience benefits for the growers. The data on the improvements in bug control, both below and above the ground and the yield benefits from that, as well as the inherent convenience to the grower of having to plant significantly less acres to a refuge will be a huge benefit. So I certainly see in this timeframe that SmartStax will be a huge competitive advantage for us and drive share growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Peter, just to go back to your share -- specific share question. Last year DEKALB would have been at 25.5 market share points, American Seed at 10.5. Our commitment has been that we'll grow each year from now through 2012 the DEKALB brand in the U.S. by 1 to 2 market share points, and ASI by 1. In soybeans, we were at 20, and our commitment is one market share gain point per year. We've also committed to 1 to 2 market share point gains annually in the large cotton or corn growing areas outside of the United States, so places like Brazil and Argentina as well as Europe.</p>
          <p>So I think that gives you a projection to Rob's point. How SmartStax and drought tolerance will ultimately affect that market share growth is still to be seen. But that's been our commitment to you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if you could maybe comment a little more on corn pricing and maybe blend in how your seven zone pricing structure, which is new this year, what you've learned from that. And the other thing that maybe you could weave in is just as orders improved in December, how important do you think was the rally in corn prices to that improvement in orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So feedback on the seven zones has been good. Nice expansion from the original fee. The segmentation allows growers access to the technology that would have thought twice about it before. So I think it's a bold move and it's still early days. And I think it looks good.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing and the marketplace, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen some very, very aggressive discounting by some of our competitors. And the last survey that we did, which was the closing days of December, we've seen significant offers of free seeds. Literally of every two growers who offered competitive seed, one of them would have been offered a free seed offer.</p>
          <p>So we've taken the high ground in this thing as much as we possibly could and really try to maintain a position where we sell value. And I think, in a call like this where we're talking about future pipeline and we're talking about the value of platform developments, the zone based pricing, the introduction of SmartStax, the loading of drought tolerant technology on top of SmartStax they all I think build towards the improvement in the value that we deliver at the farm and coincidentally, as Terry mentioned, the up tick, the 3% up tick on margins.</p>
          <p>So, we're selling good stuff and we're making margin improvements as we do that. I don't know if you have anything to add to that Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just think, Vincent, relative to where we think pricing can go, I believe for corn what we're going to look at is mid to high 20s in terms in terms of a price movement. Overall broadly, we were up about 20% in the first quarter due to price but that's the blend of the U.S. business and the Brazilian business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just clarify on that? When you're saying, Terry, that you're going to be up mid-to-high 20s percent in corn, are you talking about in corn seeds and traits or just in traits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The combination, the combination of seeds and traits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The combo? And what was that? Had you previously given a number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's just a combination of some previous numbers we've talked about relative to traits combined with seeds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I guess &#x2013; let me just ask it this way. Is that number above or below what you had previously communicated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's in line, consistent with what we previously communicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the other backstop in the fence would be seeing our triples running at that 70% mark because in a very competitive, aggressive market from the very early stages our order book developed, we saw triples surging ahead. And we've seen the same thing with technology adoption in Brazil where even in tough times the farmer is always going to reach for that best possible technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I just have one last thing. If acres are going to go back to soy from corn, what type of corn seed are those going to be? Is that non-biotech corn? Are those single stacks? What moves back to beans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My crystal ball says that technology continues to run -- technology penetration continues to run strong regardless of acres. And it's probably the marginal acres that have flipped back. And geographically, it's a lot of the southern acres. So in other words, in an earlier question on cotton, I think we'll see a lot of the South flipping from cotton last year to soy this year.</p>
          <p>But frankly, we're sitting here in the first days of January. And I don't know what it's like in New York, but it's pretty brisk here. So there's -- we need to see what the spring brings before we see what goes in the ground. But those would be the kind of rough macro effect.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A comment, I just want to say congratulations listening to you guys, and listening -- watching the slide presentation. It's like drinking out of the fire hose proverbially. But I had a question. I'm a bit puzzled looking at slide nine about soybean -- projected soybean seed and trait gross profit going down a little bit from 725 last year to 700 million this year. I guess, the reality though is the real launch of Roundup Ready 2 Yield is coming next year, isn't it? I mean, you're starting this year, but the major thrust is in 2010. Is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That would be fair to say. This year we're talking about across 1 to 2 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And just to comment on that soybean decline, just as &#x2013; one of the things that I had made in my comments is that we had anticipated a lower acreage for soybeans for this year in this plan. That $700 million reflects that lower acreage for soybeans. If, in fact, we see a shift from corn to soy back to more what we saw last year, we would not expect to see that decline in soybean gross profit because it's purely acreage driven, not driven by any fundamental factors of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the reality then, is that for 2010 we can look forward to the launch of two blockbuster products, being SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield, which Rob said would become the platforms then for the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely correct. That's kind of the fire hose that you described. So as Rob said, Roundup Ready 2 Yield, there's to beans of SmartStax, as to corn and they become the two platforms that the future technologies will be laid on top of.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, you -- when you were talking about Latin America, obviously strong start there. But you suggested that you are cautious from a credit perspective for the second growing season and you're not going to chase risky business. Is there any way to quantify how concerned you are or how many -- what percent of the business for the second growing season you may walk away from? And sticking with the credit theme, is farmer credit in the U.S. even on your radar screen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll begin with the last question. Farmer credit is always on our radar screen. But as of right now given the levels of prepays that we saw through December, we're confident that we are going to get through the season with pretty normal practices for credit in the U.S. But it's something we will continue to watch.</p>
          <p>I think relative to Brazil, I just want to say that we're not saying as of today that we're going to be walking away from business in Brazil. It's just that we are pointing out that we will still take a conservative credit approach to business in Brazil, particularly as it relates to Roundup. So the results that we see in the second quarter &#x2013; we are expecting Brazil would be down in the second quarter some because we've benefited in the first quarter, but some portion because we would expect the second season to be smaller and probably smaller consumption of Roundup.</p>
          <p>So the decline and whether we walk away from business or not is still to be seen. We'll wait until we get to that second season. I guess, we're just laying out the ground rules for which we'll sell in Brazil and it's the model we've been using for the past three or four years</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question on competitor dynamics and how you &#x2013; your philosophy in responding to them. And I guess this is two parts. First with respect to vendor financing, one of your competitors has indicated that they are extending about 1.3 to 1.5 billion of vendor financing and that that's part of their competitive strategy. Can you discuss your strategy with respect to that, and whether your credit standards with respect to customers is tightening significantly year-over-year? And I guess secondly on glyphosate, how should we connect the falling retail price of glyphosate to your pricing strategy for glyphosate going forward? That is, how far do retail prices need to fall for it to impinge on how you price your branded product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me just touch on both of these, and I'll let -- maybe ask Terry for a little bit of details on it. In terms of vendor financing, I guess the way I would characterize this at the highest level is, if you look over the last few years, I would say that there has been very little change in terms of how we have laid out our stall or how we've conducted our business. The biggest change year-on year is the continued improvement of technology.</p>
          <p>This year, we have seen much more aggressive competitive reaction than we have seen in previous years. And the biggest change in that I think has been some of the deep discounting in some of the free seed orders that have occurred. In terms of how we have conducted the business, I would say that other than the goodwill gesture linked to the very late harvest &#x2013; and we did that overall, I don't think, Terry, you would say there has been any real change there.</p>
          <p>And then on the other piece, and then I will hand over to Terry, on the second piece of your question, and this often gets lost, we sell &#x2013; I think you touched on it in your question &#x2013; we sell into retail. Retail sets the price on farm. And the level of discount or the market programs that they run is quite literally their business. But I'll maybe ask Terry to give a bit of color on both of those subjects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll begin just with the credit side. I guess probably the biggest change that we made from a credit standpoint is extending the -- as the gesture, as Hugh mentioned, as a result of the late season, extending the time of the prepay program. So we did, in fact, move that prepay program into December and January, when previously it had been November and December.</p>
          <p>We have a variety of ways that we provide credit to the channel, to the customers. And we continue to utilize those same tools. And in this year &#x2013; and so far that's been satisfactory to meet the needs for credit. I think the key thing for us is, the amount of prepays as a percent of our total sales is about consistent with where it was last year at this point. Now in early January it's about consistent with where it was last year. So that gives us confidence that the credit programs are adequate for what's in the marketplace today and for our business for this year.</p>
          <p>Relative to the pricing, I mean, we -- just as a reminder, we do sell to both growers and retailers. And where retailers go with their pricing is their own decisions. But we've been very consistent in our approach with the programs that we've used in the marketplace this year with what we've used in the past. With the -- when you exclude the prepay extension that we mentioned earlier.</p>

          <p>In terms of trying to get a handle on some of these new pipeline projects, things that have advanced, stuff like that, maybe you can talk a little bit about in connection with your pricing to value strategy, how you might price some of these really key things that have moved in phase, maybe drought tolerance. Maybe you can refresh our memory on the increased yield gene for soy to give us a feel for how that's going to work.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Mark. And we're excited about all the advances. We typically don't do any formal pricing until we're closer to launch. But I think in terms of broad philosophy, these products would fit under the same umbrella approach that we've had where we look at the substitution economics, the value created, the convenience and performance benefits of product, and then try to share that value between a third and a half with the grower and retain the residual for Monsanto.</p>
          <p>And I think, when you're looking at a drought technology or some of the improvements that we're seeing with the SmartStax technology for bug control and yield, those would fit into that exact same formula.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How you doing? I just want to ask a little bit more about the prepays in seed because they're up year-over-year. Actually, what incentivizes the farmer to prepay? I know in years past there was maybe some people trying to lock in seed when there might have been shortages either on the soy or corn side depending on what year. But what &#x2013; I'm just trying to figure why that might be up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, there's a piece that is tax planning and there's a lot of cash &#x2013; there has been a lot of cash in the countryside. But, Terry, the financial incentive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a couple of things. One is really talking about two points. One is orders improving in the face of orders picking up in December and January. And that is largely driven by people who wanted to lock in particular seeds at that point. The prepay problem is really more of a financial management program for the growers. But the encouraging thing for us is when prepays are up, that's usually a good sign because it is very rare that we would ever refund a prepay.</p>
          <p>So I think it's both of them, two separate indicators, both of them bode well for the U.S. business, the U.S. season coming up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just to add one more dimension to it, there is a technology component because certain farmers are going to want a particular seed size or a particular hybrid or a particular availability of a variety in a particular zone. And as the selling season goes on, that availability diminishes. So there's a strong incentive for the growers to get exactly what they want early on so that they can complete their other planting schedules for their farm.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>There was a discount, and it's part of our credit management in Brazil as well. And most of those prepays in Brazil, let me remind you, they occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. We actually had them going into the first quarter, which is why we were confident we were going to have a good first quarter.</p>

          <p>Two quick ones. Terry, just a clarification, I think you said through December your deferred payments were up 50%. Is that just an -- and I think in the financials as of end of November your deferred revenues were down about 50% year-on-year. So does that explain that rapid acceleration you mentioned in order pattern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really is a result of the prepay extension that we actually got cash in in December that we would have normally got in in November. So deferred revenues were down, as you've said, as a result of that. So if you look at the end of December on a apples-to-apples basis, December this year to December last year, we would be up about 50%.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then if I might briefly for Rob, when we look at SmartStax, I know there are many farmers that don't plant a full commitment to one company or another but tend to mix and match a bit on their products. Is it your understanding if you get the refuge reduction that there will be a terrific incentive for farmers to convert to 100% SmartStax technology, so that they can have just one refuge area as opposed to having sub plots some with five, some with 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's what I was indicating. The compelling benefit to be able to lower the refuge from 20% of the farm being sacrificed to bugs to less than 5% on the corn acres, both from an economic and from a convenience that planting and harvest is a huge advantage. So I would expect that that will be a compelling benefit for farmers.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the availability of seeds, since we have it both in our DEKALB, our American Seed, and our licensed channel, there will be a lot of available genetics so that farmers can provide different hybrids across their farm.</p>
          <p>And I think the key to SmartStax, and there's a lot of confusion in terms of competitive offerings in other products, the key to SmartStax is that it has the refuge reduction for both the below ground corn rootworm test and the above ground caterpillars. And there will be &#x2013; that will be what makes it such a compelling benefit to the growers. It solves in a single swoop all of their bug and weed control and provides for a very convenient refuge reduction package for the farmer.</p>

          <p>So I guess just in closing, we're now officially in the New Year with our first quarter. We've fiscally been in the New Year for a while. And 2008 was a year that most of us would really like to put behind us. I guess from here, having one seat at the table in agriculture, the year as we looked back, the year started with a food crisis, flipped from that into massive flooding in the middle of the corn belt and that led to late harvests that really rolled into a waddled economy that was unraveling.</p>
          <p>And yet through all that, we've performed against a backdrop of the continued need for food, feeds, fuel coupled with the value of technology and the importance of leadership in very, very tough times. So I know, having heard the comments from many of you, that the last four months have been unsettling.</p>
          <p>But against the rumors, the discounting, I can tell you that we have and we will hold our pricing and our value, whether that's in Seeds and Traits or in our Roundup business. I hope that we've given you the milestones and the commitments today to allow you to view our business the way that we do, and that is, that we are an agricultural technology company that optimizes our share, our price and our trait penetration, which in turn drives EPS growth of greater than 20% for the fifth consecutive year in a row.</p>
          <p>And I am particularly proud of that with the team that I sit here today. So thanks very much for your patience. This is always a longer call because we review our pipeline progress. And on behalf of the team here in St. Louis, I'd like to wish you and your families and loved ones all the very best for 2009. Thank you very much.</p>
