          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific First Quarter 2011 Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's web site. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young. You may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us on the call. Before we get started, I just wanted to thank you for bearing with us on our change in release schedule this time around as we work through some extra logistics in the holiday week. We'll be back on our regular Thursday morning before-market time slots next time around.</p>
          <p>With me here today in Omaha are Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President, Operations, and Rob Knight, our CFO. As you can see, we started the year off strong reporting record results for the first quarter. Earnings were a record $1.29 per share, a 28% increase over 2010. Driving this gain was a 15% increase in operating income to a first-quarter best of $1.1 billion. This is the first time UP's first quarter operating income has topped the $1 billion mark. Drivers behind the year-over-year improvement include a 5% volume increase and core pricing gains. Jack will provide commentary on our top line growth, but we again achieved volume gains in all six business groups for the fourth consecutive quarter. Intermodal, Industrial Products and Chemical shipments drove about two-thirds of the volume growth.</p>
          <p>We did face some challenges in the quarter, including extreme winter weather across most of the nation and a significant rise in fuel prices. The team will provide more details on both of these areas in a few minutes. Despite these challenges, though, we remain focused on improving profitability. We achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 74.7%, and that includes 2.4 points of negative fuel price impact. The strong performance enabled us to generate record free cash flow after dividends. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service. As Jack will show you, these efforts were recognized through record customer satisfaction. Strong service levels delivered value for our customers while supporting our price gains and attracting new business to the railroad.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to Jack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. So, let's lead off with a look at how customers viewed the service, and the value they're getting from the Union Pacific as measured by our customer satisfaction. And I'm pleased to say that the news is good. For the quarter, customer satisfaction came in at 91 topping the previous quarterly best of 90 and along the way we hit 92 in February, setting a new best-ever monthly mark. The strength of our value proposition, great service and continued slow improvement in the economy drove our first quarter volume up 5% with gains in all six of our businesses.</p>
          <p>First quarter is often marked by challenging weather, and as Jim pointed out, this year was no exception. You can see from the chart in the upper right the impact on our seven-day car loadings resulting from the large storm that swept across the Plains, and the Midwest in early February, ultimately dumping two feet of snow on Chicago before heading east. The chart also highlights the resiliency of our network as volume quickly rebounded.</p>
          <p>Core price improved 4.5% with each of the groups posting gains with the pluses, and the minuses of mix offsetting in total, those price gains combined with increased fuel surcharge revenue to produce an 8% increase in average revenue per car. The stronger volume and improved revenue per car drove freight revenue up 13% to $4.2 billion, a new first quarter best. So, now let's take a closer look at each one of our six businesses. We'll start with Ag products where volumes grew 4%, which combined with a 6% improvement in average revenue per car to produce revenue growth of 11%. Global demand for whole grains accounted for most of the volume growth with a 69% increase in export wheat leading the way. Export demand drove a 36% increase in frozen meat and poultry shipments.</p>
          <p>Now the meat exports were up due to various local issues that reduced supply in Australia, Korea and Brazil, while the poultry gains were a function of a shift to export markets that favored rail.</p>
          <p>Import beer volumes increased 10% with a boost from some new business. Ethanol volumes grew 4% and soybean meal stayed flat as new domestic business offset a decline from last year's strong export demand that resulted from the South American crop failures. Turning to Automotive, our Automotive revenue grew 12% as contract price increases drove an 8% improvement in average revenue per car and volume grew 4%. Volume growth was hampered by the February storms that restricted shipments and closed auto plants. Although vehicle sales were stronger than expected throughout the remainder of the quarter, equipment shortages were seen across the national rail network as industry car cycles slowed due to the lingering impact of the severe winter weather.</p>
          <p>To improve fluidity and car supply for our customers, early in February we started pulling the entire automotive fleet out of storage and by March 1st we had that process pretty well complete. In addition, we began a series of special moves to reposition empties for loading and we also launched a couple of multi-modal routes to bypass congestion and help accelerate vehicles to market.</p>
          <p>Increased vehicle production and anticipation of stronger sales in 2011 is driving the growth in both the vehicle and part shipments. Our finished vehicle volume grew 5% with the strongest increases coming from the Detroit 3. Our part shipments increased 4% with growth in tier suppliers in the Detroit 3 offsetting the continued negative impact of the closing of the NUMMI plant in April of last year.</p>
          <p>Our Chemicals revenue grew 13% as volume climbed 10% and average revenue per car was up 3%. As I mentioned earlier, mix changes across the group netted out overall, but our Chemical business did see a couple of points of negative mix driven in part by an early start to the short-haul phos rock short-haul phos rock business and growth in movements of plastics to storage and transit yards. Growth in petroleum products, which increased 34%, was largely driven by increased crude oil shipments with asphalt and refined petroleum products also posting gains. Strong seasonal demand boosted fertilizer volume 16% with a 29% increase in export potash leading the way. But this quarter export potash represented less of the overall market than we had seen in previous quarters. Plastic shipments increased 9% with growth in both domestic and export markets and improved industrial production drove industrial chemical volume up 6%.</p>
          <p>In Energy, a volume increase of 4% combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car resulting in revenue growth of 13%. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was up 5%, driven largely by the three new Wisconsin utilities, and the carryover impact of the new San Antonio unit that also came online during the second quarter of last year. Colorado Utah tonnage declined 5% as export demand was more than offset by weakened demand in the Eastern market. Additionally, a long-wall move in one of the mines will continue to reduce volumes until the third quarter. Now, we don't always highlight our other coal origins, but 4,300 carloads or 65% growth out of Southern Illinois to river ports, utilities, and industrial customers was worth highlighting for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Industrial products volume grew 9%, which combined with a 6% improvement in average revenue per car to drive a 15% increase in revenue. Non-metallic mineral shipments increased 36% as strong drilling activity continues to drive demand for frac time, barites, and bentonites. Production of pipe for drilling, as well as steel coils and bars for the strengthening auto industry reflected in a 15% increase in steel and scrap, and, although the packaging paper market is showing only a slight increase so far this year, our paperboard volume is up 21% with the growth coming from inventory replenishment and highway conversions.</p>
          <p>Our Intermodal revenue grew 15% as an 11% improvement in average revenue per unit combined with a volume growth of 4%. International intermodal volume increased 6% reflecting improved consumer demand and overcoming the timing impact of the Chinese New Year, which this year fell entirely in the first quarter, while in 2010 the holiday slowdown was spread between the first two quarters. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:36) service continues to support highway conversions in our domestic intermodal world, which was up 1%, compared to a strong 2010. Our Streamline subsidiary's door-to-door product grew 17% with nearly all of that growth coming off the highway.</p>
          <p>So let me wrap up with a look at what's ahead for the rest of 2011. Although Global Insight's forecast has softened a bit, it's still a solid growth outlook, and improved projections for industrial production and unemployment are actually encouraging signs for us. Here's kind of an overview of what we see happening in each of our six groups.</p>
          <p>We'll start with Automotive, which is the only group where we're experiencing significant impact from the recent disaster in Japan. There's still a lot of uncertainty as to the full impact on the auto industry, but our current take is that the second quarter is going to bear the brunt of the disruption with overall upside potential in the second half as managers work hard to fill the market void. While we anticipate that this will slow growth in our Automotive segment in the second quarter, we still expect strong growth in the second half if the industry recovery continues, and sales ramp up.</p>
          <p>In Industrial Products, the markets that have been the strongest in the first quarter especially those that are tied to energy demand, and the recovering auto industry should stay strong as the year progresses. Unfortunately, housing and construction continue to lag, but we're cautiously optimistic given the recent report of stronger-than-expected housing starts in March. While one month doesn't make a trend we're hoping to see at least the start of the recovery in housing and construction as we move towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Chemicals is off to a good start for the year, and most of the strength should continue driven by energy demand and a stronger economy, although we do expect to see fertilizer shipments slow a bit following kind of a more normal seasonal pattern. Strengthening industrial production, along with growing export demand, should be good news for our coal franchise, especially with the SPRB stockpiles recently estimated to be slightly below normal. We'll also continue to see benefit from those Wisconsin utilities.</p>
          <p>The biggest gains in Ag are expected to be in whole grain exports as demand for U.S. wheat remains strong, and feed grains have solid potential against a relatively low second quarter comp. And last, but not least, import volumes that drive our international intermodal business should grow if consumer demand improves as predicted, and our excellent service should continue to support highway conversions in domestic intermodal.</p>
          <p>On balance with the first quarter behind us, most of the markets are shaping up as we pretty much expected. The diversity of our business mix continues to serve us well, and with our relative fuel efficiency, higher fuel prices should further strengthen our competitive advantage as long as they don't tank the economy. Across all six groups, a strong value proposition remains the foundation of our business development efforts, positioning us to deliver both the economy plus volume gains and improved pricing that we discussed last November to drive overall revenue growth.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon. Safety is our number one focus. In the first quarter of 2011, we achieved the best-ever quarterly performance in employee safety. The continued penetration of the peer-to-peer safety process that we call Total Safety Culture, or TSC, and enhanced training drove the improvement. This had a positive impact on our bottom line, and Rob will touch on it in a few minutes. In terms of customer safety or derailments, we improved 10% to a record first quarter reportable incident rate. Derailment costs decreased over 20% with the lower incident rate and a decline in the severity of those incidents.</p>
          <p>Investments in infrastructure, technology and training created a safer operating environment, and despite increases in rail and highway traffic during the quarter, we also achieved a best-ever quarterly mark in public safety. Our crossing accident rate declined 13% in the quarter versus 2010. We continue to focus on risk reduction, including closing grade crossings and helping local communities address risky driver behavior. Safety, service, and productivity are codependent goals that reinforce one another, which is reflected in our service results.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, we handled a nice step-up in volume while maintaining strong service levels. Jack showed you the impact of the February winter storms. We really felt it in the Chicago area, which is our largest gateway, and affects about 25% of our rail traffic. Heavy snowfall and high winds impacted our operations and our employees, and caused some loss in network velocity. Our team did a tremendous job responding to the challenge.</p>
          <p>We deployed surge resources and quickly adjusted service plans. By applying the principles of the unified plan and utilizing available resources, we absorbed the 5% volume growth and overcame the weather challenges while maintaining solid customer service. Both volume and service performance quickly rebounded in March to a run-rate of 174,000 weekly car loadings and 88 service delivery index. Handling more throughput at a consistent high level of service and efficiency drives productivity and creates capacity. We leveraged the growth in train sizes, as you'll see on the next chart.</p>
          <p>Looking at our manifest business, which accounts for over one-third of our network capacity or activity, excuse me, and is predominantly our Industrial Products, Chemical and some of the Ag business, we experienced solid carload growth in quarter. We were able to leverage volume, handling 11% more carloads with just 5% more starts. We achieved similar results in unit grain trains, absorbing 9% more volume with 6% more starts. This is a product of a collaborative effort working with shippers and receivers to develop and fully utilize our grain network.</p>
          <p>We also drove train length productivity in our coal and intermodal shipments. We achieved these gains through plan design, equipment management and by working with our customers and interchange partners. Further deployment of distributed power contributed to our success in train size growth, and I expect further upside in the premium bulk and manifest products.</p>
          <p>As volumes increase, we use the unified plan process to run more trains across our network to destination without an intermediate stop. This is captured in the metric at the bottom-right, which shows the number of times each day trains stop to pick up or set out cars. Fewer work events means more throughput at higher levels of service. As volumes grow, we continue to put surplus resources back to work while maintaining our surge capabilities.</p>
          <p>We recalled around 700 TE&amp;Y employees so far in 2011, which brings furloughs down to around 820. We continue to hire TE&amp;Y employees to offset projected attrition, as well as for volume growth this year. Recall, it takes about six months to fully train and deploy a new hire. Despite having several hundred more new hires in the training pipeline and more employees working on capital projects, our workforce productivity improved around 1% from 5.31 million to 5.34 million gross ton miles per employee. Adjusting for those two factors, our productivity improved about 2.5%.</p>
          <p>While we have placed around 220 locomotives and thousands of freight cars back into service this quarter, we still have roughly 800 locomotives and 26,000 freight cars available to meet growing demand. My team has also touched or rotated around 200 of the stored locomotives to be available on-demand for weather disruption and demand spikes. Even though the equipment we returned to service was older and generally less reliable than the fleet average, productivity is measured by GTMs per horsepower day, and freight car utilization matched last year's excellent performance.</p>
          <p>Another vital part of our improvement plans are the capital investments that we're making to provide great service for our customers while handling more of their business. For 2011, our capital plan totals around $3.2 billion. More than half of that is replacement spending to harden the infrastructure, making the network safe and resilient. Spending for service growth and productivity will total close to $1.1 billion. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers.</p>
          <p>Major projects include additional double track on the Sunset Corridor, the Blair Cutoff project on the east-west main line, citing extensions, intermodal terminal expansions. We're also acquiring 100 new road locomotives, close to 5,000 new containers, some additional covered hoppers, and new AutoFlex auto racks, which were designed and are being built by a UP car shop. The bulk of these acquisitions are designed to meet expected business growth.</p>
          <p>In addition to our investments for growth and efficiency, we plan to spend around $250 million on positive train control this year. All in all, our projected capital spend is up significantly, compared to 2010. We're investing for safety, growth, service and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>The end game is delivering the full potential of the great UP franchise translated into these deliverables: world-class safety results as we build total safety culture, leveraging growth to the bottom line with network productivity, growing the value proposition for our customers, and positioning for growth as we provide excellent service. So, going forward, the key for the operating team is agility and delivering on UP's value proposition. We are meeting and will be prepared to continue to meet customer expectations regardless of the economic circumstances.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Rob to discuss the financials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lance, and good afternoon. Before we go through Union Pacific's record first quarter earnings, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2010 Fact Book will be available tomorrow morning on the UP web site under the Investors tab. So, with that, let's move on to our financials.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 summarizes our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 13% to a record first quarter $4.5 billion on the strength of core pricing gains and volume growth. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion, increasing 13% or $376 million, compared to the first quarter of 2010. If you consider that higher diesel fuel prices added $200 million of expense, you can see we demonstrated solid operating leverage. Also, you'll recall that our 2010 operating expenses included a one-time payment of $45 million to CSXI as part of the restructuring transaction.</p>
          <p>Operating income totaled $1.1 billion, a 15% increase and a first quarter record. Other income totaled $15 million in the first quarter, $14 million higher year-over-year mainly due to early debt redemption costs incurred in 2010. Quarterly interest expense declined 9% versus the first quarter of 2010 to $141 million driven by lower average debt levels.</p>
          <p>First quarter income tax expense increased to $372 million. Higher pre-tax earnings drove the increase, but was somewhat offset by a lower tax rate, which was driven by state income tax rate changes.</p>
          <p>Net income totaled $639 million, a first quarter best, and a 24% increase versus 2010. Earnings per share increased 28% to $1.29 per share as the outstanding share balance declined 3% versus 2010, reflecting our share repurchase activities.</p>
          <p>Turning to our top line. We achieved 13% freight revenue growth to a first quarter record of $4.2 billion. This slide provides a walk across of the first quarter growth drivers. First quarter volume was up 5%. Unlike the last few quarters, business mix did not have much of an impact year-over-year. Our solid price improvement of 4.5% was in line with our first quarter expectation.</p>
          <p>Fuel surcharge revenue added another 3.5%, and as you'll recall, there's a two-month lag in our fuel surcharge recovery mechanism. So, although our fuel surcharge revenue increased, we did not recover the full amount of the increased fuel cost due to the continued rise in fuel prices throughout the quarter. We view this as a timing issue, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Core pricing gains in the first quarter of 4.5% were driven by solid demand, our value proposition and RCAF fuel escalators. As we have stated before, we have roughly $750 million worth of business in our legacy portfolio to compete for and re-price this year, but the majority of these contracts don't come up for bid until the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at our incremental margin for the first quarter, after adjusting for higher fuel prices, and the 2010 CSXI payment, revenues were up nearly 10% while costs grew only 7%. That relationship equates to an incremental margin of about 45%. As we noted in the fourth quarter, we continue to take the necessary steps to prepare for the future. We believe that our proactive initiatives implemented today will result in improved margins as we approach peak season.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the expense side, first quarter compensation and benefits totaled $1.2 billion, up 10% from 2010. Breaking down the year-over-year change, roughly half of the increased expense can be attributed to inflationary pressures that we discussed with you back in January: health and welfare, unemployment taxes, wage increases, and pension costs. The other half was driven by volume growth.</p>
          <p>Our work force levels increased 5% in the quarter, compared to 2010. Half of the increase was driven by more TE&amp;Y employees in the training pipeline and more individuals working on capital projects. The other half was driven by our 5% volume growth partially offset by productivity. We will likely see similar patterns in the next quarter or so, but we are optimistic about the future and plan to stay ahead of the game. As you would expect, training costs were higher in the quarter as new employees were brought on to prepare for the expected 2011 attrition and volume growth.</p>
          <p>Conductor and engineer training costs increased $16 million year-over-year. First quarter fuel expense totaled $826 million, by far our second largest expense item in the quarter. The average diesel fuel price, which increased 33% year-over-year, was the primary driver of the quarterly change. In fact, the $2.88 per gallon of diesel fuel paid in the first quarter was our third highest quarterly fuel price on record.</p>
          <p>I'd like to make two key points about the fuel price impact. First, the math alone of higher fuel prices inflates the operating ratio, and secondly, the lag impact of our fuel surcharge mechanism also creates an additional headwind on both our operating ratio and our earnings. When we combine these two factors, the end result was a 2.4-point increase in our operating ratio and a $0.08 reduction in earnings per share, compared to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The impact is a bit larger than the $0.05 impact that I talked about in March as fuel prices continue to climb throughout the month. Fuel expense was also higher as a result of a 5% increase in gross ton miles. Slide 26 summarizes first quarter expense for two additional categories: Purchased services and material expense increased 10% or $43 million to $475 million. Similar to the two previous quarters, the biggest driver of the increase was greater use of contract services associated with our higher volume.</p>
          <p>This includes transportation expenses incurred by our subsidiaries, crew lodging and transportation costs also increased, and locomotive maintenance costs were up year-over-year as we returned stored units to active service. When you add it all up, about one-third of the increased spending in this line is associated with expected volumes in the second half of the year, reflecting the amount of time it takes to position our assets for full deployment.</p>
          <p>Depreciation expense increased 8% or $28 million to $395 million, which is in line with the previous guidance that we gave. Increased capital spending and higher depreciation associated with hauling more gross ton miles drove the increase. Looking at the second quarter, we expect depreciation expense to increase around 9% or so, compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 27 summarizes first quarter expenses for the remaining two categories. First quarter equipment and other rent expense totaled $302 million, up 4%. The biggest contributor was container lease expense, which was higher in the quarter as we increased our container fleet. Car hire expense also increased driven by volume growth. Lower freight car lease expense partially offset these increases.</p>
          <p>Other expense came in at $188 million, down $58 million, or 24% from 2010. Cost pressures, including volume-related expenses and increased operating taxes drove expenses up in the first quarter, but spending was lower than expected across the board allowing us to beat the $225 million target that we discussed with you in January. One of the bigger drivers of improvement in this cost line was lower personal injury expense, again reflecting positive experience from our continued safety gains. And we have already talked about the $45 million CSXI payment that was made in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect continued safety performance. We believe there will be less positive impact from personal injury actuarial studies. All in, we still expect the other expense category to average around $225 million per quarter for the rest of the year. But we remain committed in our efforts to offset cost pressures. As in the past, with so many ins and outs in this line, it's not unusual to see quarterly fluctuation.</p>
          <p>Bringing both the revenue and expense sides together, UP's record first quarter 2011 operating ratio illustrates the substantial improvements in profitability that we achieved over the last several years. We improved our operating ratio to 74.7% in 2011. The ongoing efforts of Project OR, solid volume growth, continued operating efficiency, and core pricing gains all contributed to this record mark. These improvements more than offset the net headwind created by higher fuel prices, and the 2010 CSXI payment. Together, those two items negatively impacted our operating ratio by 1.3 points, compared to 2010, masking a 1.7-point improvement in our base business.</p>
          <p>Union Pacific's record profitability in the first quarter of 2011 also drove record free cash flow after dividends. Growth in cash from operations more than offset increased capital spending and higher dividend payment. In fact, cash dividends paid in the first quarter of 2011 were up 38% from 2010 levels. Bonus depreciation contributed positively to cash flows in both years.</p>
          <p>Union Pacific's balance sheet continues to be in good shape, consistent with the goal of maintaining an investment grade credit rating. At the end of the first quarter, the adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 41.7%, just slightly down from year-end 2010 as earnings added to our equity balance.</p>
          <p>We've continued to generate strong cash flow to return to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares totaling $248 million. We've recently renewed our share repurchase authority for a new repurchase program of up to 40 million additional shares by March 31, 2014. The new program went into effect April 1st. Dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases continue to be key components of our balanced approach to cash allocation for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Looking ahead, we see continued opportunities to grow and improve our profitability.</p>
          <p>As Jack discussed, we are optimistic about the prospects for solid growth and pricing gains in 2011, particularly in the second half of the year. Of course, this assumes that the economy continues to cooperate. We remain committed to achieving real pricing gains in 2011 driven by the increased value of Union Pacific's service, strong market demand, and the added benefit of competing for and re-pricing our legacy business later in the year.</p>
          <p>As we look to the second half of the year, the combination of stronger revenue growth, our ongoing productivity initiative, and current resource investments should produce improved incremental margins and drive higher returns.</p>
          <p>In January of this year, we targeted a record-operating ratio for the full year of 2011. The oil price at that time was around $85 a barrel. At today's price of $110 a barrel, this will be a challenge, but we remain committed to achieving improvement from last year's 70.6% record operating ratio. Even with high fuel prices, and the pressure it puts on our margins, we still believe 2011 will be another record setting year for earnings, allowing us to reward our shareholders with greater returns.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. Obviously, there are still some uncertainties for the balance of the year such as the impact of higher fuel prices on the overall economy. So far, the economy continues to gradually improve and we expect to see this reflected in stronger business volumes as we move back into peak season later in the year. We feel good about our prospects for strong performance in this environment, and we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that UP will be ready to successfully meet this demand.</p>
          <p>When you look at it, our plan for 2011 remains very straightforward. We'll continue to deliver on our customer commitments by running a fluid and efficient railroad, focus on safety and high levels of customer service. We'll leverage our volume opportunities to drive productivity and financial results, and we'll continue to make the critical capital investments that support our long-term strategy for profitable growth. Taken together, these efforts will translate into increased value for our customers and stronger cash flows and financial returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, let's open it up to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to get a sense, you know we've heard from the two West Coast dominant truckload carriers that the western half of the United States was weaker in the first quarter and we saw that in your Intermodal volumes. And I was wondering if you guys had any real explanation for what was going on, on a relative basis. Is that just seasonal? And I guess when you think about how that's proceeded, are you starting to see increased either flows or expectation that those volumes are going to begin picking up as we move through the second</p>
          <p>quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Justin, I think first of all, you're correct in that there is always a seasonal downturn or falloff after the end of the year, and as you get into the first quarter. And we saw that volume is picking up. It's getting stronger. I always look at the number of containers we have in storage, and even with some incrementals that we bought last year, we only have about 4,500 left in storage, and that's in April. So, we're already starting to ramp up towards what looks like to be with continued economic growth a fairly decent peak season for us. So, we're very comfortable with our plan. We're seeing it play itself out. And we're not &#x2013; we're not seeing anything at this point in time that's concerning us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Rob, you did a good job getting at the incremental margin question, but I guess given that the thought is that it will be difficult to see that OR improvement year-over-year, this year because of fuel obviously coming in at a zero percent margin, that's optical, but does it create a difficulty in reaching the longer term OR goals that you guys have of getting to 65 to 67 by 2015? In terms of the underlying momentum of the business, is there anything that changes there if we're in a heightened fuel environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, I'll take that one. No, I don't see that as a challenge in our long-term goal. In fact, if you think about it, what it does to un-highway cost, I think it helps you in terms when you think about your volume story that's out here. And our team is doing a good job in terms of fuel recovery. But I really don't &#x2013; I don't see it as &#x2013; sure, I'd like to have $85 barrel of fuel.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. And I guess last one and I'll turn it over to someone else, just curious on the capital spend. You know, decent sized program this year. How much of that is eligible for bonus depreciation, and how much was potentially pulled forward because of that hundred percent depreciation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, we will benefit from the continuation of the bonus depreciation, but we really didn't change our capital planning so much around the result of that bonus depreciation. So, we will &#x2013; we will benefit from it, but it didn't cause us to pull ahead. And just a reminder, remember the guidance that we've previously given going forward, is that our capital spending should be &#x2013; we would expect in the 17% to 18% of revenue as we move forward over the next couple of years.</p>

          <p>We're making a bet here long-term, and when you look at some of our investments here, I feel good about what's happening with our profitability, our return on invested capital. But I tell you if we start to see that move the other way, you're going to see capital go back the other way. I mean, the math is pretty straight forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to see if we could start off with one on the core price at 4.5% &#x2013; certainly a good number. It is a little bit lower than what you saw for most of last year. I'm wondering if you can give a sense is that kind of the run-rate that we should assume until you get into fourth quarter when you get a bigger legacy impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, it really depends on the marketplace. It's certainly not going to get any worse than that, and if the market continues to improve and we start to see an even faster ramp-up in things like peak season, we can do a little better than that. You know, you understand clearly, that our big legacy push isn't really going to impact us much this year. It will do more for us in 2012 than it does in 2011, but we feel good about our pricing plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you look at the legacy impact at the end of this year, I think Rob you gave us a number about kind of the total revenue that you're re-pricing. And then what happens in 2012, is it a similar amount in 2012? And I guess I think the timing in 2012 is relatively early in the year. So, maybe just some comments on that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're going to see the benefit of the 750 million reflect itself in 2012, and then we have a number of year-end 12/31 contracts that will impact 2012 providing we're successful in renegotiating and keeping that business on our railroad. And the 2012 number is not as big &#x2013; the 2012 actual in the year legacy contracts is not as big as what we have with the combination of the year-end here, and then the 2012 itself. I don't have the specific number here with me right at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom, but keep in mind, legacy isn't the only place that we are able to get price. It's really across the board with all six of our business groups. A big part of that's the value proposition. I will tell you right now, again, let's assume the economy continues on kind of slow growth as we've said. You think about what's happening maybe in the trucking side. I think the pricing opportunities are pretty darn good for the rest of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a sense, Jack, of how much smaller it is than the 750 million? Is it like 500 million, or 300 million, or you just don't have the numbers in front?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This may be kind of a simple question, but it did seem that several of your expense categories grew at a faster rate than your carload growth. Is this something that you expect to persist throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I pointed out, there's some inflationary pressures like for example, in the comp line. And half of that 10% growth in the quarter was what I would call, and did call, inflationary pressures. The other half was related to volume. Similar on the purchased services, where we experienced bringing out locomotives from storage, bringing out other equipment, et cetera, so those are unusual pressures in that sense. And I would expect that some of those pressures, particularly in the comp line, will continue throughout the year. The component that's related to volume, as we've always said, head count, as it relates to volume will grow with volume. So, we'd like to see volume continue to grow. We expect head count then to continue to grow as a result, but not at a one-for-one basis because it's offset by productivity. But the other half, the inflationary pressures are likely to stick with us throughout the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, but you had a pretty big jump in &#x2013; I would call non-productive costs that we've got in our first quarter getting ready for the volume in the third and fourth quarter. In fact, I think Rob in his numbers said $35 million or so plus or minus is associated with training and pulling some locomotives out. So, as you think about that, we're going to lever that very, very nicely in the second half of the year. As those people come out of training, you get the locomotives ready to go; you start to see that business, Rob. That will be very nice leverage in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, just one more point on another category. Purchased services and other, which was up 10%, I would expect as we get into the second quarter that the run-rate year-over-year would look more like a 5% than the 10%. That 10% this year was as much a result of the more difficult comp from last year in the first quarter, then I wouldn't expect that that would continue in the second quarter and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, just a follow-up, just to clarify, the compensation inflation for the full year, are you saying that it will be five points above and beyond volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly around 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>5% all in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The inflationary part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then some additionally, on top of that for volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to ask about coal, specifically given the strong pull of export coal off the East Coast. I was wondering if you're seeing any inquiry from East Coast consumers as to an increased desire to import PRV coal further in our direction. Secondarily, I wanted to get a sense of what stockpiles look like in your area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The phone is kind of ringing off the wall actually in terms of inquiries, both on eastern coal and actually we're getting some fairly decent calls on export, which is not our strong suit, but we do have access to Missouri &#x2013; the Mississippi river terminals and some West Coast. So, we're actually seeing some interest there. Both of those are good for us. We don't really have any confirmed deals, but we're certainly talking to a lot of different customers who are interested. And hopefully, as time plays out, and if the export market stays strong, we'll see more of that draw into the East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the stockpile question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The stockpiles right now, the last reported information we had said that SPRB stock piles were around 55.6 days. Normal would be around 56.4, so just slightly below what would be normal, which sets us up quite nicely here for the summer burn season that should be coming up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. My second question would be just related to export coal more directly. We've seen the announcement now for facilities potentially looking to get permitted or expanded in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. Is your sense that that's what we're going to see? Is there more to come? And what's your sense on timing? It seems as if all goes well, it's about a two-year, three-year thing, but you also have the EPA pushback, and the environmental pushback. Just wondering is more to come, and what's your sense on timing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot of places that are looking for an opportunity. So, I'm not sure it's completely done yet in terms of what the potential site locations are. Some of them to us seem a little bit more extreme than others, but there is certainly a lot of interest in developing new port facilities, and the capability to handle some coal exports at existing ports, including not only West Coast and Canada, but also down in Mexico as well. So, that's the first issue.</p>
          <p>The second issue in terms of timing, we were actually hopeful to see some activity towards the end of this year, and the beginning of 2012. The one that we're probably most interested in is the one up in Longview, Washington with the Australian mining firm. I think it's called Amber or Ambre. And they found it good to go except for the EPA issues, and that has posed a delay, but we're hopeful that we could still see some activity there by early 2012. It really depends on what happens with the government, and the EPA.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>The amount of revenue that we have covered with some sort of fuel mechanism, and remember, we have like 75 different fuel mechanisms out there, is in the low-90s. It's not a precise number that we track as readily as you're asking, but it's in that low-90s. So, we've moved it up from that 85 mark.</p>

          <p>I think our first job here is generate the cash to put the position in the company in terms of growth, so again, we'll look at long-term capital growth. We'll look at our dividend policy in terms of where we're going, and return cash to shareholders. I don't see us levering up significantly in terms of borrowing to buy back stock. But as you see from our first quarter cash flow, we had a very good quarter, in fact, a record quarter. And that really puts us in a very good position to continue to reward our shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Wondered &#x2013; just curious, given some of the shifts over the last several years in natural gas pricing versus oil pricing, I'm wondering if that changes your intermediate term perspective on the growth rates in your chemical franchise, and how you may think about that longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as we looked at it, Scott, certainly having the lower natural gas prices is a benefit to U.S. producers, North American producers. So, that's a real plus for us. I think one of the key criteria here that you have to look at is, though, the available capacity. Our chemical customers are doing quite well right now in terms of overall production, and to significantly improve on the long-term means additional facilities will have to be built, which will take some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I mean, net-net, I remember you used to think that was sort of almost a very low growth, no growth business. You foresee probably better growth than that now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if we ever believed it was no growth, Scott. [Laughter] It was good growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then two other just maybe administrative questions sort of wrapping up. What was the total amount of the fuel surcharge in the quarter, and is the tax rate that you booked in first quarter more or less what you think the run-rate will be for this year, or what would be the right run-rate on the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, this is Rob. On the tax rate run-rate, around 38%.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, on the Intermodal side, how should we think about your volume growth there relative to the market, which was a bit stronger? Are there contracts shifting around, or is this a function of some of the changes with the underlying Intermodal marketing company partners?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, that's a good question. As we look at the Intermodal marketplace today, and we look at some of where we stand, we're being very disciplined in our approach to going after business and looking at the market. We're staying very focused on our re-investability threshold, and looking to be opportunistic. We're working with our IMC partners in terms of business availability. And, right now, they're kind of going through bid season. So, there's a lot of business up for grabs that everybody's vying for. So, until we get through May and into June, it's still somewhat of a moving target for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll tell you, I think you just have to be careful about looking at first quarter and extrapolating that out the rest of the year, particularly on the domestic intermodal side. We are seeing it start to pick up, and, but we're going to be very focused on the financial returns in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But no big contract shifts one way or another that you've seen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the coal side, absent the two or three wins here in Wisconsin, should we see the rest of that book of business grow with the existing customers as we move through the year here? It sounds like with stockpiles being a bit lower; we may actually see that growth in the existing customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the existing customer base, if you assume that we have a normal summer burn and things like that, we should see a nice ramp-up as we move into the summer season and see that business grow. A lot of it still depends on economic recovery though, too. When you look at it, Jon, there still is some discount or some reduction that's taking place because of industrial production, and some of those things that we have not yet completely recovered to where we were before the economic downturn.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to see if I could get you to put a little more color around some of the commentary we're getting on head count growth. Should we &#x2013; was there a weather component here? Did you decide to pull some hiring forward as a function of some of the weather disruptions?</p>
          <p>And then, secondarily, should we be thinking, because a lot of the commentary seems to suggest that you're doing this in anticipation of volume growth. Should we be thinking that there's some risk here if that growth doesn't materialize in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, here's the math. We're going to lose 4,000-plus employees this year through attrition. We're going to right now, our current hiring numbers are around that 4,500-plus or minus range. As Lance said, you need about &#x2013; when you look at TE&amp;Y and our conductors and engineers, you need I think at minimum six months to get them hired and trained and on the ground. So, we clearly are making a bet on the second half of the year with peak season. Now, if we are move through the second quarter here and we see the economy start to falter, we will pull that back.</p>
          <p>One of the things we do and we've shown we've been able to take advantage of is the attrition. Attrition in the company actually peaks about May or June, because the way our agreements work is you need to work X number of days to qualify for your full vacation. So, we're a little bit ahead of that right now, but I think it's something that we &#x2013; you also have some higher capital spending that's out here. But I don't necessarily see it as a risk.</p>
          <p>The risk to me is not being prepared to handle the growth and provide the service and provide that value. I think that's the real risk. Because we can cut back costs pretty quickly that's out here. But I'll tell you, we've got a great service proposition, and we're getting great value out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are confident you can dial back the cost, and just let it &#x2013; as it tread out pretty quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No question about it, Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the driver of the second half confidence? Is that just customer feedback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I believe we're getting some feedback from customers in terms you would expect kind of the normal peak. You have your international &#x2013; I mean, if you look at trends, and you assume somewhat of a normal economy, historically you should see peak start maybe July or so, early August. You're going to build; you've got the fall harvest that comes in to play. You've got the new auto production that comes in to play. All of those things happen in the second half of the year, and that's where you get your traditional peak moving up.</p>

          <p>Hi, Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe staying on the head count side for a minute, based on kind of the comments you made, I just want to make sure I understand as you see this progression going forward, I guess it seems a little bit front-half weighted, so maybe the year-over-year or sequential increases in head count probably smoothed out a little bit as you progress through the rest of the year? Is that correct, the way I'm thinking about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on volumes in terms of what happens here. Right now my view of the rest of the year is you're going to see higher volumes in third quarter than we did the prior year that's out here. And we are front-end loaded when you look at some of these costs. The question is we've got a lot of people in training today; we spend a lot of money that's not generating a dollar of revenue. So, you have to almost think of leverage in terms of the third quarter as it moves up. But it is &#x2013; it is, to some extent, front-end loaded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to that point particularly as it regards to training expenses, should we be thinking about when you look at the average cost per employee maybe smoothes out or comes down a little bit as you go forward as you start to get some of the leverage of these upfront training costs in the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the big jump in costs has happened. You're not going to see another spike-up in cost because we've built &#x2013; we've got the plan in terms of the hiring program. It's pretty well-staffed right now. So, you're not going to see a huge jump in cost going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Rob just so I'm clear, I know you mentioned other expenses coming in below kind of target. Do you have a sense of what that run-rate might look like for the rest of the year now, as we're past the $188 million you did this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That $225 million per quarter, that's still a number that I think is the right one to think through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, still stick with that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, I guess to follow up on the export coal side, Jack, you mentioned some opportunity maybe as early as next year for some export. Can you just give us a sense just as far as total volumes when you think you may be able to see next year if you do get the demand there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what? Overall, Christian, typically, when you think about UP, our run-rate for export coal has been somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 million tons. I think this year, we're probably going to be in the 4 million to 5 million ton range, and I think the potential is there if all these environmental &#x2013; there's a lot of what-ifs with the environmental stuff, but we could pick up another 2 million, 3 million tons, something like that, for next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim, I'm sorry to drive this head count thing in. I'm just a little confused. I thought you had said attrition's 4,000, you're hiring 4,500, so kind of by the end of the year, it's a net 500. Did I hear that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the way the math would work, but you have to keep thinking about how the volume numbers, and the timing of when the attrition hits that's out here. I don't think you're going to see &#x2013; we're ahead of the game right now. Again, in terms of when you look at the full complement of hirings, I do think you've got your biggest spread right now. But it's, again, a function of volume going forward, here. So, to me, though, again, Ed, the key is handling that volume that comes at us, and I'm pretty confident we're going to see a peak through this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough, Jim. On the Intermodal side, it feels like you have now taken a couple price increases in the last six or seven months, and Burlington hasn't. And I guess my question to you is, do you sense that that is changing the balance of market share, or do you get a sense that pricing &#x2013; that everybody is going to start taking up pricing soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, we compete every day. We win some and we lose some. We pay attention to our strengths and our markets that are there. When you look at &#x2013; you guys understand the truck industry, as well as anybody, and if you assume the economy is going to start picking up and you think about the cost on energy in the highway and some of the challenges they have, I think the market &#x2013; the pricing opportunity is pretty good for us. But we're going to make our decisions based on what is best for the UP railroad here in our corridors, and that gives us the greatest value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we see this strategy, and it feels like truck pricing should continue to tighten throughout the year certainly if it's tight now seasonally, the expectation would be there's more to go on domestic intermodal and peak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could be. You look for our first quarter pricing, Intermodal is pretty strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then last topic on the grain side, Jack, what tariffs have you put in place earlier in the year? And what's the opportunity for further tariffs? Can you talk about grain pricing and if there's some mix that's impacting the way the reported yields look?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we hid in some pricing for fourth quarter and April, and we'll kind of sit tight and watch what happens as the markets evolve. As with the tariff, we can increase price on a 20-days notice. So, we're just kind of watching to see what the market dynamics look like at this point in time.</p>

          <p>We had a solid quarter for Mexico. I think our growth was up about 15% in the first quarter, which is good. Business trends as we look across the scope of the business in Mexico, the only one of our six businesses that's not really showing much action right at the moment is coal, and that's because it's a very small portion of the business, and there's a bid in place as it goes right now. So, as we look across all of the rest of the businesses, whether it be Ag, Auto, Industrial Products, the Chemical business and all of that, we see great potential. The Mexico economy is tending to be a little more robust than we are in the U.S. We continue to see near-terming or bringing business back from Asian Rim into the Mexico business environment, which is very supportive of our franchise then. And we have a great working relationship with both of the Mexico railroads. So, we see a lot of potential there.</p>

          <p>And, Scott, regarding the announcement in Strauss, in fact, I'll have Lance give you the operational perspective, but we see that as a very good opportunity to grow business and improve our efficiency. Lance, why don't you talk about the operational side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Strauss is going to do three things for us, Scott. It's going to be an intermodal yard that will serve El Paso and also, south of the border business. It's going to be a run-through facility that will take some of the pressure off El Paso on our critical premium Sunset route. And it's going to be an intermodal block swapping facility that will allow us to grow outside of the LA basin both on intermodal and premium intermodal products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Intermodal business, can you talk about partnership opportunities, and how you look at working with drayage companies? Are they willing to &#x2013; it seem like a lot of them aren't willing to pick up the business because they can only get one-way routes, and they can't make money on the way back. That's what we've been hearing. So, I just want to understand, do you have the partners in place? Is that somewhat of a hurdle to growing the Intermodal cross border traffic?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I'll tell you the perspective when we are down there talking to folks in New Mexico the interest is huge, including the drayage carriers. So, this going to be a very nice facility that I think is very much needed at that location. And I just don't see that. I mean, Jack, you guys -</p>

We see a lot of partners willing to work with us there as we think about it. Of course, we always &#x2013; we're a wholesaler in the intermodal world, so it's some of our IMC partners that are arranging for drayage and those kinds of things for the most part, but we see a lot of cooperation and potential.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good afternoon. If I could just follow up with Lance on the &#x2013; you've used up a lot of useful locomotives and available furloughs. Velocity is kind of held in here. But terminal dwell looks like it's starting to creep up. How much more room capacity wise do you think is on the network? And then as that starts running up, are you looking at costs on the equipment side as well to help out with that congestion aside from the employees we've already talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Ken, in terms of how much capacity is remaining on the network, we've talked about it historically being able to run fluidly. That is with high service levels, 190,000, 195,000, seven-day carloads. We've managed to muscle through 205,000 seven-day car loads historically, just not at the current service levels. We remain confident in that, and we have a capacity program this year that'll continue to put us ahead of that growth curve. In terms of network terminal dwell and other resources that are required to kind of manage the volume growth and keep dwell down, we've got a hiring plan that's going to help us.</p>
          <p>Clearly, in the first quarter in the South, we might have had a few areas where we were a little tighter on crews than we would have liked to be. We've got graduations of our train men coming out in those areas as we speak. That would show up in a little bit of dwell. Likewise, our capital investment in equipment and locomotives, while locomotives aren't required because we've got plenty in storage. They will help us as we're able to DPU more of our traffic. Every single one of the locomotives we're purchasing is going to be DPU capable. That will help us with productivity as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ken, keep in mind you're seeing a lot of those costs in place right now. The hiring, the training, the pulling locomotives out of storage, getting them prepped. I mean, that's what we were talking about earlier that you're incurring these costs now that aren't generating a dollar of revenue that should really lever us here in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, understood. And, Jim, you were talking or I guess maybe Rob was talking about the rates being up 4.5%. But that's down sequentially from about 5.5%. I just want to understand what you were answering before. Was that something you anticipate would decelerate until those legacy contracts come up for renewal towards the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not going to decelerate. What I was talking about is you had 4.5% first quarter. This year if you look a year ago first quarter we had 3.5%. Now, it was down from what we had shown in third and fourth quarter. But be careful about assuming that's the trend. I think it will not decelerate. And depending how the demand plays out, we're going to take advantage of the opportunities going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you mentioned the $0.08 on fuel. Did you mention any impact on weather-specific costs?</p>

          <p>Ken, just remember, we did &#x2013; I did previously say not on this call, but in previous, and it still is an accurate number, that it was more of an item on our revenue, and it probably costs us about a point on volume in the quarter, the weather did.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, Lance, if you could come back to your distributor power, could you give us a sense how much of your fleet is currently equipped with DP, and how much you want to go to essentially? And as a corollary to that, how much longer can we see those train lengths go? Do you see them peaking out at what kind of level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Walter, let's start with the DPU question. We've got a fair portion, a large portion of our road fleet DPU'ed. If you look at it from the percentage of gross ton miles that we run that are DPU'ed, it's north of 60%. We anticipate being able to grow that. Every time we purchase a locomotive, we're going to be able to grow that. In terms of train sizes, we've talked about historically, that depends on the quarter. Having said that, we've got opportunity to grow train sizes in each one of the networks: premium, manifest, and bulk. So, it just depends on the corridor, and we're making investments right now in our capital plan to be able to increase train sizes through this year and into the future years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Walter, you still have a lot of single track railroad out there, and the sidings &#x2013; which can be your passing tracks can be a limiting factor on train size. And that's what Lance is referring to, is when we look at this capital investment piece in there, there's a productivity train size wise as we get that capability in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How long &#x2013; that was my next question actually on that's how long do you think out to what kind of timeframe when your entire network would be able to be optimally set up to handle these longer trains? Are we talking one, two, three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish. No. Go ahead, Lance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're constantly looking for opportunities using unified plan and investment to improve productivity. One of those ways is through train size. Continuous improvement in that area is the realistic goal, and what we're achieving. I don't think we look at that and think of one perfect balance at a moment in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have a lot of opportunity long-term though on this network. I mean, we've put a lot of money in and capital and capacity and efficiency, but there are &#x2013; to me there are opportunities at least for the foreseeable future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exciting stuff for sure. I appreciate that. And just one last quick question for Rob here. $15 million in other income, you mentioned that there was a debt redemption cost in 2010 that didn't recur. Is $15 million a good number then for us to use on a sort of go-forward basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The way we look at it, the guidance that I would give on that is about $75 million to $100 million for the full year, and it could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter so I'd look at it that way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Help me understand how you think about this with highway diesel now at $4.10 a gallon, how are you thinking about well cars and articulated wells versus flats? Does the higher price of diesel, the ever-shorter length of haul, which Intermodal is becoming cheaper than over-the-road, and the large potential incremental volume ever get to the level that you either change your view or dramatically expand your investment in flats and TOFC?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because we're getting to a point in which there's just a bigger and bigger marketplace that is available to you. Do you ever &#x2013; help me understand how you think about what you would do in changing your outlook on flats versus wells?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to tell you Don, that's a pretty strategic question in terms of what you look at. We have not had a real strong program on trailers. In fact, we have really pushed a lot into the double stack containers. But where the economics are playing right now with fuel, you're going to see us start to move in that world, in terms of putting some products in place that are pure trailer products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When I look at the marketplace, there's, what, there's as many truckload movements in the 500 mile to 600 mile length of haul as there are in the 1000 mile to 1500 mile length of haul. There's just an ever larger bite of the apple that you guys can make. The question is does the price of diesel ever get to point where you go, look, in order to take advantage of that opportunity, we're going to make much larger investments in TOFC?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're there now in terms of the TOC. And it's not only fuel. It's the other pressures on the truck side that help drive this. So, we're going to start moving down that road. We still have a lot of opportunity on the container side though, too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I could flip to Slide 22 for just one quick minute. If the fuel surcharge revenue higher year-over-year at 3.5% on a base of $3.8 billion roughly of revenue, when I just run that math, it suggests that the fuel surcharge revenue was up about $130 million, $135 million year-over-year. Fuel costs were up about $243 million year-over-year. You mentioned earlier you get about a 90% compliance rate on the surcharge. It seems to suggest that fuel is more like a $0.12 hit to numbers rather than the $0.08 hit that you've cited. I guess I'm just trying to understand better what I'm missing.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything like from higher terminals or well times or from weather, or anything else that happened in the quarter that might have disproportionately impacted the fuel consumption this quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, was flat as a result of weather and other situations. So, you have stumped me in terms of the math you just ran through, but all I can say is that the lag is the driver of that delta between the recovery we had in the quarter, and the fuel expense.</p>
