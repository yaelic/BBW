        <plist>
          <p>We start by saying seeing is believing. Those of you that have watched the quick, sort of, script there, I would like even the hardened analyst to see the last few words on that slide, which was please give generously and that's for Hong Kong and for London.</p>
          <p>Good morning London. Good afternoon to everyone here in Hong Kong. I'm always delighted to return here and this time also particularly excited as I'm heading to Beijing for the Olympics.</p>
          <p>Now, later this week with the focus and spotlight on the games, indeed for the next two weeks, you'll see why we at the bank are so excited about China, its development, vibrancy, and potential. I have every confidence that these Olympics will be an outstanding success. But another outstanding success has been our results in the first half of this year. The bank has again delivered record interim profits.</p>
          <p>These would be great results in any year, this year they are exceptional. It is important that we pause and fully reflect on these results. Now I know, you know, there are one or two cynics in the audience, that you'll want to fast forward to discuss inflation, capital, and our view of the outlook.</p>
          <p>Richard and Peter will cover these points, but before they do that, I do want you to focus on these strong first half results. It is important that we do not lose sight of exactly what we've delivered in these turbulent times. This is the strength of our franchise coming through. Our strategic focus on Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, together with strong management discipline, continues to steer us clear of the turmoil engulfing much of the financial markets. The ongoing investment agenda and the repositioning of both businesses over the last few years is why you see excellent growth today.</p>
          <p>Now Peter and the management team are to be congratulated for continuing our track record of income and profit growth during these difficult times. I'm going to do something &#x2013; look, just to break the ice because the audience here in Hong Kong is looking a bit, sort of, serious, give Peter and the team a round of applause.</p>
          <p>Now I believe the industry is experiencing the greatest upheaval in my career as a banker, and it is unlikely to get better anytime soon. The industry as a whole must reflect on what has happened over the last decade and it must examine the lessons of the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of areas that concern me most. It is clear that there has been a mispricing of risk that the market did not understand, the value and importance of liquidity. And that banks did not fully understand some of the instruments they were dealing in, increased regulation is not the answer.</p>
          <p>However, there is now rightly a robust debate playing out on these issues. We also need to question whether the market has worked in another important area, compensation. Our industry should not reward excessive risk taking, nor should it reward failure. Boards and Remuneration Committees will have to reflect on whether the risks and rewards are appropriate.</p>
          <p>In all of this, Standard Chartered is in a good position to take advantage of opportunities to continue building market share and hire top talent. We're doing both, but we will not deviate from our strategy of focusing on organic growth complemented by selective acquisition.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered has, in recent years, built an enviable depth of management, a number of them here in Hong Kong, who drive our business forward so effectively. We have a strong and sustainable business, guided by a clear and consistent strategy. We also have, which I think is very important in banking, we have a very clear value system. Our long-term view of the opportunities in our markets and how we should operate and invest in them has differentiated us and made us resilient in difficult times.</p>
          <p>We've shown that our management is disciplined as we build our business in high-growth markets. We've a culture of transparency, which enables us to have swift decision making and we have the capability to pull the right levers as circumstances change. We've achieved geographic and product diversity. We've maintained strong liquidity and capital position, without changing our strategy or reducing our dividend.</p>
          <p>Our sustainable business strategy enables us to engage deeply with our customers, communities, regulators, and staff. We now have more than 2.5 times as many staff &#x2013; employees as five years ago. And the success of our expansion is underpinned by a focus on managing talent and by our values.</p>
          <p>Now looking back, no bank has been completely unaffected or unscathed by the current turmoil. Whilst the number of large OECD players, in particular, have been severely affected, every bank should learn from these experiences. Standard Chartered's focus on Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, markets that continue to grow, has helped us deliver excellent returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now I travel, like all the management do, I travel a lot around our markets. My recent trip to Brazil, by the way we're not about to launch a deal in Brazil, the Investor Relations team insisted that I put that in, but my trip to Brazil has convinced me more than ever that there are a large number of high growth countries in the world that have dramatically changed in the last decade.</p>
          <p>These economies will be powerhouses for the world economy. Now this has huge implications for the OECD, for trade flows, and also for financial institutions. Standard Chartered is well-placed to take advantage of this trend. Standard Chartered brand is very strong. We've had an excellent first half. We enter the second half in good shape.</p>
          <p>I will now handover to Richard to talk to you through the numbers in detail. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mervyn. Good afternoon Hong Kong. Good morning London.</p>
          <p>The Group has had an outstanding first half. These results reflect the benefits of the significant investments we have made in our key markets and businesses in recent years together with the value of a clear and consistent strategy. In these turbulent times, we've continued to deliver high levels of growth, and our business pipeline is strong as we enter the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The remaining network highlights. Record levels of performance with income of almost $7 billion and profits in excess of $2.5 billion. Broad and diverse headline income growth of 33% with underlying income growth that continues to accelerate now at 28% for the half, a record high.</p>
          <p>We've continued to invest in the franchise whilst at the same time delivering good EPS growth of 19.6% and return on equity within our target range of mid to high teens of 17.8%. Impairments are low and risk remains tightly controlled. Our liquidity position remains strong. We are well capitalized.</p>
          <p>Now, let me take you through the numbers starting with the Group as whole. At a Group level, income has grown 33% during the first six months of 2008 driven by an excellent performance from Wholesale Banking with income growth of 47%.</p>
          <p>Expenses have grown 34%, reflecting both our continuing investment in the business and in line with our stance of managing cost growth broadly in line with income growth. We've surpassed $2.5 billion of profit before tax for the first time, up 31% on the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>The picture on an underlying or organic basis, by which I mean, excluding the impact of American Express Bank is also very strong with organic income growth at 28%, 3% positive jaws, and profit before tax growing 31% income. We've consistently stated that our organic performance is the key to value creation and it is the organic business that continues to power our performance of the total income growth of 33% to approximately $1.7 billion, some $1.5 billion approaching 85% comes from the organic business.</p>
          <p>The underlying rate of income growth of 28% is a record high, accelerating on the momentum seen over the previous four years of 13%, then 14%, then 18%, then 23%, and now in the first half of 2008, 28%. Our investment program is paying off.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking contributed around two-thirds of the incremental year-on-year increase in income geographies. Trading conditions in the Groups' main operating markets have benefited from robust economic growth, good local currency liquidity, and sound credit environments. Moreover, in many geographies, we have continued to see a clear upwards repricing of risk across multiple asset categories. The strength of our income and profit performance is broad based. And if you listen for the percentages, you'll get a sense of the metabolic rate at which the Group is traveling.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong has again delivered double-digit income growth and operating profit was up 28% year-on-year. Singapore income was up an excellent 62% year-on-year, with very strong contributions from both businesses. Profits were up 55%.</p>
          <p>We continue to reshape the business in Korea to good effect. And income grew by 8% on a headline basis and profit before tax at 7%. And I'll come back to this later.</p>
          <p>Other APR, which includes geographies such as Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, and China, saw income growing 22%, and profit before tax 26%. These are strong percentage growth rates.</p>
          <p>Now income in China grew 24% to $306 million. Income grew rapidly as we continue to invest in products and channel distribution, expanding outlets from 30 to 46 over the past 12 months. There were, however, no private equity gains in the first half of 2008 and operating profit in China fell 53% to $57 million.</p>
          <p>In India, the business continues to thrive. Operating profit was up 89%, driven by excellent income growth of 73%. This includes the gain on the sale of our asset management company, which is not allocated to either business. Therefore, excluding this, Consumer Banking income growth has accelerated with growth of 35% and Wholesale Banking in India has delivered another outstanding performance with income up over 50%.</p>
          <p>Middle East and Other South Asia or MESA had strong income growth of 32%, but UAE and Bahrain saw income growth in excess of 40%. Pakistan's income, however, was up only single digits, as we reduced our risk appetite in the Consumer Banking business.</p>
          <p>You will notice again that the Americas, U.K., and Europe region is showing a substantial loss. You should bear in mind that a charge to profits of $130 million related to the asset backed securities portfolio has been taken here. Expenses in this region have grown by over 80%, reflecting the inclusion of AEB, increased levels of head count and compensation costs, as well as new investment.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk about the performance of Consumer Banking. On a headline basis, Consumer Banking delivered income growth of 15% and expense growth of 22%, with operating before tax &#x2013; operating profit before tax up 2%. Underlying double-digit income growth of 10% is underpinned by continuing strong growth in SME and Wealth Management, particularly in non-funded income.</p>
          <p>This has more than offset the impact of liability margins, which have fallen in line with interest rates in a number of key markets, and a less favorable market for investment sales as equity markets fell.</p>
          <p>As we continue to invest strongly across our franchise, costs have grown faster than income. And as expected, Consumer Banking produced negative jaws of 7%. Underlying jaws, however, are much tighter, negative 2%.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking income growth is increasingly well diversified with five individual markets now contributing $200 million or more in income compared to only two markets in the first half of 2006. Wealth Management grew by 23% and now contributes almost half of total Consumer Banking income, up from one-third five years ago.</p>
          <p>Singapore with an income growth rate of 45%, India with income growth of 35%, and Africa with 23%, have all performed particularly well. Income in the Europe and Americas region has almost trebled reflecting the inclusion of AEB. Hong Kong, a core engine of the bank, also delivered double-digit income growth.</p>
          <p>The decision to rein in the unsecured business in Pakistan in response to the operating environment, as well as a repositioning in the UAE of the bancassurance offering, negatively impacted income in MESA.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs, Consumer Banking expenses were up 22% or on an underlying basis 12%. On the second half of 2007, underlying expenses are flat, as we have deliberately constrained cost growth given the revenue horizon. If we focus on this underlying 12%, that is some $130 million of the 186 million increase, is attributable to accelerated investment in future growth.</p>
          <p>We have invested in distribution capabilities key for both SME and Wealth Management with over 60 new branches in Pakistan, in China, in Indonesia, and in Africa, and over 100 new ATMs. We've pushed on with product innovation such our recently launched renminbi debit card in China and have continued rollout improved Internet Banking platforms in Hong Kong, China, and India.</p>
          <p>Of this $130 million of investment, around 20% was invested in China as we continue to invest in this core market. Paybacks in China are projected to be in excess of three years. Around 50% of the investment was made in Hong Kong, in India, and in Singapore, where paybacks remain well under 12 months.</p>
          <p>We are both investing hard but also managing our BAU costs tightly to generate investment capacity. BAU costs, including the impact of inflation, represent only some $15 million of the total increase in underlying expenses.</p>
          <p>Turning to impairment, the Consumer Banking loan impairment charge has increased from $372 million to $412 million. For the overall Consumer Banking portfolio, delinquency indicators remains stable and the cover ratio remains high at 78%.</p>
          <p>The majority of the year-on-year increase reflects the seasoning of our SME portfolio in Korea, balanced by an improving situation in Taiwan. Impairments are slightly higher in Pakistan as a result of the operating environment, but this is not material in the Group context. As we have reduced our risk appetite in Pakistan, we have witnessed a slightly improving trend in impairment compared to the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>So to summarize for Consumer Banking, overall, we have maintained double-digit income momentum in the face of liability spread compression, income growth is broad-based reflecting the breadth and scale of our franchise, and we have a confident investment agenda for future growth. Asset quality remains very good.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Wholesale Banking. Wholesale Banking has delivered an outstanding result with operating profit growing 38% on income that grew 47% headline or 42% excluding AEB.</p>
          <p>The feature of these results is the breadth and diversity of the Wholesale Banking business, which when reviewed by product, by customer segment, or by geography, is firing on all cylinders.</p>
          <p>The deal pipeline is strong as we enter the second half. We continue to deepen client relationships, increasing cross-sell and our ship to higher value products is delivering strong return.</p>
          <p>We are becoming a core bank to more of our clients, providing a platform from which to deliver sustainable income growth. We've increased by 60% the number of clients, which generate over $5 million of income per annum.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking has very strong and broad-based income growth, whilst expenses have also grown strongly, but with increased flexibility. New provisions remain low reflecting the robustness and diversity of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We continue to be disciplined in managing the relationship between risk-weighted assets and income growth with an ongoing focus on origination and distribution of assets and an increased benefit from our advanced IRB status under Basel II.</p>
          <p>During the first half of the year, we have continued to witness good demand for secondary paper and we have distributed some $22 billion of assets into the secondary market.</p>
          <p>Per these metrics of 42% underlying income growth neutral jaws, 35% underlying profit growth are excellent. Our markets are very much open for business and we enter the second half of 2008 with very strong momentum, but as you would expect, we remain vigilant of the external environment.</p>
          <p>Income, as a result of our capital and liquidity strength, we have been able to write more business as some of our competitors have eased-off. As liquidity has tightened, we have taken the opportunity to reprice assets across many of our markets and asset classes.</p>
          <p>Client income growth remained robust at 36%, excluding AEB, and is driven by strong growth across all client segments with growth strongest in our key geographies. Client income accounts for some 70% of year-on-year incremental income and continues to contribute in excess of 75% of total Wholesale Banking income.</p>
          <p>Looking to the customer loans, our use of the advanced Basel II approach to credit risk is providing us with a real competitive advantage, especially when servicing local corporate clients.</p>
          <p>The local corporate segment grew income in the first half of 2008 at 44%, global corporate grew at 31%, financial institutions at 50%, and our commodity segment at 51%. These are excellent growth metrics.</p>
          <p>Looking through the product loans, Trade and Lending income grew by 35%, Cash Management and Custody grew 28%, and Global Markets achieved 61% growth with strong growth across a broad range of products, again excellent metrics. We continue to drive Wholesale Banking income of our broader and more sophisticated product offering.</p>
          <p>Expenses, Wholesale Banking expenses were up 49% on a year-on-year basis and 42% on an underlying basis. Of this underlying increase and expenses, 2% relates to incremental investment for future growth, 6% to increased spend on regulatory and control infrastructure, and 34%, the largest part, is the direct result of business and income growth.</p>
          <p>Variable costs, as a percentage of the Wholesale Banking cost base, has moved up to 33% from 26% in 2006 and 30% in 2007. We've continued to increase the flexibility of our expense base. Performance-related compensation now constitutes some 47% of total Wholesale Banking staff costs, up from 35% in 2006 and 41% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to loan impairment. Wholesale Banking loan impairment was a net charge of $53 million to the income statement. New growth provisions remained at very low levels, similar to the second half of 2007, although slightly up on the levels seen in the first half of 2007. Recoveries reduced $23 million year-on-year reflecting in part the declining stock of provisions. We remain vigilant and have benefited from proactive and robust risk management and have continued to secure recoveries. Leading indicators through our portfolio remains strong.</p>
          <p>Early alerts remain at low levels without any geographic or industry concentration and the cover ratio remains high at 84%. The risk profile of Wholesale Banking exposures is well diversified with no material exposures to asset classes that have caused damage to Western Hemisphere banks. Overall, Wholesale Banking has delivered an outstanding first half with record levels of income growth, well controlled investment, and focused management of risk, and operating profits rose by 38%, underlying profits rose by 35%</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our recent acquisitions and firstly Korea. Korea's change program is on track and we are making progress. SCFB is trading ahead of our internals targets, margins are improving and income momentum is seeing some traction. On a headline basis, income grew by 8% in the first half with operating profit growth of 7%. This is despite the substantial negative impact of the depreciation in the Korean won during the first six months of the year.</p>
          <p>We have had some benefit from FVAs albeit at a lower level than in the first half of 2007, although this has been offset by some improvement in the results from the hedges of the Korean mortgage portfolio. Adjusting for currency impact, income grew by 14% and operating profit by 13%.</p>
          <p>As we look at the second half, we are planning on double-digit income growth for the full year on a reported basis. We also anticipate in the second half a material acceleration in investment as we invest in productivity and efficiency saves, refurbish and relocate branches, and broaden the Wholesale Banking products suite.</p>
          <p>We expect the impact of both exchange rate and hedging to remain volatile. Now through acquisition of Hsinchu in Taiwan, we remain confident that Hsinchu will be EPS accretive and deliver double-digit return on the investment in 2008. However, the performance of the Wealth Management business will be pivotal in the achievement of these metrics.</p>
          <p>American Express Bank. We completed the acquisition of AB on the 29th of February and have made good progress in the integration. So far, we've amalgamated in over half of the 48 countries in which AB operates. In terms of performance, AEB delivered $265 million of income during the period of ownership in the first half, and profit before integration expense was $51 million. We expect integration expenses to be around $180 million in 2008 resulting in a loss of around $80 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>In 2009, integration expenses are expected to fall significantly to around $75 million. We have identified some tens of millions of cost synergies in excess of the original $100 million initially estimated and we are confident of EPS accretion and the double-digit return on investment in 2009 and expect a strong delta in 2009 on 2008 in terms of operating profit contribution.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Groups' balance sheet. The Group remains strongly liquid, both in parts and as a whole, with a diverse and growing funding base. Current accounts and savings accounts or CASA grew by some $24 billion or 27% year-on-year and growth was well spread by geography</p>
          <p>Total customer deposits grew 28%. The ratio of customer loans to customer deposits, the A/D ratio is a healthy 85% in line with our long-term trends. Approximately 23% of assets are held in cash, net interbank placements, and marketable assets. As of 30th of June, the Group was a net interbank lender.</p>
          <p>We've remained in a strong liquidity position throughout the financial turmoil and are focused on maintaining this liquidity as a key enabler of business growth. The strength of our deposit franchise has underpinned the increase in loans and advances to customers; these grew by 15% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains robust, let me evidence its strength. We have low loan to values, LTVs, on our mortgage book with an average LTV of 49%, a short maturity profile on our wholesale loan book, low aggregate stick positions, low exposure to high-risk categories such as asset-backed securities, level free assets, commercial real estate, and leveraged loans, and overall exposures are well spread over geography and sector with no material concentrations.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet remains robust and well diversified. Let me now provide some specific comments on the asset-backed securities portfolio. This slide sets out our asset-backed security exposures both as at the year-end and as at 30th of June. To be clear, the first two columns are gross exposures and do not reflect the impact of either impairments or marks. The third column shows the carrying value on the balance sheet after adjusting for both marks and impairment as at the 30th of June.</p>
          <p>As we previously stated, our ABS exposure at the end of last year was around $5.9 billion or some 1.8% of Group assets. Since the year-end, we have seen redemptions approaching $500 million, resulting in a write-back to income of around $5 million reflecting the recovery of earlier lower marks.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have sold around $350 million of ABS inside of our year-end marks. We've also written new business, including one transaction of $400 million of new auto receivables business for an existing client in Asia.</p>
          <p>Our ABS portfolio at 30th of June stood at just less than $5.6 billion, representing less than 1.5% of total Group assets. As we previously stated, the Group has no direct exposure to U.S. sub-prime and extremely limited in direct exposure. Approximately 5% of the portfolio or $264 million is in ABS CDO against which we have taken $173 million of impairment-related charges.</p>
          <p>The portfolio is marked at $0.30 in the dollar. $394 million of the portfolio is held in other CDOs, which have an average credit rating of AAA. These assets are trading well and are marked at $0.85 in the dollar. Only $91 million of the portfolio is in U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities. Over half of this portfolio exposure is to 2005 vintages or earlier and only 3% of it has exposure to 2007.</p>
          <p>Other ABS of $2.2 billion has an average credit rating of AA and increased credit card receivables, future flow transactions, and auto loans, and the average mark is 93. In the first half of 2008, we have taken a charge to the income statement of $130 million of which $129 million was contract income, and we also took a charge of $186 million to reserves. Given the significant dislocation in the external market, this relatively small charge evidence is the relative quality of the ABS book.</p>
          <p>If we take accounts of cumulative adjustments to the gross exposures whether through impairment on marks, we arrive at a net exposure of some $5 billion, shown in the right-hand column, or less than 1.3% of Group assets.</p>
          <p>Total risk-weighted assets and the migration from Basel I to Basel II. You can see from this slide that on the 31st of December 2007, the transition from Basel I to Basel II increased our risk-weighted assets or RWA overnight from $172 billion to $185 billion. This is almost entirely due to the inclusion of RWA related to operational risk totaling $14 billion.</p>
          <p>Credit risk was broadly equivalent under both regimes. Although there was a redistribution from Consumer Banking to Wholesale Banking with market risk not having been affected.</p>
          <p>During the first half of the year, RWAs have increased by a further $19 billion. The completion of the acquisition of AB added over $8 billion and the deployment of capital into the Wholesale Banking business has added over $10 billion of incremental RWAs since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Excluding AB, Wholesale Banking risk-weighted assets have grown by 8% since December 2007, against growth in client income of 15% over the same period. We've taken advantage of market opportunities to grow our RWAs in value-add and strategic products such as commodity derivatives and corporate finance.</p>
          <p>Geographically, RWAs have been predominately deployed to our key markets in India, in China, the Middle East, and Singapore. Basel II is now firmly embedded in our business models and is increasingly driving our pricing and our risk behavior.</p>
          <p>Capital, we have taken a proactive approach to raising capital to support our high level of organic income growth. We've raised around $5 billion of preference shares and debt in the first half of the year. You can see that for Tier-1 capital, we remain strongly within our target range with a ratio of 8.5%.</p>
          <p>And we remain above our 12 to 14% range for total capital at 14.9%. The business has continued to generate high levels of earnings during the first half of the year, albeit its contribution to reserves has been impacted by two factors. Firstly, by negative currency translation on net asset values across the Group mainly in Korea and India of some $800 million. And secondly, by valuation adjustments on available for sale assets totaling some $900 million of which private equity accounted for around two-thirds.</p>
          <p>Since the year-end, the completion of AEB, which was pre-funded in 2007, has reduced total Tier 1 capital by over 80 basis points and over 50 basis points, respectively. Sorry total by 80 and Tier 1 by 50, sorry.</p>
          <p>The ratios have also been impacted by the acquisition of Yeahreum, a mutual savings bank in Korea, and by selective out-of-area growth as we have deepened client relationships and taken market share.</p>
          <p>You will notice that we are disclosing our core Tier 1 capital ratio at 6.1% for the first time. Broadly, core Tier 1 is total Tier 1 is less preference shares and innovative Tier 1 securities.</p>
          <p>At year-end on a Basel I basis, core Tier 1 was 7.2% and on a Basel II basis, 6.6%. The difference between the two is the impact of operational risk in the Basel II calculation.</p>
          <p>At 30th of June, core Tier 1 was 6.1%. Virtually, all of the movement from 6.6% to 6.1% is explained by the completion of AEB, which accounted for just over 40 basis points of the decrease and also by the acquisition of Yeahreum. Our organic capital generation has funded business growth.</p>
          <p>Turning now to outlook. The markets remains uncertain, and we must be mindful of the risk that the deteriorating western economies pose. The Group has delivered a very strong performance in the first half of the year. It is broadly based, not concentrated on a particular economy or business and, therefore, more resilient. We are in excellent shape and have entered the second half strongly with Consumer Banking, steady; and Wholesale Banking, strong.</p>
          <p>We will manage the bank to deliver on our financial objectives and will deploy our liquidity and capital to take advantage of the continued dislocation to capture market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I'll hand over to Peter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Good morning London. Good afternoon Hong Kong, and particularly, a thank you to Hong Kong for that &#x2013; for the generous applause. Confronted with this great set of numbers in the midst of all the turmoil, I imagine you have two broad sets of questions. First, why are Standard Chartered's numbers so different? How can we grow so quickly? Why are we so unscathed? Is it the results of our business or geographic mix, or did we do something different? Second, and perhaps more importantly, is this sustainable? Can we keep up such performance, or is it only a matter of time before the turbulence hits us?</p>
          <p>So, I thought, I'd try to address both these questions and then tell you what's on my mind, what my priorities are, as we enter the second half of 2008. So first, why are our numbers so different? One should never deny the role of fortune in business. We've had our share of good and bad luck, but beyond that in explaining our performance, there are number of factors to point to. We have a clear and consistent strategy to lead the way in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and we've been very disciplined in sticking to it.</p>
          <p>We believe in doing business in markets we know intimately, with products we understand fully, with customers with whom we build deep relationships. We've never lost sight of the basic foundations of good banking. Proactive managements of liquidity and capital, an anticipatory approach to risk, disciplined control of costs, a relentless drive to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, continuous improvement in customer service. It's easy to sail a boat when the sea is clam and the breeze gentle. It's when it gets rough that you know you've got the right rigging and sails and the crew knows its stuff.</p>
          <p>Our distinctive culture and values have played a huge role in our success and resilience. And I'll point to three aspects of this. Open communication and challenge, you need people to probe and challenge assumptions. You need bad news to travel fast. You need people to share information and collaborate. That's how we protect the bank.</p>
          <p>Learning from mistakes, we've made plenty of mistakes. No doubt we'll make more. The trick is not to pretend you are immune, but to make every problem whether ours' or others' an opportunity to improve and learn. It's a kind of constructive humility. Being one bank, I think the last 12 months have proven how dangerous it is to run a bank as a collection of silos. And there are always good reasons for drifting in this direction, line of sight and performance, incentives, clarity of focus, but these must be resisted. At its core, a bank is intrinsically one business, one balance sheet, one reputation. We run Standard Chartered as one bank.</p>
          <p>We have learned much over the last 12 months about what really matters in banking and I could talk for a long time on the topic, but I know it's the second question that really interests you all. It's all very well producing an outstanding first half, but is this performance sustainable? What happens next?</p>
          <p>There are two parts to answering this question. There is the external environment and there is the bank itself. Looking at the external environment, especially here in the West, there is lots we could all get depressed about. So, let's start with that. But our markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are not directly affected by the massive de-leveraging and liquidity crunches that we are seeing here, nor will they be, because the ingredients for these problems, the over-leverage, the skewed funding profiles, the over-complexity, simply aren't present. And our markets are being affected by inflation, high energy, and commodity prices and the second order consequences of the slowdown in the West.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a little about how each of these affects us. First, inflation. Although the scale and the nature of the inflation challenge varies dramatically by market, inflation is undoubtedly bad for economic growth and in that respect it's bad for us. But in other respects, inflation isn't all bad for bankers. Whilst we get hit by cost inflation, although in our markets that isn't a new phenomenon by any means, high and frequently changing interest rates can be good for margins as long as you call the shifts in yield curves correctly. Much depends on the policy response. Where authorities raise interest rates or the exchange rate to squeeze out inflation, that can often be positive for us. Where they increase reserve ratios or put quantitative curbs on lending, that's more negative. Because of inflation, we expect to see considerable volatility in interest rates and currencies over the next few months. That will underpin trading volumes in FX and rates, as well as demand for derivatives.</p>
          <p>Second, high energy and commodity prices. Although these benefit a number of our markets in Africa and the Middle East, they are proving a significant challenge elsewhere. High-energy prices, in particular, take money out of people's pockets and slow economic growth. Government subsidy schemes have tempered the impact in many of our markets. But it's clearly not feeding through, particularly in the most exposed economies. This will affect consumer demand and economic growth. How much depends on where energy prices go from here.</p>
          <p>We anticipate considerable volatility as demand slows and also as the markets react to supply, risks, and constraints. Harrison Lovegrove, the oil and gas advisory boutique, and the investments we've made in developing capabilities in the renewable energy space have positioned us well to be a major player in this increasingly strategic arena.</p>
          <p>Third, the second order impact of a slowdown in the West. This will undoubtedly have a negative impact on export-oriented companies and countries. Many can redirect their efforts to meet increasing domestic or intra-regional demand. But some, particularly the smaller companies, won't be able to do this. So we've been screening our exposures and where necessary re-shaping the portfolio. How big an issue this becomes depends on two factors. First, how deep and prolonged the slowdown in the U.S. and Europe is? And second, how much the fight against inflation and the impact of high-energy prices take the steam at a rapidly increasing domestic demand in markets like China and India.</p>
          <p>We don't pretend to have a precise answer to these dynamics but we're monitoring it very carefully. So there's much to watch and worry about but it's also important to keep perspective. While we do expect the economies of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East to show slower growth in 2008 and 2009 than in 2007, we're still talking about rates of growth of 6% in the UAE, more than 7% in India, around 9% in China and Nigeria. By European or U.S. standards, this is still breakneck pace. Our markets have not decoupled but neither are they in lock step.</p>
          <p>While we can't really doubt, we don't expect a major interruption in Asian growth rather a moderation more marked in some places than others. The economies of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are fundamentally much more resilient than in the late 1990s. We are in the right markets at the right time.</p>
          <p>And we're not yet seeing the impact of these issues in our numbers. There's no real sign of deterioration in credit quality in either Wholesale or Consumer, and income momentum, as Richard has described, remains robust. Which brings me to the other part of the answer, about performance sustainability, the bank itself. The bank is in great shape, well capitalized, highly liquid with good momentum. Yes, there's lots we can do better, things we can fix, or that a work in progress. But I don't see that as a problem more as an upside.</p>
          <p>For example, while we are making good progress on getting Korea on to the right performance trajectory, there's still a lot to do. In the second half, you will see us restructuring the head office in Seoul, reconfiguring part of the branch network, and launching the securities business. We only received final approval for the securities business two weeks ago. Already, we have over 70 people in place. We expect to start trading within weeks, with an initial focus on fixed income.</p>
          <p>The integration of American Express Bank is still very much work in progress. This year as expected it will be a drag on our financial performance, given integration costs, but we're ahead schedule and increasing our synergy targets. You'll see the benefits coming through in 2009, it's early days but this looks like a great deal.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to invest for growth, despite the uncertainties in the external environment. We know we are taking some risk here but this is also how we turn the turmoil to our advantage. We'll continue to pace our investment in line with income growth and the overall performance of the business but we'll not lose sight of our strategic priorities or the opportunities to seize market share.</p>
          <p>For example, in Wholesale Banking we're building financial markets with income up over 50% and corporate advisory up in excess of 130%. We are hiring exceptional talent from the market and investing in systems and control infrastructure. Our deal pipeline looks good.</p>
          <p>We are also investing in the technology operations and sales infrastructure of our core transactional banking businesses, trade finance, and cash management. These are traditional Wholesale Banking businesses remain powerful engines of growth. In trade finance, for example, income grew 40% year-on-year, with income per salesperson up 20%, online transactions up 50%.</p>
          <p>The underlying driver of income growth in Wholesale Banking across all products remains deeper client relationships. Income from our top 50 clients has increased 50% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Banking, we have continued to invest to build the franchise, despite the pressures on income momentum. This is an example of how we are running the bank with a one bank perspective. We are using the strength of Wholesale Banking performers to give us the investment headroom in Consumer Banking. We're investing in Consumer Banking businesses that in turn complement and support the momentum of Wholesale Banking.</p>
          <p>The Standard Chartered Private Bank is a great example. In the last 15 months, we've gone from having no private bank to one with over 35 billion in assets under management, over 280 relationship managers, and over 19,000 customer accounts. We've only just started, but already we've Euromoney's award as the Global Best Private Bank.</p>
          <p>The private bank is a great business in its own right, but it's also a source of stable liabilities and a powerful way to reinforce and deepen relationships with individuals. Individuals, who are often the owners and key decision makers in our Wholesale Banking clients, in fact, we're already seeing a two way referral flow.</p>
          <p>But building the private banking is not a quick or easy task. And the return on our investment will take time. Yet given the size of the private banking price in our markets, the way it works for both businesses and the current disarray of our key competitors, continuing to invest has to make sense.</p>
          <p>Another investment priority, the one that also has a relatively long payback period is China. In the last six months, Consumer Banking in China has lost almost $50 million. There is nothing wrong with the intrinsic economics. It's just that in the space of the last 15 months, we've created a significant Renminbi Consumer Banking business and grown to have a total of 46 outlets across 16 cities.</p>
          <p>As with the private bank, we see Consumer Banking as a very attractive business in its own right but also strategically critical to the overall development of Standard Chartered in China. To achieve our aspirations in Wholesale Banking in China, we'll need the network brand presence and stable deposit base of our Consumer franchise.</p>
          <p>Just two weeks ago, we launched the debit card in China. This is key to being able to attract the current accounts that will be the foundation of our franchise and overall balance sheet.</p>
          <p>China is encountering some economic strains and will have bumps, but it's a huge opportunity and the best way to grasp the opportunity and ride the bumps is to build a balanced business of scale.</p>
          <p>Looking at Consumer Banking as a whole, over the last three years we have more than doubled revenues, more than tripled our branch network, and more than quadrupled our ATMs. We have seen strong growth in Wealth Management and SME Banking, and have made a good start in creating a customer-centric organization. I would like to thank Mike DeNoma who has left a great foundation on which to build.</p>
          <p>There is more we can and will do to accelerate income momentum and improve productivity. Steve Bertamini, who joined the Board as CEO Consumer Banking at the beginning of June, has brought a fresh perspective and plenty of new ideas. Under his leadership, you'll see even greater emphasis on deepening customer relationships, on re-engineering and productivity, on technology-driven innovation, and on building a Consumer Banking business that leverages and in turn supports our strength in Wholesale Banking. I'm delighted to have him on Board.</p>
          <p>One of the highlights in the first six months of 2008 for me personally was celebrating the 150th anniversary of opening our first branch in Kolkata. We have the longest continuous history of any foreign bank in India, which is now our second largest market. Overall, the bank is in great shape, strongly positioned to weather the economic uncertainties, superbly placed to capture opportunities.</p>
          <p>So in answering the question of what next, there needs to be a balance. We don't want to appear to be underestimating the challenges in the external environment, these are real. And we can't predict quite what will happen. But I also want to make sure we get across our strength and confidence.</p>
          <p>We enter the second half with clear priorities. Obviously I'm focused on ensuring that we continue to navigate our way through the storm successfully, that we don't make basic mistakes, that we are extraordinarily vigilant and nimble. I'm very proud of the way the bank has performed during this extraordinary period, I don't want to slip up now.</p>
          <p>We are focused on striking the right stance on investments and costs and on risk appetite. I don't want us to overreact, but nor can we ignore what's happening. There is a lot judgment in how we flex our costs and risk profile, while keeping a firm eye on our strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we need to make sure that amidst all the turbulence, we don't lose sight of some of the longer-term drivers of shareholder value. Our commitment to sustainability to making a difference in the communities in which we live and work, the strength of our talent pipeline, attracting and developing a diverse set of future leaders, reinforcing the brand, increasingly powerful yet capable of much more.</p>
          <p>In that vein, I'm focused on our culture and values, being one bank, celebrating what's distinct of a bankers. Our culture and values may be intangible, but I see them as key to our shareholder value, key to our brand, key to protecting the bank, and not something we can take for granted.</p>
          <p>Despite all the turmoil, Standard Chartered has never been in better shape, highly profitable, well-capitalized, very liquid, attracting talents, deepening client relationships, building the brand.</p>
          <p>We look ahead sharp-eyed to spot the dangers, but also alert to the opportunities. We look ahead confident to invest, but also knowing where and how to react as new challenges emerge. We look ahead building one bank to lead the way in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Hi, it's Mike Trippitt at Oriel Securities. Two questions if possible. Just a detailed one on Korea consumer impairment charges, you sort of touched on it briefly, Rich, but that seems to be the one in Consumer Banking that has increased significantly half-on-half. You were talking that &#x2013; in the release a bit about building SME and also seasoning. I just wondered if you could sort of give a little bit more flavor on that and how that sort of plays out the second half of this year. Second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the second question is just on the &#x2013; sort of its broader sort of macro, but on your &#x2013; I was just curious on your economic pages, it looks like China and India inflation rate halves in '09 and growth continues. And that seems to be &#x2013; I just wonder how you expect them to pull that one out of the hat going into '09 and what happens to interest rates and currencies if that's the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you take the first half, I'll take the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, quite right to pick up. Across this Consumer Bank loan impairment picture the only country, which has any pickup, I would call material grouped, is Korea. It attaches to the SME portfolio. The SME portfolio is about 4.9 billion if you look across to the balance sheet. It's predominately seasoning of that portfolio, SME. This was slight uptick also in delinquencies attaching to installment loan provisions and on the installment loan provisions, they were vintages &#x2013; vintage of around &#x2013; of earlier six, we've tightened those underwriting criteria.</p>
          <p>We're generally taking a tighter underwriting position with regard to SME exposures in Korea. If you ask which economies might one reflect on for risks, I think looking at Korea for exports in SME would we know we would watch for, at the moment though it's a few tens of millions up that you can see 30 million or so in SME, there is another one which is BIO, which is increasing delinquency. There is also an element, which is seasoning of the book as you get &#x2013; as it really comes through and the national run rate expected delinquency run rates emerge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the broader issue of the sort of macro forecast, the first thing I would say and the Standard Chartered economists probably, I don't know, if Gerard is here probably won't thank me for saying it is I don't want to exaggerate the degree to which we think we know exactly what is going to happen, because I think all of us need a little humility or better ability to forecast 12 months ahead. But I think there is a reasonable argument that there is a degree to which we've got a step change in price structures in many of our markets due to the change in energy and food prices.</p>
          <p>And if they don't continue to accelerate and grow that that should pass through the system and that you will get a natural reduction in inflation rates as you go into 2009. For that to be true means that the authorities have to be successful in ensuring that inflation doesn't spread out as a wider phenomenon. So a lot of it depends on the way that the different governments and central banks respond to the inflationary challenge.</p>
          <p>But we think it is reasonable to surmise that actually you'll get a bit of a bump of inflation. It'll still be higher in 2009 than it was in 2007. So it won't come back entirely, but it could slow off in 2009. But the broader, I mean, at a very high level what we are anticipating is just a fair amount of volatility in currencies and interest rates as this whole thing plays out. Take one on the left.</p>

          <p>Sorry. Global markets division added about 800 million of revenues, of that about 600 million seems to have come from foreign exchange. So I appreciate the message that you've got more clients and they're dealing more with you, but it seems to be very focused in one market. I wondered if you could comment on that?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, let me draw out also if I can the note three that we always tend to have a conversation about where I think you can probably you've drawn some of your numbers from. Clearly, we have had a very good experience in foreign exchange servicing client needs. If you look at on note three, which describes net trading income over 80%, material proportion of over 80% of this income is client income.</p>
          <p>And we've clearly seen in the first half of this year volatility attached to currencies, we've taken advantage of that servicing our clients as they have looked to position against that volatility. You'll remember that we talked actually last time when we're doing this at &#x2013; and our year-end results that we'd had a truly excellent start to the year, a record year and particularly in January. A lot of that record year was coming through in this particular business line as the year started and as customers took positions as to the exchange rate exposures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a broader point though in the sense that I think the two sort of broad points. One is that we are still in the process of building out our product capability and a lot of it is related to &#x2013; it's fundamentally related to risk management around FX and interest rates. So there is a development product capability within global markets. The second point is which is a point we've made I think consistently, is that we do benefit when there is volatility, because the more volatility, the risk managed, the more clients need our products and services.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. It's Tom Rayner from Citigroup. With apologies to Mervyn in Hong Kong, I'm not sure you've really deserved your clap in the first half. The reason I say that is I'm just questioning the sustainability of some of the trends here, because if we take out the disposal gain and normalize the FX volatility revenue that you've just described, you can halve the pace of revenue growth roughly in the first half, which would give you a pretty flat looking profile pre-provision profit. And I also noticed that in the first half the Wholesale Banking has grown its loans about 54% annualized, which &#x2013; my question is with a 6.1% core equity Tier 1 ratio can you really rebuild that to a sort of more acceptable level and fund that sort of volume growth going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, your view on, Tom, normalizing for what you call the foreign currency gains isn't one that I would recognize. If I look at the wholesale bank and we use it for I think I used in my presentation actually. Wholesale Banking is firing in all cylinders, whether you look at a geographic lens, a customer lens, a product lens. So if you look at the product performance you see trade and lending up 35%, you see cash and custody up 28%, global market across a broad range up 61%.</p>
          <p>You can do the geographies. You can do geographies with performance up 79% in Singapore. You can see over 70% -- sorry 79% in Singapore, over 70% in Thailand, over 70% in Malaysia, over 50% in Hong Kong, in India, in Taiwan, in Pakistan so you have a strong geographic growth. If you look at the bank, 40% of the banks' income actually comes from staple banking products, the development of our trade and our cash, so it's a very significant proportion, which is very good endowment the business for the business.</p>
          <p>And it's also important that what we have developed over the past year as in the Wholesale Banking strategy is a build-out on those relationships to add better products and broader products and then penetrate the client relationships with them and that's a success for the Wholesale Banking strategy that you are seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that the other point &#x2013; the other question you raised was about capital. I mean &#x2013; we are very, very comfortable with both our capital position and the shape of the balance sheet as a whole. We are well capitalized at total Tier 1 core. We funded the growth in the first half through the earnings generation and we are very capital &#x2013; we are very comfortable from the liquidity point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, to add to that, look at risk-weighted assets in the Wholesale Bank. And the risk-weighted assets in the wholesale bank grew in the first half, excluding AEB, 8%. We referenced a couple of times that we are beginning to get significant benefit flowing through actually from the advanced status with -- under Basel II. And that particularly attaches to local corporates, it particularly attaches to the offset of collateral exposures to those underlying loans. You take that picture and you think about our competitive position in a number of our markets such as India and we can generate very good levels of risk-weighed asset growth that our capital is well able to serve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just come back on that please, because I mean it's still a fact and I think it's a clean number that the Wholesale Bank grew its loans 54% annualized in the first half for the year I don't imagine that you will be expecting that sort of pace to continue and you looked at the half yearly performance on the FX, for instance, has gone 400, 400, 1 billion and again I am sure that the client relationships are deepening but it doesn't explain a jump of that magnitude.</p>
          <p>I am just trying to get a sense for the sustainability of the trends into the second half, but it seems very much the business is more and more dominated by Wholesale versus Consumer, I mean Wholesale Banking is really driving things now. And if we have any questions on sustainability of that then it brings the question of the profit growth for the Group as a whole?</p>

          <p>I mean the only thing I'll pick up on the FX is I think it was a very strong performance in FX, absolutely strong growth. It's a little bit exaggerated because you'll also find that the movements in the Korean RMBS in that note three. And that sort of exaggerates, if you strip that out, it's still a very strong performance, but it's not in that line with the rest of global markets.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of sustainability, I could recite, as you might imagine further evidence of good performance and we've referenced a very strong deal pipeline that the Wholesale Bank has as it goes into the second half. But actually we look to low &#x2013; look to grow our risk-weighted assets, governed by the client income we generate. So what you have seen in that first half is client income growing 15% to get the risk-weighted assets growing at 8%. You would expect to see us continue to manage the growth of the Wholesale Banking business, according to the income that we could then generate at a superior rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Took a long time to get there. Good morning and good afternoon to everybody in Hong Kong. Can I come back to this point about the core Tier 1 please, guys, 6.1% a low number relative to the new benchmark that's potentially being set internationally. And I think it &#x2013; that's what Tom's question about sustainability, your core Tier 1 capital grew by about 1.9%, during the half. Your underlying growth in risk-weighted assets according to page 40 grew about 6%. If those trends excluding AEB were to continue, by the year-end you'd have a core Tier 1 ratio of 5.86%.</p>
          <p>So, I suppose my question is what is your tolerance to see the core Tier 1 ratio continue to trend downwards. As &#x2013; other attending questions would be, you financed most of the growth with preference share during the half, which you &#x2013; if you look at the top of page 40, we saw -- of that called-up ordinary share capital and preference shares, we saw 653 million of preference share issuance within that.</p>
          <p>If you could comment on &#x2013; first of the question on core Tier 1? Secondly, your capacity to issue further preference shares. And thirdly the potential impact if the Korean won continues the trend that we saw during the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I make some broad comments and then allow you to talk about the details of core Tier 1. I know there is an enormous enthusiasm for talking around core Tier 1, as you said the new potential benchmark or whatever it is. Core Tier 1 is clearly an important ratio, but it has to be seen in the context of the balance sheet as a whole.</p>
          <p>Tier 1 itself is an important number, total capital is important number, and I don't think you should look at those divorced from the liquidity position of the bank because fundamentally capital ensures the continued liquidity of an institution. So it all has to be looked at &#x2013; in the round, we are very comfortable with the position of our balance sheet both from a capital and a liquidity perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A whole list of questions that you asked in there Tim. In terms of target ratios for core Tier 1, we're not going to set a target ratio for core equity Tier 1. And that I would just endorse what Peter said around, you have to look at these in the round, and also against the balance sheet that they support. I also gave some evidential points around the shape, the lack of concentration, the lack of exposure to particular asset classes, which are causing such damage to other banks that we currently don't have in any significant proportion. So these capital ratios remained very strong on their own and they are very strong in their own and they are very strong, in particular, against the context of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>I think you were &#x2013; on the Korean won point. You are, I think, picking up the fact that as we look at our &#x2013; the translation of earnings due to reserves has been relatively significant, 800 million or so of currency impact. The majority of that &#x2013; over 650 million of it, essentially attached to Korea, also India and Pakistan impacted it, and then Singapore, Malaysia, and some others partly counteracted.</p>
          <p>On that Korean point &#x2013; it is fair to say that actually Korean won has somewhat reversed actually since the 30th of June, so already there has been some flow back. The capital is interesting, these ratios are interesting aren't they, because if you want to talk about the ratio then the impact of exchange is broadly &#x2013; it's going to be broadly &#x2013; it's both sides that affects really what we are seeing in capital, you've got risk-weight moving on the other side. So if you look at a ratio of the two it doesn't make a lot of difference. It should be broadly equivalent.</p>
          <p>And if you want to look at one part of that fraction and say so what is my capacity for issuance and clearly the exchange rate &#x2013; the exchange impact has an impact. As I said on the Korean won, it's bounced back since this point. Over the past two or three years, we've been having a gradual accretion to the reserves point from the dollar move in this first half, I think, for the first time in a number of years you saw that exchange move against us.</p>
          <p>I think the third point around the preference shares, the 675 million of preference shares in capacity. There is a &#x2013; as you rotate it to 150% so the regulatory gearing is 50%. Effectively for preference shares and the rating agencies in general rule of thumb would be, you can probably gear preference shares to around a third of Tier 1. We are not at that level yet. We probably have an incremental preference share capacity of 1.1, 1.2 billion within the current equity position. If you then look at the Group that generate &#x2013; and please this is not in any sense a forecast, let's just take the first half number, we did 1.88 billion of earnings through to equity.</p>
          <p>So you gear that through to the 35%, it essentially gives you &#x2013; sorry take the dividend off and then if you gear that post dividend number probably gives you another $800 million or so of pref capacity. So if you look at the capital capacity of this Group even before you take the under geared position we currently carry within our Tier 1, we are still generating 2.4 or whatever that &#x2013; whatever those numbers were, 2.4 billion of underlying equity. Take that at 12.5 times and it gives you the order of capacity simply from the underlying momentum. And what you see in this first half is underlying business momentum delivering these numbers well funded by the capital.</p>

          <p>Derek Chambers from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Can I ask a couple of quick questions about two geographical areas, one is Singapore where you seemed to have a very strong performance? I wonder if you could split that out between currency impact, maybe American Express Bank impact and also what you are doing in underlying terms and how sustainable is that?</p>
          <p>And the other areas is the UAE where I think you mentioned there were some problems in bancassurance, you've previously mentioned some problems in Consumer Lending. I just wonder how those revolve in, because I would have thought that would be a strong area, but it doesn't seem to quite so strong because of some of these, perhaps, temporary factors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the broader issue on Singapore and you can come back on the currency issue and UAE. I think Singapore, if you look across the business &#x2013; both businesses had a very, very good first half, very strong first half across pretty well all product lines in Wholesale Banking, and in Consumer increases in both, volumes and margins in most product areas. But there was a slight flattering by the movement in currencies...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; just on that &#x2013; let me give you AB, if you looked at and you'll get it from this statement anyway, I think Consumer Banks' income growth of 45% headline and 31-32% underlying. So that's the proportion of contribution of AB to Singapore in the Consumer Bank, not material to the Wholesale Bank. If I take...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...UAE, I referenced &#x2013; frankly we remodeled, repositioned the bancassurance operation. We were unpositioned, I think, towards the large U.N. jumbo policy business within the UAE, we've looked at that business, we've moved away from that business. Essentially, we've taken a negative income of between 10 or $15 million in the first half , it's probably a delta of around 25 million on the second half because since U.S. had a cessation, it's slowing of the running income as well as taking in negative income.</p>
          <p>So its about 20, $25 million negative impact to UAE in MESA I am attracting to that and we've restarted that business so now you'll see it starting to flow on a broader basis, that's the UAE bancassurance point?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So &#x2013; it's Jon Kirk from Redburn Partners. A couple of questions on the Wholesale Bank, again, I'm afraid. The &#x2013; I guess the unkind inference from what you told us about the 75% or so of your Wholesale Banking revenues being client driven are that &#x2013; the remaining 25% are in some form proprietary and I guess that in turn means that something like 12 to 13% of the Group's revenues are in that category.</p>
          <p>So my first question is, just how unkind am I being by describing that as proprietary revenue, trading revenue. And then secondly, if you could perhaps just comment on the incremental risk that the markets businesses seem to be taking because I can see the revenues are growing very strongly but I can also see that the value of risk has grown by pretty much three-fold since last year and the market risk-weighted assets have increased by about 43% during the first half. So could you just comment on the incremental risk that's being taken by the markets business in particular? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, good questions. First point, on the non-client revenue driven bit of it, actually the single biggest element of that is not proprietary trading in any sense, its ALM right, it's taking positions on the yield curve as a natural part of managing the banks' balance sheet and that has been by far the biggest driver of own account income in the first half. There is a degree of flow trading but actually it's a pretty small proportion of our own account income.</p>
          <p>Private equity is usually a bigger proportion, actually we didn't realize much from private equity in the first half of this year relative to earlier periods like first half last year or the second half of last year. In terms of your market risk point, if you look at the change in market risk actually that is more than explained by two factors, one is simply the change in volatility in interest rates' currencies over the period.</p>
          <p>If you've taken our positions at the 30th of -- 31st of December 2007 and well gone forward to 30th of June, 2008 without making any change to the positions at all, you would end up with roughly the same market risk as you've got in these numbers. The other factor on top, of course, is that we have now included AB, which has added a bit to the market risk, about 3 millionish. So there has been no change in risk appetite as regards market risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only other &#x2013; let me just sorry add to Peter. On ALM, we normally said that you &#x2013; we've been running about an 80/20 picture between client income and own account and roughly 50% of the own account has been ALM. In this particular period, it's sort of 75, not quite 75 actually 25 and 70% of the income roughly has been ALM. That gives you some sense of the proportionate pick up of ALM.</p>
          <p>It also reduces the percentage that you unkindly quoted, Jon, that was referred to in your positions. On the market risk assets, if you look at the market risk assets, what we see is matching on the other side, so clearly while you see an increase in volumes, so as your clients we have actually then taken positions to met off &#x2013; to close off the underlying market risk. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll see that the derivative positions are equivalent both on assets and liabilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions if I may. First is just following on the last one. HSBC yesterday commented about the effect of lower interest rates maybe slowing up balance sheet revenue in the second half of the year and also affecting deposit revenues in Hong Kong, could you comment on any kind of read across for that to you? And secondly, on MESA, you had a very strong Wholesale Banking contribution in MESA, could I ask you to shed some light on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me &#x2013; on Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been impacted broadly by three factors of which the one you talk about in the first half is perhaps the most material and that is the fact essentially your liability spread compression. Hong Kong as with Singapore and the UAE are significant sources through us &#x2013; foreign currency liabilities and broadly half of those liabilities tend to be in low margin, low pay current accounts or savings accounts and as the interest rates have fallen, so it's been &#x2013; one hasn't been able to price down effectively for those.</p>
          <p>So as I said Hong Kong has suffered in the first half and we have to see where the interest rate have gone because into the second half and there is a widening out then actually it should benefit. The other two aspects in Hong Kong where mortgage margins and unit trust sales halved essentially in Hong Kong. With regards to MESA, look it's broad based. Yeah do you want to pick up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. As you said, it's both in the global market side, but it's also very strong increases in cash management, in Wholesale Banking, which has done very, very well. And as you can imagine, the corporate sector in the Middle East is buoyant and we are benefiting from that and from our deep relationships with clients there. I mean the broader point by the ALM going back to that from &#x2013; if we are going to see as I anticipate, continued volatility in interest rates and currencies, you are going to see continued volatility in the earnings from ALM as yield curves shift in both dollar and local currencies and how we are positioned against those.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Ian Smillie from ABN. Richard, in the available for sale negative of 915 million. I think you mentioned about two-thirds of that came from the private equity portfolio. Could you just add a bit of color for us please in terms of the size of the investment, what the value of it is and what's driven such a sharp decline in the half and what drive as we should expect to impact that going forward, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It comes predominately from the private equity portfolio and also relative to small strategic investment portfolio that we hold, corporate investment portfolio. We have &#x2013; forget the private equity business, we indicated I think at the end of last year, the invested cost in the private equity portfolio was a touch over $1 billion. If we look at it now, it's over $1.3 billion we've invested, 350 million or so more. Private equity is a sign, frankly, of our intention to build out this business further and our confidence in it. At the end of last year, there was a significant mark-to-market benefit attaching to those private equity investments.</p>
          <p>Those &#x2013; a substantial proportion of those have reversed. Their impact going back to capital is they are reversals or evaluation gains so they remain within Tier 2 they are not Tier 1, they are not actually losses, they are reversals of product gains. We still sit with between 102, 100 million of mark-to-market valuation gains in our private equity portfolio and we value on a conservative and prudent basis.</p>

          <p>Thanks. It's Matus Casello from Merrill Lynch. I had a couple of questions please. One on the dividend, one-eights of the payout ratio ticked down this half. I wondered is that &#x2013; should we read that as a thought about the sustainability of earnings, which we've been questioning or about the capital position, which we've also been questioning. And secondly, on the question of risk-weighted asset growth, I wondered &#x2013; you commented on the market risk-weighted asset impact of AEB, I wondered what the operational risk-weighted asset was the impact of AEB and to what extent that operational risk-weighted asset growth is in your control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't over-read signals from the dividend, if you look into the history of Standard Chartered over the last few years, I would think the basis points variation from the 11% increase at the half year has been very, very small indeed so I wouldn't get too excited about that in one way or another. We simply believe in paying a progressive dividend and sharing the benefits of the growth of a business through the growth of the dividend. In terms of the operational risk.....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually don't remember the quantum, but it would be small operational risk and essentially we've been earning standardized operational risks, so you take a three-year average of income and you take a percentage between 12 and 18% is allocated to various business types. So we'll get an averaging of that sort of proportion of revenue will come through as a quantum operational risk, but actually it's small &#x2013; clearly very small in terms of the Group not material.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is James Alexander at M&amp;G. Just wondering whether we could step back a little bit and look at the shape of the Group, the Wholesale Bank versus the Consumer Bank. I think the Wholesale Banking profits are now two times those of the Consumer Bank and it's, obviously, a great performance in Wholesale Banking, whether it's sustainable is possibly another question, but it is two times the size now.</p>
          <p>And the profitability, I think looks lower as a percentage of risk-weighted assets of Wholesale versus Consumer. So interested to know your cost of capital, what you're seeing the cost of capital is between the two businesses? Because Wholesale is normally a lower fee business than consumer. If it is growing much faster, it's now two times the size and it looks less profitable than consumer. Are you happy with that situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe in having a bank with two powerful engines of growth, but I'm not going to ask Mike Rees here to slow down to get the &#x2013; allow the Consumer Bank to catch up. The clear conclusion is that we want the Consumer Bank to grow faster, because I do think there is merit in having two strongly growing successful businesses. We're also putting increasing emphasis on ways we can leverage synergies between the two banks, the two bits of the bank, the two businesses both in terms of customer referrals, in terms of product, and in terms of the way we manage our balance sheet and overall liquidity profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sustainability question which has come up on the last two, I mean there is clear breadth, to both of these businesses, both growing strongly, Wholesale is pretty growing much more strongly in this period than the Consumer Bank. Consumer Bank has suffered in this first half period, but the numbers, all the numbers has suffered a number of particular points, liability spread compression but also UAE, Pakistan decisioning and so forth. And what you see in the Wholesale Bank is what we've said we would deliver and we said as consistently now for the last few years, which is the building out of a Wholesale Banking franchise. The Wholesale Banking franchise was started on a much more staple cash and trade business.</p>
          <p>And offer to those client relationships a significant duration, a broader product set to service their needs and we do that in markets where those customers and corporate clients remain ambitious, confident growing in their businesses against strong underlying economic performance. So actually to grow out the Wholesale Banking business and offer a broader range of product set driving these levels of income and profit growth within a Group framework, which has delivered 17.8% return on equity, I think is a very performance.</p>

          <p>Good morning or afternoon. It's Sandy Chen, Panmure Gordon. I just wanted to try to get more back to the &#x2013; can you actually have the capacity to support the growth issue. Looking at your &#x2013; the segmental breakdown in the customer loan growth, it looks like it is commerce and manufacturing that were the real key drivers both on a half-on-half and year-on-year basis in terms of the customer loan growth.</p>
          <p>And would that go a long way towards explaining, given the secured nature of probably a lot of that lending, how it could be lighter in terms of the risk-weighted asset strain and thus it would support your arguments about guidance in terms of being able to deal with the capital strain of growth. And if that's so then what's your outlook, in terms of that growth on a continuing basis particularly in the commerce and manufacturing line items?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's reasonable influence. I haven't looked at it in quite that way that the loan exposures to the manufacturing side will have a significant proportion of trade finance in it and a significant proportion of that will be collateralized and therefore efficient from a Basel II point of view. Look, on the Basel II side of it, we're on a journey here, like everybody else, in terms of working out how best to manage the bank under advanced status. But what we have found is that there are some opportunities to use our capital very efficiently by the way we structure facilities and so on. And we are getting smarter at doing so. And that has some connection to the underlying, whether to manufacturing or probably whatever. But it's not a one-to-one connection with any particular SIC code.</p>

          <p>Can we a take question towards the front here?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning. It's Lee Garrant from Fox-Pitt Kelton. I'd like to get &#x2013; stick on the Wholesale Bank for a moment if I may. I've got a question actually about the net interest income this time. I see extremely impressive increase there 72%, even better than the trading increase. So &#x2013; and I was just trying to understand what the dynamics of this are because the customer loan growth looks likely it is about 27% in Wholesale, but has been a very big increase, I think 129% in loans to banks.</p>
          <p>So I wonder if you can explain, which obviously could also explain why the ALM strain is reduced because of the risk weightings there. I wonder whether you can explain a little bit about what's going on with those two factors and whether there has been any margin increases within the Wholesale Bank but as far as more specifically whether this is a sustainable rate of growth of NII?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there is a number of different things going on there. Part of the increase in net interest income in the Wholesale Bank is due to ALM, which we've been talking about already. Partly also it's been due to the strength of cash management. And in general, we have had a very strong growth in deposits. And so we have plenty of liquidity and that's being reflected to the income line through the net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash management balances &#x2013; volumes were up 40% in this half-on-half. So you see that strength on the bank positions. And what you're seeing there is managing both growth in business with the banks but also liquidity. So if you look both the places to banks and deposits from banks are up. That's been a very purposeful management of a strong liquidity position by us to enable good business growth, but also those liquidities a clear key lever of any good bank.</p>
          <p>So we're managing that liquidity profile and very proactively within our actual exposures. If you look through them across all the maturities, you'll see that we're very well positioned, essentially placing to the banks much shorter than taking from the banks. So our liquidity position is even more resilient than the proportion of liquidity on the face of the balance sheet would suggest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up then on the ALM side. I mean that's included here now within NII, that's helpful. Back to Robert's question really obviously helped in the first half by a steep yield curve, obviously we don't have &#x2013; suggest though a yield curve now. Can you give us any sort of guidance as to where that sort of income might go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if anything I think it's difficult to generalize by ALM right, because we're not facing one yield curve. We've got a whole bunch of different currencies in that, which &#x2013; where interest rates are doing different things depending on how people are responding to the challenge of inflation. In general though, I would expect that ALM income would be lower in the second half than it would be in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You talk about pricing, we are &#x2013; we've referenced pricing up multiple asset categories in multiple markets and that's true whether it's a &#x2013; on a whole has to be examples of them whether it's trade in MESA, trade in Hong Kong and lending to PLC like a corporate out of Hong Kong, CRE business relatively small proportion of the balance sheet, but where pricing actually has more than doubled. There is the whole series of areas in Wholesale Banking where our prices increased by 30 to 50% sometimes higher than that in this period and that you'll also be seeing net impact coming through.</p>

          <p>Tom, again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. It's Tom Rayner from Citi. Can I just ask you which on page 44 your statement of recognized income and expense because it's mean -- shareholder's equity hasn't grown in the first half of the year and the reason is because the profits in the periods have been fully offset by a number of significant negative items. You've talked about the 946 of the available for sale. Is the 186 that you close &#x2013; relative to the ABS within that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within the 946, the 105 you've got 186 from the mark-to-market, the reserves charge. You also got about 190 million attaching to ALM FS and then you got essentially private equity and this more strategic investment portfolio also moving through the &#x2013; so those are the items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess none of those affect the regulatory capital, they are all excluded...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are &#x2013; we got &#x2013; as well private equity, clearly gets to it, which I think, I said earlier with regard to ALM FS and with regard to the mark-to-market ASG, it's neutralized for the purpose of regulatory calculation, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the FX numbers, there is a very big swing from the year-end position to the 779 negative is that something you just expect to wash straight back out overtime as currencies move?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's true. I think we've covered this Tom already. I mean there is two different points here. One is on the single biggest number there is the movement in the Korean won, which the period end number for the Korean won was 12% weaker against the U.S. dollar then at 31st of December. But the second point is that the risk-weighted assets in Korean won would also have moved as well as relating to that same change in the exchange rate, until you can't translate it straight through to any change in the ratio. The other point is, of course, since 30th of June, the Korean won has actually come back quite significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is actually exactly why I was asking, I am just trying to relate some of these to the capital position of the Group, because if some of those AFS reserves were to become come impaired then that comes off. The core capital &#x2013; and provisional ratio that much less. I was just trying to get a sense of whether many of those negative items of any concern from our capital perspective or whether it's all volatility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the FX from a capital volatility, I think there was two points. One is, if you are fundamentally positive by Asian currencies which we would be, you would say that over the long run that number is going to be positive. But in any case because it's matched against local currency assets, it doesn't really make much difference one way or the other. The biggest number in the valuation loss is taken to equity is the private equity, as Richard described, and we are very, very confident about our private equity portfolio.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just coming back on an issue about this lending to banks and taking deposits from banks. It is an issue that HSBC sort of talked about yesterday was, they were turning, I think they said -- they're returning away some wholesale deposits because they didn't want people to transfer the risk to them of lending money to banks. And so you've expanded your interbank business, which must increase your counter-party risk through banks, I guess. And perhaps, you can just talk about how your viewing counter-party risk given the current somewhat fragile environment for banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not in a position to comment on what HSBC is about. We are not doing what they are saying. Look, we are a very liquid bank. We like being a very liquid bank, well, your liquid bank you always have to make a decision where you are going to put your liquidity, whether it's in securities in some form or whether it's in interbank exposures and you have to manage that risk very actively. Obviously, the environment in terms of counter-party risk with banks has changed and we are managing that risk with enormous care and attention but it doesn't mean that we don't want to be a very liquid bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any more questions or are we done.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, well, I'll just close to say, look, these are very strong set of results. The bank is in great shape. We are very liquid, strongly capitalized. Both our businesses have good momentum. We are investing for growth. We've got a tight grip on cost, we are pacing investments in line with the growth of the business. We are managing our risk profile with market risk and credit risk very, very carefully because the environment is uncertain, but we are strong and confident.</p>
          <p>So we are very well placed to weather all the turmoil in the markets and as I said superbly positioned to grasp the opportunities. So thank you for joining us all here, this morning. Thank you.</p>
