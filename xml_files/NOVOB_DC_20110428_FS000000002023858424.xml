          <p>Good day, and welcome to the Novo Nordisk First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.  Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our performance in the first three month of 2011 and an update for 2011 full year. I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk. With me I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Chief Science Officer; and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slides that we'll be using for this call is available on our web page, novonordisk.com. The conference call is scheduled is usual to last approximately one hour, and we'll start the presentation as outlined on slide number two. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number three. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides that we've prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Please also note that the conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on our website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four. We're satisfied with the performance in the first quarter of 2011. Sales increased 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter in 2010, the key sales drivers Victoza and the modern insulins.</p>
          <p>Solid sales performance realized in a challenging economic environment. In the first quarter of 2011, healthcare reforms are impacting sales growth negatively by 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>We have previously announced the headline results from individual phase 3a trials in Degludec and DegludecPlus.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've now completed the major analysis on hypoglycaemia across all these trails. The analysis confirms that Degludec is associated with statistically significantly less hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine, for overall confirmed hypoglycaemia and for confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemia.</p>
          <p>Victoza has now been approved in China and is expected to be launched during the second half of this year. Further Victoza &#x2013; we have seen encouraging also new expansion of the previously announced study of combined Victoza and Levemir treatment. The 12 month data confirms the benefits of efficacious glycaemic control, low risk of hypoglycaemia combined with an attractive weight loss profile.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials, reported operating profit grew 24% compared to the same period in 2010, financial guidance for 2011 is unchanged with expected sales growth of 8% to 10% in local currencies and expected operating profit growth of around 15% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five. Our portfolio of modern insulins and Victoza continues to show strong performance. In the first three months of 2011, Victoza was the prime growth driver with 45% share growth in local currencies. Sales of Victoza reached DKK1.1 billion and the performance reflect the steady penetration across key markets.</p>
          <p>Sales of our biopharmaceutical products increased 7% in Danish kroner. Sales of NoveSeven increased 4% in local currencies. Sales growth was driven by international operations but also Japan, Korea, Europe and Norwegian Europe &#x2013; excuse me, region China contributed to the growth.</p>
          <p>Sales in North America were unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to negative impact from patients transferring to an alternative treatment regimen of immune tolerance therapy.</p>
          <p>Sales of Norditropin increased11%, measured in local currencies, sales growth was driven by international operation, partly due to tenders being realized earlier in the year compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk is the second largest company in the global growth hormone market with 24% market share measured in volume.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide for an update on the regional split on our sales. In the first quarter of 2011, all regions contributed to growth, measured in local currencies. North America was the main contributor with 45% of growth, measured in local currencies, followed by international operations in China contributing 28% and 18% respectively.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in North America reflects the continuing solid penetration of the modern insulin supported by Victoza. Nova Nordisk maintains its leadership in the U.S. insulin market with 42% of the total insulin market and 37% of the modern insulin market.</p>
          <p>Sales growth is negatively impacted by U.S. healthcare reform adopted in March 2010. European sales grew 2% in local currencies, driven by the continued progress for the portfolio of modern insulin showing solid performance of Victoza. Sales are negatively impacted by healthcare reforms implemented during 2010, especially those in Germany and Spain.</p>
          <p>Sales within international operations increased 17% in local currencies; the key contributors to sales growth were the modern insulins. Sales in China increased 34% in Danish kroner and 28% in local currencies in the first quarter. The main contributor for growth was sales of modern insulins, especially NovoMix, while sales of human insulin continues to add to the overall growth in the region.</p>
          <p>Sales in Japan and Korea increased 28% measured in Danish Kroner and by 15% in local currencies in the first quarter. Following the earthquake in Japan, additional stocking of Novo Nordisk diabetes products has taken place in March throughout the supply chain, adding slightly to the Novo Nordisk sales growth in Japan in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number seven. The global insulin market continues to show double-digit annual growth. In the last 12 months, the value of growth has been around 20%. Volume growth is driven &#x2013; of 7% is driven by increased prevalence of diabetes, as well as higher diagnosis and treatment rates. The additional growth in value terms is due to the steady upgrade to modern insulins, increased use of disposable pen devices such as FlexPen as well as price changes.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk continues to hold a stable market share of 51% in the global insulin market by volume. The remaining part is divided between our two main competitors, a smaller portion held by a number of regional competitors.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the U.S. insulin markets. In the U.S., we continue to see growth rates of above 5%, measured on total scripts, primarily driven by basal and the fast-acting insulin classes. While Novo Nordisk Levemir continues to expand its position in the basal segment, we have recently seen more intense competition within the fast-acting segment.</p>
          <p>The loss of three managed care and Medicare Part E contracts from the beginning of 2011 has led to a slight decline in market share within these segments, but we expect to remain competitive in the U.S. in the future.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. In the United States, Victoza sales performance continues to be encouraging. We estimate that around 200,000 people with type 2 diabetics are treated with Victoza today.</p>
          <p>Today we hold the market share of more than 45% of filled monthly of GLP-1 prescriptions and we are capturing around 60% of new GLP-1 patients. Importantly, since the Victoza launch in February 2010, the GLP-1 class has added more than 30%. The majority of new patients are OAD failures, in line with positioning as early treatment option.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. In Europe, we continue to see strong uptake of Victoza in several key markets that GLP-1 class has doubled since launch. Victoza is now leading &#x2013; the leading GLP-1 product in all three key European markets, Germany and the U.K. and France. We estimate that around 120,000 people with type 2 diabetes is treated with Victoza in these markets.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to hand over to Mads, who'll give you an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to the next slide. In addition to the previously reported clinical trial results from the phase 3a begin program for Degludec, Novo Nordisk has already reported its phase 3 initiation planned and to be competed at least specified in this analysis plan to confirm expand on the hypoglycaemia benefits that were served in the individual studies.</p>
          <p>Today we have to announce the high level results from this major analysis plan that was previously discussed to the regulatory agencies. The statistical analysis for all adjusted for trial type of diabetes base line therapy, sex, geography and age. In the single largest of the hypoglycaemia meta-analysis, data from all the once-daily Phase 3a trial comparisons between insulins Degludec and glargine, both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated the Degludec had a significantly lower risk of overall treatment emergent confirmed hypoglycaemia compared to glargine. This occurred in spite of the inclusion of basal-bolus trials in which NovoRapid was used at meals and caused most of the hypoglycaemic events in both the Degludec and insulin glargine arms of the basal-bolus trials.</p>
          <p>Degludec was also superior to insulin glargine as regards to the occurrence of hypoglycaemia at night time, with a risk reduction that was larger than found for overall hypoglycaemia. This is presumably because differences in nocturnal hypoglycaemia are a more direct consequence of differences in the action profile of the basal insulin being administrated to the patient.</p>
          <p>Other preplan meta-analysis included analysis of the three phase 3a trials comparing once-daily Degludec to glargine in so-called basal-only insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes. This represents an apples-to-apples comparison in which the rates of both overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia are completely driven by the use of the basal insulin and hence not confounded by the use of other insulin preparations. Again, this meta-analysis demonstrated superiority for Degludec with risk reductions that were of greater magnitude than in the total analysis of type 1 and type 2 trials.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, it is our firm view that the clinical benefits, including hypoglycaemia reduction, offered by Degludec in comparison with glargine fully matched those provided by insulin glargine when compared to human insulin at launch 10 years ago. A review of the pre-specified meta-analysis plan will be provided in connection with Novo Nordisk's Capital Markets Day on May 5 this year in Copenhagen.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. As announced on March 15 this year, Novo Nordisk has received approval of Victoza for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by the state Food and Drug Administration in China. The approved indications cover treatment in combination with the metformin or sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient glycaemic control. Following local price discussions, we expect to launch Victoza in China in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>On the topic of Victoza, allow me to mention a set of recent very positive phase 3b results. Novo Nordisk has reviewed 12-month data from an extended study with 988 type 2 diabetes patients, investigating the effect of adding Levemir to the existing treatment with metformin and Victoza in those 40% of patients who have failed to meet the 88 target of hemoglobin A1c below 7% during the 12-week running period.</p>
          <p>The primary end points of the study were all reached and they are as follows. There was a statistically significant improvement into glycaemic control in the Levemir supplement group compared to the group receiving only metformin and Victoza, leading to an end of study 88 target achievement level of approximately 80% of the patients.</p>
          <p>The initial mean body weight loss of 3 to 4 kilograms achieved during the 12-week running period with Victoza was sustained in all treatment groups throughout one year's therapy. No events of major hypoglycaemia and an extremely low rate of hypoglycaemia, minor hypoglycaemia corresponding to one event for every four patient years were observed in the group receiving an addition of Levemir. This constitutes a background level of hypoglycaemia.</p>
          <p>The study, furthermore, demonstrated that the profile of the Victoza plus Levemir is safe. Six-month data from the study were communicated on August 5 last year and both the six and 12-month data sets will be presented at major conferences during 2011.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on our biopharmaceuticals pipeline. Let me for once start out with inflammation. Here I have two encouraging updates from the pipeline. Firstly, we've completed a phase I rheumatoid arthritis study for anti-IL-20, a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody, which appears to have a safe and well tolerated profile, including no anti-drug antibody inflammation in the studied subjects. Based on this, plus encouraging signs of efficacy, we've now initiated a phase 2a trial in rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have recently initiated a phase 2a clinical trial with a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody, Anti-NKG2D in Crohn's Disease, NKG2D is core signatory receptor expressed in several lineages of immune cells that show a saturated activity in chronic inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, for which the antibody is also under phase 2a investigation.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to haemostasis; Novo Nordisk has, as communicated in February this year, submitted an application for marketing authorization in the U.S. for NN1841, the first recombinant factor XIII protein for patients with congenital factor XIII deficiency. Furthermore, we expect to file for marketing authorization in Europe in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Recently, we also completed a haemostatic safety and efficacy assessment of Factor XIII in cardiac surgery and a phase 2 clinical trial including 409 patients. The results show that for the selected group of patients, there was no effect on transfusion avoidance in any of the dose arms compared to placebo and no effect was observed for the other efficacy endpoints.</p>
          <p>The trial did not give rise to any safety concerns and safety data base from this study will support the regulatory dossier submitted for factor XIII in congenital deficiency. Based on these disappointing results, no further investigations of recombinant factor XIII in cardiac surgery will be pursued. However, other indications are being investigated in pre-clinical development.</p>
          <p>With regards to our ultra long acting factor IX for hemophilia B treatment, NN7999, it's a pleasure to announce that we are getting ready for initiation of phase 3a based on the encouraging clinical data communicated in October of last year. Finally on the GlycoPEGylated Factor VIIa also known as NN7128, we have tested the safety and efficacy of this GlycoPEGylated Factor VIIa molecule in the clinical phase 2 trial including 24 hemophilia patients with inhibitors.</p>
          <p>Patients were randomized to three dose levels and treated for three months following a three months observational period. No safety concerns or anti-drug antibodies were identified. The pharmacokinetic properties of Glycopegylated Factor VIIa were similar to those observed in the Phase 1 trial. In all three dose groups, a significant reduction in annualized bleeding rate was observed compared to the observation period. However, the clear dose response relationship could not be established and further data analysis are planned.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for review of important differences between this molecule and the other Glycopegylated common factors in the pipeline. On the left hand, all of you can see how the Glycopegylated Factor VII circulates as an activated Glycopegylated Factor VIIa molecule which is in itself the active molecular species when the bleed occurs. The observed lack of the dose dependent effect of this molecule in Phase 2 may thus either relate to reduced intrinsic activity of this molecule during bleeding or potentially be due to lack of proof of the whole concept of using prophylaxis with a bypassing agent in hemophilia inhibitor patients.</p>
          <p>In regards to the latter, no rigorous intention to treat prophylaxis trial has ever robustly documented dose dependent efficacy of any bypassing agent in hemophilia inhibitor patients.</p>
          <p>Finally, the fundamentally different situation for the use of in 8-GP and in 9-GP as physiological replacement therapies in hemophilia is shown on the panels to the right. In 8-GP and in 9-GP are the factual pro-drugs that release the activated clotting factor identical to the body's old activated factor 8 and 9 molecules by cleaning off the activation peptide containing the PEG chain when the product cascade is actually entered at the onset of the bleeding episode.</p>
          <p>Hence for these products, there is expectedly no risk of reduced efficacy related to the presence of the PEG chain on the clotting factor molecule since the active molecular species is identical to endogenous factor 8 and factor 9a.</p>
          <p>And with this, over to you Jesper for update on the financials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. Healthcare reforms are affecting the sales performance of the global healthcare industry. Although it's mainly impacted by reforms in the U.S., Germany, Spain and Turkey, in the first quarter of 2011, reforms have impacted sales negatively by around three percentage point when compared to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we still expect a negative impact of two to three percentage point compared to 2010 with a more significant impact arising from the U.S. healthcare reform enacted in March of 2010. Please turn to the next slide.</p>
          <p>In the first three months of 2011, sales increased by 15% measured in Danish kroner to DKK15.7 billion or &#x2013; and by 11% in local currencies compared to the same period in 2010. Gross margin fell to 80.1 percentage point compared to 80.3 in the first quarter of 2010. This primarily reflects a favorable product mix impact due to increased sales of modern insulins and Victoza, being more than offset by a negative currency impact of 0.5 percentage point. The negative currency effect arises from first quarter 2011 sales of finished goods in Novo Nordisk affiliate's inventories at the end of 2010. The cost of goods expense related to these inventories reflect the higher level of exchange rates prevailing per 31st of December 2010.</p>
          <p>Total non-production-related costs increased by 7% to DKK7.3 billion and by 5% in local currencies. The development primarily reflects the cost associated with the global launch of Victoza impacting sales and distribution costs, the continued expansion of the sales forces, the expansion of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:07) activities in China and early stage bio pharmaceutical clinical development activities.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 24% to DKK5.4 billion. In local currencies, the growth was approximately 20%. Net financial showed a net expense of DKK128 million, compared to a net expense of DKK65 million in the same period last year. The average number of full-time employees has increased 6%. New hiring was led by expansion in China, the U.S. and in countries in the international operations region.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. Further, the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in our key invoicing currencies and the current extents of hedging for the same currencies are shown on the slide.</p>
          <p>During the first three months of 2011, the average exchange rate for both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner have been higher compared to the first quarter of 2010, but with both currencies declining. Today, the value of the U.S. dollar is approximately 10% below the average level in 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial guidance for 2011. Novo Nordisk still expects sales growth in 2011 of 8% to 10% measured in local currencies. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key products, as well as expectation of continued intense competition, generic competition to all anti-diabetic products, and an impact from the implementation of healthcare reforms, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be around 4 percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies. Reported gross margin for the full year is expected to be at the level of 2010. The expected positive contribution from product mix and production efficiencies is expected to be offset by a negative impact from currencies of around 0.6 percentage point.</p>
          <p>For 2011, growth in operating profit is still expected to be around 15%, measured in local currencies. Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is now expected to be 7.5 percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies. For 2011, Novo Nordisk now expects a net financial income of around DKK500 million.</p>
          <p>The current expectation reflects currency hedging contract gains, primarily related to the U.S. dollar. The effective tax rate for 2011 is still expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditure is still expected to be around DKK3.5 billion in 2011, primarily related to investments in the new insulin formulation and filling plant in Tianjin in China, and a new prefilled device production facility in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are still around 2.7 billion and free cash flow is still expected to be more than DKK16 billion. All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during the remaining part of 2011 and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar, will remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during the remaining part of 2011.</p>
          <p>This concludes the financial update. Now back to you, Lars.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. In closing remarks, I'd like to highlight the key drivers behind our business. The diabetes care market continues to be characterized by solid, underlying growth rates as more people are diagnosed with diabetes and treated with more advanced products. We are now the clear market leader with 51% of the insulin volume market, and with Victoza, we continue to expand the GLP-1 class.</p>
          <p>As the only company, we have completed phase 3a with two new insulin compounds. In addition, we are investigating use of liraglutide for the treatment of obesity. And we have a strategy for expanding our hemophilia franchise into hemophilia more broadly with factors VIII, IX and XIII. Please turn to the next slide.</p>
          <p>We are now moving into the Q&amp;A part. And Operator, we'd like to take the first questions please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take the first question from Michael Novod from Nordea Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it's Michael Novod from Nordea Markets. I have two questions; one is to the U.S. insulin markets. Can you try to give a bit more flavor on the full development of the market? Do you see continued other managed cares putting pressure on you and to what extent do you see other players such as Lilly, they're offering increase discounts, meaning that what kind of, say, increase in the discounts are they offering?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, regarding the costs, despite a flat gross margin reported terms in 2011, it seems still unrealistic to see your EBIT margin go down below the 32% level, around the 32% level, could you comment on what kind of operating cost levels you are expecting for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Yes, would you kindly start with the gross margin then I'll deal with the insulin market afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Michael, as you saw, we've had a quite modest cost development in Q1. I gave the guidance for the gross margin but let me just repeat that so we're sure that everybody catch that. In terms of local currency development in gross margin, we continue to expect approximately 50 basis point improvement. Given the current currency levels, that would basically be washed out by a negative currency effect on full year basis, so in reported terms we're awfully flat.</p>
          <p>Selling and distribution cost generally are not impacted by development in currencies. We are currently guiding to a S&amp;D ratio in the ballpark of 29 to 30. So a acceleration in the latter part of the year in our activities globally are partly related to an expansion of our sales activities in China.</p>
          <p>The R&amp;D ratio is expected to be around 15%, and maybe a slight increasing effect from currencies there, but around 15% for the R&amp;D ratio, admin ratio moving below the 5 percentage point and probably in local currency terms continuing to improve to the tune of 20 to 30 basis point year-on-year in that ratio.</p>
          <p>For other operating income, the guidance remains around 500 million. Note that we last year had a non-recurring income to the tune of 100 million in connection with an IP settlement in the area of biopharmaceuticals. But guidance for '11 around 500 million and looks like that is a reasonable, sustainable recurring level for other operating income. I hope &#x2013; yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Yes, thank you very much. With regards to the U.S. insulin market, it has historically been such that the payers have had the usually more than one product in each class on the same co-pay levels, meaning that, for instance, with regards to lower lock and the lower mix that both Lilly and ourselves would have the same co-pay status.</p>
          <p>We have recently seen the payer sharpening  their approach to this in some instances where they offer exclusive physicians for one rapid-acting or one-mix insulins and then also putting a more greater, say, utilization management controls in place where the patients wants to use a non-preferred insulin. So this is clearly a more tough marketplace for the competitors.</p>
          <p>Lilly has offered, as you indicate, a very substantial rebate to get into the business in those three contracts that we're alluding to which we lost in the second half. And we don't know that is apparent to be continued. We will of course, have to assess that when the next contract are being negotiated, we have the intentions of being competitive in the marketplace and therefore I'm not going to speculate on what the current or the future price level will be other than we want to be competitive.</p>
          <p>If you look at the anticipated overall market share impact of those three contracts where we elected not to participate then it would represent on an annualized basis approximately one percentage points market share loss for the rapid-acting insulin aspart, NovoLog, and a little less than a percentage point for the premix class with our Novo mix.</p>
          <p>So I hope that gives you a little bit more feeling for it. It is somewhat tougher in the U.S. market due to the economic crisis that this country is facing. Thank you. Next question, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It is Martin Parkh&#xF8;i, but it's still Danske Markets. But anyway, I have two questions also. Firstly now we are getting closer to a filing on Degludec and DegludecPlus, hopefully. Could you be a little bit more specific on the timing on this? Will it all really be just after the saw &#x2013; will it be the first part of the second half or in the last part of it?</p>
          <p>And then coming back to U.S., if I look at the development in first quarter in the market, if we look, combine you and Sanofi, really then the market is not that much lower growing than last year. So it's actually, it's just a matter of you losing market share. I can also understand that we saw a substantial pick-up in Sanofi in the first quarter, and they have also added some additional promotional effort in mid next &#x2013; last year. When should we expect to see an impact from the sales reorganization that you did in January, if there will be any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Martin. Mads Krogsgaard, I don't know how you're going to handle this, whether you will be more specific on the filing, it's up to you, in the beginning, in the middle, or in the latter part of which quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what I can reveal, Martin, is that we have now the scheduled pre-submission meetings in place with the major agencies. And that means that we are starting to get closer to being able to communicate more specifically when we anticipate to file. When that is said, it's going to be during the second half. It will not be completely at year-end, as we have previously anticipated, because as you may know, the BEGIN and BOOST programs actually did complete once two months ahead of schedule. But we will do it as soon as possible. It's not going to be in the beginning of the second half, but it will also not be completely at the end of the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. With that very, very clear feedback, then back to the U.S. insulin market. The competitive environment has shortened in the U.S., as well. We have, as you know, we have added people &#x2013; of course, we had the &#x2013; somehow great opportunities that we were launching both a completely new, novel product with Victoza. But also, seeking continued penetration with our modern insulins. And so, we would like to think that the additional sales people has meant that we have been able to continue the momentum with Victoza.</p>
          <p>We're also then in the fortunate situation that we now have a clear path towards filing a complete new set of modern insulins, and this gives us some &#x2013; what should I say without disclosing too much, some tactical opportunities in the future to adjust our sales force in the U.S. to ensure that we are competitive and not just doing so with a short-term focus, but with a more long-term focus as we have a complete new portfolio of insulins to support. So yes, more competitive; we are following our share of voice in the U.S. and if need be, we will expand that, but also to long-term take advantage of Degludec and DegludecPlus. Thank you very much for that, Martin. Next, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello and good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions from myself as well. First question is on the guidance for top line growth; you are still keeping this 8% to 10% guidance in the local currency for the year and yet you reported 11% for the first quarter. The reason for that lower growth for the year, is that mainly due to the expectation of generic Prandin NovoNorm, or what's reason that you are implicitly guiding lower growth for the remainder of the year? Secondly, on the meta-analysis of Degludec, that meta-analysis on type 1 diabetics, were you able to show a statistically significant reduction in overall confirmed hypoglycaemia, or just nocturnal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Henrik. Yes. What's giving you some caution when you compare the first quarter to the remaining three quarters of this year as we are guiding in a way, the growth is going to be less in the next three quarters than the first quarter we just saw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first quarter of this year, we've only had a very slight impact from generic competition on NovoNorm brand in &#x2013; from a few markets in Europe and we expect the European effect to accelerate over the year and we have not yet seen any impact on Prandin in the U.S. so that's part of the swing factors. In totality, those sales account for close to DKK2 billion. So that would be one element.</p>
          <p>The second element of course is also an uncertainty surrounding the healthcare reform situation in Europe and as you know, uncertainty surrounding the development of the European markets and that could account for the 2% each way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Henrik, the ones I spoke about today, it was on the one hand, the total primary analysis, which includes both type 1 diabetes trials, basal-bolus trials and type 2 diabetes trials, both basal-bolus and basal-only, and what I reported there was that there was significance in favor of Degludec, both totally and on nocturnal. And then as regards to type 2, the same prevailed but with a even enhanced, you can say, benefit in favor of Degludec. I will refer to the Capital Markets Day, where we'll go into, let's say, have more time to go to some details with all of these analyses.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. Just going back to the growth of some of the modern insulin products. Levemir growth also seems to be a little bit lower than we have been used to in the past, so I'm wondering whether there's anything specifically around the competition with LANTUS we should be thinking about or should the growth rate as alluded to with more sales force, increase throughout the year into 2011?</p>
          <p>And then second question is just on severe hypoglycaemia in terms of the meta-analysis. I realize that the event rates are pretty low for today hypoglycaemia, but any color that you could provide us on the trends that you've seen in the meta-analysis would be very useful at this point. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In terms of the market shares for the modern insulins in general, let me just add a point here, which I think is a fair overall comment here. When we started the introduction of modern insulins, we communicated in quite a number of quarters that we did see a conversion rate of about 5% to 6% of the market being converted from modern insulins to &#x2013; from human insulins to modern insulins.</p>
          <p>We've now crossed a point where 65% of the overall market has been converted and therefore, we see a slowdown in the conversion rates so that we would rather say today that it's 3% to 4% which is being converted on a bigger base and that is of course, slowing down the growth rates necessarily.</p>
          <p>And that means &#x2013; this is also one of the reasons why the data that we're publishing on Degludec and DegludecPlus are so significant, because that is where we eventually longer-term will need to see growth, otherwise, we will end up in a situation where it is &#x2013; the overall growth rate in the insulin market will gravitate towards the volume growth, because there's no further enhancement in terms of value, which typically comes from the introduction of new insulins.</p>
          <p>And, Mads, comment on the hypos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As regards to hypos, Richard, you're right, the numbers are so low that even in this population, the statistics are not able to pick up the difference significantly, so &#x2013; so but again, we'll get back to you on the total picture on the Capital Markets Day, which is kind of a week away and we'll go into much more details.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I actually had two questions, if I may. One, Lars, can you comment on any competition you're seeing from the same players ex-U.S. in the sense of price competition that you've been talking about in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And secondly as it relates to Victoza, can you talk about some kind of your strategies you're going to bring into the picture over the course of the next six to 12 months in Europe, given the recent positive opinion for Bydureon? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with regards to Bydureon, of course, I can't disclose what  our competitive activities would be &#x2013; but it's needless to say something that we have prepared ourselves for, and you can say, seen from our perspective, in a way it's the best scenario that we could think of that we get an approval of Bydureon in Europe, where the potential for the GLP-1 segment is smaller than the potential for the product in the U.S. So we will get experience, we will be able to collect gainful experience with a competitive product, how our product is stacking up before the main battle will take place in United States, which is likely to be not until a year from now, in fact.</p>
          <p>So I think it's best possible situation that we are in with regards to Bydureon, then we also add the trials, which has been where they have gone head-to-head starting with Victoza, demonstrating that Bydureon's inferior. We have the dosing, we have convenience of the product in terms of room temperature stability, and then we also have the issue of pens, where we are having a superior pen offering. And so, all-in-all, I think it's a best case scenario for us to see Bydureon in Europe first.</p>
          <p>With regard to competition, outside of the U.S. whether we are seeing as tough a competition in the &#x2013; as we see it in the U.S. We saw very sharp pencils when we had the tender business in Brazil, the prices went very, very low, and in fact it was the same players as &#x2013; from a competing in the U.S. market. So it's very clear to us that Eli Lilly is very aggressive, seeking to fuel capacity and buy volume.</p>
          <p>And so it is as we have in a way said in the past, it is more likely that it's the incumbent players that will be also competing in the more generic segments of the marketplace. We are not seeing that much success and progress from any of the smaller by similar manufacturers, neither in the local markets or in the offshore that's in the market. So it is likely to be Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novartis that will be competing for those segments of the market which will turn generic at a point in time as we start to seek patent on our offer as we have the legislative process in place for bio similar interest.

          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you for your comments regarding the infilling competition outside the U.S. but can you give us more details regarding the market trend in China, especially in China. Also please can you give us an update regarding the sixth combination of liraglutide plus Degludec, and notably the timing? And lastly, regarding the factor XIII, can you tell us what is the size of the addressable population in congenital deficit and also do you have any sales target for that? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads Krogsgaard, would you care to start talking on the last question and then I'll take the first question on China, following that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes with regards to the phase 3a program for the fixed ratio combination between Victoza and Degludec, we have received health authority approval to proceed into the first of those trials in the trial program in major territories such as U.S. and Canada which means that conduct of phase 3 is eminent and will keep you posted on that one.</p>
          <p>As you may be aware the studies have to <mark type="ph" /> shine (43:31) for six months duration, that's a total of two studies involved and of course we'll conduct these as fast as possible. So we do believe that within the field of the combination therapies between long acting GLP-1 and long acting insulin or ultra long acting insulin, we are distinctly ahead of the only competitor, which is Sanofi-Aventis, for which I've only heard that they have postponed onset of phase 3 trials at least until into sometime into 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. And Mads &#x2013; then onto the Chinese market. Novo -Nordisk is the clear leader in the Chinese insulin market. If we look at the math numbers, we had market share of about 60% plus in China, the nearest player has a market share of13% which is Eli Lilly and then we have one of the local manufacturers having 12%. These are math, February 2011. And if we then look at the big different segments what is the dynamic in terms of the different segments. If you look at the total market growth, we estimate to be slightly more than 20%. If we look at math January '11 versus math January '10 and the strongest growth rates we see are in the premix segment and the basal segments. It is largely a premix market as you know. The longer acting segment constitutes little bit more than the 10% of the market, whereas the fast-acting segment constitutes approximately 20% of the market with the remaining being premix.</p>
          <p>But we do see quite strong growth rates in the area of the basal, this is coming from LANTUS, it's coming from our own Levemir, and it's coming from bio similar analogues in the basal segment. But by and large, the market is still a premix market and when we look at the &#x2013; for instance, the value uptake by conversion, conversions are also taking place in China, as we have seen. So China in way resembles more what we saw in the European market and the U.S. markets earlier with conversion rates of 4% to 6% of the market converting to modern insulins right now, 25% have converted to modern insulins. And so we are seeing plus 10% in terms of value addition from upgrades. So if you look at the last 12 months, volumes were up 25%, 26%, but more than 30% in terms of value.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just to go back to the U.S. market and potentially even the ex-U.S. market as well. Could you give us some sense of when the other big contracts that managed care in the U.S. might come up and what the size of business might be involved as well as the big tenders that might come up ex-U.S. and what the size of the business there might be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Lars Rebien here. It's very, very difficult to give you any such notes, substantial one-offs that are happening in any particular quarter. The tenders in all the rest of the world are done at different points in time and they all wash out. So we win some and we lose some, there's no real &#x2013; the big one you could say is the Brazilian one. We have always &#x2013; that's the biggest tender in the world and we won that or let's say we bought that rather by bidding the lowest in terms of price.</p>
          <p>In the United States, one thing is the contract; you should realize one thing is contract. You bid for a certain position in managed care in the United States. The second thing is whether that particular managed care organization is actively switching patients and having utilization management programs. And so in some cases, we could end up seeing situation where we in a way loose a contract but we gain in revenues because the managed care organization is not switching the patients. And since we &#x2013; when we typically say we lose a contract is because we're not rebating, that means of course that I'll take home margin from that account is going up.</p>
          <p>So the picture in the U.S. is much more complex and takes time to convert these managed care contracts to actual patient lives. And so it's also a gradual process. However, the three that we mentioned which was entered into in the latter part of last year has been significant and therefore we decided to mention.</p>
          <p>There is, of course, <mark type="ph" /> 11 (48:30) demonstration and others similar to Walmart contracts where human insulins and really has also been quite active, but beyond those, nothing seasonal in that, that you should be looking out for.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. On NovoSeven, could you explain what the alternative treatment regime is the patients are switching to and whether this will be an ongoing issue? And then on Japan, is it possible to quantify the stocking effect that you saw in Q1? And finally on Victoza, was there any stocking there? And can we assume a U.S. access split in sales of roughly 50-50 or can you share with us what it would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, the NovoSeven alternative therapy is the immune tolerance therapy where the patients are for a very intense period of time put on large dosages of the factor that they have antibodies against with the view in a way too overwhelming and use it and then neutralize the immune system such that they can go back and being treated on their original factor product being factor VIII or factor IX.</p>
          <p>This is obviously very costly to go down that route and not all patients are responding. That depends on their antibody sizes and so &#x2013; but it is something which in some instances has success and this of course means that we will be occasionally losing some patients. We estimate that in only about a third of the cases where this is being attempted, is it successful such that people that were previously inhibitor patients will be transferred &#x2013; turned back to being original type A or type B Hemophiliacs. And, Jesper, in terms of Japan, the pipeline fill and a little bit on the Victoza, perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the very positive or unusual double-digit growth we've reported for Japan was basically reflecting uncertainty in the distribution pipeline surrounding the fallout from the tsunami and there we saw a pipeline fill from wholesalers to the tune of DKK 100 million, positively benefiting our sales in March and then basically already being reversed now in April. So just see that as a uncertainty factor that has helped sales in Japan, especially in diabetes care in March. In terms of Victoza sales and how that is distributed, you could say, as a rule of thumb, it's approximately 60% related to U.S. and approximately 40% to rest of world, as a rule of thumb.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you mentioned that you believe that the clinical benefits of Degludec fully match the benefits of LANTUS over NPH insulin when it launched. I assume that you are talking about the benefits on hypoglycaemia rates. I am just wondering, could you remind us what the magnitude of that benefit was when LANTUS was studied relative to NPH so that we can get a feeling for what you see as a clinical benefit?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the Victoza-Degludec fixed dose, can you give us any more information on the presentation, the device or the &#x2013; that you are using?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much. Mads, I guess it's you that's on here. So the question is here &#x2013; without taking all the excitement out from the capital markets, you have to try to answer this question, what was improvements that was conveyed when LANTUS was launched over the traditional NPH and why is it that we believe that ours is similar, advanced so to speak, and then if you want to say something on the Victoza-Degludec fixed dose, how we intend to present that.</p>

          <p>I was actually thinking along many, many lines, of which one of them was hypoglycaemia and the major study that has been published is from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:21) from 2005 and there they saw in total hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, an 11% reduction versus human NPH and for nocturnal hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, a 26% reduction.</p>
          <p>And as regards other benefits, I mean it is true that LANTUS was able to take many NPH users from two to one shots. So are we able to take many LANTUS users from two to one shots, because we know 25%, 30% are taking more than 80 units; there we can offer formulation with that can go to 160 units in one shot.</p>
          <p>And in terms of flexibility and convenience, we are also, as you know, striving for a label that includes any time of use on any day, whereas LANTUS is fixed dosing at the same time on every day. So there are a number of benefits including device-related that I will not go further into but that will get even further back to later on.</p>
          <p>Regarding the fixed ratio combination of Victoza, it is a ready-to-use disposable pen with a simple dial-up and dial-down system.</p>

          <p>Thanks for that. Thank you, Mads. What's very difficult for Mads not to disclose all the things that he wanted to tell you on May 5th but he managed somehow. So should we take the last question, please?</p>

          <p>Super. Thank you very much to all of you. And we look forward to seeing you on May 5th, the Danish Liberation Day, by the way. And so there will be beautiful Danish flags flying all over Denmark, if you went into the countryside. Thank you very much for your attention and we'll be seeing you. Bye, bye.</p>
