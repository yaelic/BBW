          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport McMoran Copper &amp; Gold First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings announcement was released earlier this morning and a copy of the release is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and we also have several slides to supplement our comments this morning. They are also available on the Internet at our webcast link at fcx.com. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the call will be available later today by accessing the webcast link on our Internet home page.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today's comments, I would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward looking statements. We would like refer all participants to the cautionary language included in our press release and slide materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC fillings.</p>
          <p>On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board, Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer. We also have several members of our senior operating team here on the call that Richard is going to introduce in a few minutes. I'm going to briefly summarize our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our operations and outlook and will be using the slide materials that are on our website. We'll then open the call for questions.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to report our first quarter 2008 net income applicable to common stock of 1.1 billion; that was $2.64 a share compared with 476 million, which was $2.02 per share for the first quarter of 2007. Our first quarter results included net losses on early debt extinguishments totaling $6 million. That was $5 million to net income or $0.01 per share in the 2008 period, and in the year ago quarter, 88 million or 75 million to net income, $0.31 per share. Our results for the 2007 quarter include the operations of Phelps Dodge beginning March 20th of 2007. Our sales from our mines during the first quarter of 2008 totaled 911 million pounds of copper, 280,000 ounces of gold and 20 million pounds of molybdenum. That compared to 520 million pounds of copper, 956,000 ounces of gold and 2 million pounds of molybdenum reported for the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter of 2008 sales were higher than our previous estimates that we reported in January for the first quarter of 885 million pounds of copper, 170,000 ounces of gold and 19 million pounds of molybdenum. Compared with pro forma period for the year ago, we included the pre-acquisition Phelps Dodge sales: the first quarter 2007 amounts were 1 billion pounds of copper, 977,000 ounces of gold and 19 million pounds of molybdenum.</p>
          <p>Our quarter benefited from strong commodity prices. Copper prices averaged, our recorded prices averaged $3.69 per pound in the first quarter of 2008; that was about 23% higher than in the first quarter of 2007. The 2007 recorded realizations were impacted by $0.07 per pound reduction from mark-to-market accounting adjustments, associated with the 2007 copper price protection program. As you recall that was completed in 2007 and we financially settled that transaction for just under 600 million in January of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter 2008 realizations of 369 were heavily weighted to applicable forward prices at the end of the period because of the open pounds of, and that was 382; <mark type="inaudible" /> record at 382 at the end of the quarter. Our operating cash flows, which were reduced by $1.3 billion during the quarter for working capital uses including the settlement of the copper hedges, totaled $615 million for the quarter and our capital expenditures approximated 508 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter in a strong financial position. Our total debt approximated 7.6 billion. We had cash, consolidated cash of 1.8 billion and at the year-end 2007, we had total debt of 7.2 billion and 1.6 billion of cash. We borrowed just under 300 million under our revolving credit facility during the quarter for short-term borrowings to fund the portion of the working capital requirements. As we indicated in the press release we've had recent upgrades from our rating agencies. Most recently we had upgrades from both S&amp;P and Fitch to BBB-minus.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide materials included on our website.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. It's real pleasure to report you the results of our first quarter for 2008. As Kathleen indicated, we have with us today our senior operating management team. As we previously reported, Tim Snider officially retired April 1, although he is here in our office continuing to work with us on a consulting basis. Our operations are now managed by a team of five experienced management personnel, including three long-time veterans from the Phelps Dodge organization. Red Conger, who is President of our Americas operations is here, as is John Marsden, who manages Freeport-McMoRan Mining Company, which handles construction, technology, our exploration and growth projects; Dave Thornton, who manages our important molybdenum business and is overseeing operations at Henderson, as well as our expansion project at Climax; Mark Johnson, who is a long-time Freeport manager, who many of you know is, continues to be in charge of operations at Grasberg; and Phil Brumit is the fifth member of our team who is actually here in United States, not with us today but he is managing our Tenke Fungurume project, living in the Congo, joined our organization after a distinguished carrier with Newmont, where he managed the start of the Batu Hijau mine in Sumbawa in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>In the interests of time I am going through the slides, but our team will be available to answer questions that you might have relating to their areas of operation. If you will turn to page 3, you will see a picture of our new annual report which was recently published, and the theme of our report this year is "A World Of Assets, A World Of Opportunities." The "world of assets" refers to our current operations, our producing operations, which has strong, capabilities of producing copper and our other products, as we could see in the first quarter, supported by long-lived proved and probable reserves, reserves that we have.</p>
          <p>The "world of opportunities" refers to what we are actually doing, and that's expanding our production volumes in an industry of where sustaining production and expanding is very challenging for many reasons. We also have the opportunity, that we are pursuing aggressively, of evaluating our existing ore bodies to find opportunities to extend the lives of our mines and provide for future expansion projects. And we have the opportunity to pursue and develop significant new ore bodies. Our strategy is clear-cut, we are focused on our internal opportunities and our operations and we believe it's a fabulous opportunity to create value for our share holders.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was a record quarter for us and it was a record quarter even though from a volume standpoint from terms of copper production, it looks to be our weakest volume quarter for the year, as we will have increasing volumes as we move later on into the year as Grasberg returns to the high grade core of that great ore body; as our Safford Mine ramps up; and as we continue to pursue our program of safely expanding operations. But having said that, given the very strong prices for copper, gold and molybdenum, it was a great quarter for us, over $1 billion of net income and the ability to generate cash. Had to use some of that cash this quarter to pay the final payment on the legacy Phelps Dodge hedge program and for other working capital uses.</p>
          <p>But we are very pleased with where the company is financially. We have executed on the financial plan that we set forth some time ago; that's being reflected in our balance sheet as we got -- we were upgraded to investment-grade ratings by both, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch, during the quarter. We didn't change our policy to do that, we just carried out our plan and the results resulted in the higher rating.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 5; you can see where those volumes came from in this quarter. For the year we really expect to be pretty equally weighted between North America, South America and Indonesia. In the bottom right corner you can see just what the variance was between the first quarter of '07 and first quarter of '08 in Indonesia. We were at the Grasberg, in the first half of '07 we were in the very high grade section of that mine, generated substantial volumes, we sequenced out of that beginning in the second half of '07 and by mid-year we will be returning to that. Just to reflect back, it would be a much different conference call if we were reporting on the basis of old FCX for the first quarter with those relative results.</p>
          <p>Page 6 shows what our unit costs, production costs, were for the quarter. These are unit costs, so the fact that we had lower volumes results in higher unit costs, but having said that cost pressures in this industry are very significant.  Energy costs, of course with oil approaching $120 a barrel, affects everybody in the industry, but steel costs and other input costs, sulfuric acid costs, are very significant elements and are really important factors for the industry. This cost pressure makes it more difficult to develop new projects to sustain production at older projects, and in turn creates significant values in the fact that we have producing properties and reserves that generate very strong margins, even with the higher costs in the market environment that we have.</p>
          <p>Page 7 talks about the impact on our first quarter from the changes in copper prices; if we go back three months ago to when we were reporting our fourth quarter results, we were seeing the mirror image of this. During the fourth quarter of '07, the price of copper dropped dramatically from $3.70 a pound to $3.00 a pound. Now we saw the price go from the $3.00 level back to 3.86, and this has a positive impact this quarter on our reported results because of the nature of the way that our copper concentrate contracts are priced. They are provisionally priced at the end of the quarter; they settle from a month to, most of them, up to three months after shipment, and the quarter-end price is a major determinant in the average recorded price that we report in our financial statements in any quarter.</p>
          <p>At March 38 (sic) [March 31, 2008], we had 362 [million] pounds of provisionally priced copper at $3.82 a pound. We received over time the market price for copper. This is simply the fact that we have to account for it this way because we have to draw a line in the sand at the end of each quarter. This had two impacts on the first quarter: we had an upward adjustment from the fact that open pounds at the beginning of the quarter were priced at $3.00 a pound and prices rose. That added almost $300 million to our revenues for the quarter; and that recorded price realized of $300.69 (sic) [$3.69] a pound was more than the first quarter average market price of just over 3.50 a pound. So anyway, this will be something that is an ongoing feature of our financial statements, and as I talked about three months ago, it had a negative impact then and a very positive impact now.</p>
          <p>Page 8 has price charts. The world is driven today from a commodity standpoint by demand in China and the developing world, and that continues to be very strong. The economic conditions in the U.S are affecting copper consumption here, in the housing market, in the automobile market and we're beginning to see effects in the commercial markets, but yet the U.S is a relatively small factor in the marketplace. We sell all of our copper around the world, including in the U.S at the global price, and we have the ability to sell all the copper we can produce and plan to produce at market prices, and the market continues to be very tight globally, and the market outlook is very strong.</p>
          <p>Our sales outlook for the year, at 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold and 75 million pounds of molybdenum, will allow us to generate significant profits and cash flows during the remainder of 2008, on a model-projected basis at 3.75 copper, $900 gold and $30 a pound moly, we would generate operating cash flows of $6.5 billion for 2008. We've dealt with the working capital requirements in the first quarter. 70% of our cash flows will come in during the second half of the year. Our revised capital expenditure outlook is $3 billion; I'll talk about that a little bit more. We will continue to look for ways to spend capital because we want to take advantage of the opportunities that we have, but our projects are also being affected by the very substantial escalation in capital cost that's facing the mining industry today.</p>
          <p>Our projects are progressing. The Safford Mine is the new mine in eastern Arizona, SX/EW facility that-- where we completed, essentially completed construction by year-end '07 and we're now ramping it up. We produced 22 million pounds of copper in the first quarter; we're moving by midyear to produce at the design rate of 20 million pounds a month, a very efficient operation with significant opportunities for expansion as we look forward.</p>
          <p>In the historical mining, the Globe mining area, where we have significant reclamation activities ongoing from old mining operations, we're restarting the Miami Mine to help facilitate those reclamation activities, and make some money doing it. We announced in 2007 incremental expansions in North America at Morenci, Bagdad and Sierrita. We're looking for bigger opportunities there, but in the meantime we're spending some capital to add some incremental production: scoping studies indicated capital of $370 million for those three projects, the ability to add 180 million pounds a year of copper. We're studying the engineering for that, the cost and scope may change as we go forward with that as we look at larger expansions of those properties.</p>
          <p>Really excited about the new project in our molybdenum business, reopening the Climax Mine, near Leadville, Colorado. Construction is beginning by moving snow there, I think there was over 300 inches of snow there this winter and, but we are looking forward to the spring run-off and actually putting equipment in the ground. We have ordered the equipment, everything is in line. We have the major permit that we had to obtain to go forward. $500 million high rate of return project because of the positive marketplace. We are continuing to drill there. We have an expectation of adding reserves: this initial project has a design production capacity of 30 million pounds a year. We know we could double that with what we have now and there is an opportunity to look for more reserves, long mine life. It's just a great project in a market that is very attractive.</p>
          <p>Just returned from South America and visited our operations there and morale is high, our people are very excited about what we have available to us there, Red's team is doing a great job in managing those businesses and looking for expansion. El Abra has been a very productive. Oxide SX/EW operations; has the world's largest tank house at its site. We are nearing the end of the oxide resource; we have a sulfide resource that's, as mineralogy that's amenable to leaching and we are in the process of going forward with a project there. We have the government approval to proceed with a new project that will extend the life of this mine for more than 10 years, and we are beginning construction with that project to develop the sulfide ore resources available to us.</p>
          <p>Cerro Verde in Peru is a mine where we have an expansion that was completed right at the end of 2006. We ramped up in 2007 to triple its production level and this is a resource that has the opportunity to be expanded in a significant way in the future. We are doing drilling there; we are undertaking studies of about environmental issues, water and power issues, but the location of this mine, the footprint, all these things point to it being a excellent opportunity to be a growing part of our asset base in the future.</p>
          <p>Indonesia has performed very well. The Grasberg mine is a, for us, one of the mining industry's great ore bodies. It's what allowed our company to create the company that we have today. We continue to look for opportunities there. In addition to the open pit where I might just point out, we've met the challenge that we've been facing for years in terms of meeting our mining rate objectives there, we &#x2013; our mining rate was in excess 700,000 metric tons a day and Mark and his team did a great job in moving the material which exposes the ore for us to generate the kind of volumes that we have available to us.</p>
          <p>Besides the pit, the DOZ mine is one of the world's, if not the world's largest single-block caving operation. Originally a 25,000 ton per day a mine, it operated during the first quarter at over 60,000 metric tons  a day. We are expanding it to have a sustained rate of 80,000 tons per day. We are now beginning to do mine development activities under the pit at the Grasberg Block Cave operations. Our new Big Gossan mine is on track to produce in 2011, and we have continued to optimize our milling operations, the world's largest single-site milling operation in the industry and it's always been a star of our operations. But we continue to drill at Grasberg, look for more reserves, the opportunity to optimize operations, as we go forward.</p>
          <p>In the Congo, we are very excited about what's available to us there. This is a very large concession, 600 square miles, which is yet to be fully understood from a geologic development standpoint, and we are working hard to gain that understanding. We are increasing our drilling activities. We're undertaking exploration processing analysis to see where ultimately we might go with this and our expectation is that we will be able to undertake a series of development projects focusing initially on the oxide resource and ultimately going to the mixed ore and the sulfide resource that's there and is yet undefined.</p>
          <p>Capital costs have risen substantially and our new estimate for aggregate cost is $1.75 billion, plus another significant amount to develop power for this operation. This is a significantly higher cost than we were looking at when we made our acquisition a year ago, and that reflects several factors. One is, we put a new team there and based on our experience in developing the Grasberg mine and developing a structure that will allow for future expansion, we are developing more supportive infrastructure than initially was contemplated. We are looking at a larger tailing deposition area; we are looking at more housing' we are looking at more on-site personnel to manage the operation so it can be done in the right way. We are looking at more investments in social programs and community activity.</p>
          <p>In addition, the industry, as I've said, is facing significant cost escalations. You can see that as you listen to every company's reports about their own projects and that certainly is a factor in doing business in the Congo and we've built those into our new estimates. It's a challenge to do business there: that's not a surprise to anyone, and as we gain more of an understanding of how to operate there, we are seeing more costs. Having said that, the opportunities for the resource are very significant, and we are aggressively going after it and have not lost any enthusiasm about it.</p>
          <p>We've reported that the government is undertaking a review of all the contracts in the country, including our contract. We are responding to issues that the government has raised. We are meeting with an interministerial group that's been formed to review the contracts and we feel very positive about the direction of those discussions. They remain to be resolved and we will be continuing to work with them and report to you the results of this as we go forward. But we have confidence based on our discussions with the government and the encouragement that we are receiving, that we will be able to proceed with our project in a satisfactory way. We have construction underway now. We have over 2,000 people on site working. We have management personnel that are living at the site. We are providing support from our headquarters group. John and his team were just there for over a week on site, dealing with our contractors and our plans. You can see the picture on page 15, that we're making progress. Our current target is to bring this into production during the second half of 2009 with our initial projects.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the real focus in this world of opportunities is looking at our existing ore bodies and what's available to us. As an indication of that, the bar chart on page 16 shows what our current reserves are in terms of recoverable, proved and probable. Copper that's located in our ore bodies priced at $1.20 a pound for long-term prices, and significant reserves of over 90 billion pounds. But beyond that based on drilling today &#x2013; and we're continuing to drill more and gain more understanding &#x2013; we have a roughly an equivalent amount of contained copper in mineralized material at $1.50 a pound, and that just gives us opportunity to work to convert that to reserves and then to producing assets.</p>
          <p>We are doing active drilling. We have more than 80 drill rigs operating around the world, in North America focusing on Safford, Lone Star, Morenci District; in South America focused at Cerro Verde where we have significant resource; at Grasberg in Block A and also now drilling has commenced outside Block A; and at Tenke Fungurume which on that very large concession has plenty of drilling opportunities and both surface exposures of minerals and also significant indications of minerals in areas that don't have surface expressions.</p>
          <p>So it's tremendous opportunity for us. We've upped our exploration budget shown on page 18 to $180 million for the year and you can see how that's distributed around the world. I mentioned growing volumes on page 19, expanding from pro forma 2006 before our merger, combined 3.6 billion pounds, up to a level that we are targeting 4.8 billion by 2010: very significant stair-stepped expansions there. You can see how our mine plan is affecting Grasberg, where essentially all of our gold sales are, on the chart at the top of page 19. For those of you who follow Grasberg, we have on the website, the sequencing charts that we've updated, so you can see how our sequencing over the five-year period will affect our access to the high-grade ore over time.</p>
          <p>Page 20 comes back to this issue I started with. This is a record quarter and that you can see from a volume standpoint, we're looking to have significantly stronger quarters in the second half of the year, as Grasberg gets to high-grade and as Safford ramps up. So depending on commodity prices, we have the opportunities of having extraordinary financial performance as we move forward in 2008. You can see fourth quarter gold gets approaching 600,000 ounces, which we've done that and more at Grasberg in the past. These increased volumes will have a positive impact on our unit cost, and we're currently projecting, given $900 gold, $30 moly, met about harder credits average unit cost of $1.00 a pound for the year and you can see how that breaks out regionally. We've updated our modeled projected cash flow charts on page</p>
          <p>22, increased the price levels that we used to reflect market conditions.  This just shows 3 to $4 a pound and you can see at 3.50 a pound, our annual average operating cash flows for the two years is roughly $7 billion. Annual averages, use whatever prices you want, the variance amounts are shown on page 23, $0.20 change in copper is $575 million impact on operating cash flows.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures, as I mentioned, have been updated to reflect the new higher cost estimates at Tenke Fungurume and escalations at our other projects, and continuing opportunities to invest. We're now looking at $3 billion for '08,  2.4 for '09, and 1.3 for '10.</p>
          <p>On page 25, to illustrate the free cash flow generation opportunities for our business, we show operating cash flows reduced by our capital expenditures, our roughly $1 billion requirement for our current annual common and preferred dividends, and shows just how much excess cash flows that we would be projected to have using our outlook for our operations and just modeled prices. At 3.50 copper over a two-year period, we would have excess cash flows that would exceed $5 billion.</p>
          <p>In closing, I just want to reiterate the clear-cut financial policy that our Board has set for us. We are committed to maintaining a strong financial position. We have gotten our balance sheet to the point of where we were targeting that, and well, we have now two credit rating agencies that consider our company to investment-grade rated. The continuation of the positive copper markets, and we are optimistic about markets over the longer term; we recognize risk as always, but the market continue to be fundamentally strong, supported by growth out of China and the challenges of the industry to produce volumes and develop new projects.</p>
          <p>With positive copper markets, we will be generating substantial cash flows, as I just pointed to. This allows us to invest aggressively within our business to grow near-term volumes and develop longer-term opportunities. We are going to look opportunistically for situations that allow us to reduce debt. We don't have debt maturities, but the dislocation of the credit markets may give us an opportunity to reduce debt on an economic basis, and we are focused on shareholder returns as a way of maximizing long-term shareholder value &#x2013; that's through an aggressive dividend policy, which will be reviewing as we go forward. We have an approved share buyback program; didn't buy any shares in the first quarter as we weren't generating cash flows in excess of our working capital requirements, but in the second half of the year we will be generating very substantial amounts of cash flows which will allow us to consider opportunities to execute on our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>With that, we've summarized our great quarter here and we will happy to respond to questions. Our teams here available and Jim Bob's on the line as well.</p>

          <p>Mike, one of the opportunities that opened up to us in the first quarter is we had a relatively small mining area in the pit bottom in an area we call Six East. It has very high grades and we were able to advance some of the volumes from that area in the first quarter and that's where we got our extra gold. The mill performed well; we had slightly better recovery in the mill, but we were on target in the other pushbacks and the Six East area opened up and we essentially are advancing volumes-- gold volumes from 2009 by mining in that area.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike, if we go back to -- going all the way back to 1998 over the past ten years in the story of Grasberg, we developed long-term mine plans and then operationally when we have the opportunity to grab some high-grade that typically doesn't involve very much material and we can do that in a safe way, in a way that doesn't negatively impact our long-term mine plans, we've done it.  And the history has been over that time that we've produced significantly higher volumes than our plans at any point in time would have shown us the ability to do.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congrats also on a strong performance in the quarter. Just a quick question on sensitivities in the presentation. On the one hand there is sensitivities to changes in the metals price, that matrix doesn't look like it shifted very much, but the charts on page 22 and 29 essentially look like the cash-flow performance is similar now, but we have raised the underlying gold assumption from 800 to 900, moly from 25 to 30. Is the right way to look at this in that in many regards as cost escalation as that offset the by-products or is there more to the relationship?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's essentially it John. You know we-- as you can see in the unit cost numbers, the site cost that -- it's just obvious, the higher sulfuric acid costs, higher diesel costs, labor cost increases, all of those things factor in and the way you just described it, is by-products which together represents maybe 20% of our revenues. The increase there is essentially funding the cost escalation that we are seeing for our total operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, got it. Then shifting gears a bit to back to Grasberg, this is very exciting that you are finally undertaking the Grasberg Block Cave development this year, I was just wondering if we could get a little more detail on that. What are we looking for, for milestones, block characteristics and what are we learning down there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's Mark Johnson. Really no surprises, we are on track. We may have discussed it before, but we are developing the block cave from three different directions. We've got the common infrastructure, we've got some ventilation declines and we've got some drifts we had available associated with KL development. So from those three areas, we are advancing all of those drifts and in 2008, they will start to connect and allow the ventilation and drainage networks to be established, and in 2009 we start in earnest on developing underneath the Grasberg Block Cave. Really no surprises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you'll turn to page 28 on your slides, you can see a schematic that shows what Mark was talking about. Prior to our putting in what we're calling our common infrastructure drift, we had in the 1990s pushed an attic from the mill at the 2,900 meter level, the Amole attic, which dewatered to pit but it also provided access for exploration drilling at the KL Kucing Liar Body, the Grasberg Block Cave and now this new tunnel system is 400 meters below that. We've been working on it for several years now. It connects the deep ore zone and associated ore bodies and the Block Cave, Grasberg and KL ore bodies to our mill. All of these numbers of capital cost that have been included in our numbers prospectively, and underground; there is a lot of information on this in our recently filed 10-K.</p>
          <p>Our underground team at Grasberg has just done an exceptional job. We've been block caving there since the early 1980s, and both in terms of operations, expanding the DOZ mine that I mentioned earlier and now, with what we're facing here, it gives us a lot of confidence for our future. We're projecting the pit to be essentially mined out in the 2015 range, but we'll continue reviewing that and then we have this great ore body to develop underground, similar metallurgy, and with the processing facilities and experience, we have a lot of confidence about what we can do there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody, congratulations on the strong results. Just focusing on Tenke Fungurume, increasing in CapEx there, I think -- you said, Richard this is happening across the industry. Interested in hearing your perspective though on the increase scope on the project. What are your expectations in terms of bringing that production higher from the levels that you're indicating here in the slides?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Oscar. I am going to let John Marsden comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Oscar, we're projecting this initial phase of construction, we're looking at 115,000 tons per year of copper and between 8 and 11,000 tons per year of cobalt. One of the things we've done in the last twelve months -- we have increased the mill throughput from 7,000 to 8,000 tons per day, and of course we've had increased volumes and other construction costs associated with that increase. So to accomplish this first phase, we have been implementing a slightly bigger project than we had originally anticipated. But going forward we are including, we're putting in some infrastructure, other facilities and ancillary facilities to support a broader, bigger expansion of the Tenke district going forward. We're still evaluating what those expansions, or that expansion, or further expansions look like going forward, but we're obviously confident and optimistic that we're going to be able to add additional capacity going forward. So just to summarize, we've put in with this project -- we're putting in additional facilities and beefing up some of the facilities that we had in the original plan to accommodate those potential future expansions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good. What would your nameplate capacity be then with 8,000 tons per day, copper and cobalt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it's still, Oscar it's Kathleen. It's still 250 million pounds a year of copper and 18 million pounds of cobalt, is the initial project, but as John was saying, we're doing planning to have additional reserves and planning to be able to expand the project, and so we're spending capital on the initial phase that will benefit us for the long-term. But the initial phase of the project is still 250 million pounds of copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's just the beginning of the story of course Oscar. We're doing three things: one we're drilling more, the first objective is going to be to extend the potential life of this first project, then to quickly determine what an expansion would be from the oxide standpoint, and then to understand the ore beyond that, the mixed ore and sulfide ore and where to go from there.</p>
          <p>The grades here are so high that looking at the processing rate, it can be deceptive particularly for us, that's accustomed to the mining operations at Grasberg. As we look down the road we can see some very substantial amounts of copper coming from a relatively low amount of material that is going through the mills; stripping rates are minuscule here. You can have the opportunity to produce, say, 500 million pounds of copper from a facility that processes 32,000 tons per day. So a lot of what you're seeing here from a capital standpoint, is setting the stage for aggressive subsequent development opportunities which we will be settling on as we go forward with our drilling and our processing analysis of how we deal with this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, now thanks very much. Blue sky is always good. And then if I may, just a quick one. In terms of South America, the power constraints are a big issue right now. I would be interested in hearing your perspective in terms of the -- I don't know if you could give us a cost per ton on your South American or Chilean operations, and how you see that evolving as we work through the winter months over there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, I will let Red talk about just overall power situation of our operations in Chile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Oscar, in Chile, in the north it's a separate grid, not interconnected. We've lost natural gas from Argentina. The natural gas generators have converted to diesel conversion; that all seems to be working very well and we haven't had any supply problems. We have one generator there that's struggling with the regulated customers that the mining industry has been working with to try and find a solution for them. We continue to work with them, so we see that as a good development going forward. In the central grid, we've been affected by drought: the reservoir levels are dropping, but we are optimistic to those are going to cover. Based on experience in the past we're optimistic that rain will come again and fill up the reservoirs next year, and we should be okay on the central grid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Having said that, power is a huge issue there and the system, as you well know, Oscar, is totally committed for the mining operations and the other uses in Chile with its growing economy and its big agriculture operations so, it is a real constraint on the future development of projects there.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, good morning I wanted to ask you a few questions about the capital cost changes at Tenke and just trying to understand the numbers. In slide 14, you showed $235 million for infrastructure for the larger scale you were just talking about. That implies that cost escalations account for the other 615, but I think it's a bit more complicated than that and I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the numbers on slide 14?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, why don't you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, If you look at the box, the inset on slide 14, you will see there that the first bullet is cost escalation 385 million, and that's related to costs for equipment, materials, construction labor, supervision labor. All of those we've seen dramatic increases over the last year, 18 months and those are reflected in that pretty significant number there.</p>
          <p>If you look at the next line item, which is scope changes and higher quantities, I alluded earlier to an increase in the mill throughput and associated facilities at Tenke, and so that has resulted an increased quantities of materials and equipment to achieve that slightly higher throughput rate; and also we've expanded the tailing facility. we've changed the size of some other facilities to beef them up for subsequent expansions, so that's captured in the scope changes.</p>
          <p>The third category is enhanced infrastructure, which again, that was what Richard was talking about earlier. We've provided some additional infrastructure that will set us up well in the District going forward and facilitate future expansions of production capacity. So those three items between them account for the great majority of the changes. The Other increases, there are some increases in duties and some other things that are captured in that Other category. So, that's really the high level breakdown of the increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Victor, let me just say too, this also reflects and sometimes it's different just to drop it in the bucket, but a more informed understanding of what it requires for us set up the kind of operation we want to set up there. We redesigned the housing that the people have. We are making additional investments in the health facilities and the health controls that are there. All of these things, the roads we are working with other companies on projects to improve the road system, the railroad system; it's very significant challenges, it's a tough place to do business because of the infrastructure and location, getting equipment there, getting people there, getting contractors to work on a reasonable basis. We put a lot of management -- new management resources there. As we put people there for the project we are getting a better understanding of what's required and we are investing to do this thing in the right way, as I said, to build a platform for what the future will be there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have done is, we are putting in a facility that is going to initially accommodate a greater capacity. Rather than having to rely on incrementally building up the tailings facility every year, we are giving ourselves the facility that's going to be a larger scale design to avoid such additional construction of the dam on an annual basis. And so it gives us more capacity up front, which from a start-up and commissioning point of view will be an advantage to the project. But essentially, the cost scope of the tailings facility is pretty much similar.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I just want to go back to Tenke for a minute please. Can you just remind me how the funding works,? I know it's 70 Freeport and 30 Lundin, but I thought there were some levels which you carried them, and obviously with the larger capital cost overrun, you end up having to give them quasi-loans, or how is this all going to work out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's not a carry, but under the deal that was negotiated a number of years ago, with  Lundin, who had the original contract for the concession going back to 1996, we have an obligation to fund through a loan mechanism, certain cost overruns and it's basically overruns for 125% of the original project definition and our project scope. That means we finance that and provide funds for it, we-- those amounts are repaid to us out of future production, with interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so the 125 is based on what, the original 650 or the 500 or ...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you carry-- it's not a carry, but that 125% stop, do you -we'll start at, let's take an easy number, math, say it's 500 million. Once you get to 625, do you then loan everything after 625, and it's still 70/30 on that first 25% (sic) [125%], or how does that part work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>70/30 on the initial project, and then to the extent there are overruns as defined by the contract, at 125% of that, we provide the funds for it and then that's repaid out of Lundin's future production. It's a similar situation to the financing mechanism that both partners have for the Gecamin's interest where Gecamin doesn't put up capital: the two partners fund that and that gets paid out of Gecamin's interest in the project from the future.</p>

One, this is more of a fine-tuning of the most recent expansion, and the ability to <mark type="inaudible" /> to come into play and it's really a small number. The cost escalation we are talking about that is steel and energy and labor. It's those sorts of things; it's really not anything significant.</p>
          <p>The bigger opportunity there is to have a major expansion. Indications are that the ore body there would support that, and that's what we are really putting our focus on in terms of looking at the environmental issues, the water and power issues to expand there, because we think that ore body is going to give us an opportunity to do that, and in the context of today's copper world, in a straightforward way.</p>

          <p>And just if I could, one final question just in a totally different part of the world.  I know I have asked this before, but as we've gone through the common infrastructure and taken that out you've got pretty well over to the Grasberg underground now, and you are tunneling through that whole undrilled area. Can you give us any update on exploration there?</p>

          <p>We're drilling there, as we talked about in what we call the gap, looking at the area between the Grasberg Block Cave and Kucing Liar and the DOZ. That drilling is progressing; we're very encouraged by it. There's been some positive indications of mineralization as we expected to see there. You can see that, again referring back to the chart on page 28, the driving of the common infrastructure attic has given us access to that. We're seeing mineralization and we'll continue to be testing that as the opportunity of significantly increasing underground resources at the Deep MLZ and associated ore bodies, and drilling's been positive, Brian.</p>

On your molybdenum operations, I wonder if you could give us a little bit more detail about the proposed start up and scope of Climax. For example given that every ounce seems to count in the molybdenum market these days, I was wondering how much of -that 18 million pounds that you are forecasting sales for the next year is actually going to come from your Climax operations?</p>

          <p>Climax, we feel confident about our ability to bring it on within the timeframe. Dave Thornton is here. We are also optimistic about adding reserves. If we look out and you point out, you pointed out very well, John, the value of these molybdenum pounds in today's world, and we are looking for additional molybdenum resources from our by-product operations at our copper mines. We are looking for resource in Grasberg, and so its really an important part of our business.</p>

          <p>Good morning. On the demand side I was wondering if you could comment on any implications of high prices that you are seeing if any? And a second one: if you could just comment on the sulfuric acid situation? I don't think it has any affect you but any implications of that on supply? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Mr. Liinamaa. Lets see: implications of higher prices. The implications for us are great, I mean it's great margins, great cash flows, allows us to invest. My guess is you are talking about markets and higher prices. The way that markets work is price is used to allocate scarce commodities to highest uses and that's happening. So we see plumbing, uses of copper in plumbing in the U.S. dropping, but uses of copper in energy saving devices around the world and mechanization of processes everywhere and higher use applications. The world is getting increasingly -- developing things that need copper and so worldwide copper demand and uses is very strong and with just incredible growth in China, and increasing growth in India and around the world, we feel great about the market. But as prices remain high, copper will be allocated away from its lower value uses to its higher value uses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are affected by acid by the way. We have substantial SX/EW operations and expanding operations and so we are &#x2013; and Tenke Fungurume is a leach operation, so this remarkably higher acid costs are affecting our costs. We are planning on how to deal with it. For example, right now we are buying acid for Safford, but we are in the process of constructing a sulfur burning facility there to generate acid to ourselves. We have a facility we're reconstructing at Tenke and we are doing some long-term planning about how to deal with acid in South America, North America and at Tenke, so its an important business issue for us that we're working on every day. We use acid at El Abra and Cerro Verde and will for the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And quickly back to Africa: significant amount of growth over the next three years supposed to come from projects there. We're seeing a lot of issues arising about how to divide returns between providers of capital and the host countries. Are you seeing, can you comment on the delays industry-wide that we might see as this stuff works its way through the system? I am done after that. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you ought to look to the other companies to talk about their situation because we're not in a position really to talk about specific operations. But you look at what we're dealing with and the quality of projects that we have and you translate that to other projects; it's not just Africa, but Africa clearly faces issues. Financing projects for some companies around the world is very tough today and all of these cost elements affect everybody. But globally around the world particularly for major underground developments, greenfield projects, this cost situation is really &#x2013; everyone in the industry is having their eyes pop out at it, and it's something that's developing in recent months. We're fortunate we've got such robust projects, we can absorb it, and we've got good markets. But it is certainly a factor in terms of looking at future supply situation for the industry as a whole.</p>
          <p>Mark, Kathleen passed a note on the acid situation to note that we produce a significant amount of acid in our Miami smelter and at our smelter at Atlantic Copper. So in the past, we've been relatively balanced in Southwest U.S., but as we are expanding, we'll have needs to get outside sources of sulfur and we're looking at what we might could to do at Miami, but we do -- we are a significant acid producer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congrats, again on delivering in tough times. Your answer to Oscar and Mark's question, where your answers got to what I had, and they were good answers. But I am just wondering, in terms of consumables of any kind, whether it's sulfur or power, et cetera, right now for your operations, given the stress in the world right now, are you finding in any other consumables, just difficulty in getting access to consumables, including diesel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can get access to diesel, that's not an issue, it's just the cost of it. But diesel, because the nature of the oil markets, it's available. But beyond the once you've mentioned, I mean there is some, there is huge issues today with all elements of equipment and supplies for the mining industry: long lead times for major equipment, purchases for mills, for trucks, for shovels. Component parts are an issue; tires, which everyone's talked about for several years now, continue to be very tight.</p>
          <p>We have programs. Red's team worked on to extend the life of tires and use different approaches. So, it goes .Now I don't think it's overstating it to every element of our business. Contractors today are stretched and trying to get the right contractors, whether it's for underground development operations or for construction management, is a issue. And if you ask the guys who are sitting around the table what our biggest issue is, it's people. And we are taking steps to aggressively add to our internal management team, and develop workers at all levels, but this is an industry of where years of underinvestment, slow times conservatively managed companies are catching up with us. We have these great opportunities now and the resources are very scarce.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John Tumazos, good morning. Your eleven  incremental expansion projects that you described seem very, very powerful in improving your existent permitted assets and 180 million in exploration for the 80 or so rigs running. Is it too strong to infer from that, that 200% of your team's time is being spent on the projects in hand and that acquisitions of big companies or acquisitions of little companies, like the Tech bought something for 400 million last week. You're not really probably have time for things like that given that you have such wonderful opportunities at your existing operations. Just tell me if I am reading too much into your actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, John. I'd use a couple of different words, but your point is exactly right. Our team is really focused, as I mentioned at the outset, on our internal investment opportunities. We stay in touch with what goes on in the world; we are able to do that through a steady line of investment bankers who come in and talk to us about what's going on in the world. But in terms of our people, operating guys sitting around this table, our focus is really on our operations. One, we want to produce as much copper out of our operations as we can, as much molybdenum, as much gold with the prices that we have, and then the chance to have this great company we put together with assets and the team and the people to invest. So you're exactly right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now historically, both Freeport and PD were very conservative operationally and financially, and the slide you showed for reserves at 120 copper, incremental 150 copper, is based on the data before these 80 rigs drill for the year and 180 million of outlay. Would it be too strong to characterize the eleven projects incremental as the tip of the iceberg and then a lot more is going to come out of the work you're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really think so and while putting together Freeport and Phelps Dodge, we can be more aggressive. I mean the company is much stronger together, the strategic rationale and matching up Grasberg with the former Phelps Dodge set of assets allowed us to have a company that can be more aggressive. And from Day One, started with due diligence, from Day One, March 19 a year ago, we are aggressively looking for opportunities to invest and as we do that, we are more encouraged as times goes by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The challenges with greenfield projects that are significant. You see those reflected in what we are saying about Tenke Fungurume, which has this incredible mineralization. There are challenges, but they are much less significant for brownfield expansions, they are much less significant. And so what we have is ore bodies that haven't been understood even though they have been mined for 100 years. And as we gain understanding, as we look for opportunities there and have these markets, it's much more -- it's much more straightforward to expand a Morenci than it would be develop a new project anywhere in the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me just emphasize to John what we said several times. The brownfield opportunities that we have, the bolt-on reserves to existing mines where we already have the infrastructure -- is not only that opportunity, but what we find with new core holes, the kind of opportunities that we see in terms of grade and volume, rival any greenfield opportunity that we might have. And so the ore we are bolting on is not low grade, in many cases, it's just ore that has been left undefined and therefore we're having greenfield type hits on brownfield exploitations. That's the best of all worlds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, and I'll just come back to Cerro Verde, where we do have some issues to deal with, but we have the potential opportunity just to completely replicate, twin what we have there.

We have essentially met our debt reduction target and at this point, what we are really looking at in terms of debt buybacks is as just as opportunities come to us, we look at the economics of those. If we have a dislocation in the market or some opportunity to do it, we'll do it, but it's not something that we are out actively looking to do. It's just -- if things come to us that are very attractive from an economic standpoint, we will take steps to do that. We are also interested in taking steps to further simplify our balance sheet, and clean up some of the securities that are out there.

As you guys kind of look at what you're going to do with capital, I am guessing that Moody's is at some stage and maybe you can give me a sense what Moody's is thinking with respect to you guys and investment grade? And then also just talk a little bit about whether or not you guys are planning to stay investment grade, and a little bit about kind of your state of acquisitiveness, are you looking at anything that might be a releveraging acquisition here or anything else along those lines?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brett, Moody's will reach its own conclusions. You can read what they say about us and the issues that they take into account with their ratings. With respect to all the agencies, we communicate with them, and we've had a clear-cut situation. We're very comfortable with our ability to run our business as a non-investment grade rated company. We always felt that with the strength of our assets and the markets, our balance sheet would improve to the point of where the agencies would conclude we should be investment grade and that's happened with two of them now. And we believe over time Moody's will reach a similar conclusion.</p>
          <p>We have sufficient cash to fund our investment plans for growing our business. And so, we don't anticipate levering up the company to do that. Our strategy is not to grow through acquisitions. If there was a opportunity that came to us that made a lot of sense for our shareholders, we're in a position to consider it. But our strategy is to grow through investments and our cash flows will fund those investments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. My question was with regards to cobalt, and I was just wondering, what your marketing plans for that product would be? I mean we all know the big guys roaming in Africa, trying to cover  all the cobalt there is in the DRC. So I was just trying to find out if you are going to use a third party to market it or you would set up your own marketing with for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a marketing group; we don't have to set one up. We're in the market in a significant way with copper and molybdenum and copper concentrates and our marketing group is actively working in the marketplace to find the placement of cobalt. It's a very small market but it's in great demand right now. And so we are taking steps in the marketplace to find a home for the significant amount of cobalt that we will be producing in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the other question that I have was -- is with regard to the loan to SNEL [Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Nationale d'Electricit&#xE9; de la R&#xE9;publique D&#xE9;mocratique du Congo], which is what I believe is getting the loan for the power infrastructure development. Is this going to be -- is the loan going to be guaranteed by the government or is it going to be secured by the assets and how do you get paid for the loan? Is it through a revenue base &#x2013; I mean just share some more information on how this loan is going to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes <mark type="inaudible" /> it's Kathleen. We are advancing roughly $140 million to the state-owned power entity there to refurbish the facilities for our power. We will be repaid that loan through power -- through our power purchases. It's not to answer your question about guarantees, its not guaranteed or secured; it's a situation where we will be repaid over time as we consume power at the operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And good news is because of the avail -- I mean we'd have to make this investment work with SNEL in establishing reliable power. Once we have that we will have a very attractive power source at an attractive cost for our operations in the context of worldwide power requirements.</p>

          <p>One other follow-up to Victor's question earlier about Tenke and the tailings dam, the capital cost included in our estimate is just under 5% of the total project. It's about $80 million of the 1.75 billion.</p>

          <p>Richard, let me just add one comment about our exploration. We said to John Tumazos that we have greenfield type opportunities in a brownfield exploitation program. And what we mean to do is in light of the new price syndrome there we see, there is a tremendous opportunity by just using higher prices for our cut-off grades. Let me emphasize that as we do that, we are not seeing just the lower grade portions of the ore body on the perimeter of these ore bodies, we are seeing deeper hits that are greenfield type of opportunities, and gives us an opportunity to bolt on significant reserves at almost all of our operations. I hate to use the word "limitless opportunity", but the size of these ore bodies like Morenci, like Cerro Verde, like El Abra, you see the ore that's being bolted on, it's like discovering a new greenfield property in the same vicinity where all of our infrastructure exists.</p>
          <p>Before, and a lot of people wondered on many occasion well why are those opportunities there. We just have to remember, and I know everybody is aware of the fact, that we are in a new era of pricing where with these 3 and $4 copper prices, the incentive for us to spend the money, to define the outer limits of these reserves is just so compelling compared to what it was in the days of $0.80 copper and $1 copper. With this $180 million of exploration that you see in our budget, if those were all greenfield projects, you'd spend so much money on greenfield projects, just getting the logistics set up and in many cases, if you spend $50 million, half of it on a greenfield project is just getting the logistical part set up and getting started. In our case, in the $180 million, so much of our budget is focused on bolting on these vast amounts of reserves by using the different outlooks on price cut-off, and grade cut-off, it's amazing how much money of a percentage of that $180 million, almost every nickel as it goes into core holes, and that's a huge difference and than if this 180 million as I say was all going into greenfield projects.</p>
          <p>So the money we're spending is not only money that is bolting on reserves, but the efficiency of the amount of money we're spending compared to a typical greenfield project is just overwhelming. So we would be reporting on those reserves as we get more definition where we're adding to the base and these size of these amazing ore bodies that we already have the opportunity to own. Resources that we're going to be proving up for the shareholders, is going to be one of the greatest opportunities we could have had, and is a huge plus for this acquisition and combination of these two companies. Thank you, Richard.</p>
