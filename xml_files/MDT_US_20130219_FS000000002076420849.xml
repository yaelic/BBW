          <p>Good morning. My name is Brandi and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Medtronic's Q3 Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brandi.</p>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2013 third quarter, which ended January 25, 2013. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investor portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today.</p>
          <p>This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $4.027 billion, which represented growth of 4%. Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $946 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.93, increased 7% and 11% respectively.</p>
          <p>Despite facing many challenges, Q3 represented another step in building toward our goal of delivering consistent growth on both revenue and earnings per share inline with our baseline expectations.</p>
          <p>We had a number of businesses and geographies that delivered strong performances, but at the same time, we faced some unexpected pressures in certain areas. We're still in the process of strengthening and geographically diversifying our business, so that we can continue to deliver a balanced and consistent performance reliably.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we continued to see sequential stabilization in two of our key markets; U.S. ICDs and U.S. Core Spine. While these businesses declined a combined 2% versus the prior year, average daily sales grew 4% sequentially, as we have 5 fewer selling days in Q3.</p>
          <p>In addition, our daily revenue share increased sequentially in both of these markets, despite facing competitive year-ends. Gary will walk you through the details later, but the trends confirm that these markets are indeed stabilizing.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we continue to manage challenges in other businesses. First, U.S. Pacing declined 8% versus the prior year and daily sales declined 2% sequentially. Our procedure volumes were relatively stable through December, but decelerated in January. However, our Q3 performance was in line with the market and we do expect further improvement with the launch of Advisa MRI, which recently received FDA approval.</p>
          <p>Also, our International Pacing business covered for the weakness in the U.S., growing 5% and taking over 300 basis points of share year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Next, our BMP business continues to face pressure and declined 21% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Diabetes, historically a high-growth business, also faced some near-term pressure in the U.S., as we wait to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 530G. We expect Diabetes to quickly return to faster growth once our new products are approved.</p>
          <p>Our other high-growth platforms continued to perform well in Q3. In the Cardiac and Vascular Group, our AF and Endovascular businesses delivered double-digit growth, while our transcatheter valve business had upper single-digit growth. In the Restorative Therapies Group, our DBS Gastro/Uro, CGM, Neurosurgery and Advanced Energy businesses all delivered double-digit growth, while ENT and Pain Stim grew in the high- and mid-single digits respectively. Combined, this broad-base of growth platforms, including insulin pumps, represented over 35% of our revenue and delivered 9% growth in Q3.</p>
          <p>Recent product approvals and upcoming launches will also contribute to sustain future growth. In CVG, we recently received CE Mark for our Evera family of ICDs and FDA approval of our Advisa MRI pacemaker. Looking ahead, we're expecting CE Mark approval for our Engager transapical aortic valve this spring and are targeting the U.S. launch of our Viva, CRT and Evera ICD products this summer. We're also expecting approval for our Endurant II AAA Stent Graft in Japan this summer.</p>
          <p>In the Restorative Therapies Group, we recently received CE Mark approval for the first spinal cord stimulation systems that have an indication for full-body MRI scans. As I mentioned, we're waiting for approval of our MiniMed 530G, which includes our new insulin pump, CGM sensor, and threshold suspend automation algorithm.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond FY 2014, we're executing on our U.S. trials for the CoreValve transcatheter valve and the Symplicity renal denervation system, and are targeting FY 2015 approval from these two important growth drivers.</p>
          <p>Turning to International, our revenue grew 7% with strong growth in Japan and emerging markets offsetting declines in Western Europe. While we've been monitoring Western Europe closely over the past year, Q3 was the first quarter where we experienced a meaningful slowdown, declining 1%. Western Europe sales were tracking through the first two months of the quarter, but our daily sales slowed in January. Like we have mentioned, the softness that we've been experiencing in prior quarters was in Southern Europe, especially in Italy.</p>
          <p>Towards the end of Q3, we saw a more generalized softness in several markets, including Germany. We are engaged with our Western Europe team to capitalize the markets and our growth, but we do believe it is prudent to be cautious in our expectations as we manage these challenges going forward.</p>
          <p>Japan had another strong quarter with growth of 18%, more than absorbing the unfavorable impact of R-Zone pricing that went into effect last April. Several of our new innovative products are generating significant physician interest.</p>
          <p>In CRDM, we gained over 8 points of pacemaker share sequentially on the successful launch of Advisa MRI. In Coronary, the Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent gained 4 points of DES share sequentially. We also are seeing great customer acceptance for our Endurant AAA Stent Graft and RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator in Japan.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, our Q3 growth was 21%. Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, the Middle East and Africa, and India all grew at or above 20%. Latin America growth was somewhat slower in Q3, as we continue to work through product registration issues in certain businesses. Revenue growth improved in China this quarter, although it was somewhat aided by the easier comparisons due to the timing of the Chinese New Year.</p>
          <p>In addition to our focus in expanding our existing businesses in the Chinese multinational segment, we've made two strategic moves this year to expand our presence in the Chinese local segment. We closed on our acquisition of China Kanghui Holdings, our entry into the global trauma, spine and ortho value segments, and Kanghui's performance is meeting our expectations. We also recently completed our investments in LifeTech Scientific and our teams are already working together to enter the Structural Heart value segment.</p>
          <p>Emerging market growth, meaningful product launches, our high-growth platforms, and market stabilization are all key factors to building a dependable business that can deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth.</p>
          <p>To achieve this, growth from these areas have to be successfully offset &#x2013; have to successfully offset different areas of pressure, which for this quarter were Europe, BMP, insulin pumps and U.S. Pacing.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to strengthen our business in order to consistently deliver on our mid-single-digit revenue growth expectations. In addition to our focus on the top line, we are also executing on both our product and SG&amp;A cost-reduction initiatives, which together with financial leverage from our share buybacks, will help us grow earnings per share 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue.</p>
          <p>We're working on reducing product costs by $1.2 billion over the next five years, which is important not only to maintain our gross margins, but also fuels the development of tiered products, which are essential to creating new value segment opportunities.</p>
          <p>We're also making progress on our plans to increase our U.S. cash flow through working-capital improvements, and have set an early goal of improving our inventory turns by 50% over the next five years. Not only does this instill a good fiscal discipline, but it will strengthen our already-robust levels of free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>Over the next five years, we expect to generate $25 billion of free cash flow and remain committed to returning 50% of this to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We believe this level of commitment is appropriate, given our current mix of U.S. and International free cash flow. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make investments for sustainable growth and we are and will continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy this capital, with a particular focus on returns. We expect any M&amp;A transaction to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate and we do not intend to pass along EPS dilution to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In addition to building credibility and a track record of delivering on our baseline expectations, we're also executing on transformational opportunities that we believe will establish durability in our long-term performance and create potential upside for our baseline.</p>
          <p>Our first long-term transformational opportunity is accelerating globalization. As I mentioned before, we believe there is significant opportunity to deepen the penetration of our existing therapies in emerging markets. It is striking to recognize that only 8% of the population in emerging markets that can benefit from and have the financial means to afford our therapies are indeed receiving them. Increasing this penetration level to that of developed markets represents a $5 billion annual opportunity with margins comparable to developed markets.</p>
          <p>To realize this opportunity, we are focusing on breaking down barriers such as major deficiencies in the areas of awareness, infrastructure and training. The Middle East is one example of an emerging market that has a strong desire to improve its healthcare system.</p>
          <p>I was in Dubai last month attending the largest healthcare congress in the region and came away very impressed and encouraged by our plans to realize the potential and generate significant growth in this region over the coming years.</p>
          <p>As we develop the premium segment in emerging markets, we're also creating the necessary infrastructure to participate in the next wave of growth; the emerging market value segment. As I mentioned earlier, we're taking early steps to be a global leader in this segment with our acquisition of Kanghui and partnership with LifeTech. We believe that building a platform of multi-tiered products will allow our businesses to sustain 20% growth in emerging markets over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Our other transformational opportunity beyond globalization is our ability to deliver economic value to our customers, supported by our market-leading technologies. Healthcare payment models are becoming more complex with new pay-per-value models becoming more important.</p>
          <p>In addition, our customers are evolving and now include hospital system, C-suite executives, payers and governments. Within this changing environment, we are transforming our business to not only deliver clinical value, but also deliver economic value. This transformation will include not only our existing products, but also developing and piloting new economic value programs. We're in the early stages of this transformation, but we believe Medtronic has specific competitive advantages to win in the new value-oriented environment.</p>
          <p>First, our market-leading products remain a critical factor to maintaining a strong position of advocacy in the hospital. Second, Medtronic has some of the world's leading experts in the area of healthcare economics and reimbursement, with a core skill set in economic value. And third, Medtronic's breadth and scale gives us the presence to be a desired partner to large players and providers. It is important to note that Medtronic is the only medical technology company positioned with all three of these advantages in our markets, which will significantly differentiate us in the new healthcare environment.</p>
          <p>Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results, before we take your questions. Gary?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Omar.</p>
          <p>Third-quarter revenue of $4.027 billion increased 3% as reported and 4% on a constant currency basis, after adjusting for a $41 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Q3 revenue results by region were as follows: growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 24%; the Middle East and Africa grew 23%; growth in Greater China was 22%; South Asia grew 20%; growth in Asia-Pacific was 15%, including 18% growth in Japan; Latin America grew 14%; growth in the U.S. was 1%, while Western Europe and Canada declined 1%.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets grew a combined 21% in Q3 and represented 12% of our total sales mix. While this is an improvement, it was aided by easier comparisons due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, which conversely will turn into a difficult comparison in Q4. Accordingly, we would expect Q4 emerging market growth to be in the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>Q3 earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $946 million and $0.93, an increase of 7% and 11% respectively. Q3 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $988 million and $0.97, an increase of 6% and 10% respectively.</p>
          <p>Included in our Q3 GAAP earnings was a $70 million gain, primarily related to a change in fair value of our Ardian contingent commercial milestone payments, which are based on annual revenue growth through FY 2015.</p>
          <p>Given the current slower commercial ramp in Europe and protracted U.S. regulatory process, we now expect our milestone payments to be reduced as some of the value of our Ardian business has now shifted beyond the final revenue milestone date.</p>
          <p>In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.100 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by solid growth in Coronary, Endovascular, Structural Heart and AF Solutions, partially offset by declines in ICDs.</p>
          <p>CRDM revenue of $1.171 billion declined 1%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $654 million declined 2%, which was slightly better than the overall market as our shock reduction and Lead Integrity Alert technologies, combined with our proven long-term lead performance continue to receive strong market acceptance.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our ICD revenue was stable sequentially after adjusting for fewer selling days. Our lead-to-port ratio remained strong and it is as highest points in several years. In addition, our ICD implant volumes grew 5%, the fourth quarter in a row of implant growth. At the same time, our U.S. ICD pricing declined 5%, while hospitals continue to reduce their bulk purchases on a year-over-year basis, they were sequentially stable again this quarter.</p>
          <p>Taken together, these trends suggest that our U.S. ICD business is stabilizing. At the same time, we are monitoring the European ICD markets very closely as it is declining mid-single-digits, driven by deteriorating pricing in some key markets.</p>
          <p>Despite the declines, we are gaining share and have a number of new high-power products come into market, including the Evera ICD with increased longevity and the most advanced shock reduction technology available. The Viva CRTD with Adaptive CRT for significantly better response rates, the Attain Performa second-generation quadripolar lead, and our unique CardioGuide real-time navigation systems to improve CRT implant procedures.</p>
          <p>Pacing revenue of $459 million was flat, outperforming the global market by over 200 basis points as we gained global pacing share on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. Pacing revenue declined 8% inline with the market. These declines were driven primarily by pricing, which was down in the mid-single digits, and to a lesser extent declines in implant volumes.</p>
          <p>In Japan, our low-power business grew over 20% as our Advisa MRI pacemaker gained 8 points of share sequentially, including a double-digit increase in new implants.</p>
          <p>Coronary revenue of $445 million grew 19%. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $274 million, including $97 million in the U.S. and $30 million in Japan. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, unique FDA labeling for diabetes and long-term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally. This is reflected in our DES share where we gained another point of share sequentially in the U.S. and nearly 4 points of share sequentially in Japan. This quarter's performance has now propelled us to the number one global market position in combined DES bare metal stent share.</p>
          <p>In renal denervation, while Q3 commercial results continued to be soft, the long-term outlook for this opportunity in hypertension remains robust and we are investing in evidence generation and technology development to further strengthen our leadership position.</p>
          <p>Revenue is still lagging behind our original expectations, due primarily to the lack of broad reimbursement and limited funding for new technology in nearly every European market. Many referring physicians and payers are waiting for larger data sets and longer-term follow-up, including data from our HTN-3 U.S. pivotal study, which we expect to have fully enrolled by summer.</p>
          <p>We are still tracking for an FY 2015 U.S. approval, albeit later in the fiscal year. At the same time, we continue to advance our leading renal denervation technology pipeline and expect to receive CE Mark for our Symplicity spiral and multi-electrode catheter this summer. This product will take ablation times down from 16 minutes to 24 minutes today to only 2 minutes, and all through a very small 6 French catheter. We believe our technology, strong clinical data and significant intellectual property represents a large multi-billion dollar opportunity in renal denervation.</p>
          <p>In Structural Heart, revenue of $272 million increased 4%, including 6% growth in transcatheter valves. We estimate the international transcatheter valve market grew 6% to 8% in Q3. Our CoreValve device continues to have leading share in our addressable market. With the expected CE market approval of our Engager valve this spring, we expect to expand into the transapical segment, which represents approximately 20% of the international TAVI market. Positive data from our Engager CE pivotal trial demonstrating high procedural success and exceptional rates of PBL at 6 months were presented at FCS in January.</p>
          <p>Also on the clinical front, we are actively enrolling patients in our global SURTAVI trial, which is designed to expand the market for CoreValve into more moderate risk patients. In our CoreValve U.S. pivotal study, enrollment in our extreme and high-risk arms is complete and we remain on track to commercialize in the U.S. in FY 2015.</p>
          <p>In the Endovascular, revenue of $212 million grew 14% with strong balanced growth across our aortic and peripheral businesses. In aortic, our AAA business grew in the double-digits, driven by strong growth from Endurant in Japan and a continued acceptance of Endurant II in other global markets.</p>
          <p>Our thoracic business grew over 25% on the strength of Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and China. In peripheral, we had double-digit growth in our peripheral stent business. Our drug-eluting balloon business also had double-digit growth in Q3 and we recently completed enrollment in our U.S. pivotal study trial for our impact drug-eluting balloon with an SFA indication.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1.927 billion grew 3%. Results are driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and Diabetes, partially offset by declines in BMP and balloon kyphoplasty.</p>
          <p>Spine revenue of $753 million declined 3% globally and 6% in the U.S., primarily driven by declines in BMP and BKP. We completed our Kanghui acquisition in Q3 and as expected there was no overall impact to Spine's organic growth in Q3, as we started to wind down our Weigao joint venture while only recognizing two months of Kanghui revenue.</p>
          <p>Core Spine revenue of $639 million was flat globally and declined 1% in the U.S. Excluding BKP, our Core Spine business grew 2% globally and grew 1% in the U.S. which was a point higher than the U.S. market as we gained share on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Our U.S. core business continued to stabilize as new products and procedures are rolling out and performing well. In thoracolumbar, our Solera system is generating strong surgeon interest.</p>
          <p>In Cervical, we are beginning to seeing growth in U.S. disc as we ramp up surgeon training of our recently launched BRYAN ACD. In Interbody, our new AMT portfolio and CAPSTONE CONTROL a product used in our mass mid-lift procedure are driving growth. In other biologics, the adoption of our Grafton and MagniFuse DBMs continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>We are also differentiating our Spine business from the competition through enabling technologies such as O-arm Imaging, StealthStation Navigation and POWEREASE powered surgical instruments.</p>
          <p>Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery, as they see clear value from better outcomes and more efficient procedures. This is also resulting in significant pull-through for navigation in power-enabled spinal implants.</p>
          <p>In fact, in accounts that have our O-arm, we are seeing Core Spine revenue grow 10 points higher than non-O-arm accounts this fiscal year. We believe, we are still only on the leading edge of this large differentiated opportunity in Spine.</p>
          <p>In BMP, revenue of $114 million declined 21%, as this business continues to face CE market uncertainty. The Yale University is overseeing the finalization and publication of the findings from independent reviews of the BMP data. They control the timing and we now understand from them that the systematic reviews are not likely to be published until early FY 2014.</p>
          <p>To a lesser extent, our Q3 results were also affected by our inability to fulfill hospital quarter-end sales orders due to a supply constraint of sterile water, which is a component of an INFUSE kit. We received FDA approval for an alternate sterile water supplier last week, which will allow us to work through our back order kits in Q4.</p>
          <p>Surgical Technologies revenue of $350 million grew 10%, driven by double-digit growth in Neurosurgery and Advanced Energy. Neurosurgery performance was driven by Midas Rex powered surgical equipment and core navigation, including sales of StealthStation S7 surgical navigation systems.</p>
          <p>In Advanced Energy, strong double-digit growth of our &#x2013; both of our Aquamantys bipolar sealers, and PEAK PlasmaBlade electrosurgical products drove results.</p>
          <p>Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue of $447 million increased 7%, these results were driven by strong global growth in DBS in Gastro/Uro as well as Pain Stim in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In DBS, we had another strong quarter of double-digit growth as our referral channels development efforts are generating new implants. Our Gastro/Uro business also grew double-digits in Q3, driven by strong adoption of our InterStim Therapy in Western Europe and in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Pain Stim, we are now launching in Europe, the market's first spinal cord stimulator system that are approved for full body MRI scans, including our RestoreSensor of SureScan MRI stimulator and Vectris SureScan MRI lead.</p>
          <p>Diabetes revenue of $377 million grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM. In the U.S. Diabetes declined 1% as U.S. consumers continued to wait for FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump and Enlite sensor, which we now hope to occur later this spring or summer.</p>
          <p>In addition to the impact of the delay, we also deferred $9 million in revenue, as we plan to convert some of the recently sold pumps to the new technology once it is approved. Outside the United States, our business grew 11%, although insulin pump growth slowed somewhat in Western Europe, as we await the launch of our next-generation insulin pump, the MiniMed 640G this summer.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the rest of the income statement, the gross profit margin was 75.2%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, our gross margin was 75.8%. Foreign currency's negative impact on our gross margin offset the overall efficiencies in product manufacturing which are results of our ongoing $1.2 billion initiative to reduce product cost over 5 years. In Q4, we expect gross margins to be approximately 75.5%.</p>
          <p>Third quarter R&amp;D spending of $376 million was 9.3% of revenue. We remain committed to investing in new technologies to drive future growth; and for Q4, we expect R&amp;D spending to be around 9%.</p>
          <p>Third quarter SG&amp;A expenditures of $1.401 billion represented 34.8% of sales. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, Q3 SG&amp;A on an operational basis was 34.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, while at the same time investing in new product launches and adding to our sales force in faster growing businesses and geographies. In FY 2013, we continued to expect to drive 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement.</p>
          <p>Amortization expense for the quarter was $88 million, an expected increase from prior quarters due to the Kanghui acquisition. For Q4, we continue to expect amortization expense to be approximately $90 million.</p>
          <p>Net other expense for the quarter was $17 million, which was lower than our original forecast due to less-than-planned U.S. medical device tax, royalty expense and minority interest in elimination as we wind down our Weigao joint venture.</p>
          <p>Net gains from our hedging programs were $13 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge our operating results to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Based on current exchange rates, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense for the quarter was $46 million. Excluding the $23 million non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $23 million. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and cash investments and $11.4 billion in debt.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we have $2.2 billion of convertible debt that we intend to refinance as straight debt, which will result in higher cash interest rates on this portion of our debt. As a result, based on current interest rates, we anticipate non-GAAP net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in Q4, due to the debt overlap. And it's also worth noting that we will no longer have convertible debt outstanding in FY 2014 and the non-GAAP adjustment will not be applicable.</p>
          <p>Based on current rates, we would expect net interest expense to be $40 million to $45 million per quarter throughout FY 2014 a level that is more comparable to our current GAAP interest expense level.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 14.5%. Excluding the impact of certain acquisition-related items and the impact of the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q3 was 15.8%. Included in this rate, our tax benefits associated with the extension of the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit.</p>
          <p>In addition, the finalization of certain income tax returns and audits resulted in a $0.01 benefit from our original tax expectations. For FY 2013, we expected an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 19.5%.</p>
          <p>Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated approximately $3.4 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Fiscal year-to-date, we have paid approximately $800 million in dividends and repurchased more than $1.2 billion of our common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 27 million shares. Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.021 billion shares.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe a constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for the full fiscal year 2013.</p>
          <p>Although, we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year that our FY 2013 revenue would be unfavorably affected by approximately $300 million to $320 million, including an unfavorable $20 million to $40 million impact in Q4.</p>
          <p>With respect to earnings per share guidance, we continue to expect FY 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.66 to $3.70, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 7%. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, based on our performance through three quarters, we would expect to be at the upper end of our ranges on both revenue and earnings per share.</p>
          <p>As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year, nor do they includes the impact of a non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gary.</p>
          <p>Before opening the lines for Q&amp;A, let me conclude by reiterating that Q3 represented another quarter in building toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth. While we continue to execute in areas we can control, including growing our markets we're in the same time early in the process of building a business that is strong enough to offset the variables that are beyond our control, so that we can reliably deliver on our baseline expectations which are: consistent mid-single digit revenue growth; consistent EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue; and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're also playing a leading role in transforming global healthcare by implementing our long-term strategies of economic value and globalization.</p>
          <p>We're only at the beginning of establishing our track record, but we believe that crisp execution on both our baseline and long-term growth strategies combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare.</p>
          <p>With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&amp;A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us again for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>We're rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so we respectfully request you limit yourself to only one question and if necessary, one follow up so that we can get to as many people as possible.

          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looks like January was a little bit soft. And just curious how the January performance impacts your thinking relative to the goal of getting back to mid-single-digit revenue growth in the near term. And I know it's premature to think about FY 2014, but if you had to think about it today, how that would influence that goal of getting back to mid-single digits for FY 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Mike, the goal is still there. Obviously, the slowdown in January especially in Europe put some challenges in our way. But we feel that we're strengthening our business in enough ways to get there.</p>
          <p>Like we mentioned at JPMorgan, there are basically &#x2013; our roadmap included strengthening of the U.S. ICD and Spine markets and of offsetting the year-over-year bad comparison, if you like, with Resolute Integrity. However &#x2013; and on top of that, the rest of the businesses were supposed to grow, if you recall, at about 4.5% and &#x2013; or 5% and that's where we were sort of road mapping our mid-single digits.</p>
          <p>Now, Europe's got pressure, but at the same time, Japan has got some upside. And we're like pushing emerging markets quite hard. And that's basically our game plan, to offset these different variables and address the challenges and then reach our goal, which we think is still achievable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mike, if I can just add to what Omar said. I mean, overall, we &#x2013; obviously, January, especially in Europe, was softer than we had expected. And as we indicated in our comments, that gives us a little bit of pause.</p>
          <p>But as Omar said, there is a lot of parts of Medtronic. And we're going to have to push harder in some other areas. And we don't know what the impact of Europe is going to be long-term either. We have to make sure how &#x2013; we'll see how that plays out.</p>
          <p>But as Omar said, Japan continues to be very, very strong. The U.S., we're starting to see some growth back in some of our core businesses on Spine and CRDM. So net-net, we're still &#x2013; our goal is to put together plans that can deliver on that mid-single digit growth.</p>
          <p>Now we &#x2013; as you indicated, we're not giving FY 2014 guidance yet, but that is still our plan to deliver on the mid-single digit revenue growth.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. On the Diabetes business, it sounded like you got a round of questions on the 530G approval. Any sense of the likelihood that pushes out beyond just a 3-month turnaround?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't really say. I mean, we're working with the FDA closely and we're pretty optimistic that we will get it in the next few months, but a regulatory process has unknowns, which we cannot control. But at this stage, we're working closely with them and achieve &#x2013; and expect to achieve a positive outcome.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Mike's question on Diabetes. The U.S. it was down 1%; I know the pump business, you're being held up by the new approval, but how is the disposable business tracking? And is the diabetes market, in your view, for pump slowing overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're such a big piece of the market, I think, we obviously have an impact on that. There are some pressures that the other competitors have also faced, but I think the new pump is a strong enough catalyst that it will further growth of the market. And we're a big enough player in that space.</p>
          <p>And as far as the disposable market is concerned, I think that's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matt the disposables overall are growing fine. We're not seeing any &#x2013; on the CGM or disposables, we're not seeing any real slowdown there. It's primarily on the pump side of the equation and we do believe it is related to the fact that people are waiting for the new pump for its approval and so that's clearly had an impact.</p>
          <p>I mean, I think, the overall pump market in the U.S. had been somewhat slower. Even if you went back over the last year, it had been somewhat slower.</p>
          <p>But what we've seen outside the United States when you get this new pump approved, the 530G, with its Low Glucose Suspend feature we've seen that we actually reaccelerated the markets and we saw that outside the United States and in Europe where we saw double-digit growth for really two years since the pump was &#x2013; has been launched.</p>
          <p>And so we are expecting that will accelerate pump growth in the U.S. And, as Omar said, we're such a large part of the market that clearly will drive market growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a quick one for Mike Coyle. With the Advisa now out, can you compare and contrast how much more of the market or what the potential share benefit is of Advisa versus Revo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So obviously, you've seen Advisa has had a real impact on our growth in Japan, but it was also the first MRI product to be approved in Japan.</p>
          <p>Since Revo has been in the marketplace here for a year in the U.S. we don't expect quite as much benefit as we are seeing in Japan. But on the other hand, adding all of the top-end feature sets of the &#x2013; of our Advisa pacemaker to now an MRI-capable product, gives us an opportunity we think both on price as well as on market share.</p>
          <p>And importantly, it also gives us now, Revo has a product tier to deal with some of the pricing pressures we've seen at the mid-tier. So we think it's going to be an important addition to our product line, and we think it'll continue the momentum that we're seeing in Pacing.</p>
          <p>We're up, as we pointed out, on a global basis, two market share points year-over-year. And obviously having this to reload our U.S. offering is very encouraging.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. So I was just wondering, if you could provide some more details on two things that you mentioned on the call. First, you talked about selling day comparisons, and I was wondering if you could just be more specific about exactly where the mismatches were this particular quarter?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, on Western Europe, I was wondering, if you could just talk a little bit more detail about specifically, which areas of the business are seeing the greatest weakness? Is it Cardiovascular? Is it Spine? Is it pricing? Is it units? Just a little more detail on Western Europe and on the selling day mismatches that you mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me cover Western Europe and I'll let Gary cover the selling day thing, and Gary can add to the Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, I would answer by saying, all of the above, because, in general, we've had general softness like everywhere. It's &#x2013; I think more in the Cardiovascular area, because the products &#x2013; there's more competition, and they're more in the radar screen, if you like, of the policymakers. But every business faces a certain degree of pressure.</p>
          <p>And it's both pricing and volume. And it varies by country. In Italy, for example, it clearly is both of them. In Germany, it was more pricing. So, it varied according to the different countries.</p>
          <p>What we saw this quarter which was different from previous quarters was that in previous quarters the softness, if you like, was limited to Southern Europe. This quarter, we saw more generalized softening. And to some degree, the general economic news we hear is kind of consistent with that.</p>
          <p>But again, we don't know all the answers yet. We're watching this thing very carefully. Obviously, we're doing everything we can through our specialists to make it clear to the market the value that our products bring and the value to the healthcare system, both in terms of cost and clinical efficacy that our products bring. And through that approach, we hope to at least stabilize the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just quickly on the selling days. Bob, what we were trying to highlight is really not a significant difference in selling days this year versus last year.</p>
          <p>There is a difference versus our Q3 versus Q2, which you always have. Q3 is the lowest selling days for us of any of the quarters, just from a standpoint of obviously the holiday seasons that are in there. And so, as a result of that, Q4 versus Q3, there is 5, 6 extra selling days in our Q4 and the same thing versus Q2.</p>
          <p>So that's all we were trying to highlight in the comments when we were comparing against that sequential &#x2013; our Q2 results &#x2013; that there was fewer selling days this quarter versus the prior quarter. Versus the prior year it's basically comparable.</p>
          <p>It does have some impact. We probably saw a little bit more impact we believe this year than last. Depending obviously where the holidays fall in the week and what that kind of an impact is, so there was some of that softness.</p>
          <p>In fact, that was in some ways what we thought might have been some of the issue, even in Europe. The first two weeks of January clearly were much, much softer than we've ever historically seen, and so we couldn't tell whether that was really a holiday effect or not. So we're watching it closely.</p>
          <p>But clearly that's what we were trying to get at in the selling-days comment. There is no difference really on &#x2013; year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then just as one quick follow-up on the BMP supply constraint. How much did that impact the revenues in the quarter? And when do you expect that to be resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, right now, it is resolved. So we are shipping with the &#x2013; where the &#x2013; the supply constraint is done. We've got approval on the sterile water supply, right, from the FDA. So that piece is resolved.</p>
          <p>How much of an impact there it had? It had some impact. I mean, Chris, do you want to make a comment on that, if you want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Bob, it wasn't a major impact. We were on allocation on certain kit sizes because of the sterile water supply issue, and we didn't take typical end-of-the-quarter orders.</p>
          <p>And so now that we have FDA approval on a new supplier for sterile water, we're in the process of releasing inventory and getting back into &#x2013; and getting off an allocation basis on that product. And so I would characterize it as minor.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Omar, you gave us more detail on the acquisition strategy than we've had in prior quarters, so I wanted to start there. And maybe one follow-up.</p>
          <p>I guess if you can give us some more color in terms of how you're thinking about the size of transaction. We've sort of become comfortable with Medtronic the last several years doing deals that were less than $1 billion. Maybe if you could talk just about the size of transaction. Maybe the stage of development.</p>
          <p>It sounds like your preference is still emerging markets over developed markets, but within emerging markets, you did talk about some nice return goals. Help us understand sort of how you think about those return goals as it relates to transactions like Kanghui, which are very much infrastructure-type of deals. But any additional color you could give us on some of those components would be very helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, David, the goals and the hurdles don't change based on whether it's a geographic broadening acquisition or a new technology acquisition. I mean, those goals don't change.</p>
          <p>We really look at two things, or three things, if you like. We look for a strategic fit. A strategic fit &#x2013; we've already described our businesses in three groups: the Cardiovascular Group, the Restorative Therapy Group, which essentially includes Ortho and Spine in a broad sense &#x2013; and Neuro for that matter &#x2013; Ortho, Spine and Neuro &#x2013; and Diabetes. And we are aiming to fill gaps within these groups. That's one area of strategic focus.</p>
          <p>And the other is, as we fill those gaps, we're also looking at acquisitions that can help us deliver economic value, and that could mean broadening our focus in the continuum of care, but always related to our therapies. And by that I mean, looking at businesses which help us identify patients better or more efficiently, as well as patient-management offerings.</p>
          <p>And the other area is globalization. And in globalization, it's primarily &#x2013; at this stage, anyway, is approaching the value segment. Although we're quite interested in sort of market growth as well, if we see fit. Distribution companies who are &#x2013; who've got high share and have got credibility in certain marketplaces are also areas that we look at. So those are the areas that we look at. That's the first thing, the strategic focus.</p>
          <p>The second is, it's got to have certain hurdle rates in the mid-teens, and that applies to everyone, no matter who we buy. And the third is that we've got to cover dilution within the company. And by covering dilution, what I mean is that our goal of delivering this mid-single digit growth with 200 basis points to 400 basis points of leverage and EPS is something we want to protect, despite an acquisition. The acquisition should help us get there rather than get in the way of achieving that.</p>
          <p>So these are the things that we try to look at for the acquisition. The size, if it meets all these criteria, is a secondary factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very helpful. And then, Gary, just a quick follow-up here. If we think about margins and progression throughout the year, specifically gross margins, they have come down maybe 50 basis points, 60 basis points across the quarters.</p>
          <p>If you just sort of &#x2013; if we get to the fourth-quarter number that you provided &#x2013; is obviously where it comes in at &#x2013; can you just give us a sense of the factors across the quarters, whether it's FX, some of the pricing pressure you talked about, or geographic mix? So, what's been sort of the incremental downward pressure on GMs across the quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, as we indicated, obviously FX was a big impact, especially over the last couple of quarters. And the good news is as we go into the fourth quarter here, we're starting to anniversary, especially versus the euro, some significant changes on the FX. And so the FX impact certainly in Q4 is less on the gross margin line and so we do expect that we're not going to quite have quite the negative impact that we've had in the last two or three quarters from that factor.</p>
          <p>As you indicated, I mean, obviously, we continue to see pricing pressures across the organization. We've talked about that. The revenue mix, you've got positives and negatives. Japan obviously being a big growth engine right now has higher margins, and that's a positive. Having the U.S. actually coming back and seeing the CRDM business and even Spine in the U.S., which are higher-margin businesses improving, is good. But we still have pricing pressure that we're offsetting, and then we're having product-cost reductions, obviously, as we continue to take the $1.2 billion of product cost out. So we're seeing a benefit on that side of the equation.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of factors that are driving it. Overall, we feel still very confident that we're kind of in &#x2013; we've been able to maintain that 75% to 76% range. It's going to vary by 30 basis points, 40 basis points in kind of given quarters. But in general, as we indicated for the fourth quarter, 75.5% is what we're looking at, and that's assuming that the FX basically can &#x2013; stays where it's at, and we don't have a significant negative impact from FX, which is what we've been fighting the last two or three quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Omar and then a follow-up for Mike.</p>
          <p>Omar, at JPM, you were sounding reasonably optimistic that mid-single digits was feasible with kind of reasonable assumptions. Clearly, January in Europe seemed to be a surprise to the company. Now the question is do you guys have intelligence as to whether or not January was just a bad month? Or there were specific, identifiable policy changes that really impacted the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have really hard evidence, but our &#x2013; obviously, we've looked into this very closely and are watching the trends very carefully as well.</p>
          <p>The policy changes, there aren't any dramatics &#x2013; across-the-board policy changes in Europe that we can point to. However, in Italy, for example, some of the policy changes are &#x2013; people are driving more strongly, and it's having an impact.</p>
          <p>I think there is a general concern &#x2013; and it's a little qualitative, but there's a general concern over the overall economy in Europe. Like you've heard recently in the press, there's even a concern about growth in Germany. And I think that to some degree is probably driving some of this caution in the marketplace, both from policymakers as well as patients themselves, to the degree that they participate in paying for their own healthcare.</p>
          <p>So that's the best that I can do with that. And I'd be welcome to -</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean I &#x2013; Bruce, this is Gary. I don't know if I can add much more to what Omar said.</p>
          <p>Obviously, as you indicated, we were surprised by January. We had seen &#x2013; through December, we were feeling pretty good and then January clearly was softer.</p>
          <p>As we indicated, clearly the first couple weeks, we could maybe point to the holidays and say that, that was maybe just an unusual impact and that was both how we were explaining it. And we saw &#x2013; we did see a recovery a little bit in the back half of January, but we're still cautious because it's not like it has bounced back to where we were previously at, as far as growth rates.</p>
          <p>And so, we're watching it carefully, but we don't have any &#x2013; as Omar said, there's nothing from a policy or &#x2013; direction that changed in January. There wasn't anything that came out from the governments or anything else that would have changed how &#x2013; why January ended up being the way it was. And it just seems as the overall, as Omar said, the overall economy and concern and focus on healthcare is what's kind of focused on this and will have to wait and see how &#x2013; how this plays out.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then on for &#x2013; on TAVI, Western Europe is haves and have-nots, and I was wondering if you guys could comment on just general trajectory of volume and price. And what's it going to take to get the rest of Western Europe to look more like Germany where they're moving past partner one into partner two type patients? And then, finally, when is the extreme risk data from your trial in the U.S. likely to be made available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the question of Europe in general, we believe the availability of data into the more moderate risk patient populations is going to be the key item to expanding the usage of the technology more broadly outside of Germany and obviously we're very aggressively pursuing enrollment in our SURTAVI program to provide those data.</p>
          <p>In addition, for us, obviously the ability for us to penetrate the transapical segment is going to be important and then we expect Engager CE Mark here in the spring and going forward that gives us an opportunity to penetrate what's roughly 20% of the overall market. So, those would be the primary drivers, I would point to, for what will keep the growth going in the upper single-digit kind of range for Europe.</p>
          <p>In terms of availability for our data, we are in the &#x2013; on the U.S. trial, we would expect that to become available in the fall timeframe for sharing more generally and that's what I would set as an expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just to follow up on, like you look at the UK and Belgium, I mean, they are not even into &#x2013; through partner one yet. I mean, so what's it going to take to open up markets like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, again, I think there has to be compelling data to show the use of this technology in lower risk patients to really get at the larger patient population and I think that we are very aggressively pursuing the generation of those data.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonder if I could ask a bit about the U.S. ICD market. I think for a couple of quarters now you've commented about the lead-to-port ratio continuing to increase for you, but you haven't yet seen any pull-through on the can side. And I'm curious whether you expect to do that or really what's behind that sort of lack of pull-through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mike you're in the best position to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well, as you point out, we have seen and consistently have seen an increase in lead to port ratios and that is very encouraging for us. I think the opportunity that we see going forward is to use some of the unique technologies that we have within our cans to differentiate our product line. And for example, we have submitted data for the use of our lead Integrity alert with competitive leads, which we believe would be an important catalyst for us to be able to convert replacement shares on competitive lead products. So, that's an example of where I think we have some opportunity to expand can penetration.</p>
          <p>But the other piece is we just have these very robust pipeline going forward. I mean as you look at the &#x2013; not only the revised MRI program on the Pacing side, but also the Evera product line is going to be coming into the U.S. in the first quarter of next year, which offers a significant size, shape reductions and longevity enhancements to the overall product line, which we think will help us with the can penetration. And then the availability of the Viva/Brava product, which offers some unique algorithms for enhancing CRT effectiveness in that segment of the population; that too will be coming to the U.S. in the first quarter. And obviously those products, Evera and Viva/Brava, are also going to help us in Europe where we now have the Viva/Brava approved and are getting very nice uptake on its technology &#x2013; on that technology in Europe and we'll have Evera here in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So, we think these are going to give us good opportunities to continue to share capture momentum. And what's encouraging to us is that we're up almost a point of share year-over-year on the ICD side even though our competitors have been in new product introduction modes and we are just entering ours. So, we think the share momentum will continue in these segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just two quick follow-ups, so in times past you've also talked about the replacement market improving for you. How much of that share increase you're seeing is on the replacement side? And are you actually starting to see now acceleration in that side of your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the share capture has been on the replacement side, but we expect that to now shift to the initial implant side as we bring in our new products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly into the pricing. Again, U.S. ICDs I think you noted was down 5% in the U.S. How has that been changing? Have you seen that stabilize? Is pricing getting worse? And also, in the context of not bulking to see negative 5% is kind of a big number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the negative 5% is slightly worse than what we had been seeing. Typically, we had been seeing around 3% declines in the prior quarters. But obviously, we think the new products are going to give us an opportunity to play in multiple tiers with better pricing, which is going to be helpful to us. But frankly, we've also seen that more competitive pressure on pricing. And so we are going to continue to shift our discussions with customers to the breadth of our CVG product offering from the standpoint that we have multiple programs for economic value creation in leaning out their pacer clinics, leaning out patient flow through their cath labs, their blood conservation programs, the use of the connectivity technologies that we have, like CareLink Express, for being able to do more efficient device checks in emergency rooms.</p>
          <p>These are all programs that we are working with accounts on in multi-product line offerings to basically address their core economic needs beyond simply the price reductions that we're seeing. And that's something that's getting a lot more traction and we think will help us with mitigating some of these pricing issues going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. I was hoping &#x2013; I know there's been a lot of focus on this call on trends in January in Europe, but if I look across your U.S. businesses, those actually seem to be pretty healthy. Can you maybe just talk about the trajectory in some of the core U.S. markets? And maybe you could help us frame it into two categories. One would be sort of looking at those businesses that have faced a sort of reassessment of prescribing patterns, whether that's Spine or ICDs, whether we are in fact, you think, reaching a bottom there and poised for re-acceleration? And then maybe some of the categories that are more elective in nature where you might have seen some seasonal impact in the fourth calendar quarter and how those have trended?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; I think you're right. I think there is room to reason for some level of optimism regarding the U.S. market, because in general, that has at least been stable over the past few quarters. I think a number of things. First of all, I do think in January in the early part of the year, in the U.S., there is some pressure in the market based on people's insurance plans, deductibles start coming up early in the year, so any out-of-pocket expense people are more careful with and that has a tendency to shift procedures to the back half of the year when they want to use up whatever health benefits they have. So, there is that kind of pattern in the U.S. market, which we think we do see in the early part of the year as insurance schemes become more and more patient care pay dependent. That's one factor.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, we do think that both in Spine and in ICDs, there is a general stabilization of volume and implants. And Spine for example, has reached a level of stability that we haven't seen for years, I think, with the practitioners getting comfortable with the policies in place. Now we expect to continue to work with them to drive further growth in that market, but there does seem to be some level of stabilization. I think there is going to be issues with pricing. I think there is going to be issues in the U.S. with healthcare reform; the Affordable Care Act gets in play and there is a certain level of uncertainty there.</p>
          <p>I think there is factors around, affordable care &#x2013; the accountable care organizations that we have to watch. But in all of these areas, we think that if we can demonstrate value, financially, of the products that we have, that is essential to our success and the success of the overall healthcare system. So, we do think that the U.S. in some ways will be a little more stable than Europe for example; but again, I mean there's uncertainty here as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to add to his &#x2013; Omar's comment, David, is &#x2013; what I would also say is, I think you're right. I think the U.S. is looking better because of the stabilization in ICDs and Spine, as Omar said. I think the other thing that people need to focus on is, as you heard from Mike and even as we move through our discussion, we have a lot of new products that are just hitting the U.S. market at this point in time. I mean Spine has seen some uplift because they had some new products here recently that are starting to impact and CRDM is getting ready to launch several new products in the U.S. market. Diabetes, as we've talked about, is clearly getting ready to launch some things in the U.S. market and the fact is some of the things that have been driving some of the emerging and international markets, some of those products are finally just hitting the U.S. market and I think that will even have &#x2013; well especially on top of the fact that we've stabilized the ICD and Spine business, will help to start accelerating some of the growth in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Maybe my follow-up could just be on that last point, Gary, where you talk about new product launches. If we look at Ardian outside the United States, I think in your comments that has gone a little bit more slowly than you had expected. Maybe you could provide a little bit more detail there. But maybe more broadly speaking, as new products get phased in and launched, how should we be thinking about ramp curves and timing of adoption? I mean, if we look across the entire sector, it seems as though, we're all used to you launch a new product it automatically gets adopted. Those ramp curves are all looking more slowly than they used to. So, maybe just sort of &#x2013; how should we think about your new product flow and then the corresponding impact on revenue and then earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I'll just add a few comments on that one. First of all, the ramp, increasingly people will demand economic data because every government everywhere in the world is concerned about healthcare costs. Even when their spending, as a percent of GDP is low, they all watch what's going on around the world and are very careful with escalating healthcare costs. So that the need for economic value of these therapies is going to be and is becoming as important as clinical value so that's an essential ingredient to accelerating the commercial adoption of some of these products.</p>
          <p>The other factor, which you have to be careful with, is that these products are different. I mean Ardian, for example, has a referral chain. That has to be educated, which is not the same as some of the other products that we might launch. And so, depending on the details of &#x2013; and the nature of the technology and who is adopting it, what are the barriers in changing the physician or the hospital or healthcare system workflow that's needed here, that also will affect the speed of ramp. So, those are two things that I would look at, as we look to new products.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We've gone by the past the top of the hour, so we have time for one last question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to go back over &#x2013; Gary, I know you mentioned other expense came in a little bit lower. I think you cited the device tax and then also I think a gain on the sale of investment. Can you maybe just talk about the drivers between where it came in at $17 million relative to your expectations again and whether the device tax is something that we should expect should remain lower, whether it was just a timing issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there were a few items that affected the other income and expense line item. It's a little bit more favorable than we had expected. One is, something we should have, but we didn't note the timing on it.</p>
          <p>With the dissolution of the Weigao joint venture &#x2013; one of the things obviously as a joint venture. We consolidated the entire sales and expense is really the joint venture, but the profits related that basically Weigao took the offsetting profits, half the profits in effect were down as an expense and other income and expense line item. Resolving the joint venture, that went away so that expense that we've had done in that other income expense was eliminated because of the accounting on how we handle Weigao now joint venture. So, that was a benefit that we didn't anticipate at the beginning of the quarter. It obviously is offset by the fact that you don't have the revenues and everything else that we would've &#x2013; we also lost from the resolution of the joint venture. And Kanghui, obviously, then the revenues and expenses are up all above the line, not in the other income and expense line and even though those two basically offset. So that was one item.</p>
          <p>The medical device tax was also a little lower than we expected. Now we only have one month of the device tax, but as the final rules and regulations came out, basically what we saw is on something. Basically the existing inventory that's in the field already, you don't pay the device tax on that piece of it. And so as a result of it, the only thing you pay is what's coming to the manufacturers that actually go through to the final sale.</p>
          <p>So, there's going to be a little bit of a slower ramp up on the device tax itself just based on what the existing inventory levels that are out there for the various businesses. And so, it is relatively small. Our previous estimate I think even for the fiscal year we said to be up to $50 million kind of on a pre-tax basis. Now our current estimate, based on the new regulations would say that probably for the fiscal year, it's maybe up to $25 million &#x2013; $20 million, $25 million, so it's about half of what we expected, say, prior to the final regulations and so that was a slight benefit also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Did you have any gains on the sale of any investments? I know that you guys were selling Weigao.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean nothing that's unusual. I mean, we have some periodically, where we do some, I mean, we &#x2013; but we also had some impairments on some investments also. So net-net there was no real change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can you provide any more color just around the &#x2013; it sounded like it was a gain related to Ardian and the contingent or future milestones. Just what the expectation was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Right. What we did on the non-GAAP &#x2013; excuse me, on the GAAP financials reflects the $70 million gain which is a reduction in the contingent consideration so this is &#x2013; as we made the acquisition of Ardian we had to record, the accounting rules require you to record what you think your milestone payments are going to be and you have to book that as a contingent consideration of liability as you go forward. Because of the &#x2013; obviously the regulatory process in the U.S. here and the enrollment, I should say, the enrollment process has been longer than we expected and because of the slower commercialization in Western Europe because of some of the getting reimbursement and some of these things, the whole things we've been talking about that Ardian &#x2013; we're still excited about the opportunity, but the reality is it's coming a little slower than we expected.</p>
          <p>That means that the milestone payments that we would have to pay out based on our current estimates and forecast of how this will ramp up, is less because we're shifting things out a little bit and we're shifting things out past &#x2013; some of it out past obviously the final milestone payment which is an FY 2015. And that gain, because the liability has now been reduced, that liability being reduced, it goes &#x2013; flows through the P&amp;L as a gain. We recorded this obviously in the GAAP financials, but we did not reflect it in our non-GAAP numbers, but it is a gain that the company recognizes by reducing that liability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will that also have any implications on the amortization that ultimately flows through once you get U.S. commercialization?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because again the intangible assets and all the assets related, as the value of the Ardian itself we still feel very, very strongly about; in fact, if anything probably feel that there's more value there long-term. It's just that if you think about it, the value has shifted out past the milestone payment.</p>
