          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's Group Second Quarter and First Half 2009 Results Conference Call. The presentation hosted by Mr. Didier Valet, Group Financial Officer, will be followed by a question-and-answer session <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Mr. Valet. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon to everybody. I will quickly make a presentation of 20 minutes on the second quarter results of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and then I will be able to answer your question with other members from the Executive Committee.</p>
          <p>So starting with slide three, we can see that despite the challenging economic environments, the group operational performance was satisfactory overall. If I look at French and International Retail Banking business, they both experienced some commercial activity.</p>
          <p>On the Corporate and Investment Banking side, the division achieved a record operational performance with net banking income of nearly &#x20AC;3 billion, up compared to the first quarter. And this highlights the commercial successes that we have achieved over the last six months and also the very strong resilience of our trading activities, combined with also successfully controlled risk <mark type="inaudible" /> went down compared to the first quarter. The situation is more mixed for the Asset Management and Security Services businesses, as you would see, with revenues down by 14% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>As we announced at the beginning of July, revenues for this quarter include the negative accounting impact linked to the tightening of credit spread, totaling &#x20AC;1.3 billion, 840 for the CDS which are hedging our loan portfolio and 459 linked to the revaluation of our own debt.</p>
          <p>Revenues excluding non-recurring item, which also include almost &#x20AC;400 million of markdown, amounted to 7.4 billion during the quarter. In other words, 13.5% up compared to last year. Also this quarter, it's important to notice that thanks to an improvement on liquidity on certain category of assets, we were able to reduce assets at risk in the amount of &#x20AC;3 billion essentially on the <mark type="inaudible" /> credit portfolio side, as well as on the assets that we have taken from the GAAP.</p>
          <p>On the cost of risk, which remains high at 112 basis points, also it is slightly lower than the level that we've seen in the first quarter and we also provide you more detail later on.</p>
          <p>So all in all, the net income reached &#x20AC;309 million, and also I should point it out that the Tier 1 ratio of the group has improved, not only thanks to the pref share issued to the French government, but also on top of that, we have generated fairly bit additional during the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we move to slide four, we also reconcile that is a 7.4 billion with the 5.7 billion from an accounting point of view. You can see that. So we have this &#x20AC;840 million on CDS. The outstanding on the CDS portfolio now stands at &#x20AC;18 billion of nominal, and let's say, non-crystallized positive mark-to-market amount to &#x20AC;400 million as of end of June.</p>
          <p>On our own debt, the charge of the reversal was minus 459 and the residual, let's say, positive mark-to-market stands at &#x20AC;300 million as of end of June also.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, I also mention that we booked some impairments and write-down during the quarter for a total of &#x20AC;384 million, of which 397 are linked to the CIB side. I will be also able to answer your question on that side.</p>
          <p>Moving to page five, with the full P&amp;L, you can see that the top line went up by 3.3%; as I said already, 13.5% on an underlying basis. Costs were under control at 4.8% on a like-for-like basis. And so other results from a pure accounting perspective, gross operating income was flat compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk has tripled compared to last year, but went down compared to Q1. I will comment on the next slide. And so all in all, return on equity after-tax stands at 3% for the second quarter. If we were to exclude the non-recurring items, net profit will be in the region of &#x20AC;1.5 billion and return on equity around 18% after-tax.</p>
          <p>On page six, let's have a look at our risk. As I said, this risk fell slightly this quarter with &#x20AC;1,075 million of net provisioning, representing 112 basis points of the Basel I risk-weighted assets. This level is not down to an improvement in this economic situation, but underlying the slowdown in our counterparty declaration compared to the first quarter, except in certain businesses, like Russia and Financial Services.</p>
          <p>If we look more into detail in the French networks, we're at a plateau, with a cost of risk of 65 bps compared to 68 in the first quarter. SMEs and professional customers continue to be the segments that are the most affected in term of default. And as expected, and as mentioned several times on the housing loans, we continue to have an extremely low cost of risk.</p>
          <p>In International Retail Banking, the rise in the cost of risk has slowed down compared to what we've seen in the previous quarter, plus 5% in absolute term compared to plus 44, for example, in the first quarter. So cost of risk amounted to 185 basis point.</p>
          <p>We can say that there we have two different trend. On one side, a continued increase in Russia where the cost of risk increased further from 381 in the first quarter in term of basis point to 559 in the second quarter. So we had the stress test that we have presented you in the previous quarter, which is approximately 600 bps cost of risk for the full year.</p>
          <p>And outside of Russia, we went down from 113 to 97 basis points. I mentioned at the time of the first quarter result that we had one single site that was relatively important in Czech Republic. Neutralizing for this impact, the cost of risk is relatively stable compared to Q4, Q1 at 95, 97 basis points.</p>
          <p>On the Financial Services, there was a further increase to 242 basis points, compared to 197 increase, which is split evenly between consumer finance and also leasing, where we've seen some deterioration in the counterparty risk in Germany, notably.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, and this explain most of the decrease that we see in the quarter, you can see that in CIB, in million of euros, the provisioning went down from &#x20AC;567 million to 258. Just to explain the decline, there is three major items, first of all, and we said that in the first quarter, we booked some litigation provisions and there is none in Q2. So the swing is approximately &#x20AC;110 million.</p>
          <p>We booked also in the first quarter some general provisioning on reclassified assets for &#x20AC;58 million. It is nil this quarter. And last, but not least, on the, let's say, portfolio-based provisioning that we booked on the counterparty risk in CIB, the slowdown of entry of a new five in the watch list has led us to reduce the amount alloted to general provisioning from 127 in Q1 to &#x20AC;49 million in Q2.</p>
          <p>All that explain, let's say, the slight decline that we've seen in the first quarter <mark type="inaudible" /> the cost of risk even high and we should see that continuing for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Page seven, in term of solvency positioning, as I said at the introduction, the Tier 1 ratio went up from 8.7, end of March, 9.2 pro forma from the 50 bps pref share issuance to 9.5% as of end of June, and so was the increase of the core Tire 1 ratio, 30 bps, above the pro forma figures that we gave you when we presented the first quarter results.</p>
          <p>These 30 bps increase is coming from net profits, neutralization of the negative item on spreads, which is from a regulatory perspective, excluding from Tier 1 capital, is a positive or negative, as well as reduction of the risk-weighted assets. So this showed us during the second quarter Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, through its internal capital generation, as well as through its strict control on the risk-weighted assets was able to improve the Tier 1 ratio by 30bps.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have benefited from a light 15 bps from the scrip dividend, which was offset by a goodwill and auto regulatory deduction in term of goodwill. I'll remind you that we book the goodwill linked to 7% sales increase in Rosbank, which took place during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I will not comment on slide eight, and turning directly to slide nine, we're starting in term of business line with the French networks. There you can see that overall, the activity was solid, with an increase in deposit by 6% overall. But if we look by business, customers increase was 20% and 1.5% for individual customers, essentially linked to a dynamic growth in regulated savings accounts.</p>
          <p>On the lending side, the increase was 3.7 for both business customers and individual customers, showing that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord networks continued to accompany the customer base in this economic environment.</p>
          <p>In term of revenues, net banking income rose by 1.2% excluding PEL/CEL, driven by a 3.8% increase in interest margin and a slight decline in commission, minus 1.9, which is a combination of a plus 1.8% increase in service commissioning and a contraction of financial commission by 13.5%.</p>
          <p>Costs under control, and all in all, the cost income ratio is relatively stable. We confirm our target of annual net banking income growth of 1%, excluding PEL/CEL and excluding also the capital gains that we booked last year on VISA, and to our so positive jaws for the full year.</p>
          <p>If we look to page ten, a quick look to the client activity and what we have done in term of commercial strategy, we continue to push for the Livret A, where we have seen some &#x20AC;4 billion of outstanding as of end of March. We have opened 1.4 million accounts, so one of every four sight accounts.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, we have also re-launched the payout product, which was for the whole industry continuingly decreasing since two or three years, and we believe that this product which is a long-term saving product is now well positioned compared to other type of savings.</p>
          <p>Also we've launched some initiative for the business customers in term of time deposits. In term of market share, we can see &#x2013; you can see on the two graphs that we have gained regularly market share for the business segment, plus 30% compared to one year ago. And in term of household deposit market share, we've seen a rebound by 20 bps compared to end of February this year. In term of local authorities, we continue to increase our loan to that segment which grew by 17% almost over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>If now we move to International Retail Banking, page 11, you can see that over the last nine months, we've adjusted our commercial policy, putting great emphasis on the deposit correction. They increased by 1.1% at constant exchange rates compared to beginning of the year. While at the same time the slowdown of loan origination triggered a contraction of the loan by minus 2.3%. We are more strict, let's say, in term of new lending origination in this market context.</p>
          <p>Overall, you can see that the loan-to-deposit ratio has improved <mark type="inaudible" /> below 100%, even if the situation are extremely different from one country to one other. In term of operations, we have slowed down the expansion of network, opening only 31 branches in Q2 compared to 150 last year. And we have also reduced the accounts by 1.1% over the quarters. So almost 700 people.</p>
          <p>Net banking income reached almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion for the quarter, with bottom line of 122. And impact on Russia, on which I would focus a little bit more in two slides. You can see that the franchise is extremely resilient with a return on equity post-tax of 29%, despite triplements on the cost of risk compared to last year.</p>
          <p>This resilience is highlighted by slide 12. We are looking at three regions or countries. We can see that there are some positive trends in our major entities. Looking at the Mediterranean Basin, you can see that both Morocco and Egypt have delivered sustained activities, thanks to a diversified portfolio and the regular growth in outstanding, mentioning that this region is less impacted by the economic recession compared to see. All in all, you can see that net banking income reached &#x20AC;190 million and the bottom line contribution is &#x20AC;51 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Czech Republic, Komer&#x10D;n&#xED; banka has continued to gain market share in certain segments, like housing loans and life insurance, and also is leveraging its cost and synergy pooling, as illustrated by the fact that operating expense have contracted by minus 1.7% compared to last year. The bottom line contribution of Komer&#x10D;n&#xED; banka for the group results reached &#x20AC;49 million and the return on equity on normalized equity allocation reached 41% for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Romania, BRD confirmed its resilience showing that its balance sheet structure is sounder than most of its peers and having also capacity to grow its deposit outstanding by 6.3% improving and emphasizing cross-selling by increasing the equipment rate to 3.3 products per customer. And so as a result, you can see that net banking income reached &#x20AC;179 million for contribution of almost 30 million.</p>
          <p>If I turn now to Russia, on page 13, well, the crisis environment is affecting the performance of our entities. Starting with the Russian economy, which can say that the first half was extremely tough with a contraction of the GDP by almost 10% and we're expecting the GDP to shrink by around 8 to 9% for the full year.</p>
          <p>However, let's say, we've seen some signs of improvements in the recent months with an increase in oil price, the fact that most commodity prices, essentially metals have stabilized. And also ruble has slightly improved, appreciated and the government was able to also slightly increase its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
          <p>I already commented on the cost of risk of our, let's say, framework in Russia, so BSGV, Rosbank and DeltaCredit with a cost of risk that has been multiplied by almost 2.5 times compared to Q4. And so this framework is loss making in the quarter, minus &#x20AC;55 million.</p>
          <p>To cope with that, we have implemented some measures as freezing the network expansion, accelerating productivity gains in each entity with a 10% head count reduction across the Russian entity's target, and also being even more selective in loan approval policy and by strengthening our collection procedures, which are key in this market environment.</p>
          <p>All in all, we're confident that the framework continue to have a medium-term growth potential which is intact and the country also will remain promising for the full year &#x2013; for the rest of the decade.</p>
          <p>On page 14, Financial Services, having a look to these major two divisions on financial &#x2013; specialized financials &#x2013; specialized financing, sorry, as well as insurance. Starting with the first one, we can say that in specialized financing, we've seen a decrease in loan demand which is illustrated by a new business contraction figure that you have on the slide, but this was more than offset by rise in margins and the origination, which combined with some losses that we booked in the fleet management, led to a stable net banking income compared to last year.</p>
          <p>On top of this effort of repricing, we have implemented some realignment measures in most operations, leading to a contraction of operating expenses by minus 3.5 %. And so as a result, the gross operating income was slightly up compared to last year by 5.4% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>On the life insurance side, we've seen some inflows of 2.3 billion, slightly down compared to last year. And so all in all, the contribution of Financial Services to group profit stood at &#x20AC;17 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>If I now move to this, starting with Private Banking, we can say that Private Banking commercial activity was strong despite an environment that is still fairly negative overall. Inflows were robust at 1.3 billion. We were at 0.6 in the first quarter. And this has triggered, let's say, an increase in the assets under management to &#x20AC;71 billion, also helped by the market rebound.</p>
          <p>The gross margin rate stands at 128 basis points. It is up compared to last year where it was 113, driven partially by Treasury revenues. We can say that this 128 <mark type="inaudible" /> sustainable level is more likely to be in the region of 110, 115. All in all, net banking income was up by 9.4% at &#x20AC;222 million.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we have seen further outflows, 3.1 billion in the second quarter, which are coming mainly from the alternative management. As you can see, alternative investment has seen minus &#x20AC;3 billion of outflows, essentially linked to hedge funds and structured product strategies.</p>
          <p>For the rest, let's say, we've seen some arbitrage between money market funds into bond funds. And also we've seen some slight inflows in equity funds, plus &#x20AC;0.3 billion. Net banking income fell by 25.5% on a like-for-like basis, essentially reflecting the asset contraction compared to last year.</p>
          <p>On page 16, on Securities Services and Newedge and Boursorama, as we said in the title, these divisions on this slide are impacted by the fall in interest rates, which are at historically low level. As part of their revenues is coming from the float we see from the customers, it is true for <mark type="inaudible" /> Securities Services as well as Newedge.</p>
          <p>For the rest, you can see that income of assets under custody and asset under administration we've seen an increase compared to last year and also compared to end of March, reflecting the rebound we've seen on the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Newedge, in an environment where we've seen some lower volatility compared to last year, it's maintaining its market share at a high level, 11.8%. And Boursorama, which has published its results last week, was able, let's say, to have a very satisfactory activity with a 29% increase in the number of orders executed and also 7,000 bank accounts opened in second quarter with now a total of almost 90,000 accounts as of end of June. Net banking income was down by 19% and gross operating income by minus 82%.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, I have to finish now with the CIB, as I've said already, net banking income excluding non-recurring item was almost at &#x2013; was at record level at almost &#x20AC;3 billion, up 57 compared to the second quarter and also up compared to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>This highlights a very strong commercial performance. Client revenues went up by 20% compared to both Q1 and Q2, and also a high level of trading revenues, which was stable compared to Q1 overall, while the value at risk went down by &#x20AC;6 million. So we have controlled our market risk. It is also highlighted by a reduction in stress test. Operating expenses went up by 19%, Q2/Q2 went up by 6%, H1/H1, and as I said at the beginning, we have also reduced our exposure at least by selling &#x20AC;3 billion of assets.</p>
          <p>If I move now to page 18 to comment a bit further on each set component of the CIB, starting with equity. There was a very strong performance for the quarter with the net banking income of 1 billion, up 28% compared to last year. The commercial revenues were up 12%. And what we've seen is that there was a rebound in flows in listed products, a slight slowdown in structured commercial business, a positive impact this quarter of hedges on client position, and Lyxor, as also we're seeing asset under management slightly increasing due to market rebound.</p>
          <p>So trading revenues went also up compared to both Q2 and Q1 with good performance across the business on both arbitrage and volatility trading. Our franchise was again recognized by some awards on Euromoney, on Risk Magazine and so on.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 19, on the fixed income, currency and commodities, the high level that we have achieved in first quarter was maintained, only minus 9% compared to Q1, with again a very solid commercial performance, which even if slightly down compared to Q1 is also the reflection of the tightening of spread, let's say, income of activities. But when we look at flow business, structured products in both fixed income and currency, we've seen an extremely satisfactory performance and we are, let's say, gaining market share as highlighted in the slide on the right hand side.</p>
          <p>On the trading revenues, we are continuing to benefit from good market condition and almost, let's say, half of the 1 billion trading is coming from treasury activities.</p>
          <p>If I now move to page 20, on the financing and advisory, that is also record quarter. Showing that on the structured finance business, we've seen some very satisfactory performance in both infrastructure, export finance, natural resources and acquisition finance, with, as you can see, almost double-digit growth everywhere. We've seen also, and it's logic, some contraction in leveraged finance and real estate financing.</p>
          <p>And last, but not least, in capital markets, Bousorama, let's say, debt and equity capital market franchise was able to confirm its strong positioning, which for the debt capital market is number three positioned for all new Euro bond issuance, number two for the sole corporate insurances, and on the equity primary market which has regained some momentum in Q2, we are able to rank number four on both equity and equity derivative issuances.</p>
          <p>So just to conclude now, I think this quarter show that the group performed strongly in most of its business. This is highlighted by on, first, the French Retail Banking, which has post a steady contribution of 1.2%, so while the economic environment is a contraction of the French GDP. This accounts for 25% of total revenues.</p>
          <p>We see also in the International Retail Banking, excluding Russia, a strong and satisfactory profitability. I mentioned the 29.1% post-tax return on equity, which account for 13% of group revenues. And last, but not least, revenues on the CIB, which were at record level, accounting for 40%, so all together 80% of the revenues which come from these three business lines was solid for the quarter.</p>
          <p>But that's not that, let's say, we have launched some realignment measures in businesses which are the most impacted by the crisis. And you've seen that, especially in Financial Services and in Russia, we have reduced our cost base and we would continue to do so to adapt to this current invest environment.</p>
          <p>In term of strategic partnership, we have decided, so we have confirmed the 75, 25% joint venture with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole in Asset Management, which aim to build a critical mass in this activity. And lastly, we have also continued to reduce overall our risks, as it is created not only by this &#x20AC;3 billion of disposal of asset at risk, but also the reduction that we've seen while running stress test.</p>
          <p>Lastly, let's say, the group has strengthened its financial structure with a Tier 1 ratio of 9.5%. So we believe that all that show that the group have some solid fundamentals, continue to realign its model to adapt, let's say, to the new banking industry and banking environment. And thanks to that, we can, let's say, promote profitability and face the future with confidence.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention and we are now ready for your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have a question from Mr. Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. The first question is regarding positive replacement value, say, declined materially in the second quarter. Could you just explain if there was anything else in market movement related to that?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding NPL coverage and doubtful claim coverage, which is slipping. At what level do you get uncomfortable about your level &#x2013; coverage level, and how should we expect doubtful claims moving forward &#x2013; going forward? When do you expect doubtful claims actually to peak? Can you talk a little bit about doubtful claims movement, and where you expect the peak levels to stand at what timeframe? And if you could discuss it a little bit by the different segments, that would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>And lastly, if you could talk about payback of the government preference capital, if you have any timing in mind and any idea how that could be done? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kian, on your first question, you mentioned own replacement value. What do you mean, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The positive replacement values in the balance sheet, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine, thank you. So on the balance sheet, yes, we've seen some 90 billion compared to end of last year, reduction of the net replacement value of the derivatives. This, I would say, is a mechanical, let's say, consequence of the spread tightening. And at some point, also, a slight increase also in interest rates. And so this had, of course, an impact on the, let's say, mark-to-market value of the swaps and other options and credit derivatives contract that we have and that we do carry in the balance sheet. So I would say, looking at spreads further tightening in July, this movement is likely to slightly continue on the balance sheet structure.</p>
          <p>In term of non-performing loans, so you're asking, yes, that overall we have a decrease up to 51% of the provision for doubtful loans, including on the portfolio-based provisioning. If we exclude the portfolio-based provisioning, we have 53. I would say this is a mixed picture, let's say, and we should more look on a divisional to divisional basis. Let's say, the coverage is in the region of 50% for the French Networks and we believe that at that level we are, let's say, comfortable looking at historical datas, with a non-performing loan ratio of 3.7% as of end of June. It is 20 bps up compared to end of March. We believe that there, there could be some slight increase further by end of this year.</p>
          <p>On the Retail Outside France, there, let's say, the picture would have to be even more sales on a country-by-country basis. But let's say, just to give you the NPL ratios and the coverage, excluding again portfolio-based provisioning as of end of June, NPL was 7.6% compared to 6.8% at the end of March and the coverage ratio was at 64, and, let's say, there were sole NPL, let's say, momentum should continue to grow, especially in Russia. Let's say, in Russia, we are in the region of 8 to 9% at Rosbank and clearly this ratio should continue to increase by end of this year.</p>
          <p>Financial Services, we were at 8.1% NPL as of end of June, coverage 50%, which is there also a figure which is relatively stable over time, when we look three years back, and so, let's say, this should remain stable in term of coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>And last, but not least, on the CIB side, we've seen, as I said, a slight deceleration of the entry of <mark type="inaudible" /> names during the quarter and the coverage ratio is at 60%. But I would say where we have most of the portfolio-based provisioning is, of course, in CIB first, Retail Outside France second, and I would say almost evenly in Financial Services and in French Networks. So what we can say is that, as I said, that plateau that we've seen in Q2 is, I would say, encouraging but we need to remain cautious as, I would say, the economical contraction is likely that it will be there and we know that development in NPL tends to lag economical recovery, and so we should have something like six months' lag before, let's say, the benefit of economical recovery, but then arrive at the stabilization of NPL.</p>
          <p>Lastly, your question on the payback on the pref shares, I would say that we look maybe in early 2010, having, let's say, again more view on the outlook on both economical environment as well as banking industry how to proceed, let's say, with this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just coming back on the NPLs, will you meet your coverage at the current level going forward, assuming NPLs deteriorate further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; well, the 60% region is something reasonable, but I had said it's an average of different characteristics. So it depends on the momentum. Let's say, we are likely to see a momentum that would be maybe slightly dynamic <mark type="inaudible" /> Retail Outside France compared to CIB, Retail in France, and Financial Services. So, maybe, let's say, the 61% at some point will stabilize at that level, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you see any deceleration/acceleration in International Retail country-by-country, in terms of change in NPL or doubtful claim formation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, this has to be, as you clearly mentioned, assessed on a case-by-case basis, but, let's say, clearly Russia is currently continuing to be up. Czech Republic, when we look at the trend over the last 12 months, no acceleration, something virtually regular. Same for Romania.</p>
          <p>And where, let's say, we've seen something which is relatively stable and not growing at all, but we mentioned that is on the Mediterranean <mark type="inaudible" />. We have a kind of stable level at this point in Morocco, in Egypt, so I cover most of five large &#x2013; five large subsidiaries that we have. So stable and consistently stable in Morocco and Egypt. No change of trend, no acceleration, no deterioration in Czech Republic and in Romania, and clearly, on the base of increasing in Rosbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, just on the &#x2013; you mentioned the deceleration of what's left in CIB, do you think that is a trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that when we look at the Q2 figures, what we can say is that the specialty provisioning that we passed this quarter. But two sectors were coming from that. Let's say, one was commercial real estate and there, I think we would have one in the US essentially. We would have to continue to be attentive to the development on that side. But the rest, on the LBOs and you have the dependencies. I think we have defined something at &#x20AC;50 million provisioning for the quarter, something which is not that huge and overall, let's say, the regulatory portfolio appears to be virtually resilient in this market environment at this stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Without, let's say, generical provisioning and litigation is something at this point which seems to be reasonable, but you can't value that quickly with one file. That how we can get into trouble, but we would have to assess that as an average over the trend.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Jean Francois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I have a small number of questions, starting maybe with private banking. I just use the detail, but I saw margins of about 128 basis points, up sharply. It's probably a record high, actually. I was just wondering whether there was any sort of one-off there.</p>
          <p>My second question is on your fixed trading activity. You mentioned during your presentation then, about half of that was due to treasury activities. I was just &#x2013; can you be a bit more specific? It is basically riding the yield curve and therefore if interest rates yield curve stay the way they are, this is something that actually should re-occur over the next few quarters, depending on what's your outlook obviously for the yield curve, but then we can take a view.</p>
          <p>And finally for the cost income in CIB, then it's a question of whether you look at it using underlying revenues or reported revenues. I was just trying to get a sense of where you would expect your cost income ratio to be, were you not to have write-downs going forward, or any sort of noise around your underlying revenues? And then that would &#x2013; and that would be about it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I will let Michel P&#xE9;reti&#xE9; start with the last two questions. On the private banking, maybe, Jean Pierre, a quick word on the level of margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The level of margin on the private banking side, as Didier mentioned, is actually quite high at 120 basis points. We feel a more normative level should be between 110 and 115. We had relatively high revenues on the second quarter coming from our treasury activities, with one-off &#x2013; two one-offs, basically, which were on the positive side. We don't feel these one-offs are recurrent basically. And we can see our treasury revenues potentially being slightly lower starting on the third quarter, with the improvement of the environment. Hence the forecast that we give of margin between 110 and 115.</p>
          <p>This being said, aside of the treasury activities, we have seen in the private banking side a good improvement of the commissions versus the first quarter, with a good increase of the brokerage commission, as well as the commission on structured product, as clients are coming back to the market, and we expect that this trend will continue in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding fixed, as you've seen the trading revenues, they have been showing a strong performance in Q2, and we can say that roughly 45% of this is coming from treasury. And on the treasury side, it's coming from value type of activities, including of course the gapping, but not only the gapping.</p>
          <p>It is also trading curves in value currencies. What we can forecast is that the visibility of the market is still relatively good. And therefore, even if spreads have contracted, such as the OIS spread, which is now reaching a level which were seen previously to Lehman in September. We still think that we are confident that we will achieve a relatively strong performance on trading from the treasury side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now regarding the cost/income ratio, which is reaching pretty low level this quarter, our medium-term objective is still to maintain it below 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. Maybe one last one, if you allow me, on the exotic credit derivative portfolio, can you explain us a bit of the development there, and what we should expect going forward? It seems to be slightly volatile there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so on the exotic credit derivatives evolution in this quarter there was &#x2013; there were three major impacts. First one is on the RMBS side, where we had approximately &#x20AC;250 million negative in the second quarter. 60% of this minus 250 is coming from the bait-and-switch between the long cash prime and Alt-A position, which is hedged by EBIT, and I would say the evolution in term of underlying specimens of the prime and Alt-A that we have -- these derivatives faster than the EBIT during the quarter. So that hedge was not effectively working.</p>
          <p>And 40% of this 250, so approximately &#x20AC;100 million was linked to the fact that as we sold some assets during the quarter, with some positive contribution on CMB is slightly positive, but negative on the RMBS. And we have also taken into account the fact that when we're selling these assets during the quarter, the price that we get was the slightly below our mark. So this is the two adjustments that we made on the RMBS of approximately 250.</p>
          <p>On the second big part of the portfolio which are US CMBS, there the picture is a little bit more complicated, I would say, because overall let's say we have a nil impact on the P&amp;L. But in the exotic credit derivatives, you have minus 200, which is compensated by the fact that on the monoline side because we have a monoline, which is hedging this exposure, the tightening of the spreads which has linked to a lower mark-to-market, led us to a write back just in the month in term of provision on monoline for &#x20AC;200 million. So you can see that in the 145, you have on monoline positive, plus 200 was linked to the &#x2013; that exotic credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we have &#x20AC;75 million negative on the sale of these assets, and as I said essentially on the RMBS, and we have some hedges that have also created some volatility on the global portfolio for the remaining parts. So, when you make all that together, you have approximately 550, and which is linked just to CMBS, RMBS, and the sale that we have crystallized during the quarter, and the macro hedge that was due to a spread tightening having also a negative impact during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what's the outlook here? Is there any action that you intend to take to reduce this volatility, in terms of disposing your hedging, I don't know...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when you look at the portfolio, which you have the position which is described on the appendices on the slide 75, you can see that what we have done during the second quarter are two-folds. On one side, first, on the RMBS, we have now, let's say, following this &#x20AC;250 million adjustments lower by this business risk and also price, which are more in line with I would say price that we have seen on the market, and the position is neutral while we were long cash still at the beginning of March. So this should be having a lower of level of impact on P&amp;L going forward.</p>
          <p>On the CMBS side, you can see that voluntary we are long protection, and so this could cost us some money as the CMBS price have continued to tighten in July, but this is a voluntary decision because we believe that these spreads have actually widen. The collectivity of the position this mean that we will not only be exposed to spreads widening, but also to the fact that spreads widening will trigger some loss of efficiency of the protection that we have from monolines. And in that case, your better assets will be long protection when the movement stops than to be balanced, because in that case you will have <mark type="inaudible" /> protection at the worst moment. So we have a defensive position, we know that in a market rally it will cost us some money, but we prefer to be on that side. I should mention also that out of the &#x20AC;3 billion of asset disposal -- asset at risk disposal that we made during the second quarter, 2.2 billion was made on this portfolio and now the remaining notional advance is 4.7 billion. It was 6.6 -- something like that, as of end of March.</p>
          <p>So reduces size, we have on the NBI side, now a more even position. On the CMBS, we are voluntary long protection in this market environment, and that's how we manage a position going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The question relates to the capital requirement for the capital market activities. Is it fair to assume that if capital market risk has to triple in the coming few years, you could have solvency impact of about 60 or 70 basis points? And if that is correct, can you maybe tell us what would be the minimum level of core Tier 1 that you would be comfortable with? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Guillaume. Well, we're getting the discussion that our &#x2013; in place with regulators is the one where we are already communicated to see implementation of the incremental recharge, which is so linked with the counterparty risk on market position. That -- and you have the detail on page 33 of the appendices, you can see that whole market risk, not only <mark type="inaudible" />, but also counterparty risk and market activities. For the sole CIB, stands at 16 billion, as of end of June, and making some, I would say, assimilation we have more or less, we could see a kind of developments of this 16 billion, really much grow by two to three times.</p>
          <p>This is, as I said, what we've seen in the impact study, and so this will have an impact that you can mechanically calculate it. On top of that, we have to look at a further discussion which on the stress VaR and which also on the securitization, which could add further impact on the capital, and that's where we have to get in mind.</p>
          <p>Regarding the capital adequacy of the Group, we believe that we are well above our minimum level, around 7.3 core and 9.5 total Tier 1 ratio. We had in mind something in the region of 8% plus, I would say, for the total ratio. And so we can see that we have a certain capacity to absorb these change in regulation that are likely to take place not next year, but maybe 1st of Jan 2011 for certain of the new capital requirements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I've got three questions. So the first one is on the risk-weighted assets for the first time in the second quarter we've seen a reduction of nine billion, which is a positive. I am just wondering whether you can give us any idea of where we are going forward whether there is any more room for further decrease?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the equities business where we've seen very strong results one billion of revenues from 0.5 billion in the first quarter, and in particular I've seen a very strong increase in the activity with clients which has almost doubled quarter-on-quarter. So I am just wondering whether you see these sustainable going forward?</p>
          <p>And finally on the cost of risk we've seen a stabilization in most of the divisions with the exclusion of the Financial Services where the cost of risk was in the region of 300 basis points annualized. So, I am just wondering whether you can comment on this division where you see the cost of risk going forward for the Financial Services? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hi Alessandro. First, starting with the risk-weighted assets, we've seen -- so this -- there a very slight reduction in fact when you look at end of period in the first quarter. Total <mark type="inaudible" /> was minus two billion so lower than the minus nine that you've seen this quarter. As you can see detail-by-detail the bulk of that is coming from the CIB, essentially market risk, and this is reflecting the <mark type="inaudible" /> VaR went down consistently Q1 compared to Q4 and Q2 compared to Q1. I think that that valuable is extremely low, so we should not expect the VaR to continue to decline and looking at certain evolution of market parameters, not increasing position. We should more expect the VaR to be stable or slightly up. So, I think that at least from the market risk perspective, we should not expect a huge contraction of the risk-weighted assets going forward and more something on the upside.</p>
          <p>Regarding the equity revenue on account side I will let Michel answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the equity side the strong performance highlighted on the Q2 is coming on both a solid commercial performance, which is up 12%, and also -- and this is also coming from a normalization of market and a normalization of positions on the structured position we have with -- we had with clients. So overall the performance on the commercial side is mostly deriving from the flow business and the vanilla business and the ETF business, which has been quite strong during this quarter. And the structured business has still registered a decline between Q2 and Q2 '08 of something like 35%. What we could see is that I think on the recurring &#x2013; the recurring business is not may be as high it would not be as a high as what we have seen this quarter especially because traditionally second half is not a strong as first half. As is being said July has been pretty encouraging on all fronts, including equity. And what we are seeing for the first time is a resuming of the pipeline on the structured products. So, I would say that I am confident that may be we will not with this level but we will &#x2013; we could be quite close to this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your last question, Alessandro, on the cost of risk in the financial statistics, what we gave last quarter kind of stressed that scenario for that division, so which is kind of capped in the worst case, which was 250. Looking at the some deterioration that we've seen on the leasing segment especially, it could go up to 300 bps but this is extremely again in the kind of lasting recession as seen developed Europe where we have most of our exposure. So this gives you a kind of a cap after that between these 242 and this 300 we should see some further increase across the second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one, in your preannouncement of the results, you indicated that you expected the loan loss charge to be similar of our &#x2013; in the second quarter versus the first one and actually it came below, could you explain what was the reason for the delta in your expectations and what happened?</p>
          <p>Second question is regarding developments in Russia. It seems that the problems are related to the retail activities and it's a bit surprising perhaps, I mean, from the comments you've provided in the slide, could you explain a little bit more on what action you are taking and what is precisely the area of concern, is it car leasing, or car lending, is it a particular lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, if you could provide some color? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jean Pierre. Regarding your first let's say the statement that we made in July we were at this point based on estimated results for June and when you know that you have just three to four weeks with a lot of thing that could take place as we've seen in the recent years and months and quarters, you tend to be most on the safe side and on the aggressive side. So that's why and I would say the statement was region like that and I would say excluding the litigation and the portfolio based provisioning as I said, we're not that similar in terms of cost of which compared to what we see in Q1. I did not mention in my presentation, but for example, I would say we were able to increase the provisioning rate of lend back, post the deterioration that was made on the rating by both S&amp;P and Moody's late in July. So clearly after closing of the results.</p>
          <p>On your second question in Russia, regarding for the development of different segments, what we see in terms of cost risk is yes, an increase in the private individuals cost of risk is &#x2013; okay, this is a nature of the exposure that we have in Russia essentially leading to consumer finance, which is a book of cost exposure of which we announced on the financial strategy, but also of Rosbank, because we have the limited exposure to housing loans. So that you can see that the cost of risk is in the region of 900 bps in the West, North, and should be almost the same at Rosbank.</p>
          <p>On the middle markets where we have relatively limited exposure so with more comment on the -- I would say domestic sector corporate, which are not link to natural resources each we have we've seen yes some provisioning on the retail and real estate segments at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi everybody. I have just two or three quick clarifications please. Firstly, the trading part of your C&amp;IB revenues continues to be well above the historic norm. So, I just wondered which set of kind of macro developments do you see would cause that revenue to normalize and is it higher short term rate, is it flatter yield curve? What should we look for in terms of macro catalysts to see that come back to a more normalized level?</p>
          <p>And then a couple of question on credit, it sound like from previous comments that you are saying 97 basis points for International Retail ex-Russia, is it kind of run rate for the cost of risk, is that right?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is just on your IS 39 reclassified assets the 28.6 billion that's still like I think one of the larger groups of assets that's been reclassified in the peer group, what kind of credit risk do you see in that? Do you expect some of that come into NPLs and provisions going forward? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will answer the last two questions and then pass the first question to Michel. Regarding the 97, 95 basis points that I mentioned at International Retail Banking ex-Russia it's more observation that it was relatively stable Q4, Q1, Q2 is under production. So, I think that we are back to a normal after the 117 that we've seen -- 113 that we've seen because it was diversified on &#x2013; in Czech Republic. I would say looking at the trend it should gradually increase but again, it's not <mark type="inaudible" /> items, as some market participants were fearing. So I think this is more what I was willing to mention.</p>
          <p>Regarding the reclassified assets, so, the 28.6 billion you have on page 27. So the shadow P&amp;L I would say that we've seen in Q2. So, we've seen for those that would have seen their result booked in revenues plus &#x20AC;0.9 billion revenues. So that should have been there but on the net basis total it's minus 3.0 since the 1st of October 2008. I would say there at this point we have not seen a necessity to take some provision but we clearly cannot exclude that on that certain part of the portfolio for the rest of the year or by 2010. But again we said that what we have a classified was nevertheless assessed cautiously and we were seeing a strong and sharp deterioration we have kept them in trading essentially.</p>
          <p>Now, Michel, on the CIB trading performance and the sustainability of what could be the parameters that could adversely impact this trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's never any question to answer but it's true that we've been favorably -- it will be in an environment which is -- where we have registered contraction of credit spreads, a normalization of equity parameters, and a relatively strong visibility on rates and a stabilization of the volatility on FX and also on commodities. I think that for us -- what the thing which is important to remember is that we've been showing this strong trading revenues in an environment where we have a significant decline of our VaR in our stress test which means that we have reduced our overall risk exposure. And therefore looking forward what could be an issue for us Ifs think would be some more limited than in the past. And my feeling is that on the equity side the -- as I said earlier, and specifically on the trading side, we could see a recurring type of revenues of maybe 60-70 basis under what we are producing, each market becoming more difficult on the fixed income side maybe a bit more than that but no catastrophe hopefully because we've sharply reduced our exposure.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add a bit on what Michel said for example on the equity side it's arbitrage strategy that it will well high frequency or medium frequency which is just needs some normal level of volatility, but &#x2013; and not totally linked to interest rates or strong movements in fundamentals of market parameters. Next question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just two remaining questions on the French Retail Banking. We've seen in Q2 a clearly positive impact on reversal of the Basel provisioning in on the revenue line of &#x20AC;42 million I just wanted to know if you see that as one-off item or something that should last over the next quarter and so what do we have to expect on this point of view?</p>
          <p>Second question still on French Retail, we've seen a nice evolution of the individual customers interest margin in Q2 compared to Q1. I just wanted to know if it's an effect of the newer interest price decrease so far this year and if this positive impact will continue with a further decrease we've seen as of the first of August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brice. And on your second question, the answer is yes so clearly, and on the private individuals, the improvement that you've seen in the interest income is explained mainly by the decline in pricing on the <mark type="inaudible" /> and the whole regulated earnings and so we should have some further impact in H2. Having in mind that nevertheless this is more the impact that this movement is lagging the level as there is a decline in the market interest rates and so we just kind of catching up of what has been under pressure because of movement in market interest rates.</p>
          <p>And in your first question, you should see the reversal of asset of this quarter as a one-off. And we have &#x2013; and nevertheless when we come under this somewhat extreme debt that this quarter there was a slight adjustment on the model that we used to assess this provision which is the reflection of the fact that first of all, we've seen a stabilization of the outstanding due to our renewed strategy and also looking at the usage that the customer base is doing of pale horse now to get a loan, we've seen a lower <mark type="inaudible" /> usage, which has also triggered some reduction in the provisioning. So you should not expect that to take place further in Q3 or Q4. And so we'll come back to kind of more normal evolution of the provision of <mark type="inaudible" /> which is that when interest rates are going down normally we have to make an allowance in terms of provisioning and so we will &#x2013; you would have that to keep in mind.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Mrs. Ann Clear Hangan from Execution. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I am coming from Execution. Good afternoon. Four brief follow-up questions. The first one I'm sorry I didn't understand on Ambac has this is been dealt with in the second quarter? And then secondly, when you talked about equities, you mentioned normalization of losses on positions you had with the clients. I just wondered if you are willing to tell us how much this contributed on the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Then thirdly, at the beginning you basically said your underling net profit adjusting for a one-offs was 1.5 billion you see it as 1.5 billion in the second quarter and I just wonder adding back the 1.7 billion of one-offs you identified does it basically mean you only adjusted for tax, i.e., there is no -- you didn't pass on those negatives to the cost line or is it impact of actually not that simple as the 1.5 billion net?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, just on dividend accrual I assume in the first half you didn't accrue any dividend and I was just wondering going into the second half would you be -- I mean, obviously it's very early to say, but would you be looking at a 30, 40% payout ratio trying to get back to last year's level or is the priority to pay back the present shares before you go back to significant -- pay a dividend again? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. And regarding your question of Ambac, I think it what we increased in term of providing so as I said we've raised our provisioning rate on Ambac from 60 to 70% so we were at 49% end of December, went up to 60% for Ambac and MBIA end of March. And so now we have increased Ambac to 70%.</p>
          <p>Regarding the normalization of our position linked to current position, I would not disclose but it was a slight negative impact in Q1 and it was a positive impact in Q2, which reflect the fact that long-term volatility as well as dividend curve were in the right sense I would say so right direction which mean that we've seen long-term volatility going down and dividend curve going up, so this is part of the reversal of what we've seen as a negative -- huge negative in Q4 and the slight negative in Q1.</p>
          <p>On the distribution, on the dividend so now 301.5 billion net profit that I mentioned yes well this is a just mechanical calculation which mean that we have taken the 1.7 adjusted for the tax and have to just for '09. This is just too given you an idea, but I would say then if you believe that we have to adjust for further cost it is your choice.</p>
          <p>And last but not least on the dividend yes well the results is in fact slightly negative after taking into account the provisioning that we have to set aside for the subordinated debt and the TSS. So the dividend at this point has not been accrued in the Tier 1 calculation.</p>
          <p>Regarding the target that we have in mind I would say well we -- let's wait for what would be seen in the second half, but clearly throughout the payout let's say region of what we paid last year seems to be at this point reasonable. I think we would have to asses further when the dust would have settled what is the -- what are the new receivables in term of level of solvency, underlying profitability for the banking industry to adjust for the -- official target in term of payout, but let's say to bet on a mid 30 at this point is not illogical.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I just got two more questions I mean just first one is coming back on Rosbank could you let say explain what is your net goodwill following the capital increase and following the situation I mean we face now in terms of cost of risk I mean would you expect further impairments? Extensively regarding I mean goodwills we saw some of your competitors starting I mean to book some impairments of goodwill on leasing and other activities. Did you have any assessment of what could be booked at the end of the year?</p>
          <p>Second question is regarding SGAM-CAAM -- should we expect I mean any non-recurring impact on the P&amp;L on balance sheet I mean that going forward for H2? Please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean the new entity, I mean should we expect I mean some kind of non-recurring items to impact I mean the P&amp;L and the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the goodwill, starting with Russia we made the internal test as of end of June and the room of managed convertibles so we have not passed any further adjustment and the remaining goodwill on the Russian Retail Banking division Rosbank, Delta Credit and BSGV was as of end of June &#x20AC;774 million of goodwill on this &#x2013; on this cash flow generating unit.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on your question regarding CAAM-SGAM, yes, there will be something back in Q4. We will have a capital gain on one side, also a creation of goodwill because we will also enter into the new company. And there could be some, let's say write-offs of certain part of certain activities, but that will be extremely limited. For example, we could have some software or some type of that -- that will be written off, but in such a similar order, I would say, so that will be booked. In the fourth quarter, as always when we have -- I would say a major improvement in the corporate center; it was the same from the hedge in the first quarter of '08. Whether it answer your question, Eric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay can we have some idea of the impact, I mean, so far or is it too early to assess it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean in term of capital gain...?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Capital gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the capital gain is not the biggest question because on the front of that we will have goodwill. So the impact in term of Tier 1, which is more the way you look at it which will be on one side you have a plus on the other side you have a goodwill deduction is that it will be neutral may be slightly positive but no material impact on the Tier 1 position of the Group.</p>

I just want a have a little bit of flavor about how -- what has been the driver of the growth to your NPL for Russia but the NPLs are rising by 8.5% in Q2, can you give us a little bit of breakdown of what is the rest exactly by division.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and hi Maxence. So the NPL ratio in Russia, and so would be used as three entities, were 8.6% end of June for Rosbank compared to 7.4 end of March, so in term of ratio the outstanding being relatively stable to down it is a kind of 15% increase. At BSGV it went up from 3.5 end of March to 5.4 end of June, so then it states more kind of 50% increase almost., and at Delta Credit, it remain relatively low due to the nature of the business, and also the underwriting policy of that credit, so we are 0.7% of NPL. This was only to Russia; you were willing to get some further information, Maxence.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not updated that but I would say looking at the trends that we see in terms of usage of balance sheet and also the revenue to assets ratio, I think the trends are relatively similar, which mean that we continue to see an improvement on the flow side. On the trading side let's see clearly that adjustment for the EBITDA, and it better excel on the trading activities. But we are nevertheless as Michel was mentioning reduced position where the consequence the usage of balance sheet has been contracted compared to their peak and relatively stable year-to-date.</p>
          <p>And last but not least on the structured product as we have seen a kind of strategy ratio of the demand there were so dramatic change on the trends. So, clearly flow continues to be as a nice spot. On the trading we've seen no usage of further balance sheet and still an improvement on the risk reward because you've seen that revenues in both equity and fixed income has improved and on the structured products kind of stability.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of quick ones on the French Retail Bank. I mean first, just in terms of provisioning, it looks fairly stable Q2 on Q1 but I just wondered if can you give us some sort of background color whether there is any particular areas of stress that you were seeing within the business in Q2. I think in Q1 you were talking perhaps a little about some of the Alt-A sector related companies.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly on French Retail on the financial commissions number, are you seeing any signs of life coming through there? Is there any sort of change through the second quarter and running into July? Are we seeing sort of investors perhaps coming back a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Robin, regarding the provisioning levels so I just said which is relatively stable that sense to relative which is coming from middle market, I would say. The kind of stress that you were mentioning I think the stress will come from that segment, which mean that you could always have a reacceleration or an increase of delinquencies just because -- especially in summer time when the factories are not working that much, people continue to be to pay the employees, and it could be a drain on their cash positions. So we will have to see whether in September we &#x2013; there is no acceleration of that phenomenon. At some point there is no &#x2013; at this point there is no sign of that, but I will say this is always that segment which mostly sensitive and we can say that if -- even if French SMEs have been to face the stress situation that started last fall extremely well overall compared to what we have seen in other countries nevertheless the start to be little bit exhausted, so if it was to last we could see some further pain.</p>
          <p>Regarding your question on financial commissions, I would say the change of the trends could be two-fold on one side is that the more we go into the year the lower the base of comparison will be because market decline has started -- was extremely strong in H2 last year compared to H1. Secondly, in term of mix we could see a renewed in the life insurance side especially after the repricing of the regular things the deposit at took place 1st of August. This mean that having the leverage at 125 bps would be profiting from the savings from the French household, so it's likely to focus on the life insurance product. And so this could help, but still nevertheless products that will be essentially euro denominated contracts rather than unit-linked contract where arbitrage or risk aversion remains still relatively high.</p>

          <p>Hi, just a quick question on your monoline insurers exposure. I understand that the only part marked-to-market is that regarding the CDPC and then the others are marked to your stress test or marked-to-model. Could you comment on whether or not moving forward you plan to mark any of those to market, assuming that there are additional monoline insurers that do go bankrupt? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the valuation methodology on the monoline we have a certain part of the exposure which is marked-to-market, not only the CDPC, which is what we worries on the line of other replacement risk, where we clearly said that which is a replacement fees that we have essentially on the CMBS hedged by monolines in derivative credit portfolio part of the &#x2013; of our exposure. The rest I would say is a mixture of marked-to-model, marked-to-stress, but also with an add-on which is coming from the observation of market parameters to take into account which is a movement that you can see on the spreads for both corporates or index, for example. So we are at some point taking that into account not entirely but we are taking that into account and so this explain also why there is some liability in these different exposure.</p>
          <p>Then your point was if all monolines were to get bankrupt in that case we will migrate into a full marked-to-market world I would say you have to bear in mind that certain part of this exposure and you have that detail in the appendices that we produced on this asset at risk, have been reclassified in loans and receivable and so even if the exposure was to not to be efficient, we would have in that case valuation that will be more on the credit assessment rather on a marked-to-market assessment.</p>
