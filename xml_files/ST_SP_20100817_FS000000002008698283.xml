          <p>A warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening to SingTel's Earnings Conference Call for the Quarter Ended 30th June, 2010.</p>
          <p>My name is Yang Fong, and let me introduce panel members on the call; Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO, Singapore; Mr. Lim Chuan Poh, CEO, International; Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO, Optus; Ms. Jeann Low, Group CFO. They are also assisted by other members of the management team from both Singapore and Australia.</p>
          <p>Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Yang Fong. And thank you all for joining us today.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you some quick highlights from &#x2013; for this quarter's results. Group revenues were up 12%. Both Singapore and Australia operations continued their growth momentum. That's also helped by the stronger Australian dollar for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Contributions from the Regional Mobile Associates declined 16%. A large part of that is due to swings in the foreign currency, gains, losses on the underlying liabilities at the Associates and we can talk a bit more about that later. And as a result, Group net profit was stable.</p>
          <p>Singapore revenues were up 10% and that's on strong growth in IT and engineering and in mobile. EBITDA, up 2% to S$591 million. That reflects continued investments in key strategic initiatives; in particular, customer acquisition, mio TV content, and rollout. And Australia, we've got another set of very strong results. Revenues up 3% and that's driven by continued strong performance in mobile. EBITDA was up 10%. We have margin improvements across all three business segments.</p>
          <p>And at the associates level, we've seen another quarter of very strong customer growth. We now have 351 million mobile customers. Earnings from the Regional Mobile Associates, however, declined 16%, lower operating profits from Bharti, Telkomsel and Globe, and also &#x2013; and the impact of fair value gains recorded in &#x2013; losses compared to gains that we had in the corresponding quarter last year.</p>
          <p>And if I can just elaborate a bit further on the contributions for the Group. Overseas operations contributed 73% of proportionate EBITDA. And during the quarter, we also marked the world premiere of the highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. SingTel, Optus,</p>
          <p>AIS, Globe and Telkomsel were the first to launch the phones in their respective markets.</p>
          <p>So maybe I will stop here and we'll take Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ma'am. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. First question, we have Mr. Ian Martin [RBS Equities (Australia) Ltd.].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Look a note &#x2013; more a clarification I guess. Can you comment on the subscriber acquisition costs in Singapore? The rate of growth there, it just seems extraordinary, 20%, S$370. When you look at Australia, the SAC cost is much lower and flattening off. And I was just curious why we're getting one trend in Australia and a significantly different number. Obviously, they're not exactly like-for-like. But why is it that the Australian cost is much lower and flatter and you've got this very different trend and very different outcome in Singapore on mobile subscriber acquisition cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take this question. This is Jeann, the Group CFO. The way we've disclosed it in Singapore, the subscriber acquisition costs, these are the postpaid customer basis. And the way it is disclosed in Australia is on a blended basis, which is postpaid and prepaid, and that is consistent with the industry practice in the respective countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this &#x2013; but why is the trend so much different, the growth rate in Singapore being so high compared to the same &#x2013; in effect, the same drivers in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in our two markets, we compete on the basis of what's happening in the respective markets. I think in Singapore case, the growth trend reflects basically the higher percentage of smartphones that are being connected to the network. We don't reveal the actual number, but in Q1 this year, the percentage of new installations and recontracts that were smartphones was in excess of 50%. And that's a step-change from what it was one year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And any idea where it might pop up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Benefits of these &#x2013; you can see the benefits on retail customers. If you look at just our postpaid ARPU, it has increased $5 year-on-year. If you look at the ARPU we get from smartphone customer, it's significantly higher than one that's on the normal featured phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Navin Killa from Morgan Stanley.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot for the conference call. I actually have three questions. The first was just to get a bit of sense on your IPTV strategy in Singapore. Now that BPL launch is underway, it's good to see that you've started disclosing revenue numbers there. But what kind of targets or specific approach that you have got growing that business? Because one of the things that we did noticed in the StarHub results was that they have not yet started seeing any meaningful customer disconnections. So how do you see that playing out?</p>
          <p>Second on the Bharti contribution, we notice that the operating numbers excluding the forex impact is also down 5% year-on-year, which I understand is a little bit different at least from what Bharti reported overnight. So if you could throw some lights on that too. And then lastly, again, back in Singapore, NBN rollout, it seems like its gathering pace based on the revenue number that you're reporting. So can you shed a little bit more on how that impacts both your near-term as well as longer-term business performance in Singapore? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen, do you want to take the first and third question; and then the</p>
          <p>Bharti issue, maybe Jean you want to cover that off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of our IPTV strategy in Singapore and what are some of our targets or approach. I think let me start by saying that IPTV is a service that we've introduced onto our existing fixed telephone network. Basically, it is something where we look at a new source of revenue for us and we've been investing in it for the last three years. We know that with BPL, we will not just get significant increase in our customer base, which today is 28% of the market, but we will also see a lift in our revenue per subscriber with BPL as well. So I think we are continuing to push our pay TV service very aggressively. It's part of our overall strategy to transform ourselves from being just a telco to a multimedia player.</p>
          <p>Pay TV is essential also as we move into NBN, because one of the core applications that we will be using on the 100 meg fibre that they'll be getting at the end of this year is not just high speed internet access, it's TV as well. So I think this is something that you'll continue to see us placing more and more emphasis and you'll see IPTV revenue continuing to increase, actually bringing on more and more customers who are focused on our sports packages.</p>
          <p>In terms of NBN, I think as you can see that in this quarter we have got some significant revenues from rolling out the fibre as part of the fixed or passive network of NBN. When NBN starts to get launched towards the end of this year and there are commercial services for consumer and business customers, you'll start to see us get revenue from NBN services firstly in terms of higher speeds that we'll be selling to our customers.</p>
          <p>There'll be also a few other interesting services that we'll be providing in the multimedia area for consumers, and also in the business area related to software-as-a-service. So I won't talk too much more about this at this stage, but you will see in subsequent quarters, probably starting from our fourth quarter onwards, that we will be moving beyond just providing higher speed fibre services but other services that will use fibre as sources of revenue for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Navin, you also had a question about the reconciliation to Bharti's results. I do have a fair amount of data on hand from my finance colleagues. Let me come back to you later on the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Luis Hilado, over to you.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call and congrats on the results. I have three questions; one on Singapore, one on Australia and one on the performance management awards. Just a follow-up I guess on mio TV. Now with the BPL content enhancements, what's your outlook in terms of mio TV breaking even on EBITDA in &#x2013; as a standalone business? And second question on Optus, I saw the note on the Partner Connect portal. I just wanted some more color on what the revenue generation model is for that and whether Singapore will also implement a similar model?</p>
          <p>And last question is on the upgrade in the management performance award to economic profit targets. Could you give us more color in terms of perhaps whether the targets are annual, cumulative and what the implied trend in ROIC is for those targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the mio TV question, regarding what is the impact of BPL on our breakeven for mio TV standalone. Let me answer the question in three parts. I think firstly, mio TV is a new growth business for the Singapore business. It's something that we never had and &#x2013; three years ago. It is a new business. We would normally take a longer-term perspective. We don't provide details as to what is the breakeven point for our different services. So mio TV is no different. I just want to make sure that investors and analysts are aware that for us when we look at mio TV, we have a longer-term horizon.</p>
          <p>The second is, one thing about mio TV is that, while we look at the breakeven on an individual service or product perspective, the more important is to look at what is the impact on mio TV in terms of our ability to get into overall consumer customer spends. And when we look at that product, we look at its profitability not just standalone but also its profitability in terms of our overall consumer segment and consumer revenue. So I think that's the other thing that I think we need to factor in there. The impact on mio TV is not just on that product. It has a flow-on impact on mobile. It also has a flow-on impact on the broadband internet access.</p>
          <p>And finally, mio TV is an instrumental part of what we will be delivering on fibre. So there will be a flow-on effect of mio TV on SingTel's traction as we roll out NBN as well. So if you don't have a TV product that entertains and informs, you will not be able to open the doors and get into homes to sell a fibre product.</p>
          <p>So from those three perspectives, I think you can see that the value that mio TV brings to us is looked at in three different frames by SingTel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Paul here. I'll follow on the partner portal and talk briefly about the strategy we have.</p>
          <p>We think that the user maps across all the different platforms, Android and all the other different operating systems, will be increasingly important. So we've been working to develop what we call a service delivery platform, and that allows any developer to work with all of our different systems. It allows us to be confident that, provided they meet our specs and our standards, that we can support it to our customer base. And very importantly, it allows us to use our billing system to charge the customer for the actual application.</p>
          <p>We've talked generally about our rev-share model, and we've talked about it roughly being a</p>
          <p>70/30 split, whereby we look to participate in the application revenue as driven. But obviously, it will depend on the specifics of each application and the specifics of what it does for the customer and how it works.</p>
          <p>It's early days in terms of development, but we do believe you will see a lot more disclosure and a lot more activity from us over the next couple of years as we develop more and more of these apps.</p>
          <p>Allen and I work very closely on a joint approach to all these areas, and you'll see a consistency in the way we aim to operate across our businesses. Hopefully, that's given you some color and light.</p>
          <p>I should add that we have just restructured or announced a restructure within the Australian business to create the Optus Digital Media Group, and it's a classic example of one of the areas that they will be focusing on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeann here. On the senior management awards, on the economic profit, the vesting of the senior management award from this year is actually conditional on, of course one, the general award vesting, and two, on SingTel achieving cumulative economic profit targets over a three-year performance period.</p>
          <p>So for this financial year, it will be basically from 1 April, 2010 to 31 March, 2013. That is the performance period that we will measure.</p>
          <p>And economic profit, as we have disclosed in our Annual Report, is measured as profit net of tax, but after deducting the costs of invested capital. And as we have indicated before, we felt that the cumulative economic profit measure is actually a refinement over the ROIC target, because it has got all the characteristics of the ROIC metrics, but it also is more comprehensive in that it takes into account the cost of capital. So one of the benefits is that it does not discourage investments or divestments that can generate returns that is above our cost of capital, and thereby, increasing shareholders' value.</p>
          <p>In terms of disclosure of the targets, we don't disclose the targets for the economic profit because of &#x2013; because they are commercially sensitive. It is however presented before the Board, and the Board ensures that the economic profit targets are aligned with shareholders' interest. And we do have a compensation committee, which is a subset of the Board that oversees that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next, we have Foong Choong Chen, BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. Just two questions for Allen on Singapore.</p>
          <p>Quarter-on-quarter, the postpaid ARPU growth was very strong. So how much was it due to uplift from smartphones that took up data plans? And could you also review the number of smartphones with data plans on your network at the moment?</p>
          <p>And second question is with regards to the prepaid mobile side, I understand that you guys deactivated quite a bit of the inactive customers. But for prepaid revenues, what was the change quarter-on-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Choong Chen, firstly on the mobile ARPU, I think the mobile ARPU increase quarter-on-quarter was due to additional roaming that we got in Q1 compared to Q4, and also some uplift in terms of people who are using &#x2013; signing on more to our data plans and increasing the ARPU. So it's a mixture of two things. One is usage and one is data.</p>
          <p>We don't disclose the number of smartphones in our network, other than the comments I made earlier this morning. So I can't share more details than that.</p>
          <p>In terms of prepaid mobile, you've seen that ARPU is basically flat. That compares with our competitors, which are declining ARPU. We don't split up our mobile prepaid revenue separately from our postpaid. So I can't give you the details as to whether that revenue of prepaid is increasing or decreasing. But you can see...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen, just one follow-up question. On a year-on-year basis, is the uplift on the ARPU side is significant from the smartphone data plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If &#x2013; the ARPU uplift that you see in our MD&amp;A actually takes into consideration voice and data SIMs plus data SIMs.</p>
          <p>So you know the ARPU from our data SIMs is much lower than our voice SIMs. So the overall increase that you see reflects a little bit of dilution because of the data SIMs. If you take out the data SIMs, the growth of our voice &#x2013; customers who are voice and data is significantly higher. It's more like...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Largely driven by data plans or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Largely driven by people who are on our voice plan taking on data products. There's also a little bit of usage increase that we are seeing, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin Gupta, Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I've got a few questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Paul, congratulations on the Optus Mobile results. But as you've seen, Telstra's just had their result as well, and David Thodey was pretty explicit that he's not happy that you're winning mobile revenue share and they're definitely been looking to react. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how do you intend to defend market share or defend revenue share if Telstra starts reacting for the rest of this year? That's number one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Allen, just back on the mio TV stuff, your net adds look quite strong. StarHub had pretty much flat pay TV adds. I'm just wondering, where are these customers coming from? Are they entirely new customers or there is a bit of an overlap with the StarHub customers as well?</p>
          <p>And lastly, maybe Sock Koong I think, you have been increasing your stakes in Bharti in particular recently. Obviously some of the other associates are facing some operational challenges. I'm just wondering, any thoughts or any plans to divest any of these stakes over time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Sachin, this is Paul here. Thanks for the question.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I guess I'm always quite pleased when we pop up on our competitors' radar, so it's always a compliment to be seen to be making inroads.</p>
          <p>We do take Telstra very seriously indeed. It's a very large company, and it has huge resources, and it's certainly clear from the comments they made this morning that they do see themselves being very aggressive and very competitive over the next 6 to 12 months. So clearly that's going to have an impact in the market.</p>
          <p>I just would bring you back to the core of the strategies we're executing. First of all, a real focus from us on improving both our footprint and our quality on the mobile network. We've now expanded to 97%, and we are continuing to expand our population coverage toward 98.</p>
          <p>We bought additional spectrum in the 8 capital cities, which effectively doubled our 3D spectrum from Qualcomm. We've also just announced the acquisition of spectrum for over a 1,000 regional sites, which will give us significant extra headroom in regional areas. We are working quite hard as well to make sure that we capitalize on that expansion with new distribution and new activity in regional areas.</p>
          <p>I think the other point I would make is that it will certainly be competitive moving forward, but we're coming from different angles in this market. Telstra's traditionally been a strong incumbent in the mobile area. It has charged premium rates and high prices. And as they look to become more aggressive, I expect we'll see them having to reprice and having to change the nature of their tariffs. And I expect that will have some impact on their revenue share, and that in turn may act, to some extent, to limit how aggressive they will be.</p>
          <p>But then I would overall say we can all expect a very aggressive and competitive 12 months ahead of us, and we're certainly ready and willing to participate in that, and to take our role.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, with regards to mio TV, our mio TV right now is renowned for its sports package and also for our English TV series package, whether it's Sony Entertainment or it's our TV series that you can buy on video-on-demand basis.</p>
          <p>A lot of the customers &#x2013; they're coming across in Q1. A fair mix of them are new, primarily because with our sports pricing, you just pay $23 or $25, there is no basic fee. So there are some people who did not take up pay TV in the past who are now taking it up because it's that much less expensive, to put it that way, to get it.</p>
          <p>And we're also seeing a fair number of people who are probably dual box. They have two set-top boxes. When we go and do the installation, we can see that very clearly. So I can't give you the details of the mix. But I guess the short answer to your question is that we are getting a fair percentage of both categories, new as well as from StarHub</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Chuan Poh, on your question on divestments. As you know that SingTel is a long-term strategic investor. We constantly review our portfolio. That can then help us enhance our shareholders' value. We don't just look at it from the divestment perspective, we also look at up staking, and in some cases, where the market calls for, we are looking at consolidation. So all these are options that we constantly look at in our portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for that. But can I just follow up with Paul again?</p>
          <p>Paul, I understand obviously the mobile network coverage is all on par or close to on par anyway. But the difference previously was Telstra was able to spend &#x2013; was willing to spend a lot more on the cost or their subsidies to get the customers, which Optus wasn't willing to match. Has there been a change in approach or are you &#x2013; I mean could you approach that differently in the coming 12 months?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we obviously have to wait and see how the market develops, Sachin. But what I would say is that looking at the guidance that's been issued, and really looking at in a very preliminary way, I've only seen the headlines. But I do sense Telstra are signaling that they do intend to spend a lot more in the market over the next 12 months. So we are certainly of the view that it will be a more competitive market and more aggressive. But we'll have to wait and see how exactly they execute that before I can comment with any sort of detail as to how we will react and what we will do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. I just have a few quick questions relating to Singapore, Australia and also on Bharti.</p>
          <p>For Singapore, the mobile penetration is 140%. How much more room do you think there is for subscriber growth? The second thing is, how are smartphone &#x2013; sorry, how are customer acquisition costs treated for Singapore given that &#x2013; I'm wondering do you amortize it or do you write-off right at the start?</p>
          <p>For Optus, margins are down quarter-on-quarter, and you're looking forward to an aggressive and competitive 12 months. Where do you see margins heading?</p>
          <p>And lastly for Bharti, they just completed the acquisition of Africa and they've got holdings in Sri Lanka. What value does these holdings add to SingTel? I'm just trying to understand.</p>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the easy question first. The subscriber acquisition costs, mobile acquisitions costs, our company policy is that we expense it at the point of acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to mobile penetration in Singapore and the room for growth, I think when you look at the mobile penetration numbers there; I think the 140%, that reflects both postpaid and prepaid. And you know that in Singapore a large percentage of the prepaid market is actually foreign workers that come in and go. I think in terms of ability to penetrate further, I think we are always very minded that the data includes a fair amount of transient workers. I think at the end of the day, this number will be something that will continue to increase.</p>
          <p>I think the local population as well as permanent residents are also expected to increase, so</p>
          <p>I would think definitely from that perspective there is some opportunity there. But I think the bigger opportunity for us in SingTel is not just on pure penetration on mobile. It's more on increasing the ARPU, getting the higher value customers &#x2013; getting the higher value business customers, and retaining those that we already have, plus of course getting people to use their mobiles for more than just communications and to get them to use the mobile for information and entertainment, which then drives additional ARPU for us, not only from data usage, but more importantly more increasing those service days, to drive ARPU from them by selling applications to them that they can use on the mobile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, its Paul here picking up on the question on the mobile margin. Actually, I think it's important to distinguish between the impact of seasonality and our underlying trading performance. Traditionally Q4 in Australia, that's the quarter before this, has a very high mobile margin, because our summer vacation is in the January period. And so the volume of handsets that are subsidized is traditionally quite low. So we always find our Q4 margins spikes each year.</p>
          <p>If you actually look at the EBITDA margins year-on-year for the equivalent quarter, it's actually gone up 1%, and that reflects the work we've been doing to acquire higher value customers and to bring on-board people who've got higher ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU in our postpaid business, if you exclude wireless broadband and look at our postpaid voice customers, what you see is that that's up nearly 6% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I'll pick up on the other part of your question and actually go back to Sachin's question, which is sort of trying to look at some of the increased competition that's being headlined by our competitor this morning. I think it's important to realize that there is a distinction between subscriber share and revenue share, and I'll be keen to understand which of those areas our competitor is saying they're going to focus on.</p>
          <p>There is a paradox in that the more that our competitor focuses on trying to protect or gain subscriber share, that will require repricing and rerating of that tariff which will actually have a significant impact on their revenue share. On the other hand, if they're looking to protect revenue share, then I would have thought that's going to have some impact in the short-term on their ability to maintain subscriber share.</p>
          <p>So there is quite a challenge for our competitor in deciding which way they want to operate on that. And I think it's important to look at their comments in that context. Nonetheless, we do think it will be a very competitive year ahead, and as I've signaled, we are more than ready to play our part so we have no illusions about the fact that it will be very, very competitive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions for me, apologies. Just on Optus, just Paul, are we starting to see a bit of a kind of structural recovery margin? We're still seeing service revenue growth and PCP of 11, 12%, but you're indicating that your mobile handset costs are down year-on-year. So is it kind of the start of the sort of margin extension that we can expect will continue in the next couple of quarters or is it just a quarterly impact?</p>
          <p>And the second thing is, on your ICT revenues in business and wholesale, maybe can you give a bit of color on this lumpiness in terms of this particular project sort of taking something like 30 million of revenue off in the quarter, but doesn't seem to have much of an impact at the EBITDA level, which is sort of still growing 6, 7%. So just a bit of color on that and if you expect that sort of lumpiness to continue into the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Laurent. I'm going to invite Murray to join in discussion on the</p>
          <p>first part of your question. But I'll point to looking at the operational EBITDA in absolute terms as well as looking at the percentage margins in the mobile business, where I talked earlier about us taking on the expense of acquiring high value smartphone customers, which does impact our percentage margins.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless you can now see the value of that strategy pulling through in the absolute EBITDA expansion. It's nearly 11% up year-on-year for the quarter and that's a very significant expansion in terms of the business. But Murray, would you like to talk a little bit more about the trends that underpin what's happening with our mobile margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks Paul. In relation to the question on the mobile margins, clearly</p>
          <p>as we've said in prior quarters, the mobile margins are a consequence not only of the unit</p>
          <p>subscriber acquisition, but also the volume of subscriber acquisition and subscriber retention. So in relation to the question on structural change, it really depends somewhat on the volumes of subscriber acquisition and retention activities in subsequent quarters. As Paul has indicated, you've seen us grow our selling costs this quarter at around 4% whereas our mobile service revenue growth is around 11% and that's &#x2013; as a consequence, you've seen some expansion in margins. Looking forward, we're reaffirming guidance today in relation to EBITDA growth at mid single digit levels and we believe we can deliver that in the marketplace as we see it today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pick up the second part of your question, Laurent, which is to talk about Optus Business. And yeah, your observations are quite perceptive. The impact of that large one-off payment last year was associated with one of our big customer wins and with the transition. And typically, those are fairly low margin payments; they're often associated with the facility changes and the hardware changes we've got to make as we bring a new customer online.</p>
          <p>You can see, if you look at our Optus Business and Wholesale area, the impact of our focus</p>
          <p>on-net, we changed our sales rules and our commissions in the business area and the wholesale area over the last two years to drive our people to sell more in areas where we have network and to keep away from customers who have a large off-net requirement. What you can see there is that in percentage terms the margin has gone from 23 to 26% year-on-year. And again, very pleasingly the absolute EBITDA has expanded quite significantly; it's 7% up year-on-year. And that's the pull through of the voice and data focus on-net becoming very visible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Paul maybe just a follow-up on the mobile side. You're obviously sort of investing in mobile coverage and sort of narrowing the gap with Telstra's. Does it provide an opportunity specifically in the corporate market in terms of wireless data services?</p>
          <p>Just wondering if you had some numbers in terms of what your share of the mobile corporate data &#x2013; corporate market is today, and if you can &#x2013; if you think on the back of this network expansion you think there's some upside to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, quite difficult at this stage, Laurent, to get a good handle on that. In fact, we've been poring through &#x2013; I've been poring through some of the disclosures this morning and trying to get a sense how the numbers break out segment wise. So all I can really do is talk qualitatively to it. But there's no doubt that &#x2013; and this goes to my earlier point on the paradox between subscriber growth and revenue share for our competitor &#x2013; our competitor traditionally charged a very high premium for wireless broadband. When we entered the market two years ago, it was not uncommon to see customers pay 80 to $90 for a gig of download; and today you know in Australia for $49 you're getting anywhere between five and seven gig in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So our sense is that we are making in-roads in that space, but it's &#x2013; I can't give you an authoritative market share number on it simply because of the lack of disclosure by all the competitors, and it would be based purely on estimates. In terms of our strategy moving forward, the decision to purchase additional spectrum, the fact that we're now doing a metro build for the first time in several years as well as expanding geographically, our work as well in expanding our backhaul from our sites, all of those are absolutely about making our network of a quality that allows us to make in-roads in the business markets as much as in the consumer markets. We will continue to focus on that. We'll just have to wait and see if we get a level of disclosure from all the carriers that allows us to go any deeper in terms of commentary on the segments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, thank you very much for the call. Just a few questions from me. Firstly, on Optus &#x2013; I'm sorry if I missed some portion, but it looks like your net add run rate has slowed for the last two quarters despite your having increased coverage. Can you please shed some light there in terms of what you think could be the trend and what's happening?</p>
          <p>My second question is on your investment recent 0.04% stake hike in Bharti. I'm just keen to understand, with the benefit of hindsight and investment that's worked so well, why you didn't make a bigger investment when you did decide to kind of take that call. And finally on Singapore, given where your margins are for the first quarter, would you say that your margin guidance for the full year has upside surprise because you're ramping up more slowly on mio and NBN than you expected? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul here. I'm not sure I'd call out that you've seen a major slowing in our acquisition levels. If you looked back over the last couple of years, we've regularly travelled at fairly strong levels. For FY09, our total net adds were about 650,000 overall. If you look at what we're saying we've done in the last 12 months, including that number we're saying it's a number of about 680. So we're pretty much in the same range we've been for a while. We've been travelling, over the last two years, between 180 to 230 or so net adds on the quarterly basis, and this is certainly well within that range.</p>
          <p>So on the contrary I would probably say if anything if you look at the revenue growth we're driving, which is now the highest in the industry and which based on the disclosures we've seen today</p>
          <p>shows us continuing to gain revenue market share, then I think what that shows is that we have good momentum in the market and we're leading the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up on your postpaid net adds which are declining. Do you see that trend changing? And on your prepaid ARPU, we have seen a bit of slippage for two quarters now. Any chance of a reversal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to pull out where you're getting the view on the postpaid net adds in terms of &#x2013; yes, because if I look at my numbers here. I just want to clarify with IR, do we disclose, have we disclosed postpaid net adds? Apparently we have. Okay, all right. If I look over the last couple of years on that, what you can see is over time we've travelled generally in the range of, if I go back to '09, around about anywhere between 120 and 100,000 in that year. Last year we travelled in the region of 139 through to around about 160. This quarter we're reporting 139. So we're travelling very consistently in the range in which we've been reporting over the last</p>
          <p>couple of years. So I'm not quite sure what's giving you that perception.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a decline from 164 back to 139, so are you losing momentum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I think if you look at the 164, it's the December quarter, which is</p>
          <p>supported by the Christmas trading period. And then if you look at the most recent quarter, the June quarter, at 139, there was some slowing at the backend of that quarter, as Apple announced the iPhone 4 launch. But the pleasing thing is we've seen uptake and consistent performance against the prior quarters around the 140 mark. So we're not seeing any substantive slowing in relation to postpaid customer growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, if you look at the Q1 on Q1 year-on-year, it's actually pretty much bang on with where it was. So yes, so postpaid net adds in Q1 last year were 139 and this year they're 139. So we're very much consistent with where we've been in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>And to Murray's point, the fact that the iPhone launch shifted from June into July this year actually had the impact for a couple of weeks of the market of slowing down acquisitions. So I think we take the view that our numbers are pretty consistent with where we've been.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's not our intention to disturb the share price, and</p>
          <p>therefore the on-market orders have to be executed in a way that don't cause any share spike, which is why we always would only account for a reasonable amount of the market volume.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In regard to your third question about the margin guidance for Singapore and</p>
          <p>whether there's any upside, I think basically, Q1, our EBITDA margins were at 38.2% for the overall Singapore business. Margin guidance is 35%.</p>
          <p>There are some significant initiatives that we have in mind, especially with NBN coming up. I think one other big cost item that you don't see there and will start to see in subsequent quarters will be our content costs for BPL.</p>
          <p>So we still affirm our guidance on 35% and I don't want to give further information regarding that because obviously I don't want my competitors to know what we have up our sleeves with things like NBN coming up. We've got a whole bunch of other smartphones that are going to get launched in the year as well.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as you rightly point out in the MDA, we're disclosing in relation to prepaid ARPU some decline.</p>
          <p>The prepaid market is characterized by intense competition in the marketplace over the last few quarters. And also a lot of the carriers, including ourselves, farming their prepaid base into postpaid, so looking at the higher value customers and ensuring we get greater certainty with regards to tenure and moving and migrating them over into the postpaid customer base. And as a consequence, that has seen some declines in relation to pre-paid ARPUs in our base.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon guys. A lot of the questions regarding Optus have been asked. I just wanted to ask just one further question.</p>
          <p>Just obviously depending what happens on the election on 21st of August, but assuming that we do get some sort of change in regulatory pressure post that. Is there any thought process with a Labor win in terms of what you would do with regard to submitting regulatory reform documents about moving to average pricing as we go towards an NBN environment, or would you prefer to stick to de-average pricing through that interim period?</p>
          <p>The reason why I'm asking is that, you know, if you move to an average cost move, obviously that has some cost pressure at the same time as we've obviously got increased competitive pressures coming through, with obviously the Telstra announcement today, in terms of upping its competitive sort of like ante. So I don't know if you've got any thoughts on that? That would be great.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> . I think what you are saying is do you mean the Labor Government is returned and that the NBN will ultimately be based on average pricing methodologies, would we be willing ourselves to look at the possibility of an average priced approach to ULL? Is that what you were driving at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah as an interim solution, because clearly there'll be some interim pricing policies that are adopted. Then from your point would you be looking to advocate that or would you be looking to keep it at de-averaging basing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd argue very strongly for de-averaging because we have two different policy objectives that are associated with this. There's a policy objective around being able to have uniform pricing available for people in rural areas to give them same sort of opportunity that exists in metro. But separately there's a requirement and a desire to be able to create a level playing field for competition. And the two are in conflict in this case because of the way we're structured today.</p>
          <p>Effectively if you have an average priced model and it's applied across the marketplace then it really favors the incumbent who has a much lower unit cost in sales in metro areas. Net effect of that would be to provide them with a greater margin to spend against their competitors defending their turf in metro and to be able to recover that and to be able to put the rest of us at a disadvantage because we have to cross-subsidize into the regional area.</p>
          <p>So we've always argued very strongly to treat the two separately. If you want to have the same pricing or equivalent pricing in regional areas to urban areas then there needs to be some form of subsidy provided in the marketplace today. And in terms of providing a level playing field, one that the access prices reflect the reality of the cost structure for the competitor so that we're not disadvantaged in metro areas and we are able to access the ULL at the sort of proper economic or reflect what Telstra's economics are.</p>
          <p>That's very consistent with what we've argued over the last few years we are not all against uniform national pricing, we just want to make sure that the policy instruments are clearly understood and are implemented in a way that achieves two different goals that I've just outlined.</p>
