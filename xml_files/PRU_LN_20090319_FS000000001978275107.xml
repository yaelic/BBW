        <plist>
          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I recognize quite a few faces in the audience but for those of you who don't know me, I'm Harvey McGrath, Chairman of Prudential. And it's a pleasure to have you all here today to participate in this presentation and discussion of the Group's full year results for 2008, which as I think you will have seen from this morning's announcement are robust in performance terms and robust in capital terms. All in what can only be described as a seriously challenging environment.</p>
          <p>I'm going to hand over to Mark and Tidjane to take you through the detail of those results. But before I do, I wanted to say a few words about the other news item that you will have read this morning. We announced this morning that Mark will be stepping down in as Group Chief Executive effective September 30 of this year and that Tidjane will succeed him in that role.</p>
          <p>Mark has been with Prudential for some 25 years and he's had a pivotal role in the success of the Group for many of those years. His achievements many of you will be familiar with and it's a long list but I'd like to make mention of his role as the main architect, organizer and driver of our leading presence in Asia, a very significant contribution indeed. And over the last four years as Group CEO, his contribution in transforming the Group's operating performance, the Group's financial strength, and indeed it has to be said, the level of respect that I think the Group has now held in by our stake holders. Over the same period and significantly, Mark has build a really impressive world-class leadership team and that obviously has enabled us to deal with his succession very effectively and very smoothly, on a basis that ensures continuity on the essentials of our program and our strategy.</p>
          <p>Some numbers, during Mark's tenure as CEO, our compound annual growth rate in EEV has been some 21% and on an IFRS basis 14%. And as you know, we now derive more than 65% of our earnings internationally. The PRU is a very different, much stronger and more resilient Group than the one that Mark inherited when he took on the CEO position.</p>
          <p>Both the Board and I personally are truly sorry that Mark has decided to leave, but we accept and respect that decision, and thank him for ensuring such high quality succession. You are of course going to continue to both see and hear from Mark because he is not going anywhere until September 30 and he will remain, as you know, firmly in control until that day, and you will hear from him at interims in August.</p>
          <p>But as from October 1, Tidjane will become Group Chief Executive Officer. I know he is no stranger to all of you. I am personally very pleased and the Board is delighted to have such an obviously talented successor with proven experience of critical importance to all of the areas of the business in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Tidjane, you will recall, joined the Prudential in March 2008 from Aviva where he was an Executive Director and Chief Executive of Aviva Europe. He had worked for Aviva for six years in their core leadership team in roles including Group Development and Strategy Director. His professional career started with McKinsey. He spent time both in Paris and London from '86 to '94 serving insurance companies and banks and you will also be aware he was a cabinet minister in the C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire. Tidjane is truly a multi-faceted and a very highly talented individual and I look forward to working with him going forward.</p>
          <p>But today's focus isn't on succession, it's on the financial results that we've just reported and I'd like to now hand over to Mark and Tidjane, so that they can take you through the results presentation. There may well be questions about the succession issue. We'd be happy to deal with those after the presentation in the Q&amp;A, in the normal way. Thank you very much, and Mark over to you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Harvey and good morning. It's good to see such a full attendance in an insurance company results session. Just to let you know, that I think we do want you to be comfortable this morning, because this is going to be a long session. I think it's appropriately so I think given the markets are &#x2013; the thankful part of this is it's a long session from Tidjane and not from me, but there are an immense amount of slides that we intend to go through and take you through in some detail our financial position. And hopefully at the end of that there will only be one or two questions but I think let's wait and see.</p>
          <p>But before I go through the results what I would like to add a few words, to say that I have hugely enjoyed my career with Prudential to-date and my decision to step down was a personal one and was enormously hard. When I look at it even though I look incredibly young, I spent half my life with Prudential, which is not an insignificant amount of time. However, I do believe that what I set out to do when I came back in my role as Group Chief Executive, the focusing of the business on value drivers in the retirement space; the clarity and I think the compelling nature of the strategy; expanding our international operations; improving the quality of the business through selected disposals; building capital strength; delivering consistent growth across all the key markets, and most critically or most important to me, and I think to the Group of all, was putting a top quality management team in place.</p>
          <p>As you've seen from the results this morning, our strategy is demonstrating sustainability and our capital position is both, robust and resilient. Having a very strong management team in place and an excellent successor in Tidjane, means that there will be continuity and consistency in our outperformance going forward. I think it's important to feel this is as it seems an orderly managed transition and I think a consistency of a very powerful strategy.</p>
          <p>As Harvey said and as I have reminded my executive colleagues on a number of occasions this week, they haven't got rid of me yet. And I will be around until September and I don't &#x2013; it's not in my nature or my style to play a low profile back-office position. So I think we will continue to drive the business forward as we always have over the next six months.</p>
          <p>I think just to record, I think while I remain in a good mood my thanks to all of you. I'm going to read out what it says here now. In promoting a better understanding of our complex business and for times you are rather blunt but always clear encouragement. Thank you for that.</p>
          <p>Now I think on to the order for the day. I want to kick off this morning with a fairly short introduction before handing you to Tidjane to take you through a very detailed financial review. I'll then come back to give you my view on why we have been resilient in 2008, how we have continued to deliver on our strategy and the strength of the business model, I think looking in particular at the benefits of our approach to diversification. I'll then spend a little time giving you the outlook, our outlook for 2009. At the end of that as Harvey has said, we're happy to take questions and for that I'm joined by my colleagues on the front couple of rows here where we can answer your questions in as much detail as you would like and give you clearly as much time as you'd like for that.</p>
          <p>Let's get into the numbers. I think you can see that our results represent a very strong performance and importantly, both in absolute and relative terms in what we know has been an exceptionally challenging circumstances, in particular in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>On an embedded value basis, new business profit is ahead 8% and we've seen an increase in margins, up from 42 to 43%. And as I've said before many times, we have maintained our focus on pursuing profitable growth, not volume target. EEV operating profit has grown to almost 3 billion, including some additional gains on our in-force business. And I think it's important here that this shows that our past assumption bases are holding up well even in these dislocated markets.</p>
          <p>Proactive management of the in-force book, particularly in times of market downturn is clearly just as important as generating new business. Shareholders' funds increased slightly and our operating return on embedded value remained a very healthy 15%. Our IFRS operating profit also saw growth of 12%, and Tidjane will take you through these numbers in more detail later.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the very important subject of capital and cash, you can see that the estimated IGD surplus is 1.7 billion and that's as we reported in February. We reported also that this will increase by 800 or million &#x2013; 800 million or so on completion of the transfer of the agency back book business in Taiwan. And we expect by June, sometime in June, the completion of that transfer which will give a headline IGD figure of 2.5 billion. This is a very resilient and robust position and we believe is one of the strongest in the industry with a solvency ratio of around 240%.</p>
          <p>Through focused management actions, sensitivities to further falls in equity markets and interest rates are low and don't have a material impact. And our hedging as you've seen has been effective. Indeed we'll talk about over the next two or three hours, there are plenty of options for us to bolster this position further, should the need arise.</p>
          <p>As you'll see from Tidjane's presentation shortly, the Group has the ability to generate significant amounts of capital. In particular, he will discuss Free Surplus and cash both of which are absolutely key. In these very challenging times, we successfully hit our target of being operating cash flow positive at the holding company level in 2008. And as you'll also have seen, we've increased the final dividend by 5%. And that means that the full year dividend is up by 5% and is covered in line with our dividend policy 2.2 times by IFRS operating profit after-tax.</p>
          <p>The events of 2008 have put the balance sheets and capital positions of all insurance companies under close scrutiny. No one anticipated the full depth of the banking crisis or indeed a speed onset of recession in the western economies. Having said all of that we at Prudential entered the period in a relatively defensive position and we've maintained a regular set of operating principles throughout.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years, we've also we believe made a series of clear sighted decisions and proactively moved to improve our capital position. Let me remind you of some of these actions. In 2007 in the UK, after strategic review of the market, we exited our high capital strain and uneconomic product lines and put into place major and significant cost savings initiatives. Over the years, we have continued in the UK our prudent approach to both pricing and credit reserving.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., with our strongly held view that value is more important than volume we deliberately stood back from the very competitive and in our view uneconomic pricing in the VA market in the early part of 2008. In addition, our long established hedging program has been highly effective in these turbulent market. We've also taken a series of broader-based initiatives that have significantly improved the capital position of the Group.</p>
          <p>In mid-year after an exhaustive &#x2013; an exhausting review, we determined that in order to maintain a strong and robust life fund through the economic cycle it would not be in the best interest, long-term interest, of policyholders or shareholders to reattribute the inherited estate. We also identified further and very effective ways to generate more IGD capital. For example, we obtained FSA agreement to recognize a small element of the shareholders economic interest in the PAC with-profits fund.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our decisive action on Taiwan will significantly improve the Group's capital position and Free Surplus and will also reduce long-term risk for shareholders. We've also deliberately reduced shareholder equity exposure in Asia.</p>
          <p>As we previously stated, we did review the AIG assets in Asia and their capacity to create material, incremental shareholder value above our organic opportunities. After careful consideration we decided not to proceed with an offer for any of these assets. Our financial discipline and our view of value and price did not meet the criteria.</p>
          <p>All of these decisions and actions taken together have significantly improved the Group's capital position and the risk profile. And I think with all of that as an initial context, let me now hand you over to Tidjane.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I think that becoming a CFO of a life company in March 2008 has proven to be a really interesting decision. Like Mark, I may look young, but I can guarantee that internally I have aged significantly. They should have a special unit for CFO life years, but anyway carry on. I'm looking forward to the next stage, but in the meantime, I have to take you through exactly 39 slides, so brace yourselves.</p>
          <p>Let's get started. I have three key messages that I hope you'll take away from my presentation this morning. First, we have delivered a strong operating performance in 2008 whether measured in terms of EEV, IFRS or cash generation. Second, we have managed our capital and risks in a prudent, but proactive manner for 2008, not hesitating when necessary to take decisive action, for example, in Taiwan. Third, going forward we are focused on preserving capital and cash in 2009.</p>
          <p>What I would like to do now is first, present our performance on our key financial metrics in EEV and IFRS putting a particular emphasis on cash and on the development of Free Surplus, an important metric for us. I'll then talk about risk and capital management focusing on two issues that I know are on your mind, first our solvency, and second, our asset quality.</p>
          <p>Moving on we believe that the best way to run our business is to have a balanced approach and to keep an eye on EEV, IFRS and cash. So at the Group level, EEV operating profit has increased 17%, IFRS operating profit is up 12% and you can see at the bottom that holding company cash flow turned from a negative 82 in 2007 to a positive 54 in 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking in more detail at the EEV profit, we have had a 23% in our in-force profit to more than 1.6 billion in 2008. In-force profit, as we see it, of course is a key driver of cash flow and Free Surplus generation. I will return to this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>The largest component of in-force profits the Unwind in red here has increased to 1.2 billion in 2008, a 5% increase over 2007. This growth was driven primarily by Asia, Barry [Barry Stowe] and his team, which increased their profits by 28% to 434 million demonstrating the growing maturity and scale of the Asian in-force book.</p>
          <p>We have also had operating assumption changes for the year at positive 118. We have benefited here from a number of assumption changes in Asia, which underlines the quality of our embedded value there. The second 118 on the page and that's a coincidence reflects the benefit of portfolio rebalancing in the UK. I will come back to this in more detail later, and finally, 153 of other items which brings us to a total of 1.6.</p>
          <p>Moving on to new business, the 8% growth in new business profits we have achieved compared to 5% increase in APE sales, tangible evidence of our focus on value over volume which led to an increase in Group margin at the bottom of the page from 42 to 43%.</p>
          <p>Within this, Asia delivered a strong performance again with new business profit up 15% to 741 million. This was driven by an increase in both volume and margin with margins moving up from 50 to 54%, underlying the success of our increased focus on protection and health. More detail on the evolution of margin in Asia is in the -in your pack in Appendix 1.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Jackson, the evolution in Jackson's new business profit up 3% results from a 7% increase in volumes which was offset by a shift in product mix from higher margin variable annuities to lower margin fixed annuities, as you would expect at this point in the cycle. This led to a slight decline in margin from 42 to 41%.</p>
          <p>In the UK, the 1% fall in new business profit is the result of higher sales of our well performing With-Profit products, offset by a decline in annuity margins where we have had unsurprisingly to make a higher allowance for credit risk. Overall, margin fell slightly from 30 to 29%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the EEV balance sheet, shareholder funds increased by 2% in the year to just under 15 billion. This increase is explained by a combination of factors, positive elements shown in dark blue here and negative elements in light blue. Starting first with the positives. We have a strong operating performance at 2,961. We have a benefit of a mark-to-market of our own debt, for 656. We have positive tax changes and other items of 720, which include the tax credit on negative short-term fluctuations and finally, currency gains of 2,010.</p>
          <p>The negative items in light blue were the impact of market movements as reflected in negative short-term fluctuations of 5,127, changes in economic assumptions of 581, and a dividend Net of Scrip of 283. Looking more closely within the short-term fluctuations, they include 2.4 billion for the UK, of which the majority, 2.1, I believe, relates to the With-Profit fund, 1.3 billion for the U.S. and 1.1 billion for Asia. So to summarize on embedded value, we have increased the in-force profit by 23%, we have achieved an 8% increase in new business profits and have maintained stable shareholder funds in an exceptionally challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to IFRS. Our IFRS profits have increased 12% in '08 to 1,347. At the BU level, Asia Life contributed 132 million whilst Jackson saw a small decline of 38 million and the UK a slight increase of 21 million. Asia asset management experienced a decline of 20 million, mostly as a consequence of market volatility. And finally, M&amp;G, Mike [Michael McLintock] and his team deserve a special mention here. They had a truly excellent year, growing profits by 32 million against a difficult market background, thanks to their continued strong investment performance.</p>
          <p>Looking now more closely at our Life business in Asia, we have told you that we have an increased focus on IFRS going forward for a number of countries particularly in India as our business matures, we have reviewed the treatment of deferred acquisition costs. This led to a positive movement of 66 million in DAC and other reserving. In addition, underlying growth in profit was 49 million as the business continues to grow and develop. And lastly, foreign exchange movements helped and other items giving us a 17 million uplift in operating profits. Based on all these elements, IFRS operating profit has increased by 70% to 321 million, bringing closer the growth trajectories in Asia of EEV and IFRS operating profits.</p>
          <p>Moving on, you may recall from my half-year presentation in '08, that I'd shown a split of U.S. earnings by source. We have now extended that analysis to all our Life businesses. I have included the detail of those in your packs in Appendix 2. Fundamentally, we see our earnings coming from three sources. Insurance income, which is made from underwriting risks and managing claims, fee income where we receive a fee for managing assets, and spread income, where we make the difference between an earned and a credited rate.</p>
          <p>Shown here is the income split for Asia, where as you can see almost three quarters of our profit is derived from insurance margin showing the value of our writer sales alongside our unit-linked business and the successful development of our health business. Those earnings are perhaps less sensitive to market movements than you may have imagined and increase the persistency of our portfolio. This underlines the success of our accident and health strategy in the region. As a help here, I also providing some data on the IFRS new business strength for Asia. We have extended this analysis to a full year but for the sake of time, I will not present it, it is in your pack in the Appendix 3.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Jackson, you are well aware of the extraordinary movements we have seen in the U.S. in equity markets and in corporate spreads in 2008. Clark [Clark Manning] and his team in Jackson have managed well for this challenging period. Operating profits have decreased by 9%, a creditable performance if compared with the 38.5% decrease in the S&amp;P. This movement lets out losses from the decline in investment spread of 26 million offset by hedging gains of 57 million. Thanks to Jackson's effective hedging program. FX movements of 38 million and other items of 34 million to give an increase in operating profit up to 547 million after allowing for the acceleration in debt amortization, which we flagged and discussed at Q3. The total IFRS profit fell 406 million.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the UK, where IFRS profit increased by 12%, again a very good performance from the team there under Nick's [Nick Prettejohn] leadership. At Q4, we talked about the increase we have decided to make to our credit reserve during the year. You can see the effect of that coming through impacting profit negatively by 413 million as we strengthen the IFRS assumption from 20 basis points to 55 basis points. You probably have in mind the 80 basis points that we discussed at Q4. It is important to explain how we arrived at 55 basis points in IFRS. The 80 basis points were related to Pillar I. Pillar I is a very prudent reserving basis. For IFRS reporting excessive prudence is not appropriate. So historically the company's policy has been to set IFRS default assumptions around halfway between the expected default levels and it's 15 basis points for us and the Pillar I assumption is 80. So it's an average of 47.5 we set it at 55 so we've been even more conservative than what we've been historically.</p>
          <p>I mentioned earlier that I would give you more detail on our portfolio rebalancing. We have said that we would look to take advantage of the opportunities created by the current asset dislocation. We have a fundamental view that the increase in spreads we have observed is only partially linked to an increase in default risk. Therefore, in the UK, we have rebalanced our credit portfolio, in particular in the shareholder annuity fund. We came into 2008 significantly overweight guilds, with an average rating in the fund of double A against a benchmark of A. After rebalancing, the fund now has an average rating of A+ therefore remaining ahead of benchmark. The 390 million net benefit you see here is due to the change in yields as a result of this rebalancing, after allowing for credit risk.</p>
          <p>The GI commissions, which we received following the sale of our GI business in 2002, increased by 40 million. And finally, a number of our items amount to 44 million, bridging a gap from '07 to '08.</p>
          <p>Finally, final slide on IFRS, our shareholder funds have decreased by 17% to 5.058 billion. A number of items have had positive impacts here. Our operating profits of 1347, FX gains of 631, tax and other items of 155. These have been offset by the effects of negative market movements as reflected in negative short-term situations for 1783, which include defaults, losses on sales, and write-downs on our U.S. debt portfolio of 570. Another negative element is the net impact of unrealized losses at 1071 and the dividend Net Of Script for 283 which I previously described as a negative. The unrealized losses on the Jackson debt securities shown here are after associated DAC and tax. So to summarize again on IFRS, operating profit is up 12% with a strong contribution from Asia and M&amp;G and a resilient performance in the U.S. we are continuing to improve our disclosures and shareholder funds have decreased due to market situations.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to cash flow, and Free Surplus, I have a first graphic, which shows you the development of the holding company cash flow over the last four years. There are two key points about this slide. The first is that you can see from the dark blue bars in each year that over the period, cash remittances to the Group have more than doubled. This is really an important point for us from 417 million to 1.33 billion. Secondly, in 2008 we saw a marked increase in capital invested by the Group into the businesses. The main driver from this was Asia, where we needed to bolster solvency in the future returns.</p>
          <p>Overall, net cash for the Group grew to 515 million from almost zero in 2005. The overall net position for the Group was positive 54 million shown in red here, meeting the targets set in 2006. We have been able here to achieve one of our significant external commitments.</p>
          <p>Over the years, we have drawn your attention to Free Surplus and I know that some or many of you use it as a useful proxy for capital, so I would like to spend some time on Free Surplus now, for a few slides. You will be familiar with the mechanics of Free Surplus, which we have tried to summarize here. First, for generation of Free Surplus where we take our opening Free Surplus position, we add the expected profits generated from both, the in-force book and our asset management business, plus any capital that is released as policies mature.</p>
          <p>This underlying Free Surplus is then adjusted, at the bottom, for operating variances and assumption changes. This gives us our stock of Free Surplus, which we can of course apply to several uses. We use it to write new business, covering acquisition costs and required capital. We use it to remit cash to the Group and we use it to build reserves as a function of our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>I would like to underline that these uses of Free Surplus, new business, cash remittances, reserving, are fundamentally the result of management decisions. And finally, the Free Surplus can also be used to absorb the impact of market movements. So let us now look at how these various elements have impacted our Free Surplus in 2008.</p>
          <p>Here I have combined the life and asset management businesses to give a view of the sources and uses of Free Surplus in 2008. As explained in the previous slides, we started the year with a Free Surplus, with stock of Free Surplus, of 1,915. During the year, the business generated, and this is an important number, about 168 to 1, 680 billion bringing the total Free Surplus to 3,595. After allowing for market related items of 1,068, which are largely out of control &#x2013; out of our control- both are out of control, this left us with 2,527 of Free Surplus, which we then had a choice on how to utilize.</p>
          <p>We decided to invest 825 million in writing new business during the year. And in addition, we took the decision &#x2013; this is the decision, to increase the UK credit reserve by 770. This brings us to a Free Surplus before cash and other items of 932, so as you see there is, now at the top we showed you a decrease of 983 during the year and that's another important number, to &#x2013; from 1,915, the starting level.</p>
          <p>After allowing for 442 of Forex and other movements and the 515 that we saw in the previous slide, which was remitted to Group, this left us with a net Free Surplus of 859 retained within the business. The key conclusions we draw from this analysis our that operations generate significant levels of Free Surplus close to 1.7 billion in 2008 alone. And that overall in a tough year the Free Surplus was down 983 million but also as a result of a number of decisions we made.</p>
          <p>So I would like now to look at this evolution after 2008 over a number of years because it is interesting. You can see from the first set of bars the strong growth from the in-force and asset management profits from 992 in 2005, to 1744 in 2008. Next to that, you can see the impact of operating assumption changes and experience variances and the key point here is that they are small, followed by the underlying Free Surplus generated shown in red here, like in the previous slide. This has grown over the last four years as you can see, 1680, which is the number you recognize from the previous slide.</p>
          <p>The amount we invested in new business in 2008, is 825 grew quite significantly from 544 in 2007, which is due to product mix as we increased sales of U.S. fixed liabilities and shareholder backed books in the UK. The light blue shows the significant negative impact the dislocated markets have had on our Free Surplus position in 2008. An additional feature of 2008 is the 770 million used to strengthen our credit reserve. This should be a one-off given that we have now provided for a Great Depression every year for remaining life of our portfolio of annuities in the UK.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in contrast to the preceding years, in 2008 we have seen a decline in our Free Surplus before net cash remitted to the Group and other items of 983 as I mentioned earlier. We expect the official variation to continue at a high level. And looking forward into 2009, we expect new business trend to return closer to levels seen in prior years on this analysis. And we will manage our appetite for books, individual annuities in the UK and fixed annuities and VIFs in the U.S. carefully. Given that our Free Surplus generation remains significant, we are confident that we are in a strong position to manage full volatility introduced by the current economic environment. But confidence stems in large part from the quality of our VIF. This chart shows the expected discounted, not undiscounted, discounted contribution from the in-force like book and the pattern of release of required capital as the in-force book matures on current assumptions. Some 45% of this is expected to monetize in the next five years.</p>
          <p>The average pay back period on an undiscounted basis is in Asia, the U.S., and the UK respectively four, five and six years. As we showed you in the previous slide, our track record for operating assumption changes and experience variances is good. We are therefore, highly confident that these cash flows will materialize.</p>
          <p>So to summarize on Free Surplus, our businesses generate a high level of Free Surplus close to &#xA3;1.7 billion in 2008. The investment we make in new business increased our VIF with attractive pay back periods. This gives us the ability to remit significant amounts of cash to Group, 515 million in '08. We believe that our VIF is of high quality and will provide &#x2013; will continue to provide strong cash flows over the next five years.</p>
          <p>Finally, just a final comment on this, all these numbers include Taiwan. It is worth noting that on completion of the transfer the Free Surplus will increase by about 1 billion. And you will find more information in Appendix 4 in your packs on Taiwan. So Free Surplus is a key underpin of our cash and capital generation and will continue to be a focus for us going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to risk and capital, at Q4 on February 20, we talked in some detail about our capital positions, so today I'd like to focus mostly on two areas, we'll address our solvency and then talk about our asset portfolio focusing in particular on credit risk and our debt securities.</p>
          <p>Looking at our solvency, there are two considerations for us, it's simple, it's the absolute level of surplus and its resilience or if you prefer its sensitivity. As of December 31, '08 we had a 9-digit surplus of 1.7 billion and a solvency ratio of 162% plus the Taiwan transfer the surplus will move to 2.5 billion a very strong solvency ratio of 240 or about 220 after allowing forward dividend. On the right here you can also see the sensitivities of our IGD position as at the end of '08; thanks to an active hedging strategy we have limited our sensitivity to equity market levels to 350 million or 40% fall in equities. We have also limited sensitivity to interest rate risk, 300 million for a 150 basis points fall in interest rates. And we have provided as an example here a sensitivity to 10 times expected credit default on our entire portfolio, which would be a sensitivity of 500 million for the Group. So, really if you think about it, the main exposure for IGD particularly after a transfer Taiwan will be credit risk, and I will come back to this in a few slides.</p>
          <p>On February 20 I gave a bridge in the IGD movement from Q3 to Q4, what I wanted to do here is, to bridge it for the year, which is more significant. So, during the course of the year, net earnings contributed &#xA3;800 million underlining the importance of profitable operations. The cost of a dividend paid during 2008 Net of Scrip was about 300 million, which is over two and a half times covered by earnings, an important consideration for us. An additional 600 million was generated by a large number of management actions taken during the year reflecting our prudent, but proactive stance. Offsetting this were 400 million of market related items, 800 million for the strengthening of our UK credit reserves, which we mentioned several times already and 600 or so for U.S. default impairments and write-downs.</p>
          <p>After allowing for FX of 200 million this gave us total estimated IGD position of 1.4, including the 300 million from a portion of a shareholders economic interest in future transfers for the UK With-Profit fund, for which we have obtained FSA recognition. This takes the IGD to 1.7 billion I mentioned earlier or 2.5 billion after allowing for Taiwan transfer. Therefore a strong IGD surplus at the end of a year, but so, very significant negative market movements. You have seen how we've been able to maintain a stable IGD position. I would like to remind you now of the options we have to manage our capital. Regarding available capital, as illustrated in the previous slide, we can rely on our earnings. We have the ability to access more of the shareholder economic interest in the With-Profit fund. We can also use financial reinsurance on other in-force books.</p>
          <p>We also manage actively our required capital for both the level and mix of new business and by maintaining our pricing discipline. We have employed and will continue to employ other risk mitigation strategies such as hedging.</p>
          <p>So after solvency, I'd like to talk in more detail now about our asset portfolio. There is a significant amount of disclosure in your packs, some of which is summarized here. This slide covers our total invested assets, which from the Group amounted to 193 billion, of which 31% or 61 billion relate to shareholders. Of this 61 billion outside the 45.9 billion for debt securities circled here and the 5.3 of commercial mortgage loans, the shareholder exposure is limited. So I would like to focus now on those two items, the commercial mortgage loans and the debt securities, where I will mostly talk about the U.S., which is 4.5 billion out of the 5.3.</p>
          <p>The total portfolio of 4.5 billion consists of commercial mortgage loans. The exposure is well diversified by property type as shown here and by geography, always important in the U.S., and its average loan size is &#xA3; 7.5 million, with no single-family occupancy. We have a strong underwriting discipline. We have an estimated average loan-to-value, LTV, of 73% as at December 31 '08. In 2008 we have had no foreclosures or restructuring and there have only been two defaults resulting in the loss since May 1995. Therefore, overall we believe that our exposure here is contained.</p>
          <p>I will now focus on our 45.9 billion of debt securities but before analyzing it in more detail for our key business units I would like to update you briefly on our exposure to banks and not only the Tier 1 hybrid debt, a topic that has generated much interest lately. Of our total shareholder debt portfolio, 12.9% is in respect of the banking industry. Our total Tier 1 exposure is 824 million, which is less than 2% of our debt securities portfolio. Of this 366, sorry I think I said 361 on February 26, 366 to correct that is in UK banks. The split by UK bank is shown at the bottom, and of which I gave you 160 for Barclays, Lloyds and RBS on February 20.</p>
          <p>Now turning to business units, of the shareholder debt portfolio 45.9, 17 billion is in the UK, 24 billion is in Jackson with the remainder in Asia and asset management. Looking first, at the UK, so 17 billion, this portfolio is high quality with 86% invested in assets rated A, or above. In addition and as you know, we have built a 1.4 billion credit reserve, this equates to 10% of the credit related assets, but in shareholder annuity business and you know what's coming after this, this reserve would allow the portfolio to absorb the repeat of a Great Depression occurring every year from the life of a portfolio. And is equivalent to defaults of 185 basis points per annum for three years which is more than 12 times the long-term expected defaults and 45 basis points per annum thereafter. Fundamentally, we believe credit risk in the UK is appropriately reserved with very little residual exposure in the in the IGD.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the U.S. portfolio, 24 billion which is made up of 16 billion of corporate bonds, 4 billion of RMBS, 2 billion for CMBS and 2 billion in other items and we'll cover these elements in turn later, but first I'd like to talk about the unrealized losses 3.2 billion at the end of 2008. You will remember about 1.3 billion of this occurred in Q4. I'd just like to remind everybody that out of that 1.3, 400 million is foreign exchange. As you can see on the chart, of the 3.2 billion, 2.2 relates to the corporate bond portfolio of which 82% at 1.8, is investment grade.</p>
          <p>As we have said before, we really believe here that the accounting does not represent the economic reality. We believe that our portfolio is of good quality and well managed. The actual default losses were 78 million for the year. We also experienced as you know 419 million of write-downs and 127 million on losses of &#x2013; on the sale of impaired bonds, but this is part of our active management of the portfolio and of managing down some of our exposures when we don't like them.</p>
          <p>If we were to apply the highest level of default that we have seen in a recession, with a conservative level of recoveries to this portfolio, it would generate losses of &#xA3;350 million a year, significantly lower than the &#xA3;2.2 billion of unrealized losses here and at a level that we can absorb within our IGD surplus of 2.5 billion. So let us now look at each of the key components of the portfolio starting with corporate bonds.</p>
          <p>We have 16.5 billion of corporate bonds, which are 92% investment grade with 41% invested in triple A to A. The remaining 8% of a corporate bond is in high yield with the vast maturity BB-rated. So, taking first investment grades, 15.1 billion, the first observation is that concentration risk is low. We have 489 lines with an average of &#xA3;31 million per line. As this chart demonstrates, we have a high level of diversification, a very important consideration at this point in the credit cycle of course. As mentioned in our Q4 release, our largest sector exposures are in utilities and energy. If you were to apply the highest level of Moody's historic default rates in a recession of 1.6% of this portfolio it would generate losses of 140 million. In 2008, we experienced three defaults for a total of 78 million on this portfolio and unrealized losses of 1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our high yield portfolio, the same approach applies and the same logic is used. The high yield portfolio is actively managed. It is equally diversified as shown here. Average holdings are however much lower, just 8 million across 181 issue, so 8 million to 31 million in investment-grade. It is worth noting anyway that the size of this book is 1.4 billion accounting for only 6% of Jackson shareholder debt portfolio. Applying the highest historic level of Moody's default in a recession of 15.4% it would generate losses of &#xA3;130 million. In 2008, we saw no default on this portfolio and the unrealized losses were 400 million.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our structured securities, starting with the CMBS portfolio of 1.8 billion, which is performing strongly with no defaults or impairments in the year. 85% of our portfolio is AAA and less than 1% is below investment grade. We materially reduced our non-AAA purchases after 2004, in response to what we perceived as a significant deterioration in underwriting standards observed in the market. So 96% of our bonds purchased post 2005 are rated AAA. This compares to 85% of the entire portfolio. So we were pro-active and conservative. There is an average credit enhancement across the portfolio of 30% and 81% of AAA portfolio is in senior or AAA tranches, which provides additional protection. So even to the extent that there would be a principal loss, its impact on us is going to be mitigated because we are the last tranche in line.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the RMBS portfolio of 4.5 billion, which has an average fair value price of $0.881 to $1, it is important to breakdown this figure. Why, because our actual ultimate exposure is small and I'd like to show you why. Over 4.508, 2411 or close to 50% of the portfolio is agency backed, which as you know, is guaranteed. This has an average fair value price of 102.2. Next is 291 million invested in subprime, which is fixed rate collaterals, so no floating rates and originally all AAA rated and in senior tranches, so well protected. Again, average fair value price is high at 82.81. Our pre-2006 vintage of 1,071 has performed very well with the average fair value price holding well in the high 80s. So our exposure to a more problematic and well known '06 and '07 vintages is of 735 million. Two-thirds of this, 445, is in well protected senior tranches, which ultimately out of this &#xA3;4.5 billion leaves us with &#xA3;290 million of non-senior 2006, 2007, which we have written down to 5,502 with an average of a prime fair value price of 69 and an Alt-A written down to 34.7. So overall, our structured securities portfolio is small with the problem areas extensively written down, so we believe that the exposure is now contained.</p>
          <p>As I explained earlier, our main exposure within IGD is credit risk. Therefore, I'll spend some time describing our credit portfolio which we believe in the UK is adequately reserved, in the U.S. as a structured securities exposure, which is contained and is on the corporate side with a portfolio of good quality, well diversified and with low concentration risk.</p>
          <p>This will be my final slide, so thanks for your patience, as there has been a lot to get through. We are investing in improving our disclosures, some of which I have presented today but there is a lot more in the schedules and I hope you will find that helpful. My key messages have been the underlying business is performing strongly. We have been prudent but proactive in our approach to risk and capital management with clear results, we have a resilient IGD position and a reduced level of sensitivity. And finally, I would like to guarantee you that we are taking our cautious mindset through into 2009 and I'll be here to talk about that. So let me hand back to Mark.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Tidjane. I think much of what you've heard this morning is about the critically important here now and focus on the balance sheet and capital. And that is, of course, very appropriate. But it's also very important to us and I think to you to spend a few minutes reinforcing how we continue to deliver on our strategy and the strength of our business model, in particular as I mentioned before the benefits of our approach to diversification.</p>
          <p>If we look over a four-year period the Group has sustained significant growth in operating profit both on the EEV and IFRS basis. We have continued to pursue our strategy and focus on the retirement opportunity, but in doing so we have also made choices. We have chosen to be highly international, but on a carefully selected basis, in terms of the countries in which we operate. We're also systematically selective in our choices of both products and distribution channels. And as a result, we have a level of diversification within the Group that means we are less at risk from changing market conditions.</p>
          <p>These graphics demonstrate the spread of topics across the geographic regions and also the significant contribution from the asset management businesses. The benefits of diversification can also be seen from one of the new areas of disclosure that Tidjane touched on earlier. In his presentation, Tidjane talked about IFRS earnings by source in Asia. This chart extends that analysis and consolidates sources of earnings at the Group level across both the life and the asset management businesses. Beyond that diversification of earnings, our aim is to have a suite of products that delivers value by meeting customer needs that is highly capital efficient and does not leave the Group overly exposed to the economic cycle. We saw clear evidence of this in 2008.</p>
          <p>Asian markets did start to feel the impact of the global financial turmoil in mid 2008 and the region's economic performance has undoubtedly suffered as a consequence of the downturn in demand for its goods in the western markets. Initially in that environment, we saw market conditions that were much tougher, particularly in the second half. However, and this is one of our key differentiators, we continue to benefit from our focus on regular premium products which accounted for a 90%, over 90%, of total APE sales in the region.</p>
          <p>We're also able to refocus our energy as a higher margin health and protection products, which were up 32% and on with-profits products for the more cautious investor. In addition to that, we developed our Shariah-compliant products in both Indonesia and Malaysia. In the U.S., we took the decision to give up a share in the competitive variable annuity market. Jackson's strength across the annuity product range enabled us to anticipate and react to the changes in consumer demand towards fixed annuities. The mix was more capital intensive and lower margin. So as Tidjane said, this is one area where we would likely limit our appetite in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the UK, our strategy has been focused on areas of real strength for us. We've benefited from our leadership position in the individual annuity market, from the financial strength of the With-Profits Fund, and, in particular, our excellent and sustained long-term investment performance. We also benefit from diversified distribution. In Asia, for example we are unique in that we have developed the largest network the Title agency network of agents, as well as the excellent partnership with Standard Chartered, ICICI and CITIC and many other banks across the region.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our industry leading wholesaler teams offer genuine added value to the Independent Financial Advisor channel and also focus on the regional broker-dealers and banks. In the UK, we've got a diverse multi channel approach including direct sales, financial advisors and partnerships. By removing ourselves from uneconomic product areas in the market, we now have a much lower proportion of IFA and therefore traditionally structured commission related distribution.</p>
          <p>The scale and profitability of our asset management operations is a clear and powerful differentiator for the Group. In 2008, M&amp;G's performance against the market in the UK has been quite exceptional. This is based on sustained investment performance, with 25% of retail funds in the top decile over three years. M&amp;G achieved 62% growth in its UK net retail net inflows as the market fell by 57%, and we also saw the value of our funds under management hold up very well. On the institutional side, 70% of fixed income mandates met or exceeded their benchmarks.</p>
          <p>The benefits of our focused strategy and the diversification across our businesses has also enabled the Group to show strong performance against the competition in 2008. In Asia, we are ranked number one in three markets. In Malaysia, where we combine our traditional business with our successful Shariah-compliant products, we believe that for the first time in our history we are the market leader, we are number one. We are now in the top five position in eight markets across the region. And an interesting statistic we've used the first time here we believe ex-Japan that we've outsold the regional market two and half times in 2008 and gained profitable share in many if not most of the opportunity &#x2013; of the territories that we operate in.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., I have already said that we deliberately gave up share in the VA market and you can see that from this slide. And I've also talked about our ability to react to changing market conditions as demands for FAs increased. And in the UK, as Tidjane has mentioned, we achieved an excellent relative performance, with retail growth up 10% compared with the overall retail market, which was down 10%.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, we will continue to implement our clear and consistent strategy and to maintain our rigorous and disciplined operating principles. First, we will continue to focus on the retirement opportunity to take advantage of the clear demographic and social trends that are driving the largest financial services profit pools in each region. This makes our revenue streams highly resilient. Second, we have a highly attractive geographic spread with exposure to the main growth areas of the retirement market, especially in Asia. Third, our concentration will be on profitable product lines within our chosen markets as we seek to generate strong returns with short average payback periods. Fourth, our portfolio of businesses allows us to make efficient choices on where and when we can impact capital. Fifth, we've consistently refused to pursue volume at the expense of value and in this environment, it's even more important that we remain immensely disciplined on this point. And last, and certainly not least, and it applies right across our management team, we will combine targeting of growth with financial conservatism.</p>
          <p>The key messages that I hope you will come away with following our presentation today are, we are a Group focused on a consistent and compelling strategy. We have a business model that is both well diversified and resilient, and we have a management team that have made and continue to make a series of clear-sighted decisions and proactive moves to improve both the capital and the cash position of the Group.</p>
          <p>2009 is and will continue to be, a very difficult and challenging year for all our businesses. Bearing in mind the uncertainty in the operating environment and as you've heard from Tidjane earlier, we've taken a prudent approach to our plans for 2009. This means focusing on balancing new business with cash generation and making it our top and our absolute priority to ensure that our balance sheet, that our capital position and that our cash flow remain robust. As the past year has demonstrated, prudence pays.</p>
          <p>Thank you for that and let me hand over to you guys for questions.</p>

          <p>It's Andrew Crean at Citi, couple of questions but the first one is I haven't seen such enthusiastic moves by the company and yet you are leaving and it's quite difficult to square these things. Perhaps you could talk about it, I mean you must assume something about this strategic difference in direction, particularly with all the rumors, which were in the papers about what you were trying to do in AIA and how you're going to pay for those things if you achieve that? And then the second question, could you give us a &#x2013; a technical question, could you give us in the sensitivity test what is the impact on your embedded values from spread widening 50 to 100 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me deal with the first part. Andrew, I'm sorry that I haven't shown my enthusiasm before. I think anybody that knows me knows that I have been an enthusiastic supporter of the Group for 25 years. So I'm sorry it's taken 24 and a half years to get there, but I remain as enthusiastic and committed and I hold an awful lot of Prudential shares and I intend to continue to hold an awful lot of Prudential shares going forward. There's absolutely no strategic difference I think on the basis either clearly of a new chairman, who again Harvey and I knew each other before and I was the mostly key supporter to Harvey's introduction to the company and clearly Tidjane again, was somebody that I recruited in.</p>
          <p>There are no strategic differences between us. I think hopefully, they will say the same thing. But I think the basis of the strategy is clear. We've got a clear track record of delivery. I think there has been an awful lot of speculation about AIG. It was a simple decision and I said to you and many others before I don't get emotional about acquisitions. If it makes sense in terms of the financials, then we look at it. If it doesn't we won't. We couldn't get to a situation where it made sense and we did not put an offer forward. There were no differences at all. It was a purely value equation.</p>
          <p>In looking at a sensitivity test for EEV, Tidjane where are we with that, is that something that we can look at giving?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andy Hughes, JPMorgan. A couple questions if I may, just first one is about the general view of defaults being the important driver of the business, the risk of the business. My real concern is not defaults, but impairments on the asset on balance sheet because of course you've impaired 500 million of assets last year and that's 10 times your expected defaults. Could you talk a bit about that and potentially what levers you have within that? And then just a couple of clarification questions on the bond disclosures that you gave today. First one on the financial debt exposure, you talked about the Tier 1 bank debt exposure, what is the rest of the 5 billion that you disclosed on the slides?</p>
          <p>Because obviously some Tier 2 stuff is treated the same way as Tier 1 now in the debt market. And the other question was on the Prudential Capital unit in the UK, which has 2.7 billion of bridging loans and other things on it which I don't really understand. Is there a credit provision in respect to this business or is it treated as zero and indeed how does that square with the view of being able to cope with the 1930s style recession, please? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, good morning. On the impairments, from the perspective of Jackson's portfolio, all figures being dollars not pounds, we have investments trading below $0.80 on the dollar $2.8 billion. So that would be the pool that you would look at on the mark-to market for potential write-downs. Our approach to write-downs is we don't have bright line price trigger or time trigger. What we do is we look at whether we think the investment is impaired. For the structured securities, we project up cash flows and if there's a significant impairment, we mark them to market or mark them to fair value.</p>
          <p>If on other bonds, what we're looking at is how are the credit spreads moving relative to overall credit spreads where overall credit spreads in the U.S. market have exploded since 9/30, resulting in average prices across the entire market dropping a great deal. So we would look at does the spread increase and the bond indicate some sort of credit impairment? Or does other information and the company indicates some sort of credit impairment. And that's what gave rise to the write-downs that we took.</p>
          <p>I think the question being what might future write-downs be that's forward-looking, can't address it. I mean the market's too volatile to address that directly. We'll continue to look at the structured securities portfolio. Tidjane in his presentation flagged the portion of that portfolio that we think is most interesting and that's the Alt-As and non-agency backed prime '06, '07 subordinated tranches. And we'll watch the triple Bs, and what I'd say about the BBB portfolio, it's first, well diversified.</p>
          <p>Second, its credit quality is reasonably good in that is tilted towards the higher end of the BBB spectrum about 75% of it is BBB or BBB plus when the portfolio was configured, it was a little higher than that, but it's obviously there's been some rating migration there. And the largest exposures, or the largest sector exposures are utilities, consumer non-cyclicals and energy, so what will happen there, I don't know exactly. There'll be some downgrades. There'll be some defaults and we'll take them as we incur them, but that's the general philosophy that we take to those impairments.</p>

          <p>Greig Paterson, KBW. Three questions, one is can you give us some color on how Asia is trading currently? That's question one. Second one, Indian IPO, isn't there a date coming up soon that you have to potentially increase your stake or I don't know if you just want to talk around that theme? And the third thing is you mentioned that financial reinsurance was one of your levers, Friends Provident can't tell that because they have hit up against their fixed charge cover. I wonder if you could just discuss the headroom you have within that constraint in terms of levers? And I'll ask a quick fourth one for you Mark, is I wonder if you &#x2013; yeah, the one thing that worries me about you leaving is if you went off to AIA, I was wondering if you were going to rule that out for me, explicitly now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fourth one absolutely totally and anything else that gives you a complete confirmation, I will rule that out. In terms of color on Asia, Barry are you happy to give a few seconds update?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; as the presentation said and as we've had in some private discussions, I mean it's no surprise that the environment is a lot more complicated than it was a year ago. Asia has been impacted just like every other part of the world. When we announced the full year results, and specifically the fourth quarter results, you did see difficulties in October, November in terms of sales results. They came off quite a bit. They came roaring back. In December, we had quite a good December.</p>
          <p>And without giving you information that I'm not meant to give you until we announce our fourth quarter results, we feel good about the environment in the context of the environment, and we &#x2013; I guess I should say we feel good about our performance in the environment. You see in the presentation as well the market share movements. I think those tell the story of outperformance and outperformance is really I think the key indicator right now. So while no one is doing as well as they did, say in 2007 or maybe in the first quarter of 2008, the reality is we're doing better, we think, than most anyone else and that shows in the numbers.</p>
          <p>And even in the markets where it may appear that our market share or in fact our absolute market share did come off a little bit in during the course of 2008, when you look at those specifically such as Korea. While it's true we did lose absolute market share, we gained market share amongst the foreign companies, which are the companies that seem to impose more of a value over volume mindset than the local companies who've done some quite uneconomic things.</p>
          <p>When you look at India, we did lose a little market share relative to the full marketplace, but we maintained our number one position. And one of the big issues there is that we've refused to participate in a distribution system that's starting to proliferate. It's built on multi-level marketing where essentially you have unlicensed agents selling your products. These are literally the Amways of the world, who are now selling insurance. We won't do things like that.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, again, we lost some market share but retained our number one position. And the reason we lost market share there is because we refused to try to replace the CPF-driven single premium sales with uneconomic single premium sales simply for the point of getting market share. We refocused on protection products where we've got big increases. We've refocused on recurring premium and that's serving us well. So you see that story come through in the margins. So it's a tough environment but we feel good about it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>The other thing I'd add to that Barry was I think 2008 first quarter was one of the highest quarters in history.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>Yes, 2008 first quarter is our second highest quarter in history and it only fell behind fourth quarter of 2007 literally by about &#xA3;10 million. So it's essentially equal to our best quarter ever.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point there is that there is a degree of tension between the economic capital and solvency capital. As you know, what we've fundamentally managed to is economic capital. So we're trying not to do things that are not sensible from an economic perspective for solvency reasons. So I think the limit is really our appetite for those types of transactions, which really have little economic value and just have a solvency benefit. But in terms of recharge cover I think, I don't have the number from the top of my head, but we're not running into any constraints. We looked at a number of structures in Q4 and Q1 and they were implementable. So...</p>

          <p>Good morning gentlemen, it's Raghu Hariharan, Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Three questions, on your IGD capital I mean you've given us the waterfall chart. The second biggest component is 600 million of management actions. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what the composition of those management actions are in terms of the 600 million? The second question also on the IGD capital was what is the regulatory reserving for defaults in the U.S. because you are at 80 bps, I guess which is included in your IGD, I was just wondering what the corridor number was for U.S. for bonds? The third question was for Clark, I guess on DAC recoverability testing, could you give us, I mean obviously there is a big movement in DAC and we want to understand what the levers are? I guess two big questions that I have is what is the sensitivity of DAC to lapses and what is the sensitivity of DAC to credit defaults and/or impairments because these two things I guess will drive impairment of profitability and therefore, amortization of DAC? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start in reverse order and ask Mr. Manning to talk about DAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Primary sensitivity in DAC is going to be to moves in the equity markets and that's what we saw. The &#x2013; to the extent that there is defaults that will be taken into account in the overall amortization schedule of that DAC and it will actually mute the impact of the default somewhat in the period in which it occurs. From a surrender standpoint, our acquisition costs are very well covered by the surrender charges on the business. So you shouldn't see material moves there. What hit us last year was the movements in the equity markets and the DAC sensitivities there.</p>
          <p>As we discussed last year we had &#x2013; we were within the corridor until October of last year, the DAC amortization corridor where we smoothed the DAC amortization without going through all the mechanics. And that was accounted for about 170 million of excess amortization until we broke through the corridor in October. At that point, the sensitivity of DAC to movements in the market moved from 4 to $6 million per 1% move in the market to about $11 million per 1% move in the market, and so we incurred another 70 million in the last three months of the year outside of the corridor. Our current DAC sensitivities to equities, which is really that's the most relevant point, we're out of the corridor. We're way out of the corridor at this point. As of the end of February, the market would need to go up 57% to get us back into the corridor. So, I'm not even going to give you what the DAC sensitivity in the corridor is, because we no longer calculate it.</p>
          <p>Out of the corridor, the next trigger point would be where do you hit recoverability thresholds? Where your fees are no longer sufficient to amortize your outstanding acquisition cost? For us as of the end of February we could incur another 40% drop in the market before hitting recoverability. Our K factor is for those who follow those things was 73%, which is good. The business that we're writing is profitable, and our funds are outperforming the equity indices, equity indices through the end of February were down 19, we were down 14, so about 500 basis points of outperformance, all of which is helping. So, that leaves us with the current sensitivity for DAC of it's about 7 to $8 million per one point move in the market today outside of the corridor between where we'd go back in the main reversion and where would hit, DAC recoverability thresholds.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also on DAC, we have 5.2 billion of DAC, there's 4 in the U.S., 1.1 in Asia, and 0.1 in the UK, so that gives you a sense. And in Asia the 0.1 is about 4% of the VIF so we think it's well covered in addition to what Clark said in the U.S. we're in a good position, I think globally. IGD, the management actions, it's a lot of various little lines. I mean it goes from changing the interest rate cap in Vietnam to some de-risking of equity in Asia. That's why we haven't detailed it. You've got at least 20 options there, so it's not lumpy. It's a lot of little things that we do to manage the book as we go forward and that's the characteristic of IGD as it is today. I mean Clark has just obtained the deferred tax assets in Michigan to what Iowa gave a few months back. We've obtained it in Michigan. That will be an additional gain for IGD going forward, so it's constantly moving, that's the nature of the beast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's James Pearce from Cazenove. You've got a new Chairman and a new Chief Executive, have you got a new strategy as well, please? Second, can you talk about arrears development on the U.S. mortgage book? And thirdly, could you say how you're investing premiums on fixed annuities now? Are you taking more credit risk in the U.S. like you seem to be doing in the UK or are you holding it in cash or what are you doing with the money?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>As far as the &#x2013; what we're doing with the money, we're going up quality right now. We don't want to deploy the capital against lower quality investments and don't want to run the downgrade risk. So we've gone very much up-quality in terms of cash flow.</p>
          <p>And the commercial mortgage question, or was that a commercial mortgage question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley, three questions if I may. Firstly, could Clark give us a little bit more detail on the performance of the VA hedging program, particularly how it's performed relative to expectations and when hedges roll et cetera and how you are prepared for that? And secondly, on the DAC point, I see there is a billion movement in the shadow DAC in the U.S. That seems to be linked to some widening of spreads so presumably that balance is actually more spread sensitive rather than equity sensitive, I wonder if you could talk about that and how you sort of look at impairments on that number? And then finally if you could comment a little bit on what you are seeing competitively with AIG in Asia, I think there is also room sort of on the P&amp;C side in the States they have been quite aggressive. Are you seeing same thing on the Life side in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that Barry can as diplomatically as possible give a sense of AIG, Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean what we, what I've heard from on the AIU side and I think at DBG in the United States as well as is the sort of particularly in commercial lines is sort of pricing that you've never seen out of AIG. I mean very, very, very aggressive pricing which undoubtedly you'd think would have an impact on their combined. So I guess the question is are we seeing similar sorts of activity in Asia? What we're seeing I mean you don't see it the Life sector as much in terms of ravaging products, building sort of completely uneconomic products. But what we are seeing is very aggressive compensation to distribution. AIA is very, and Southeast Asia is very reliant upon agency distribution. And we are, we do get intelligence about, a lot of money being spent in order to try to stabilize, you know a distribution plan in what's obviously a very unstable environment.</p>

          <p>Clark on, your thesis on VA hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll start with shadow DAC, the shadow DAC number is a large number because the mark-to-market on the assets is a larger number. We're not close to any impairments there, if you think about the margins in a fixed annuity contract we've got a good 100 basis points per annum between the cost and the amortization of the acquisition costs and the earned rate on the assets. And so &#x2013; and we're not incurring any real spread pressure, so it's just the default. So we're not bumping into a shadow DAC recoverability issue.</p>
          <p>The VA hedging, IFRS in dollar terms $119 million profit, above the line $101 million pre-tax on the bottom line. On a U.S. regulatory basis, we had a profit of about $30 million on the hedge program. What is it right now? I'm not going to give all the details on the hedge programs because that's proprietary and if I gave too many details, it might impact our trading. But we've got about right now about $17.5 billion notional on the books. Maturities out to 4.5 years, average life of about 1.5 year, and a future short position of about $900 million. What we've been doing is rolling those options positions and adjusting the delta position using futures and we have been able to do so and stay well within our hedging budget.</p>
          <p>The thing I'd emphasize on the hedging though is that the purpose of the hedging is not to make a profit. We went into last year overhedged and we're very happy about that, and that's showing up in the numbers. The purpose of the hedging program is to hedge the liabilities, so it's fortuitous that we have profits on it because of the overhedged positions in very volatile markets though, so we're quite happy with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, a couple of follow-up questions if I may. I was more worried about another buyout fund and not an AIA joining, so hopefully you're not going to set up a buyout fund, just to talk here, so. The question on the impairments is basically in terms of the clarification to previous question. So, if the credit spread you see today is partly reflecting future credit migration in terms of a bunch of bonds pulling back to par and a bunch of bonds getting downgraded. The bunch of bonds who get downgraded in your criteria would presumably need to be impaired and the bunch of bonds that pull back to par would be as you currently allow for any reserves. So, I'll be quite keen to get a viewpoint out, and obviously given the current unrealized loss which is below 80%. And the other point was a guess about the VA hedging and the take-up rate. I mean you just mentioned 900 million of short futures position against 23 billion of the guarantees?</p>

          <p>Leave us fairly excited as to movements in the market. The &#x2013; so, yeah, you have to look at that in combination. The &#x2013; as far as ratings migrations, we got some ratings migration. We don't need to impair in investment because of a ratings migration. What will happen upon a downgrade is that the capital charge associated with it under the U.S. risk based capital ratio calculation will go up, but you don't have to impair the instrument unless you actually think that the creditworthiness of the instrument is impaired to where you're not going to get recovery of the cash flows.</p>

          <p>Another chunk will get downgraded, and the price will fall of those bonds that are downgraded and they will fall below you are 80% test?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The 80% &#x2013; let me clarify on the 80%. It's not a test. That is &#x2013; it's a metric that's widely disclosed in the U.S. to give an idea of what are your unrealized losses that could be subject to impairment in the future? The bond markets have traded way down the average index price for a double B, single B is around 70 right now, it's been lower than that and it's about 90 for investment grade right now and it's been in the low 80s at times. The $2.8 million trading below 80 is simply something we watch. It's not a hard test, it's an impairment test, so if it's impaired then we're going to have to impair it. And some portion of that will become impaired and have to be impaired through the books, have to be recognized through the books. But you know, our belief right now is looking at that portfolio that the unrealized loss on it and the unrealized loss in the U.S. indices, credit indices is not reflective of the actual impairments that we would expect out of that portfolio.</p>

          <p>And the second on withdrawal benefits, I guess was the other bit of the question, how you're hedging the second rate on withdrawal benefits, and how are those moving, how do you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The withdrawal benefits we hedge very conservatively on the withdrawal benefits. When we priced the products originally, we assumed very efficient election of the withdrawal benefits on the part of the policyholder in the sense that when they were in the money they would start taking the withdrawal benefit and when they started taking the withdrawal benefit that they would take all of it. They, meaning take the maximum if it was a 5% withdrawal benefit, that they take all 5. We're now getting some experience in the tails. And what we're seeing is that the withdrawals are not at all efficient, which has been helpful to us. And what we have also seen in the policyholder behavior front is that their deployment of the assets is much less aggressive than what was assumed in the pricing of the products, we assumed 80% equities and we're looking at about 60%, 85% equities and we're looking at about 60% equities today, which is helpful.</p>
          <p>The hedging is by and large following the pricing in terms of policy or the behavior assumptions. And what we've been doing with the pricing is where we get clear experience in the tails we adjust to those utilization assumptions but do so on a conservative basis still assuming that over the long haul election becomes more efficient. But so far it has been &#x2013; it has worked to our benefit. The benefit type that's most subject to policyholder behavior is guaranteed minimum income benefits because you have to do a point in time election on the part of the policyholder and it's a light switch. It's either on or it's off. There is no partial utilization. We have shied away from that benefit type. We have reinsured what we have and we're in the process of pulling it within the next couple of week, so.</p>

          <p>One final question, there's been a lot of talk about the continuity strategy and also rumors about AIG, most of which I tried to ignore. But there is a very alarming one in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend that Prudential was contemplating sponsoring Manchester United. Now under current management that would clearly be unthinkable, I trust and season tickets would have to be forfeited. Can the incoming management whose affinities are elsewhere in London also confirm that sponsoring Man United is entirely unacceptable and unthinkable.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from a socially, ethically, philosophically, personal basis it's totally unacceptable. I think from a business basis, it's something that we must examine if there is value and we can generate value in a compelling business case for that.</p>

          <p>Tony Silverman, Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. I just like to ask two questions. One on your asset gain, and I just wonder if you could clarify where &#x2013; what the impact if surrenders increased in fixed annuities is, I know you said surrender charges, penalties, sorry are good from your point of view but given the sort of profile of this, I wondered if you could expand on that? Do you keep a liquidity reserve just in case? And the second question was for Mark really, despite everything that's being said, I'm just sort of not quite there yet as to why you've decided to resign? And I wonder we've covered several things that you probably wouldn't do, and perhaps you could talk a bit about what you would do and what you might be thinking of doing next to sort of get us to an appreciation of why you've decided to resign? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the fixed annuities, if we start with our recent persistency experience, persistency last year actually improved in fixed annuities. Our surrender rate in '07 was about 12% and our surrender in '08 was 10%. So that book is fairly well locked down. From a liquidity perspective, we've got plenty of liquidity facilities we've got right now about $1 billion worth of essentially cash on our books that's a little higher than we normally run, about 3 to 400 million. Plus, we have availability of liquidity facility from the federal home loan banks that would in excess of $5 billion that we could access very quickly that we have pledgible collateral force some of it already pledged, so from a liquidity standpoint we're quite liquid.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, I think again it's, again it is very simple. It is not complicated. I think the strength of the business is clear. I think to say I've given 25 years and will be 4.5 years as Group CEO to the Group. I think, when I look back what I didn't do effectively when I was in Asia was create succession as well as I would have liked and I was certain that I wasn't going to do that again when I came back to this job. And it was one of the clear criteria and I put in place what I believed is a succession in the Group, and Tidjane is the living example of that. And beyond this, it's a question and the answer is as simple as that. I believe regeneration of a CEO should happen after a certain time.</p>
          <p>And I think Tidjane will come in and do a superb job. As to what I will do I have no idea. I think it's &#x2013; I will not be inactive. I want to do something, I think I have another big job also in me &#x2013; but I think the point is now when you're in these sort of jobs you don't have time to think about it and it's totally inappropriate to have any conversations. So, I have not thought about it and not been in any conversations. And what happens in the future happens the future, but I think the timing for the Group to do it from a position of strength was very important to me and I think this is a great position to do it from.</p>

          <p>Andrew Crean, Citi. Can you go back to the subject of economic capital under Quest 4? And how the Group look on the emerging capital debate particularly what I am thinking about is the capital that you require behind things like UK and your annuities in U.S. fixed annuities. How that compares with the Solvency I regime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are working on it as you can imagine Solvency II we did Quest 4 like overs and we are looking at it. And I don't know if you want to start a discussion on liquidity primarily when its treatment is similar some of the discussions I think we had in the CFO Forum on MCEV. And I think the discussions are ongoing, regular meetings with the FSA et cetera on these topics.</p>

          <p>I'd like to ask you a question, CFO Forum deadline coming up I suppose Feb 2010. Given the current sort of hullabaloo that's going on within the committee, and the way that's been treated, et cetera, in the market. Would you if you got to the date and there wasn't any consensus reached, would you consider unsigning yourself from the CFO Forum? Was there some kind of loophole in your document that you can just delay it until, I just want your thinking around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. I think we've been an active participant with CFO Forum. We think the CFO Forum is a good thing for the industry. We will welcome a joint, agreed position on all the issues that are on the table now. We think it will be good for the industry to have a comparable standard. We decided not to be an early adopter because we didn't think it was helpful for the industry or companies to go ahead in a disbursed and inconsistent manner. I think we've been proven right on that and we keep the same position, which is to work within the forum towards a solution hoping that we will find one.</p>
