          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ING Group's Second Quarter Results 2008 Conference Call on 13th of August 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to Jane Park. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon. This is Jane Park for ING Group welcoming you to ING Group's second quarter 2008 results conference call. Before turning this over to John Hele, CFO of ING Group; Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer of ING Group; and Tom McInerney, Member of the Executive Board and CEO of ING U.S. Financial Services; let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of variables. They include interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in securities markets including equity markets and underlying economic health and changes. The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.</p>
          <p>That said, good morning and good afternoon again John, Koos and Tom. John, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon to everybody. We'll just give a very quick introduction and then turn over to questions. I'm here again with Koos Timmermans, the Chief Risk Officer and Tom McInerney, Executive Board Member for Insurance, Americas.</p>
          <p>Just in terms of highlights for the quarter, we had underlined net profit of 1.9 billion, down 29% from a year ago, basically because of lower investment returns and investment income. Our earnings per share was down 20% and that's because of the 5 billion euro share buyback that we did over the last year that was completed in May. We had a limited direct impact from the credit and liquidity crisis in the second quarter. However, we are not immune to the challenging environment around us and it has affected to some extent some of our business units.</p>
          <p>All of our capital and leverage ratios are well within target with a fair leveraged capacity at the end of the quarter at 3.9 billion euros. And we continue to focus on our commercial growth and almost 30 euros of client balances in the quarter to be almost near 1.5 trillion euro, the client balances from which we receive fees and margins from. And we will continue to focus on our core business while keeping mind of the challenging circumstances in which we're operating.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn it over for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions.] Thank you. Our first question comes from Bruno Paulson of Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-- very much. Bruno Paulson for Bernstein here. Three questions if I may. Firstly, looking at your pretty sharp loan growth in Q1, I think the risk-weighted assets went up by 4.5% or something in that order. With that, how much of this was, if you like, voluntary and how much of this was companies taking up lines of credit which had been advanced? Is there any evidence of pro cyclicality by either risk-weighted assets rising relative to assets <mark type="inaudible" /> and are there capital implications?  Is this kind of loan rate sustainable going forward and what is your planned growth in risk-weighted assets over the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just a very quick mechanical question, what's the impact of the already announced acquisition for disposal on the span of the bridge over the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>And finally a deeply obscure one. On page 67 of the fiscal supplement, we realized gains and losses on equities in European insurance dropped from 70 million to 20 million. My understanding was that this was a fixed proportion of the 3% annual of the equity holding, I was wondering why it had dropped so dramatically. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we turn over the first question on the loan growth to our Chief Risk Officer who personally looks at all these loans and things on an ongoing basis. Koos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the question of the growth of risk weighted assets, and it is due to the effect of usage of either commercial paper or best of lines, one of the things is that the answer in short area is no, it is not a short of involuntary growth of credit against the pre-crisis level of these limits. I think we do have some of these backup lines for corporate available, at the same time we always have to make sure that we have liquidity for it, but actually we don't see the utilization there.</p>
          <p>What we did see however is selective growth in the wholesale portfolio, because of the fact that there is a bit of bond market working less than it was in the past, you see a bit more club deals. So in that sense you are growing something. And the other aspect is there is always the occasional changes of methodology and things, but I would say a part of it is indeed more usage of bank balance sheet, but not the involuntary part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the question regarding the spare leverage over the next few quarters. Well, we have some acquisitions we have announced that we have closed, as well as some we've ended up selling. And suffice it to say that these are all factored in and we don't expect really a material mass of changes in our overall spare leverage capacity from these. We will be paying a dividend though of course, the interim dividend which will have an impact on it, that's factored in for the next quarter.</p>
          <p>Your last question I think is on the gains and losses and &#x2013; if it's perhaps regarding in Insurance Europe, the reduction of gains and losses on impairments from equity securities in Insurance Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, being 20 versus 70, which is on page 67 of 188 of the statistical supplement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is 67, I found that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is an impairment of &#x2013; it's actually an asset backed debt fund that is pooled and it is recorded as an equity security so some of the underlying credits were actually impaired and it is disclosed, we spoke about it in the Insurance Europe pages.  It is a 49 million euro impairment, but it's classified as an equity even though it is debt securities within the overall equity structure. It's pooled between a few units and that is why it is structured that way. And that is why &#x2013; that is in the business line, versus normally impairments would be in the corporate line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Duncan Russell of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a quick question on slide 56. On the impairment test of the Alt-A, I just want to make sure I'm reading this right. Is it correct to say that you will only impair the Alt-A book when the estimated pipeline loss is greater than the credit notes; is that what this slide is saying? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start this and then Koos can add to it. No, this is a screen by which we review these and if you're less than one, then we clearly look at it to impair unless there's compelling evidence to the contrary, such as perhaps prepayments, because of -- a senior structure might give you higher credit protection than what this initial screen does. But anything one to two is also very carefully reviewed and is done with a detailed cash flow and structure because we view that to be on our watch list and we use a model that takes into account prepayments and another factors to review and also looked at the structural credit protection versus this &#x2013; this is a sort of point in time structure, Koos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're right John, in the sense that if you only look at credit enhancement and build of losses then the one thing what you for instance miss is how far along is this bond already on the road. I mean if it's close to majority then they are supposed to have eaten up their credit enhancement so then it is less likely an issue. With an essence it is just like John said below one it is &#x2013; it should be unless, and above one it's more a suspect, that is how the &#x2013; but indeed, there's a quite a few criteria which play a role, it's a credit enhancement versus losses it is the excess spread which is still on the bond and the level of prepayment which you get there, but at least filter one word this way and then you do the through analysis and then you impair based on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, on the accounting policy again, if it's in category three, i.e. coverage ratio greater than two, that will definitely not get impaired, is that what this is saying? And if it is in category one and two you review it and you might impair it, but category three definitely does not get impaired to the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is what it says is this is with our first filter category three bond have not come out at this moment as something which is likely to be impaired given the current assessment which we are making. So we &#x2013; in essence, it is level 5 is more an absolute no, level 3 you start to pay already a closer look at it and level you know the first and the second column are the clearly the ones which you have in an impairment committee and you look at very closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would happen if your securities got downgraded materially by S&amp;P, but it was still in level 5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be honest I think we should spend the most time on looking at our own credit assessment there. Nevertheless if at a certain moment if a bond gets downgraded than that gets done, because there are revised expectations of ultimate losses.  And one way or the other if that is materializing, something will fall through the crack of these filters and something will migrate from levels at bigger than five to two to five there.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, I think what you see happening is downgrades our happening based on loss estimates. Ultimately, loss estimates ultimately are set by data own the current pipeline and its current pipeline times are multiplier is what you here. So the things are very much linked and it might be a matter of quarters or something like that in between, but things in generally progressing thing, but a downgrade as such is not an ultimate agree categorization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if it was a dramatic downgrade of several notches we would review that security very carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then estimated pipeline losses, again just to put it into simple terms, what does that assume about house prices?  Is it where -- is it house prices as they are today or are they factored in?  So, when you've got five times covered 14.9 billion. Is that assuming further deterioration on house prices, what do they assume about house prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you've seen under there is that we take a loss given default for sub-primal 50% of Alt-A of 35, and if we then work our way backwards, what you could say is you have an Alt-A security versus 70% loan to value. But okay there's a 30% cushion there, but that will be eaten up, basically by foreclosure cost and all the other loss because of for selling. So in essence from our own, you could say there is a 35% house price decline, which you anticipate in the security there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This formula seems to be saying 60% ton 60 plus delinquencies, 90% times &#x2013; so that's as of today, the credit outlook as of today, it doesn't factor in. So, when you say estimated pipeline loss, not just as of today we are already seeing today not factoring in further delinquencies. So next time -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we started with the 70% loan to value in general on the securities and house prices are down depending upon the area, 15 or 20. And if you use a 35% loss given default, you already have factored in some future elements of call it house price decline, foreclosure costs, time, value of money before you can ever have an ultimate value, but we're down, half of the &#x2013; under half of value ultimately that you saw and from when these were originally issued.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I agree the loss given default. What I meant was the delinquencies are going to go up, surely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you can see is &#x2013; and that is a bit &#x2013; then you come to the point of the forecasting delinquencies is going to go up. If we look at the SMPs scenario, what they say is they have doubled their ultimate losses what they expect, and that is the sum of two things. I think they see a slight deterioration of the house prices, so they increased the loss given default and that is a bit in-line with the house price decline which we already had. So they made that factor of LGD bigger, and at the same time they significantly increased in their scenario the amount of PD. So that is why they came up with their doubling of this estimate. And so no doubt there is a deterioration and that is something which is being factored in, in these revived outlooks at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't take up any more time, but I just wanted to get one thing off this chart again. If delinquent &#x2013; what if you put in the SMP estimated delinquencies then, what does the chart look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry that the SMP estimated delinquencies is something which I don't have over here. The only thing what I have is the ultimate losses per the different vintages. The way how they built it up with delinquencies. If I take the example on the NegAms, I think ultimately, they are going to end up with a 15% factor of ultimate losses for the 2007 and 2008, given the fact that it's a market practice to take at this moment a 50% LGD on NegAms, that means that they assume delinquencies in order to approach approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>As so it is with it's very much, a product class and vintage driven way how they analyze it. So that means that I would have to come up with basically more than actually over a different rating classes and products, 50 different delinquencies and house price decline. That's why I give you the most important, the '07 NegAm, 30% delinquency, 50% LGD that is something which is factored in their scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the same scenario is applied to our Alt-A, gives the 200 million in credit losses or at these market prices at the 30th of June would have been 400 million in impairments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Farooq Hanif of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few questions. Firstly, I'm afraid I'm going to dance all over the place, but if you go to slide 85, which is looking at your capital position in Group and how it's down streamed to bank and holding. One thing that's confused me, I'm sure you've explained before, but I can't see out the equity from the Group is injected to ING Bank and ING Insurance and how the core debt as well goes into that. But I noted in ING Bank you got this Tier 2 capital of 12 billion, is it doesn't seem to be appear in the consolidated balance sheet. I was just wondering where that is in the consolidated balance sheet. That's question number one. Question number two is when you look at your loan provisions against the kind of provision loans and non-performing loans. I mean that ratio now is about 35%. And I've noticed historically it never &#x2013; it hasn't really fallen into that level for as I remember for a long time. So I was just wondering I mean how come that's low, is that normal, do we expect it to go back towards kind of the 50% or 45% level in our modeling? And the third question to tie you up in knots even more -the CDO and CLO that you've been buying through derivatives, am I right in thinking that that will basically move using fair value accounting to the Insurance Americas in the Wholesale Banking line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to repeat those questions, by the way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You want to know what the Tier 2 consolidation is and I believe that's in subordinated loans when you consolidate it across the eliminations of course of subordinated loans on both sides bank and insurance. I think the Tier 2 shows up as subordinated loans in the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you don't show it, the reason that I asked is that you're not showing an ING Group Holding in that chart anywhere, so I just got a bit confused.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, no, right &#x2013; because that's a parent, that's the holding parent.  So this is not consolidated, this is on the balance sheet of the holding on page 85.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, we will &#x2013; I mean &#x2013; when I look into your &#x2013; in your total balance sheet in the actual books, I should find that 12 million in the proper sort of consolidated balance sheet somewhere? That debt to capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 9, 6 or to be split in the debt securities and issuance depending upon the categorization of the Tier 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as long as it's not double counted, that's the main thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And sorry &#x2013; and the question about provision versus the provision loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll turn that to Koos for the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you talk about &#x2013; the first thing just to make sure, if you talk about provision as compared to credit risk weighted assets, there you could say like it's doubled that is because the credit rate &#x2013; this as occurred in half also if the Basel I, Basel II effect. But what you're eluding to more is the amount of provision versus non-performing loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words the level of provision in for non-performing loans is lower at this month. Is that what you asked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we just seemed &#x2013; I know it fluctuates and there's probably very good reasons for that, but the ratio of 35%, just seems well below where it's been, since I have looked to that --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or maybe I can ask &#x2013; yes, just on this one I can ask <mark type="inaudible" /> whose is the Head of Credit here to comment on that one.</p>

If you have a very matured portfolio, then you almost did before it is actually is less, so if you are very, very secured let's say you have a 100 million loan with 90 million security and there are such an outstanding &#x2013; you have a provision of 15 then your ratio is 150.</p>
          <p>Now we are very, very collateralized balance sheet both in our real estate operations and to be quite honest also in our retail operations where we're underlying mortgages. So for the traditional wholesale bank with more unsecured loans at holding companies you would see that you ratio much higher than what else.</p>
          <p>On the other hand it is also impacted by how you're or what you're right of policy is. If I have a 100 million loan against with a 100 million provision and I write it off on day one and basically influence more ratio for management. Because if I keep it on, then I'll keep that 100% on the books and we are very, very conservative in actually writing off provisions our write-off policy is very strict.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Yap Meyer from Dresdner. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. On your CDOs, you only provided a net exposure rather than a gross exposure. Could you provide that? And then let's say split up in corporate, multi sector and ABS build, we know it is sub prime, but those three set will be handy? And in terms of monoline exposures, could you provide the underlying assets the evaluation metric of those underlying assets the value at risk in the provisions is taken from the monoline exposures? And finally on your spare leverage is 3.9 billion, that I have remember well it includes about close to 5 billion benefits from Basel II, so I was wondering how rating agencies are looking at this, they already recognized Basel II, because initially they were not really willing to embrace Basel II? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I start with the last question, while everyone looks up the details for the first two questions. The 3.9 billion &#x2013; we are formally on Basel II, we file with our regulator, it has been fully reflective we have had meetings with the rating agencies, we had no fundamental arguments about it moving forward. So they certainly never have said to us, that don't believe in Basel II. And we with our regulator have been validating and even audited all of our calculations across the board, so it does include this benefit, but we are fully on it today. And we set our ratios and communicate that to the rating agencies and that is how we are operating, and I don't expect any problems from that.</p>
          <p>Koos, do you have the gross and the exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think if you look at gross and net that is especially applicable to the banknotes, so much the insurance company because they are a net investor. I think on the banking side you have some arbitrage type of business. And if we follow that portfolio in the cash CDOs, it is only a very small amount, I think 83 million and that's net sole protection, that is the cash part, but the bigger numbers are in the synthetics. There you can say that at this moment, first tech index related &#x2013; index related, sole protection 1.9 billion, both protection, 1 billion. So that is typically IPEX tranches opposite each other. If we take the B spokes there I have 1.4 billion on each side both in solid protection. And if you look at the &#x2013; sort of the synthetic CDOs, if I look at the CLOs, I mean that's a 100 million or something like that, so the protection is a small amount. So that's the total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you also have a question on our monoline exposure, could you say what that is again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are the underlying assets, what is the evaluation metric of the underlying assets? And therefore what is the validated risk related to the monoline sector? And what provisions have you taken for the monoline sector as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. If you look at the monoline exposure first, over all the amount of insured money is 2.9 billion. Now again the interesting thing is it takes a double type of default before you get into a problem.  The first is a monoline and the monoline insurer itself, and second is the underlying asset. So let's first focus on that one. What are we have with the monoliners? We have a few things. We have on the insurance side some wrapped exposure, we have on the banks, <mark type="inaudible" />, so that's our customer <mark type="inaudible" /> conduit.  We have some wrapped exposure.  We have some bond wrap, AFS books and ING Direct.</p>
          <p>Now overall you could argue that especially on <mark type="inaudible" /> and the wrap bonds that is 1.5 billion out of the 2.9 billion, those are assets shipping in the conduit or bonds underlying where, if at a certain moment, the insurer would go bust, in that case we would not lose directly any money. Because the ultimate assets underlying it are held at cost. So in other words, they are not bonds in a trading book.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the insurance side, we do have assets which are wrapped by an insurer and that is something like below 500 million, that part in case the monoliner defaults, you will find that the security gets a lower value and in other words, then you will get a 50 to 60 million revaluation.  That is something what we see happening at that moment because of down rate. The third element is ING Direct, there we do have some exposure, which is wrapped as well, and that part book revalued but only with relatively small amounts.</p>
          <p>So in other words in your held-to-maturity part, there you don't see a lot.  On the available-for-sale value you will see in total an amount of &#x2013; let me see, 75 million. And then we still have one other part and that is on the banking side, the derivatives, we have 630 million of derivatives outstanding, CD assets in our trading book. And there, I would say the revaluation gain and losses we're talking at the moment about 44 million.</p>
          <p>And so underlying in a nutshell if something happens with the monoliner, then the effect goes either directly via P&amp;L, because we have some derivative which cease to exist and those derivatives they have 44 million value for us. We have some loans in the portfolio and there you could say well, slightly the loan in terms of repayment &#x2013; the debt has a slightly lower quality, but not a direct P&amp;L impact and you have the available-for-sale segment.  So where you have wraps and bonds and that is where you have in total the 75 million of value decline anticipated once these monoliners don't exist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so how much are the underlying assets then under water currently? So all the three together even held to maturity &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> market value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>75 plus -- 44 essentially, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I gave you as amounts is more the value declines once this happens and the wrap is out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is the impact of the wrap on it is the, if all monolines will go bust tomorrow with a negative pre-tax P&amp;L of 44 million, and at the same time a negative pre-tax revaluation of 75 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the most important part is what we are insuring is underlying assets there and those underlying assets are performing assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, excellent. One question actually on Belgium, it's performing quite poorly I think, the Belgian retail unit.  Gross income ratio is going up, revenues coming down. And probably outlook doesn't look very good for the second half because of the war for savings and very little reprising on the mortgage side.  Any plans there to address the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, absolutely, in fact some of the higher costs in Belgium in the quarter is some of the repositioning of the whole banking system there. Where we are revitalizing the branches, we're shrinking some branches down to be more self service and also building more products to be sold to the other branches. And in fact there's quite a whole system at work to bring through next year, some of the technology being built this year in the Netherlands will be applied next year throughout Belgium.</p>
          <p>So we believe that with the sort of savings war that is going on now in Belgium that we have to address the structural costs across the board.  We've already started a retail transformation program; we plan to accelerate that in the coming quarters. It does take time though obviously in the Belgian economy to restructure these things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that a region you want to add on to increase this &#x2013; well, the footprint to create synergies or is that not an option for you? If let's say one of the players were to sell their retail unit?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Farquhar Murray from FPK. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, afternoon gentleman, it's Farquhar from Fox-Pitt. Four quick questions and I do actually promise they are quick and all related to slide 56. So following on from Duncan, really. First question is, would you have the unrealized loss associated with each of the bars, just in order to help us gauge the impairment risk attached to each? And then secondly, could you help us reconcile between the 35 million impairment in the second quarter, and this graphic? And what I'm trying to understand as whether all the impairments came from the less than one times cover bar, presumably not because it would imply a par valuation of 24%. And then finally with regards to the 400 million scenario, would those impairments stretch beyond the less than one, and one to two times bar, and obviously that's similar to Duncan's question. And that's it, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay it's, let me start with the part -- well let me start with the last question. If you look at the 400 million there in a sense what we've done with this S&amp;P scenario, we've said like, we calculate ultimate losses. But we do it a bit in a funny way, because we say like we calculate those ultimate losses that they are going to happen overtime, but we are not going to benefit from any of the credit spreads or any of the prepayments. Let us see what happens to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In such cases what would happen is we in total, we fill 200 million of credit enhancements short. So in essence, 200 million of credit enhancements short would mean, my book at smaller than one would fill up. But here indeed one of the points is, is that 20 tickets of 10 million or is debt, 40 tickets for 5 million, that is one of the things which is a bit often, difficult one to determine. Although what you can see is with the S&amp;P scenario, we looked at a total amount will bounce 126 off the RMBSs, they would reach a credit enhancement.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; so in a sense it is a bit of a difficult one to forecast precisely that the 200 million credit loss in case S&amp;Ps materializes, that's ascertain. But at the same time would it materialize into 400 impairments or 300 or 500 that's a bit more on the difficult, because it's the distribution of the bumps which play a role. But I don't have precisely over here, how big in notional amount of bar number one would be.</p>
          <p>If I look at the total impairments, what you see is that most of the second quarter impairments come from book of two, so in other words we have some book of one, but we also have a &#x2013; you know, the main part of it come from book of two, so you are right in saying, &#x2013; like that doesn't come from the brokered one only. And then that was the last question which was this total division of unrealized losses over the different buckets and that this one number which I owe to you at the later stage because I don't have that I mean what we did here is a credit impairment test, but then I would have to slice the bonds and take the realized losses or the unrealized losses of this and selected over these credit and Hamburg.  I don't have this breakdowns directly here, but I would be more than happy to tell it later.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, two questions for Thomas if I may. On available annuities, can you give us a bit of flavor what you think about the outlook? We had a number of U.S. players talking about a very competitive environment and do you anticipate more pressure on sales as well as the IRR? And could be also give us an update on what do you think about the hedging costs going forward and if you think you're in the position to hand this over to the policyholders as well? My second question is regarding the composite margins, again talking about compensation credit rates, slightly moving up, do you expect that to continue? And may be you can also give us a bit of flavor regarding the outlook for credit losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on the variable annuity book I think if you look in the second quarter, our monthly sales were about 950 million these are in dollars that is in the statistical supplement on page 8. I think what our sales last few quarters that would be roughly my expectation although as we pointed out in the press release it is happening modestly from where it is been I think the IRR's we have been pricing for 14% IRR with the increase in the cost of the hedging we have been earning we are into the second quarter of 12.7%. So we will look at the hedging costs and make the assets back through the consumers.</p>
          <p>I think all the competitors are probably looking at that in terms of the margins and crediting rates, if you look at that and see it again in the statistical supplement, our quoting rates have been roughly in the 400 &#x2013; 405 basis points range. If you look over the last six quarter, it is I think it's been vary to within four, five days of the point. So I would say our book given the fixed annuity credit rates and the individual annuities in our <mark type="inaudible" /> services see our crediting rates roughly stay where they are because obviously it's averaged over the entire portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we obviously go through with Koos and Koos' team, and my sense is overall, as it is point on the SMP work that we've done we would think there would be some increase in the fault over time I think the sheets that Koos reviewed are probably less indication of what we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think and maybe to add there in general like what on the banking side with loans you do expect a bit of an overall increase to a long-term average of the credit risk rated &#x2013; it is foreign credit risk-weighted assets and you see no reason to say that on the corporate bond diversified side, I mean, you know a slight increase of risk cost is probably what you'll see there as well.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Question &#x2013; I have the technical answer to the balance sheet on where the bank tier II goes to? Its on page 12 of our consolidated balance sheet in our quarterly report. The tier II is shown as subordinated loans in the bank. It's been eliminated on consolidation and moved from subordinated loans to other borrowed funds, because it's considered subordinated tier II for ING Bank NV, but at ING Group it's considered other borrowed funds and you can see it is the 12 billion is within the 16, roughly 16 billion that's eliminated and added between the two categories. So, that's where the money is going to and it is fully recorded.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. On the U.S. what I was wondering about is, is not so much the credit losses that you're just discussing. There was also the $120 million interest and other market related investment losses from page 7 of the U.S. fiscal supplement, which will see was bit of a turnaround from quite significant positive numbers in the two previous quarters. I was wondering if you could tell us sort of what that is, what drives this? And how we could think about what that's likely to be going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that breaks down to credit, credit related gains and losses and that of 48 million and then trading gains and losses were 22 million in the second quarter. And then on our CMO portfolio, we have derivatives and based on the steepness of the yield curve, there is a what we call cumulative catch-up provisions, so based on the value of those derivatives, and that in the second quarter was 58 million. That will bounce from in last year second quarter was a positive seven. So that was a big if you look at quarter-to-quarter, a big driver of the difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
