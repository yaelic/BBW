          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Rio Tinto Fourth Quarter Operations Review Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Also as a reminder, the company is in its pre-earnings close period. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Guy Elliott. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to teleconference of the quarterly operations review for the fourth quarter of 2007. My name is Guy Elliott. I am CFO of Rio Tinto and with me today are Bret Clayton, who is our Corporate Chief Executive; Dan Larsen, our Financial Controller; and Nigel Jones, who many of you will know, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Now, you will see that in addition to the normal quarterly operating review, we've also today released a guidance note which clarifies the key issues relating to the integration of Alcan into Rio Tinto, which a number of financial analysts have asked us for, and we hope it's going to be a useful document for you. Now because of the release of both of these documents, we decided to host this conference call today for the first time. We are doing that to give you an opportunity to ask questions about our quarterly operating report and also to give you a real insight into how to model the enlarged aluminum business as we go forward. So we are here to talk about those two things. I am afraid you will have to wait until our full year results are disclosed on the 13th of February to get at profit numbers, and I've got nothing new to say today about the take-up approach from BHP Billiton.</p>
          <p>Let me just, before we get into questions, point out a few key points that I think come out of the quarterly operations review. It was a strong quarter overall, and we produced a number of records, both in the quarter and in the year. In iron ore, for example, the group produced nearly 180 million tons in total in 2007 or on an equity share basis 145 million tons, which represented a rise of 9% on the previous year. Our fourth quarter iron ore production rose 11% year-on-year, and when we closed the year, we were running at an annualized run rate of 190 million tons on a 100% basis, as all our operations were performing well. And we began to see the benefits of all the very strong investment that we put into new capacity.</p>
          <p>Moving on to aluminum, if you set on one side for a moment the Alcan acquisition, the earlier Rio Tinto operations on their own were set quarterly and annual records in both bauxite and aluminum. And if you, of course, added in the Alcan acquisition, of course, we see very substantial production increases across the board in that product group. We expect that we are going to continue to benefit strongly from that additional Alcan production during 2008, and on top of that, of course, we've got growth projects going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to copper, mine copper output fell 8% year-on-year, mainly due to grade variability. Refined copper production rose 30% year-on-year and 65% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting full production at the Kennecott smelter. And finally, gold mined rose 23% year-on-year. And it's worth remembering, as we have these high bullion prices at the moment, that Rio Tinto is a leading gold producer with 2007 production of 1.2 million ounces.</p>
          <p>Now, those are just a few opening points. I'd now like to go over to you and cover any questions that you might have as best as I can, either on the quarterly report or on Alcan or anything else. So over to you now, please. Who would like to ask the first question?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Given the concerns on the U.S. market here, the turmoil that's going on in the financials, the concerns about the economies, have you seen any change in the economic patterns in the emerging markets? China is one of the drivers for copper growth here in 2008, also probably in 2009. Have you seen any kind of change versus 2007 in the copper markets from China and also in case of iron ore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you asked a very pertinent question. And I think that viewed from New York and from London, of course, there is a great preoccupation that market participants have with the credit issues that banks are experiencing, with the housing issues, particularly in the U.S., and with the general lack of confidence. And that clearly is moving into all sorts of markets at the moment. For all of us here in Rio Tinto, that looks a very foreign environment, not something that we are seeing in our markets at all. China, both directly and indirectly, is an extremely important part of our revenue formation. And we are not seeing any of this, sort of, uncertainty, any of this lack of confidence at all in China. To the contrary, we are still seeing very, very strong demand in all the products, which we supply there and which are supplied by others there, but where China is actually forming the price. And so, for us and for the mining industry, but particularly for us because of the three main products that we supply to China, we think that the situation is very favorable. And we think that perhaps markets are tending to paint Rio Tinto with the same brush as they are painting other sectors, which are in fact in a much more difficult situation.</p>
          <p>When we look at China, we can see, as I have said, continued very, very strong investment in fixed asset investment, up 25% in recent times and, of course, all this investment is very materials-intensive. It's using a lot of copper for electrification. It's using a lot of steel for construction. It's using a lot of aluminum also in infrastructure development. Those developments are not at all slowing down. And in fact, if you begin to think "well, what is the effect of a U.S. recession on China?" We think it's very muted. And the reason for that is that all these metals are going into China and they are staying in China. They are not really in any significant quantities coming out of China in the form of manufactures. So when we look at the effect of a U.S. recession on China, we think that it will, if it happens, bring about a reduction of one percentage point or less to Chinese growth, which is running in double-digits overall and, of course, is running at higher levels for metals demand. So for all of us, we think that the &#x2013; we are not seeing these concerns that financial markets have at all in the main emerging market with which we are concerned, which is China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was also one talk about probably after the Olympics is over, probably China's growth may stall, is that the view that you might &#x2013; you said, you very confidently said about continued investment in the fixed asset. But that view is not echoed by the Chinese authorities that the growth may stall after Chinese Olympics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Olympics are coming up in a few months' time in August, and I can tell you that nearly all of that investment has already been made. Those buildings are mostly already there. There isn't a great deal of new metal that's being ordered to go into the Olympic investment. Now, what's happening is investment in a great many cities of which neither you know or I have ever heard, they are large numbers of very important infrastructural developments, roads, factories, buildings, electrification. We are seeing very, very major development going on as very major populations move from the west and from the country into the urban areas. They have very high expectations for larger and larger living spaces with more and more sophisticated lifestyles. And all of those expectations must be met. They are being met by the Chinese authorities. And I don't think that the Olympics is any kind of end spot on this road. To the contrary, we think that that's already been dealt with basically, and we're going to see further growth well beyond that. Of course, at some point or another, there will be overheating and speed bumps in that path. We're not seeing any sign of that now, and I think that we view the future in China with very great confidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the copper market in that case, if the story still continues for China, then we should be seeing a balanced market for '08 and '09 in that case. Is that right what I should assume in that case or that's how the reflection should be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What &#x2013; rather than me go on about this, maybe I can ask Bret Clayton, Chief Executive of our Copper Group, to comment on copper in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what I would say to that is that we are in a very finely balanced market. So we have growth continuing at a robust pace, as Guy has talked about. Supply is struggling. We continue to see higher levels of disruption than we've seen in the past. We are seeing continuing levels that we saw last year. And so what I would say is we might see a slight surplus, not much, but a slight surplus, but in a very finely-balanced market, where Chinese growth being a bit higher than one might expect or disruption being slightly more than, say, is forecast for next year, can change that very quickly from one from a slight surplus to something else which we saw this year. Chinese growth came in much, much stronger, I think, than most people were anticipating in the copper market. And if that was to repeat itself again next year, we would see that again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Bret.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the iron ore side, I think there was a comment from you guys, saying that probably the price discussions are continuing, but probably it is going very slow. Do you say the Chinese authorities are willing for a 40, 50% increase in the iron ore prices over 2007 or they are not willing for that, given where the iron ore markets are currently or which are in deficit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right that we did issue a comment earlier today about the continuing pace, albeit a fairly slow pace of those discussions. I am not going to get drawn into percentage increases and what China may expect or not expect. But what I will say is that the background to these negotiations, which are underway, is very favorable. When you look at the spot price of iron ore, and if you look at any of the other fundamentals that relate to formation of the iron ore price, you can see that the conditions are very favorable. So that's the background against which these negotiations are being carried out. And I think you can draw your own conclusions from that; we are very optimistic. So I think that's all I'll say on iron ore prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I ask a last question on the BHP thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I'll tell you what, why don't we offer other people a chance and maybe come back to you a bit later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I appreciate that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. What's the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" /> with Citadel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Guy, hi everyone. Just a very quick question on, I think it was actually the ARI result yesterday on the quarterly production report. They highlighted much higher or stronger prices for uranium in the second half. It looks like some of the contracts might be rolling off. Are you experiencing the same things within the 100%-owned Rio Tinto mines for uranium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have any 100%-owned producing mine in uranium. We have Rossing uranium, which is 60-something percent owned. I can't remember &#x2013; 68%-owned. And basically the same sorts of phenomena are occurring in both uranium mines, where they have legacy contracts in both cases. Those legacy contracts, which were signed at a time when market prices were much lower. And gradually, those legacy contracts are maturing, and new contracts are being entered into. And you saw that a little bit in the first half of 2007 with a very sharp increase in the Rossing profit. I can't comment, of course, on the second half of 2007 yet, but I think that what the important message to draw from this is that uranium has been a rather modest contributor in recent years to Rio Tinto's profits. But in the fairly near future, and it differs from mine to mine, we will see very interesting increases in the average prices received, and we're also looking at increases in the tonnages produced. So I would say that, in the not too distant future, we're going to see that uranium is a much more prominent part of Rio Tinto's results and of its future. And I think that when we look at uranium in general, it is the metal where the fate between today's solar price and the long-run equilibrium price is probably one of the very longest. And so we are the number two producer in the world, especially well positioned to benefit from uranium's strength. And that incumbency in the two mines, ERA and Rossing, is very strong. So I think we are well placed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When &#x2013; thanks for that, Guy. Just when you are &#x2013; just to talk about the uranium pricing, when do you think Rio Tinto or the ERA or Ranger and Rossing. When will those mines start to receive a price that emerging uranium producers like, might be receiving at the moment who don't have these legacy contracts, what would that be, would that be two or three or five years down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been a bit cautious about issuing the precise time at which our contracts are maturing. And of course, ERA, as you know is a public company, and I need to be even more cautious about that. But I think as you observed, there has been a bit of an improvement at ERA, and, but I can't give you chapter and verse on the maturity of each individual contract, I am afraid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a bit of an update on, sorry, I am changing topics, just how are the asset sales going; I suppose, some assets that were to be divested, can you give us an update there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Matthew, I mean this is a fairly major program of asset disposals that we've got. We talked in terms of a $10 billion set of disposals back in July, August of last year, and then at the end of November, we talked of a higher number, about $15 billion. And even we mentioned the fact that interest has been shown by various potential buyers in other assets that weren't on our list, and that the overall potential of what just could conceivably been sold could be as high as $30 billion. Now, at the moment, we have a program, which is ongoing on the list, which we gave at the end of November. So a number of asset sales that are being carried out, banks have been appointed in all cases, sale of programs are underway. There is a lot of interest in these businesses. They are each of them, every single one of them, an excellent business. And we're finding that strategic buyers are queuing up for each and every one of those businesses. We think that there is no significant challenge to financing those sales or those purchases by those strategic buyers. They are able, we think, to raise money to buy these assets at good prices. And we are pursuing those processes vigorously, but this isn't a far sale. We are going to be very demanding when it comes to price in making these sales, and we see a lot of competition developing for each of these businesses. So that's where we stand on the asset sales.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Hi, Guy; hi, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a question regards to the non-core assets with a follow-up on Matt's question a little bit. In particular, the aerospace assets of Alcan, it's my understanding that the ISWA operation is a multipurpose mill, i.e., it's more than just aerospace, and I was wondering, should we conclude that these assets may be sold piecemeal or would the level of interest that you guys are seeing on strategic players indicate that there might be a single buyer for all of these &#x2013; for the entire facility if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, our preference with respect to the sale of engineered products, the business that you are talking about, is to sell the whole business as a single entity. But, nevertheless, we've got to keep our options open. and I think that ISWA, as you say, is a big plant and it does have a number of activities going on there. There are other plants in the similar place. So we just &#x2013; we are at a fairly early stage with respect to engineered products. Because of the aerospace connection, it's probably &#x2013; again it will be more complex to sell the engineered products business than many of the other businesses that we are looking at at the moment. But I can tell you there is a lot of interest in the engineered products business, which is an excellent business. And I don't think you should draw any conclusions about that. I think it's &#x2013; we are getting the process underway. We've got good advisers, and we are looking at it very carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And one follow-up question if I may. I obviously heard your comments with great interest about China, but are you concerned at all the way these things, this contagion seems to permeate that maybe the Chinese government, there is no possibility they can overzealous raising reserve requirements, raising interest rates instead of maybe seeing possibly a slowdown in other economies to see what that impact might be, could they go too far? Could they put their foot on the brake too much, Guy, and possibly cause more of a deterioration, you guys aren't seeing anything yet, but is there a risk that &#x2013; to that economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, of course, there are risks to the Chinese economic growth. We've always recognized that. And I think that you mentioned a couple of risks that exist. Overheating, clearly, is there in the certain aspects of the economy. The government has, from time-to-time, tried to apply breaks in both of the forms that you mentioned. The effects have been extremely short-lived in the past. And that's not to say that it will necessarily be like that in the future, but I think that, remember, that it's in the very strong interest of the Chinese government to continue to see very strong rates of growth. That is very important to them, and I think that it's not the contagion that you use that term, it's a term, which may be appropriate within, let us say, the U.S. financial system. It's not so obvious to me that it needs to spread to China, which is in many senses a freestanding, and we believe, detached entity. And therefore, I am not unduly concerned about the points you make. I accept there are risks. But we have a panel of experts, external academic experts, who help us with our assessment of China. And they meet regularly to assess a dashboard of the risks that we see affecting Chinese growth. And those risks are many of the ones you have mentioned, plus a lot of other risks &#x2013; social risks, political risks, and so forth. And their most recent assessment was, in fact, that risks had reduced in China, not increased, compared to the previous period studies. So, I mean, I don't say that China is without risk, but I do think that in its present condition, it is in a very different place from any of the western economies. And we remain very confident of it, and I think that a company like Rio Tinto is a particularly strong beneficiary of that development.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No doubt about it. If I may, just a follow-up quickly on copper, and I was wondering, in your expectations of the market closely and balance for slight surplus, what are your folks building in terms of supply disruption?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was there the first or second &#x2013; first week of December, meeting with government officials as well as with our partners there in Ivanhoe. I actually visited Mongolia four times in the last 12 months as part of our efforts. The new Prime Minister has put together a very good cabinet, is speaking the right language. They are &#x2013; the new Prime Minister is action-oriented, a bit more market-oriented as well. Against that, those positives, we are facing an election that is coming in June, and so we are working diligently with the government. We are engaged with them, but there is the pressure of as we get closer to that June, probably really May, early May timeframe when elections, the campaign season will kick in full tilt, will become more difficult, but then after that, we would have, hopefully, we believe, the same cabinet, the same Prime Minister to be working with. So we're very engaged with them. They are speaking the right language, but these things are never easy, but the signals are all good.</p>

          <p>Hi, just a quick one, you might have already answered it. I probably wasn't in the call. Have you mentioned how much you want to sell in the spot market, in terms of tonnage of iron ore for next year, I mean '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Alberto, I think we made an announcement, I think, you might have been just before Christmas or in the New Year, I can't remember exactly when it was. Anyway, we said 15 million tons was the plan for 2008, and so as you can see, a meaningful tonnage in what is currently a very strong spot market.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Terence Ortslan with TSO &amp; Associates.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Thanks for the review; just to come back to the Mongolian profile, is that &#x2013; the elections coming up in June, and whatever happens happens but is that of importance to the parties, especially to you, that everything has to be done before the election or we can wait, pass, see what the election results will show, and the negotiation will go on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are &#x2013; you would hear arguments on both sides from various people. There is the obvious issue that if some &#x2013; if they were able to complete an agreement into the election, they take that, the ruling party takes that in as an election issue. That is an issue for the party that is not in control and how they share that. So there are those issues that are going to crop up in the political campaign as we near the elections. The messaging that we are getting is they want to get this done. We are engaging to get it done before the elections, but it's really not an issue of whether we will but kind of win and that's what we are &#x2013; we are getting very consistent and positive messaging from various aspects, from both those in control and those not in control that there is strong desire to bring the agreement to a conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the best thing is getting the right deal done but not any deal; I agree with you. Could you make an estimate about how much a project like this, of a major size, can be increasing in capital cost as time goes on, on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis, because last time it was, like, quite, I will say, ancient numbers in terms of feasibility study and the scoping and all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ivanhoe is getting ready in the not too distant future to release some new figures on the capital cost for the project. I guess they are in a close period as we are. I can't go into too much detail. What I would say is it would not be unreasonable to accept or expect that the normal inflationary pressures that we are seeing in the capital markets for all mines, whether it be iron or a copper, whatever, are being experienced by OT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me understand, the way the deal is now is that government or entity owns 34%, and what else is there that has been changed in the public forum since the last draft agreement has been done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has not been any change as of yet in the draft agreement between the major issues that are arising or are around &#x2013; windfall profits tax, around government's share, those are an equity participation, and, potentially the smelter that would be built to process, downstream processing within countries. Those are the issues that are being discussed. Those are kind of the three big issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think I am going to have to stop the questions on Ivanhoe there if that's all right, because we are already talking about ERA here today. And could we move on. I mean either has anybody else got any more ERA-related questions, please?</p>
