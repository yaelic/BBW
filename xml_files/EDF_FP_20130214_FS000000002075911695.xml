        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being with us today, and welcome to everyone. We're going to tell you about the 2012 financial results of EDF Group. And I'll get back to that later on, but these results show a new step of progress achieved by the company. I would like to acknowledge all EDF teams and personnel who have achieved this performance, and in the current economic context, this is something that deserves to be highlighted.</p>
          <p>Let me sum up the key highlights of 2012, the lessons that we learned or we can learn. And I'd like to tell you about the main challenges for EDF in 2013 and the prospects for the group. Then Thomas Piquemal will come back on the detailed figures, naturally, and we will leave ample room for all of your questions. I imagine that in view of the topical issues currently there will be many of these questions.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the highlights for fiscal year 2012 and the key challenges for 2013. As you know for the past three years, we have demonstrated our ability to solve, one by one, the key issues that were bearing down on EDF's future. And without dwelling too much on that, let me mention the U.S., Germany, the NOME law, Italy, and a few other key topics, of course. I won't list them exhaustively, because you're all familiar with that.</p>
          <p>2012 was no exception, which give us a lot more visibility to the company, having solved these challenges, even though there's still a lot to be done, naturally for the future. In a very unfavorable context, we were able to achieve a good operational performance, which was no easy job.</p>
          <p>And the nuclear power plants have experienced a number of maintenance shutdowns that were longer than expected and planned. And in spite of the improvement of the quality and efficiency of the fleet, that explains why there was an impact on the nuclear output, which forced us to push down our output targets.</p>
          <p>In counterpart, to &#x2013; the investment for development and maintenance have borne fruit. The number of unplanned outages, and you will see that later in the details, has remained the lowest over the past decade.</p>
          <p>Then we were able to equip ourselves with a highly diversified energy mix, which is unique in the world, so that we were able to improve the total growth output at nearly 643 terawatt hours. In spite of the decline of the nuclear output of 3.8% for the reasons I mentioned, we nevertheless exceeded our targets in the U.K., with an excellent performance of the output, 60 terawatt hour, up 7.5%.</p>
          <p>Similarly, hyrdropower output rose sharply by 29% at 34.5 terawatt hour. I remind you that EDF is the first hydropower operator in Europe, and this carbon-free energy resource is, of course, essential in our energy mix.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight as well the growth of renewable energies due to the remarkable path of EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles. Let me remind you that for EDFEN, 2012 was a record year for commissioning of new wind and solar power, with 1,550 megawatt of additional capacities installed. In addition, we have invested &#x20AC;12 billion, up 12% including more than &#x20AC;8 billion in France. Among this CapEx, over &#x20AC;3 billion we devoted to modernizing and expanding our networks, up to 11% versus 2011.</p>
          <p>Investments in nuclear maintenance reached &#x20AC;2.7 billion, up 32%. For instance, we replaced three steam generators in 2012. To date, we have replaced 21 steam generators throughout the fleet in the context of the program for replacement of large components. This demonstrates, if need be, our commitment to pursue the growth of EDF for the high quality industrial equipment to secure the future of one of the top, if not the top, and the leading industrial French company, namely, EDF.</p>
          <p>We've also conducted a structuring operation for EDF and its future. We are operating in a constrained world, in a sector with strategic challenges. And in a long-term industry, this is something that must be kept in mind constantly.</p>
          <p>The cash earned, generated by operations, are, of course, the indispensible foundation to back these investments. We need to combine that with a solid financial structure to enable EDF to continue to ensure its industrial role and a financial dimension that must be in the service of the industry. A number of highly restructuring operations were successfully carried out for the future of EDF early this year, and can give us more visibility on the horizon.</p>
          <p>You're familiar with this issue of the CSPE tax. That resolved the recognition by the state of CSPE receivable for &#x20AC;5 billion. Now that it has been recognized, that gives us much more visibility. This receivable will be allocated to the dedicated assets, dedicated to the decommissioning of power plant. And in counterpart, it will enable us to withdraw &#x20AC;2.4 billion from this dedicated asset provision. In other words, the &#x20AC;5 billion will be paid into and allocated to the dedicated asset funds. &#x20AC;2.4 billion have been removed, improving sharply the group's financial position.</p>
          <p>This operation, combined with the other achievements of the fiscal year, will enable us to reduce our debt by virtually &#x20AC;2.5 billion, &#x20AC;2.4 billion more specifically, resulting from the agreements secured with the state authorities. That is for the calendar year 2012. In addition, it will enable us to reach a 100% coverage rate of dedicated asset as early as 2013 well before the deadline of June 2016, as provided by law.</p>
          <p>To be exhaustive, I'd like to highlight the success of the hybrid bond issue that was launched a few weeks ago in January. It was oversubscribed four times, and that's been a way to contribute to the funding of the industrial projects under development. I remind you that EDF is currently building the two largest industrial sites in France, the EPR at Flamanville and the LNG Terminal at Dunkerque.</p>
          <p>Don't forget as well that in 2012 we finalized the controlled takeover of Edison, and you know how important it is in our gas strategy. Favorable renegotiation of their gas contract by Edison have enabled the company to close the year in excellent conditions, as you see on the slide. Remember as well the recruitment of over 6,000 new employees in 2012, of which 2,000 are net job creation.</p>
          <p>The development and renewal of our skills, as I've always said, is one of our absolute priorities. The best proof of that comes from the nuclear sector. In order to integrate the 1,570 new hires in 2012, we have spent 2.7 million hours of training, i.e. 40% more than just three years ago. This is a major important effort. It is demanding. It is difficult effort, but it is absolutely indispensable to guarantee the future of our human resources, hence the continued sustainability of the group and its energy.</p>
          <p>This summary of the key figures shows you quickly the &#x2013; and enables you to assess the progress accomplished in 2012 in spite of a tough environment. First of all, sales revenue was up 6% in organic growth, EBITDA reaching over &#x20AC;16 billion, up 7.7%, including 4.6% on the like-for-like basis. Net income from recurring operation grew by nearly 17%, of which 5.3% attributable, and with a net debt of EBITDA ratio at 2.4, taking into account the CSPE transaction, thereby confirming our financial soundness.</p>
          <p>There again, we are keeping our commitments, since our target was to remain below 2.5 in terms of debt over EBITDA ratio. We've therefore reached the targets set for 2012. The fiscal year 2012 was positive, grows positively, since once again, we've reached all of our targets. And while the stock markets are not &#x2013; do not seem to be in a position to really assess the real value of EDF, the proposal to pay out a dividend of &#x20AC;1.15 per share represents &#x2013; is a strong signal of our trust and confidence in the future.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about the future. We are faced with key challenges, once again, and major projects. I'll describe them, of course, but they are up to par with the ambitious targets that we are keeping for 2013. Financial standpoint, we are targeting a growth of EBITDA excluding Edison between 2% and 3%.</p>
          <p>Edison, as we found in 2012, has renegotiated its gas contract quite positively, but a second wave of price revision is expected, and we are therefore faced with a volatility of results between 2013 and 2014. We remain confident on the midterm path for Edison, but there will be a shift in the final Edison, but once the negotiations are finally closed, we will give &#x2013; inform you that. But we remain perfectly confident, I repeat, on the midterm future of Edison.</p>
          <p>Our target is a debt EBITDA ratio ranging between 2 and 2.5 times, and a pay out dividend between 55% and 65% of the net current income. By the end of 2013 of course, we will have a much more detailed view of the midterm group's future. The year 2013 is expected to be tough, and therefore, we need to manage our cost base with ever more rigor and discipline, which is the purpose of the savings plan for &#x20AC;1 billion which has been announced for 2013.</p>
          <p>The net CapEx have been set at &#x20AC;12 billion, partly designed for the maintenance of our power plants, in particular nuclear plants, since we have increased output target to 410, 415 terawatt hour, taking into account seven more 10-year inspections that are planned in 2013.</p>
          <p>I'll remind you that the French nuclear power plants are 26 years old on average, which is relatively young versus other nuclear fleets in the world. The quality of the fleet, of course, resides primarily in a continuous integration of technical improvement derived from the lessons learned from experience.</p>
          <p>We continue to improve our performance in terms of nuclear safety, the goal being to continue operation in perfect conditions, to renovate and modernize our industrial equipment. We will continue the program initiated several years ago and speed it up for the past three years. This program will generate intense industrial activity, design, engineering, plants, nuclear side, which will represent a challenge not only for EDF, but also for the national, regional, and local companies. This is actually a tremendous opportunity for France in terms of employment and industrial activity.</p>
          <p>We remind you that the French nuclear industry, the only one to operate in a fully integrated model, is a major component of the French industry, accounting for 6.1% of the French industrial employment and total revenue of over &#x20AC;46 billion. In the U.K., our second domestic market, our ambition is to repeat the excellent performance achieved in 2012. Lastly, in a continuum with 2012 we will hire 6,000 more people during fiscal year 2013, and once again EDF will create 2,000 net jobs, new jobs.</p>
          <p>Whether from the financial perspective or skills, in view of the challenges ahead of us, being ready demands that we perfectly anticipate our needs, and we are determined to do so. So financial perspective, skills perspective, well, EDF will achieve its ambition, and in the next coming years 2013, 2014, and 2015, we will achieve the performance that you expect of us.</p>
          <p>In 2013 the first key challenge is the redefinition of the parameters of the economic and pricing equation that underpins all the questions and debates ongoing regarding changes in the energy landscape over the coming years, particularly in the short term. And that is a challenge where we are mobilizing extensively. We'll discuss that again.</p>
          <p>The second key challenge for fiscal year 2013 is, of course, the British nuclear new build, an industrial and financial stake of major importance where we will have to take the right decision. Let me dwell a few minutes on the changes in the energy landscape, a debate that is just currently underway in France with stakes that go well beyond the French borders of course.</p>
          <p>EDF is the only integrated operator operating in all technologies, and by definition EDF will be a key player of these changes. As with any topic of concern to us, the industrial facet and financial facets are closely linked. And the key questions we need to respond to affect many, many stakeholders with interests that are sometimes converging, sometimes diverging.</p>
          <p>What is certain is that everyone agrees on the necessity of preserving the environment and preserving the energy independence of France. And of course, no one will challenge our prime and priority target namely to produce a safe, low-carbon, available and competitive electricity.</p>
          <p>The ongoing national debate on the energy transition in France, with the first findings to be delivered in June 2013, will necessarily be complex, since its consequences will affect these equilibriums. Our key asset is our model as integrated energy operators. That gives us a broad vision on the components of the pricing equation, said differently on the consumer bill. Remind you that the high proportion of nuclear output in the domestic electricity is the only reason enabling highly competitive prices for residential and corporate customers. This is a key asset for the competitiveness of France, even taking into account the full cost of nuclear power estimated at 49.5 by the French Cour des Comptes in January 2012.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, the new formula of the ARENH price will enable a convergence towards this full cost of ownership by 2015 based on the principle established by the NOME law. And that's good news again. In 2013, we're going to speak again about the NOME law, but more generally, the equilibriums of the pricing structure need to be revamped while preserving the interests of the residential and industrial customers, as we've always said.</p>
          <p>The cancellation by the French Council of State last November of the distribution tariffs for the period 2009 to 2013, the so-called TURPE 3, that cancellation by the Council of State proves that the calculation method for the TURPE price is not adapted. We are consequently confronted today to an inconsistency between the accounting reality, the contractual reality between ERDF and the concession authorities, and the pricing reality of ERDF.</p>
          <p>Our challenge for 2013 in this respect will be triple. First of all, we need to trace the way for public authorities to adopt a pricing strategy capable of giving more visibility to the entire industry and stakeholders. And consequently, we will need to define the conditions for a change in the future ARENH price. Lastly, we will need to work to revamp the ERDF business model.</p>
          <p>Another key, of course, challenge will be taking the right decision on the nuclear new builds in the U.K. A very quick update, perhaps, on the progress. On the Hinkley Point C project, the first site that is concerned by nuclear new builds, and we can be quite satisfied with the major progress made in 2012. I won't list them out. You're familiar with that as well. I would like, however, to highlight the fact that EDF was granted certification by the British nuclear safety authorities in new points, first of all, the project organization for construction and operation of the site and last December the certification on the EPI design.</p>
          <p>We can only make a commitment in a responsible and final manner if all the contractual, economic, and profitability conditions of our investment are fulfilled. The final decisive step on an agreement is the agreement you'll find with the British government relative to the so-called contract for difference, namely the price guaranteed for the buy-back of the energy produced. As you know, negotiations are ongoing with the British government. They're quite intensive, and most likely this should be closed by the end of the first quarter 2013.</p>
          <p>Once this agreement has been reached and the guarantee of its acceptability by Brussels, since the EU will have a say in it, then we can start searching for partners to work jointly with us, both on the financial aspect and the industrial side. And this will, of course, facilitate this approach. Only after this initial step can we be in a position to take a final decision of this investment.</p>
          <p>I can sum it up by saying yes, we do have an interest in the British nuclear new build. We've demonstrated that interest, since we've already invested &#x20AC;480 million. Yes, we would be legitimate considering our existing presence and our position in the country. We are the leading electricity operator in the U.K. Yes, we enjoy the best expertise in the world to fulfill it. But no, we will not go there without any formal guarantee of return on our investment for the benefit of EDF and its shareholders.</p>
          <p>So, as you see, we have major challenges ahead of us for 2013. We've already carried out successfully several other challenges, while some had been somewhat skeptical regarding our ability to meet these challenges.</p>
          <p>Regarding the financial soundness of the company since 2009, let me highlight that we significantly boosted the group's financial position since 2009. The graph you have here attests to that. Within three years, the net income from recurring operations has grown 7.5%, and the net debt has declined by 7.8% over the same period. By comparison with any other players, we will take the comparisons without any problem.</p>
          <p>Let me say this quite simply:   Trust us. Don't be afraid. We are much too aware of our responsibility to ensure that EDF, one of the most outstanding French company, if not the most outstanding, to ensure the future that it deserves. EDF is a chance for France, and we will continue in full serenity, but with great determination, to endorse this responsibility.</p>
          <p>I'll now give the floor to Thomas Piquemal, who will detail the figures.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I'll now present a detailed review of our earnings in 2012 and outlook for 2013. I speak first about the key figures, our sales up by 11.4%, EBITDA up by 7.7% at &#x20AC;14.9 million, so respectively on a like-for-like basis at 5.8% and 4.6%. EBITDA 4.6%, that's mid-range as we indicated last year, between 4% and 6%. Net income group share at 5.3% at 16.9% for a net income excluding than recurring items double-digits growth for the third consecutive year, 11% in 2010, 13% in 2011, and 16.9% in 2012. There, too, our performance is better than expected because our range was between 5% and 10%.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt at &#x20AC;39.2 billion including the allocation of the CSPE receivables in the dedicated assets portfolio and the withdrawal of &#x20AC;2.4 billion in assets, and this is what reduces the debt, which pro forma as of December 30, 2012, is at &#x20AC;39.2 billion, meaning a net financial debt over EBITDA of 2.4, below our guideline set, which was obtained at 30 of June at 2.2 times. This does not include the production of hybrid at &#x20AC;6.2 billion. The ratio is about 2 times debt over EBITDA if we were to include this issue.</p>
          <p>Let me now present you the details, starting with the growth in EBITDA on the like-for-like basis 4.6%. The scope effect positive &#x20AC;460 billion (sic) [million] (25:27) due to the first full consolidation as of the end of May for our subsidiary Edison and also a favorable foreign exchange on the pound sterling in the U.K., with &#x20AC;166 billion (sic) [million] (25:29) in addition. Italy &#x20AC;137 million, the U.K. minus &#x20AC;30 million, but this does not translate the excellent operational performance in the U.K. in 2012.</p>
          <p>You may recall that we already explained this accounting phenomenon dating back to the acquisition of British Energy and the re-evaluation of the opening balance sheet at British Energy. The accounting effects will possibly start of this year, the effects are reversed with the negative impact on EDF &#xC9;nergies results, at &#x20AC;166 million, but you will see that the performance was extremely favorable in 2012. Other segment, down by &#x20AC;159 million due to unfavorable effects in United States and in Brazil versus 2011.</p>
          <p>EBITDA up by 7.6% (sic) [7.7%] (26:40), the 7% increase is also leads to a 7.6% in current EBITDA versus 4.6%. You can see that the growth in EBITDA excluding non-recurring items translates a significant impact in the group's investments.</p>
          <p>EBIT down by 2.4% at &#x20AC;8.245 million, but net income is up primarily due to improvement in the group's financial expenses in 2012 versus 2011, at &#x20AC;3.362 billion down by 11% versus &#x20AC;3.780 billion in 2012. We had the recognition of the historical CSPE, the total carryover of CSPE receivables, but this line also includes the increase in the discount to present value due to the drop in our rates in 2012, plus 5.3% in net income group share.</p>
          <p>But we processed for exceptional items, tax-free, &#x20AC;900 million. The increase is 16.9%. What are these elements? Some were known as of the 30 June. Non-recurring items net of tax, others, in the second part of the year, primarily the impairment of our CENG activities in the United States, our minority stakes in nuclear fleet from the Constellation transaction in 2009, the impairment and the drop in the price of electricity due to the gas situation, as you know, in the United States.</p>
          <p>Once again in 2012, we were forced to note an impairment of goodwill for Alpiq, a company listed in Switzerland, where the group holds 25%. This is a minority stake. And as I have said before, once again, we must record a charge on this line, and we unfortunately note, possibly at this stage, a deterioration of the situation. &#x20AC;900 million overall in non-recurring items net of tax, explaining the difference between the book results and our income net of recurring items.</p>
          <p>So minus 16 terawatt hours leading to a drop in margin to the extent of &#x20AC;635 million offset by sharp rise in hydropower plus &#x20AC;357 million, tariffs as well, also for ERDF with the tariff plus &#x20AC;298 million, also market prices plus &#x20AC;240 million. We're talking about the drop in the market price in 2012, because EDF is a net buyer on the market. And since EDF must also cope with its purchase requirements, when market prices decline, EDF's margin improves versus 2011, thus enabling us to generate &#x20AC;240 million in additional margin.</p>
          <p>OpEx at 3.1%, in line in 2012 in the context with significant investments in the renewal of scales, in the renewal of industrial tools. We also saw the end of a certain number of long-term contracts, amongst which we had to sell at a price that was below market prices, giving us an additional margin of &#x20AC;238 million.</p>
          <p>I'll skip others, the end of the TaRTAM mechanism which luckily has disappeared. Just to point out that in 2012, we recovered what I spoke of, partly, one year ago. It was a regularization of the TaRTAM mechanism, a mechanism that is now over with, and I will not speak about it any further.</p>
          <p>Electricity, our electricity balance and nuclear production on the left-hand side at the bottom, 405 terawatt hours, down 16 versus the previous year, a drop that was offset by a better performance of hydropower, a higher level than in the previous year, but also the good management of our hydropower inventories at the end of 2011, and also an improvement in the fossil-fired.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, a few comments maybe about new developments. All in all, the volume is up by 13 terawatt hours because of the increase in the volume sold by the NOME law, six to one, meaning plus 30 terawatt hours more than in 2011, because this mechanism existed only for six months in 2011. In terms of consumption, up by 7 terawatt hours due to climate, for about 13 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>The balance shows, well, when you reprocess for the climate effects and other effects, the consumption is relatively stable in 2012 for EDF. Nuclear production, down by 16 terawatt hours. We have positive and negative impacts. Amongst the negative impacts, we have the extension of outages due to additional controls, especially on the N4, the most powerful section, and the extension of outages due to technical incidents during maintenance programs that are constantly increasing over several years now.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, this heavy duty investments and replacements of large equipment is bearing its fruits, because once again in 2012, the loss of production due to damages is very minimal versus what the group experienced at the start of the year 2000. Less program shutdowns and also because of the climate, at the end of the year, we modulated downwards nuclear production, so minus 16 terawatt hours versus the previous year all-in-all.</p>
          <p>Room &#x2013; areas for improvement of output, I will plain identify that I'm referring to the ability to improve our control over plant outages by stabilizing the volumes of preventive maintenance without calling into question our investment programs. In 2012, we saw that this was essential to ensure nuclear performance that is quite remarkable. But we have clearly identified, once again, areas for improvement, and this is why whereas we have a planned outage program with seven 10-year inspections versus six before, this is why we have set a target of increasing our nuclear output between 410 and 415 terawatt hours versus 405 in 2012.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we benefited from a rise in the hydropower, as you can see. Quarter-by-quarter, 2011 was quite dry. In blue, as you can see, the rain below average, whereas in red, we can see that we are in the historical average. And the start of this year, I must say for January at any rate, when it comes to hydrolicity will certainly bring a very good first quarter.</p>
          <p>For the U.K., as I said in my introduction, I spoke about the performance displayed in our books showing, on a like-for-like basis, a decline of 1.5. And as you can see on the second line before the end, this is mainly due to the fair value revaluation related to the acquisition of British Energy with the consolidation of British Energy in our books. So, performance up by 7.5% because EDF &#xC9;nergies in 2012 saw a remarkable nuclear production, 60 terawatt hours, the highest nuclear output for the past seven years, bearing witness to the efforts made to improve the production since the acquisition of British Energy in 2008.</p>
          <p>You can see it clearly here on the left-hand side, plus 4 terawatt hours versus the previous year, but at the bottom left, plus 6 terawatt hours for fossil-fired. And of course, the spreads were more favorable, thus enabling us to call on fossil-fired plants, but also because of the higher availability of our facilities in 2012 versus 2011, enabling us therefore to benefit from a favorable market in the U.K.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, we can see trends that do not call for any comments apart from the structured sales, down by 8 terawatt hours according to existing contracts and a certain number of other contracts in Italy. Edison reported its figures last week. I'd just like to point out organic growth as reflected in our accounts, because we account for Edison 100% since May 2012. But this full consolidation in the second half that allows us to take on 100% of the effect of the renegotiation of gas contracts, explaining the good performance and the good contribution plus 23% on a like-for-like basis in 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me also point out you have noted that in Edison's financial reporting that Edison's net debt dropped by &#x20AC;1.3 billion as compared to the previous situation that we found with our partners, &#x20AC;1.3 billion. That's a bit more than the income from the disposal of Edi Power. As of the 30th of June, I pointed out that the debt reduction was not felt to the same extent due to the unfavorable trends in working capital requirements. So we're back to normal. Edison's debt truly reflects the income from the disposal of Edi Power, even in terms of working capital requirements. Certain efforts have been made in terms of payment schedules.</p>
          <p>Very briefly now with respect to the electricity balance at Edison, which marginally reflects trends noted on the Italian market for electricity, with a drop in demand and increase in renewable energies. And in the middle, we have a combined gas cycle, CCGT, a difficult year. Since the disposal of Edi Power, we are less affected by these trends on the Italian electricity market in 2012.</p>
          <p>On other international, as I said before, performance is down by 90.5% on the like-for-like basis, mainly due to negative trends in Poland, a drop in margins because of the rise in fuel prices, changes that are quite unfavorable in terms of the regulation environment in United States with shrinking prices, the drop in the contribution of this minority stake which we hold in the nuclear fleet of former Constellation, and despite the efforts we made in other activities linked to nuclear in United States and more particularly UniStar.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, it's hard to compare with 2011, and this is what explains the drop in our Brazilian activities. In 2011, we benefited from a remarkable performance linked to certain exports to neighboring countries. As I explained before in the first quarter, there was a maintenance shutdown that was fully planned, but of course, cost us somewhat in terms of power generation.</p>
          <p>For other activities, performance is up by 4.7%, primarily due to EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles, which this year installed over 1,550 megawatts, a record in terms of gross commissioning before disposals, and you can see that EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles' EBITDA is up by 20.6% in 2012 versus 2011. The EDF trading down by 20%, in line with our budget. 2011 saw a remarkable performance, in the United States in particular, thanks to the climate during summer 2011.</p>
          <p>So, those were the details on the various countries, and now by cash flow. EBITDA up by 7.7%, operating cash flow up by almost 20% before investments, thereby translating, as you can see in the second line of this chart, translating, therefore, the fact that EBITDA this year saw a higher level of cash flow thanks to a drop in non-cash items in EBITDA, reflecting the quality of the group's EBITDA in 2012.</p>
          <p>Net of investments, cash flow is negative by &#x20AC;1.798 billion <mark type="ph" /> but I like to stop at (40:57) 2 points. This negative figure, &#x20AC;1.798 billion, includes the increase in working capital due to the CSPE, &#x20AC;1.4 billion. That's an old story. We have went through that before. If we eliminate the CSPE, which will no longer occur, we have a negative cash flow of &#x20AC;400 million. Out of this &#x20AC;400 million, we have the impact of the payment to ENEL from its withdrawal from Flamanville to the extent of &#x2013; because we repaid &#x20AC;600 million this year for its contribution. These are the main figures for our negative cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the other aggregates, working capital requirements in particular, we are in line and cash flow, setting aside CSPE, is close to zero. Net investments are rising sharply, up by 12%, with a constant effort in France for power generation plants, the grids, and also in renewable energies. As you can see in the United Kingdom, a certain number of projects including renewable energies and also development projects in nuclear.</p>
          <p>So all in all, the same proportion of investments in regulated and non-regulated activities, 70% versus 30%, with one-third of group investments focusing on future development. Bearing in mind, the &#x20AC;1.8 billion in negative cash flow, for the reasons I indicated before, due to investments CSPE and the ENEL withdrawal dividend payouts. This is the first full consolidation of Edison's debt. Before we only consolidated 30%, &#x20AC;3.3 billion including the cost of Edison was a listed company. These are the main reasons that explained increasing our debt.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, this year, taking into account the operation we announced to allocate CSPE in 2013 to dedicated activities and the &#x20AC;2.4 billion, so pro forma is negative by &#x20AC;1.7 billion. We will be withdrawing $1.7 billion from the dedicated assets portfolio, giving us a net pro forma debt of &#x20AC;39.2 billion at the end of December 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks to the CSPE allocation, from the beginning of the year, we will cover 100% of the decommissioning provision that must covered by dedicated asset. You see the pro forma figure here. &#x20AC;20.1 billion is exactly the amount of provisions that must be covered. Let me highlight the excellent performance of the portfolio managed by EDF plus 12% increase on the value of the bond and security portfolio during 2012.</p>
          <p>So overall, for the dedicated asset portfolio, an excellent performance. So that was it for the financial results for 2012. Thanks to the CSPE, the allocation to dedicated asset. Thanks also to this withdrawal of &#x20AC;2.4 billion. Thanks to the hybrid bond issue. That has enabled us to start 2013 with a solid financial position.</p>
          <p>Outlook for 2013, there are key challenges for the group ahead of us, as Chairman Proglio said earlier. I've listed four key challenges here. I'll try to explain each one of them. I'm not going to explain what our goals are to solve them. I'm not going to explain how we'll be working on it, how we have been working on them for several years.</p>
          <p>What I want is to explain what the stakes are precisely, starting first of all with the billing systems, the pricing system. How is it built, and what is the challenge ahead of us that needs to be tackled? That is the pricing &#x2013; building the pricing for the electricity tariffs in France. What you have here broken down on the left side as compared on the right side, the red curve with the evolution of our investment. This red curve represents maintenance investment in our generation fleet in France.</p>
          <p>Few words about the break down of the left side, to tell you how the bill is broken down. &#x20AC;143 is what the residential customer pays. Out of which once you remove taxes, VAT, once you've removed the CSPE utility tax, transport, TURPE, once you remove the selling cost and that includes the cost of energy efficiency services, you remove this shape factor, i.e. what has to be bought on the wholesale market to cover peak consumptions, then you end up with a baseload generation which accounts for 27% of the consumer bill, which is &#x20AC;38 per megawatt hour as compared with a total &#x20AC;143 per megawatt hour. Less than 10%, in other words is the baseload generation proportion.</p>
          <p>What is the challenge and what do we need to work? This proportion, 27%, &#x20AC;38, that is the baseload proportion. That enables to finance our investment in our generation fleet in France. When you compare evolutions in the trends over this past three years, that's the blue bars on the right side, you see that the energy proportion of the tariff is down, because at constant increase of the bill itself, taxes increase, the TURPE, third-party access price increases, and sales cost increase. And what is left for us to invest in our generation fleet is going down. That is the pricing, or the tariff problem and challenge. This is what we call our tariff equation, and this is one of the key priorities to work in 2013.</p>
          <p>The second key priority and challenge is to gain more visibility by the ARENH formula that, in 2013, should set the price at which we sell our energy to our competitors, in line with the NOME law. I won't detail it, but today we're selling at &#x20AC;42 per megawatt hour to our competitors, which of course does not reflect the full cost of ownership of our generation fleet that has been evaluated at nearly &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour by the Cour des Comptes. There, again, is another priority, and that is to work on this new decree that will settle the ARENH price in 2013.</p>
          <p>Third key challenge, that is a challenge linked to the distributors' lack of consistency between the contractual model with the concession authorities. We need consistency with the accounting model as well. And these inconsistencies were illustrated by the decision of the Council of State to cancel the TURPE 3 system, which has no impact on our 2012 results. But this decision underlines and illustrates the complexity and the inconsistencies. Of course, one of our priorities in the TURPE 4, the fourth regulation period, our target is to improve visibility and consistency.</p>
          <p>Fourth key priority that is up to us only is the launch of a savings plan for &#x20AC;1 billion. We're not talking five years from now, we're not looking at re-engineering, or revamping or reorganizing things entirely. We will &#x2013; that revamping of many processes has already been started several years ago under the so called Synergies and Transformation plan to gain synergies within the group by integrating foreign subsidiaries. What we're talking here is a cost reduction plan with immediate effect in 2013, covering primarily our purchasing, of course. But the target is to reduce all group purchasings by 5%, combined actions on prices, specifications, and volume.</p>
          <p>We're talking about a cost reduction of &#x20AC;1 billion expenses, investments expenses and so on as early as 2013. So we can announce an EBITDA growth between 0% and 3%, excluding Edison. Two words about Edison, they confirmed their normative profitability of their business equivalent to 2012, i.e. &#x20AC;1.1 billion in EBITDA. Nevertheless, the volatility of Edison's results is linked to the calendar of renegotiation for gas contracts.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we were successful with this renegotiation, but we had to start a new wave of arbitration on the same contracts. This should probably be completed in 2014, and that's why our 2013 forecasts are not taking into account the results of this arbitration.</p>
          <p>In any case, the margin is negative for the time being, but you see we have a negative margin of &#x20AC;600 million for the time being with the existing contracts, which will be deferred and postponed. But that margin will be carried forward in 2014. It changes nothing to the normative profitability of Edison, as we have analyzed, and in line with our expectations during the Edison transaction last year.</p>
          <p>Excluding these items of volatility and using the foundation of 2013, i.e. &#x20AC;500 million for Edison in EBITDA, our targets excluding Edison and its volatility are as follows:  growth of EBITDA ranging from 0% to 3%, 3% thanks in particular to the savings plan, the Sparks savings plan that will take effect in 2013. Net debt to EBITDA ratio will be in the range of 2 to 2.5 times, and after the hybrid bond issue, we'll probably be closer to 2 times rather than 2.5.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the payout rate on net income, 55% to 65% will be the dividend payout. In view of the key challenges that I mentioned, you will understand why at this point I'm going beyond 2013 for this outlook. But we'll meet again at the end of this year to look at the prospects and outlook beyond 2013 up to 2015. And this outlook should enable us to return to our goal, and I will detail this outlook in greater details at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
          <p>The floor is open to questions.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question from Credit Suisse, I have three questions. The first one has to do with the transition between EBITDA between the two years. ERDF impact, you isolated the tariff proportion, and can you explain how you spread the impact on ERDF?</p>
          <p>Can we get back to Edison in my second question? What do you expect in terms of EBITDA for 2013? How are you structuring the renegotiations on gas contracts? And third question on dividend, you decided to offer the investors the possibility of subscribing in shares. Will that be continued in the future in terms of dividend payout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so in ERDF, &#x20AC;298 million is a positive effect of the TURPE price. Other effect &#x20AC;253 million due to a set of various items, let me mention a few:  higher revenue in the connections slightly below &#x20AC;200 million. In the context of the NOME law, we &#x2013; EDF was able to bill some of the connections, particularly for renewable energy, which increases the contribution of this particular business.</p>
          <p>Second effect is lower market prices, which has decreased the losses when &#x2013; for power purchases. Edison, &#x20AC;500 million &#x2013; no excuse me let me get back to the ERDF. Performance, of course, is linked to good control over operating expenses, naturally, which is one reason why we can forecast this EBITDA growth for the distributor.</p>
          <p>Edison, &#x20AC;500 million is our internal forecast, and I say it is the foundation for 2013. It does not reflect the inherent performance of the company as such of &#x20AC;1.1 billion, as I have shown you in my slide. And that doesn't reflect the fact that, at least from our standpoint, it is abnormal to sell gas at a loss on the market, and it's not provided in our contracts. We must be able to earn normal margin. Negative margins is not normal. When you lose over &#x20AC;600 million by selling gas on the market, it is abnormal. This is why we believe that &#x20AC;500 million is not a normative performance. However, this is the number that we have kept in our forecast for 2013. Naturally, in 2014, there will be a sharp growth of the EBITDA at Edison, provided that we are successful on the renegotiation for gas contracts.</p>
          <p>On your last question, the option that is given to our shareholders for dividend payment in shares, we're talking about &#x20AC;0.10 per share. This is an increase of the dividend that will be proposed to the shareholders meeting between &#x20AC;1.15 and &#x20AC;1.25. So the option given to the shareholders is related to &#x20AC;0.10 per share only to take the option of being paid in shares. The rest will, of course, be paid in cash, &#x20AC;1.15. This &#x20AC;0.10 which is an increase, the shareholders can take it either in cash or in equity at the option of the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A question from Emmanuel Turpin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. In your Spark program, you mentioned that there was an economic cost and a CapEx component. Can you give us an approximate breakdown between OpEx and CapEx? Your EBITDA guidance and net income from recurring operations among &#x2013; the CSPE item of course is a non-recurring item, so it will disappear, obviously. I imagine we can expect increased depreciation. Can you give us more information on what you expect on fixed cost particularly for the year?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, can you get back on the dividends policy? Now, you have a payout between 55% and 65% of net income from recurring operation. You are at the lower end of the bracket for the time being in 2012. We can &#x2013; I guess we can expect a decline of this net income. Can you commit to at least having a flat payout and stable payout, at least in absolute value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question CapEx, OpEx, 40/60, that would be the breakdown in line with the spread of our purchases in the group. As I said, 5% of our purchases, complete total purchases, then minus 10% is what the Sparks program covers.</p>
          <p>Now, are you asking me to give you an EBITDA for 2013? Let me just tell you that, yes, of course, say it's &#x20AC;100 million. That is the proceeds from the CSPE allowance that will be a significant income. Of course, it will offset the deficit that we have borne for several years, including in 2012. Nevertheless, it is true that &#x20AC;400 million net of tax is what will be contributed by the net proceeds of &#x20AC;629 million.</p>
          <p>And we had unfavorable effects from the impairment rates that went down. I won't give you my forecast for 2013 EBITDA, but I am comfortable with the net income consensus that is announced today, and given by the average numbers by analysts. For 2012, we are in the bracket that is planned for the dividend payout, and if you apply that bracket for 2013, you end up with &#x20AC;1.15 per share. No comment beyond on that.</p>
          <p>We are committed to a bracket 55%-65% of the net income from recurring operations, and we have kept that commitment in 2012. We were at 60% of payout rates on the 2011 results. We went down to 55% for 2012, but we are perfectly right in that bracket, and that is the important thing for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions as well. First of all, have you set an availability rate for nuclear plants for this year or the future? Have you abandoned the idea of a target for the availability rates? Could you also give us figures?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to the possible guarantee on credits for the Hinkley Point project in the U.K., as well as spoken about in the press in the U.K., to attract investors for this new project? Do you consider that such a guarantee would be indispensible, desirable? And to what extent would you, at what level would you accept this guarantee?</p>
          <p>My third point about the withdrawal of dedicated assets, the &#x20AC;2.4 billion is the same amount as RTE assets, if I understand correctly. RTE assets are still amongst dedicated assets. Can you tell me more about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding nuclear output, of course we have various objectives or parameters that we must bear in mind. Availability rate should improve in 2013. There was a decline in 2012 due to shutdowns. The important thing is the availability factor in the winter time, which is much more important for us.</p>
          <p>91.6% availability rate in winter 2011-2012. In January, we are already at 92.5%, so an ambitious target for our winter availability factor, thus lowering the average Kd, which is still a benchmark, but as less significant or less relevant for our own operations. At the same time in addition to that, the availability factor is good, but nuclear output is important as well. It dropped in 2012, and we expect a new increase. Earlier, I pointed out that we expected nuclear output to rise in 2013 despite the seven 10-year inspections scheduled.</p>
          <p>Regarding the U.K., I would let Thomas answer the question about that guarantee. As I said before, the U.K. is really essential when it comes to decisions to be taken in 2013. Negotiations are underway with the public authorities, and based on these negotiations, negotiations of the contract that, by definition, we'll be able to guide our own decision. And once the decision is taken by EDF, by virtue of the contract, the expected yield, and industrial and financial considerations, I feel very much at ease as regards our ability to find partners. Some have already come to step forward, but we expect to have more visibility about the contract before talking to them.</p>
          <p>This is a time when it would not be efficient to speak with potential partners without being able to answer their questions because negotiations are pending. Three or four years ago, it was different. We're starting from scratch. Today, we're just on the eve of reaching a decision, and it is more reasonable to wait for the various parameters of the decision to be known before meeting with potential partners. Once again, some have already stepped forward.</p>
          <p>So now more details maybe on the financing, well, I believe that you're referring here to the possibility to benefit from financing for infrastructures as offered by the U.K. public authorities. Of course this can be important for a project such as Hinkley Point, but at this point, it's too early for us to make any comments on the financing structure, since, as Henri Proglio just pointed out, the most important thing is the contractual environment, finalizing negotiations on the contract. And once finalized, once the contract is well known in terms of its price, but also the main contractual clauses, we can finalize our financing structure, our search for partners, the infrastructure debt and the guarantee that may be a part in the U.K. contract. It's being reviewed, but I cannot comment any further on that at this stage.</p>
          <p>You also asked about dedicated assets, RTE, asked about the value of RTE. That's true, the net book value of RTE, since RTE is accounted for for its net book value 50%. Now, dedicated assets, as I said, we have &#x20AC;20 billion, &#x20AC;2.4 billion for RTE, &#x20AC;4.9 billion CSPE receivables, the remaining invested in equities and bonds.</p>
          <p>The important thing for us since 2010 is to set up in this portfolio an infrastructure block. We consider that infrastructures because of the lower risk have a lower risk than other asset classes, a greater visibility, and therefore perfectly correspond to the liabilities we're supposed to cover, I'm referring here to long-term liabilities. The board voted in favor of a 20% increase in infrastructures. They're talking about &#x20AC;4 billion, so RTE for &#x20AC;2.4 billion is part of this infrastructure group that we have set up.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we were selected by Total in an exclusive agreement to acquire potentially a share in TGR, the gas transport networks in the south of France in TIGF, with partners of Italian Snam. If we make this investment, it will naturally find its place in this infrastructure portfolio amongst the dedicated assets fund that has CSPE that has nothing to do with the infrastructures dedicated to infrastructures, or RTE which is in this fund because it's a fabulous infrastructure fund, probably one of the finest infrastructure funds in France at present.</p>
          <p>Maybe I could take a few questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question number four, first. <mark type="ph" /> Armin from Chesswiz (1:09:44) Corporate Investors. One question about CapEx, you gave your guidance for 2013, 2014, and 2015. What could you tell us today about the main components, &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles, ERDF, and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, &#x20AC;12 billion investments in CapEx in 2013. The breakdown? Well, the breakdown is about the same once again, &#x20AC;12 billion which is less than the previous figures I presented in 2011. For 2013, this figure is net of disposals every year. The amount of disposals are made in corporate activities, real estate, and so on. In 2012, we disposed of Exelon.</p>
          <p>As for the rest, we still have the main types of investments as regards development &#x20AC;1 billion in net investments. What we see here is &#x20AC;2 billion, because we are referring to gross CapEx before disposal of assets. I stressed that point. Considerable efforts made by teams at EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles in 2012 which will take place, for a lesser extent given the market, but in 2013, an effort to produce fleet and to dispose of them.</p>
          <p>So &#x20AC;2 billion gross installed in 1,550 megawatt gross, but net is about half. In 2012, it is 1.1 in net investments and 2013, about &#x20AC;1 billion, but without reducing the pace of growth, which is strong given the quality of teams at EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles. The same priorities, the same figures, &#x20AC;12 billion, thanks to this same volume of disposals, about &#x20AC;1 billion in 2013.</p>
          <p>Let me point out that the strategy at EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles in this fast-growing business, in renewable &#xC9;nergies, that is, consists in holding the expertise and the experience as regards to developing power-generating plants. And the rest for assets management, it could be there at the start of a project development, to build it and to carry it out and then you dispose of it while keeping your management, dedicated management, of these industrial assets.</p>
          <p>This is the system at EDF EN, which consists in optimizing the development of new energy capacities around the world wherever these projects have an industrial meaning and are economically viable to enable development and then to dispose of it as a financial asset and while keeping dedicated management, thereby optimizing all of the components, industrial, technical, financial and services which are fundamental as regards our expertise, experience with the perfect integration, therefore, with EDF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about ERDF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For ERDF, the net investments rose by over 10% in 2012, with the special efforts as regards to quality of networks. We expect an increase in 2013 also. Above and beyond 2013, I won't give you the new figures in terms of our CapEx. We'll tell you at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, the distributors model has been reviewed. Certain studies are underway, changes in tariffs, contracts, and it is hence difficult to give you precise figures for 2013, but significant efforts were made in 2012. And as you can see, the constant efforts by the company have shown us significant improvement in our net income since 2009 when it showed a loss of &#x20AC;800 million in 2012. Constantly progressing throughout the year, so we'll continue to invest but the performance has been achieved and this will continue.</p>
          <p>Once again, while discussing certain parameters of the economy for our team, also the quality of service constantly improving. The cut-outs have dropped significantly in recent years. We must pay tribute to teams at ERDF. We are the reference public service operator. ERDF plays its role, like all other group entities, upstream in terms of power generation, downstream in commerce and optimization and on the grids.</p>
          <p>One challenge as well is to enable France to have a flexible and efficient tool, especially by integrating alternative &#xC9;nergies that are a problem around the world and for us, things to be working quite smoothly. So it's all consistent part and parcel of a global vision. These are very important challenges in terms of quality of service and the efficiency of the overall system and the figures show an economic performance that is improving significantly, as we saw earlier, as well an industrial performance and a level of service that's constantly improving. Both go hand in hand, and we must stress that.</p>
          <p>We will continue &#x2013; of course, we will not give a lot of precise figures while negotiations are still underway. You can understand. We can only commit ourselves to steady growth in our performance without saying more. We'll be more transparent once the new conditions have been identified.</p>
          <p>A question on the Internet, if you wish. We'll come back to you in the room, but so as not to despair our listeners on the Internet.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you tell us if the &#x20AC;1 billion in savings in 2013 includes Edison's gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That has nothing to do with the negotiation of gas contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A question about the hybrid debt, question put by Goldman Sachs, what will we use the &#x20AC;6 billion in hybrid debt that we've issued recently for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 55/65 payout ratio, this is applied to net income before the hybrid issues. Well, this issue will be used to refinance EDF's debt. We have a program for regular issues for 2013 and 2014, more in 2014 than in 2013. Two years will be a bit busier than in 2010 and 2011 because of significant acquisitions made in 2008 and 2009 that were financed over a five-year period in 2012 and 2013. We must therefore finance a high level of debt. And this hybrid issue will give us the liquidity to help to refinance this.</p>
          <p>Will we use this to buy back our debt? As I said, no, it's for refinancing. The payout ratio, 55%, 65% applies to the net income before recurring items. The hybrid debt is classified as equity on the IFRS. The cost of hybrid is therefore in equity and does not reduce our earnings and will not be a part of our net income before non-recurring items.</p>
          <p>So the 55%, 65% applies to our income according to IFRS, standards not retreated.</p>

          <p>A question on Edison. Edison has already negotiated the contracts for gas. Would they have to be renegotiated again for RasGas and will it be done in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. These contracts must be renegotiated again. Here, I talked about the favorable arbitrage obtained by the group Edison, but that relates to a tariff, or a purchase premium that ended in September 2012. This is why need to start a new arbitrage period for a new period of gas purchases and we'll probably have the results in 2014 unless an agreement we reach in 2013. But as a matter of caution, we do not provide for that profit in our forecast for EBITDA for 2013.</p>

          <p>Question, Sofia Savvantidou. What is the vision of the regulator and the auditors regarding the allocation of the CSPE into the dedicated asset portfolio and the fact that it is not a liquid amount, the CSPE receivable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the RTE is an infrastructure asset. I won't get back to the reasons why we allocated 50% of that. CSPE is very liquid. We have a schedule for this day to pay us, i.e., until 2018 so this is a liquid asset, and this is why the regulator has approved the allocation to the dedicated asset portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question on Edison, from RBS. Do you intend to centralize for funding Edison at EDF Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Edison will benefit from the full contribution of EDF Group in terms of funding, yes, but not just for funding purposes. Then we have no intention to cut off our relationships with our major Italian financial partners. And these are two goals. Actually, there's probably we even associated them in the group's transactions. So we will keep in line with these two goals to manage the funding need for Edison at the best cost for the group, obviously. So you could imagine that this would involve some sort of centralization.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On that credit line, are you comfortable with your available credit lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer is yes, we're comfortable with our available credit lines. We have &#x20AC;9 billion in available lines, including four syndicated loans. And I believe that this is very sufficient in terms of liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, do you intend to return &#x2013; to get back on the hybrid bond market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said to previous investors road show when we launched the hybrid bond, I believe that the hybrid bond is perfectly adapted to EDF's business, which is a long-term cycle of investment. It will enable the financing of the group's extension that need to be funded without generated any EBITDA on the long term. So the hybrid bond are perfectly adapted to this type of investment. That is not just a one-shot transaction that took place in early. It is one tool in our financial toolbox.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Getting back questions from the room, from the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question, you've shown that the financial situation of EDF has been improving since 2009 steadily so. However, your debt remains high. Are you considering any &#x2013; selling any industrial assets or any other initiative to deleverage your debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the debt remains high, well, we thought that we will be comfortable with the debt that would be around 2.5 times EBITDA. We believe that this debt-to-EBITDA ratio is perfectly adapted and very cautious for a business like ours. We've done better. We'll continue with a financial policy that is both prudent, but that would not cause the group to be immobilized at all.</p>
          <p>So we don't feel we're in a situation of having to sell any assets at any cost. Naturally, we need some breathing room sometimes. We have had sold some assets over the past few years. Some of them were opportunities, opportunistic. Nobody is complaining about selling the networks in the U.K. or the German subsidiaries, provided that we have been able to demonstrate that it was a strategic operation that supported the group. So we can do it if necessary, but we have no pressure to sell off any assets.</p>
          <p>In EDF &#xC9;nergies Nouvelles, there again we have breathing room. We can sell assets as the EDF EN continues to grow. So we will continue to sell, dispose of some assets, but we have no constraints, no pressure to sell any asset just to deleverage the group, since our financial situation is not tense.</p>
          <p>So, yes, it's a position that's quite comfortable. When you look at the ratios of the group, we've even boosted our financial position with the hybrid bond issue. So today, the group is in a financial position that is more solid and sound than it ever was due to its operational performance, which is of course, of the essence.</p>
          <p>And I was saying earlier that I'm highly thankful to all of the employees of the group that have enabled this performance. It was no easy job, and we'll continue to improve our operational performance at the same time as we will conduct an ambitious strategy for expansion and a financial strategy that is both rational and prudent. But we have no specific constraint or pressure to sell off anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions from Exane. First question on Edison, can you shed some light on the underlying assumption of EBITDA growth of &#x20AC;1.1 billion in the midterm? Does that involve stable electricity prices, or does it also take on board the lower prices that might happen in Italy? Second question's on the white certificate and their cost incurreds. The proposals to tighten up the ambitions linked to energy efficiency in France, what is the cost for EDF in 2012, and how do you expect these white certificate costs to evolve in the future? Third question, could you give us a reminder on Egypt on the payment deadline in the upstream business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so Edison, now Edison is much less affected by electricity prices than before since we sold Edi Power. What really affects Edison is our ability to have non-zero margin on the gas business. Now Edison also has approximately &#x20AC;100 million contribution from renewable energy sources. And Edison also benefit from an exploration and production business that also contributes to the group's EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Now I can't say that in 2012, electricity production and output are beyond the margin that we earn, thanks to the network operator and availability of our capacity, but I can say that electricity generation was a great contributor to the groups' EBITDA except in hydropower. So the key data to take into account out of that &#x20AC;1.1 billion is our ability no longer to sell gas at a loss in Italy.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we were able to be successful in two major arbitration decision on gas purchasing prices, plus Gazprom that had been renegotiated in the previous year as well as ENI. And that is a big challenge, but that gives us also some comfort with a normative level of EBITDA, that would be at least &#x20AC;1.1 billion</p>
          <p>Now, the white certificates, I won't give you the cost of that, because EDF produces nearly 90% of these white certificates. The group is very, very present in making a lot of proposals to make sure that these significant financial aggregates would be devoted to mechanisms that will be increasingly efficient in terms of energy efficiencies.</p>
          <p>The group is presenting a number of proposals in the context of the current debate on energy to make sure that the significant cost is part of our sales costs, which are increasing. And, therefore, it contributes to increase the gap between the needs due to the investment policy, and the resources due to this pricing component that I explained earlier on the baseload. So we are very present in the national debate to make proposals for better energy efficiency, but more efficient mechanisms in terms of cost as well.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, that's an excellent question. Indeed, the payment deadlines or payment schedule, at least the receivable that we have with our Egyptian client is quite significant. That is at a distance, of course. We had an agreement in 2012 on a payment schedule by the Egyptian client, so that's an excellent thing, and that's why we're a little bit more optimistic on this issue than we were just a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Proglio, you said that the energy transition debate would be a big challenge in 2013, that you would be very much involved in this debate. Can you tell us more about that?</p>
          <p>Second question, you gave up building gas storage in Southwestern France. If you were to buy back TIGF, would that might have been meaningful? And last question, are you trying to gain permits for shale gas anywhere in the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, energy transition of course, there are two challenges participation in the debate, national debate. Obviously, we're very much present in that debate. We have a lot of things to say and to propose, so we'll have a strong presence both on a national level and a regional level. And therefore we will be very much involved, very closely involved via our various staff in the regions as well.</p>
          <p>Actually, interestingly we may have some original ideas to propose in that debate. And then of course, there's also the issue of economic equation on the French scope, the pricing equations. Hence, discussions on the general economics, namely with the tariff equation. As soon as you start talking tariffs, of course it becomes complex. For anybody concerned and i.e., our customers, we're talking about integrated tariffs that would combine energy prices to the cost of networks, distribution, transmission, as well as taxes that add up including this CSPE, which is an equalization tax that is billed to everyone. So, all of that makes for a very complex issue.</p>
          <p>Once again, we have a very pragmatic outlook, very related to our mission of public service. How can we preserve the competitiveness of the French territory as well as access to all for the essential service of electricity which affects the purchasing power and competitiveness in France? And can you combine that as well to improve the service level, make the necessary investment to improve the service? So a complex equation once again.</p>
          <p>There are a number of dates that have been scheduled with the French public authority. Now in France, as you know, the tariffs are regulated, under the control and decided by the state public authorities. And so we have a number of proposals to make in the analysis of these topics, proposals which I believe could be successful or at least have a good chance to be successful. We'll talk about it again of course.</p>
          <p>So yes, we will be very much present in 2013 in this debate. We've always been, but more specifically this year on these particular topics. And we'll have opportunities to talk about it again. What I've always said is we need visibility. You need visibility. Basically, what's important is to give us and to give you visibility for economic and industrial reasons for us and you for reasons of analysis, parameter setting. So this year, we're going to try and give you a little bit more visibility on the evolution of economic conditions on &#x2013; over the French scope of course because that is the issue.</p>
          <p>But of course, we have the same concern everywhere, internationally, in the U.K. We talked about the 40-year British contract and so on. So in 2013, we'll have proposals and answers to a range of these questions. Even though today, we have a lot of, let's say, elements of response, or a lot of convictions, but it's very difficult to give you any precise numbers until the negotiations are finished. We're not trying to conceal anything, but we're deliberately very cautious before we announce any kind of specific figures.</p>
          <p>Now, the project on gas storage in the <mark type="ph" /> Lond (94:34) area, we felt that it was really not compatible with our requirements for return on investment. So we decided to abandon the project, which just goes to show that in this company, when we take a decision, we look at a project and find that if this is not going to be profitable or create any value for the shareholders, then we just give up.</p>
          <p>But TIGF is an existing infrastructure. It is basically a financial investment for EDF clearly, but it is also a tangible way to link up durable partnership with a Singapore partner and with any tie-in player who is a leader in the distribution business. So, I believe that TIGF is actually more strategic than merely financial. And it does have a merit of combining a strategic vision of financial industrial partnership together with a relevant financial investment with a return that should be quite satisfactory for even the most demanding of us on the short and longer term.</p>
          <p>Shale gas now, now that is an issue which is not a major topic of investment for us, since we are not really very involved in gas production as a business. But we have taken a number of initiatives to be a little bit more present on the upstream, i.e., exploration and production. We have extremely skillful teams at Edison in the E&amp;P sector.</p>
          <p>We have an initiative underway consisting in leveraging this expertise ability to dedicated funds, in the service of dedicated funds. This is something that is underdeveloped and the idea is for the group to find the financial leverage that would enable us to go faster and farther in exploration and production of gas, which is an important strategic lever for the group. Of course, no need to dwell on that. And it would enable us as well to preserve our CapEx potential and financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>We have no specific appetite for shale gas except for research and development, technical expertise, because they are part of the landscape and we need to be well ahead of time on all the technology so that we can shed light on the future in a relevant way. If by some extraordinary occasion, we were to be offered a project, one of them we are looking at outside of Europe, we would look at it. And we would consider it if we have the necessary technical expertise and learn the lessons from experience. But no decision has been made at this point. We are simply looking at that area with some interest.</p>

          <p>Questions from Bloomberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us some details on your discussion with the state as a shareholder on this issue of dividend payout? Are you confident that you will be able to increase tariffs in France as well as the ARENH price?</p>
          <p>Second question, is there any discussions going on in the U.K.? Are the expenditures continuing in the U.K. as well, or have you stopped spending money pending a decision from the government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure how I should translate your question regarding our confidence and trust in the state as a shareholder. The state is a regulator. He is a shareholder. So, as a shareholder, the state acts as a shareholder. Why not? I've met quite a few shareholders. It seems logical to me that the state as a shareholder would be concerned about the return on their investment, so the French state, and who can blame them, as any shareholder is concerned with their economic equation and their return on investment.</p>
          <p>It is a demanding shareholder, natural, but quite flexible. We have discussion with the state as a shareholder as we do with other shareholders and board &#x2013; via  the board of directors. Yes, we have discussion. We have fascinating passionate discussions as well. And on the dividend, that will be submitted to the shareholders meeting.</p>
          <p>My feeling is that the state shareholder will agree positively the proposal that we have given you in terms of dividend payout. And, of course, they will continue to keep a close eye on the return on their investment beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>Now the state as regulator of yours, of course, that is entirely different. There's no correlation between the regulator or the shareholder. So, we don't talk with the shareholder about increases in tariffs. But I do have confidence in our ability to give you more visibility on this future tariff equation.</p>
          <p>And so, the U.K., expense s continuing or not in the U.K., most of the expenditures in the U.K. would be linked to the final decision to invest, meaning that we will sign a number of contracts, meaning we'll have to commit to a number of expenditures. But until the decision is made, we're keeping costs under control.</p>
          <p>The amount was quite significant, already spent. We've spent &#x20AC;400 million &#x2013; we've given you the figure earlier &#x2013; to develop a project. That was in 2012, so significant amounts have been spent, yes, kept under control, but of course most of the expenditures will only be committed once we have a final decision to invest. And discussions continue, as I said, with the British government and all other British authorities. We've been working on that for several years. And as far as other capital expenditures, we will continue, as we have for several years.</p>

          <p>Question regarding Edison. Recurring EBITDA of &#x20AC;900 million, should we look at it &#x20AC;900 million or not? And what figure are you using in your guidance for 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it seems that I wasn't very clear earlier. Let me clarify that with a few more figures.</p>
          <p>Recurring EBITDA is &#x20AC;1.1 billion for 2013. We use &#x20AC;500 million internally. If I now exclude Edison also in 2012 to have a sound basis with my 0.3% so &#x20AC;16.1 million are removed and &#x20AC;900 million Edison contribution in 2012 after the consolidation effect, which gives me &#x20AC;15.2 billion EBITDA for Edison, excluding Edison. So if you add &#x20AC;500 million to that for Edison, you end up with an EBITDA bracket for the group between &#x20AC;15.7 million and &#x20AC;16.2 million. That is the EBITDA bracket which is consistent with the consensus given. I think the consensus is &#x20AC;15.9 million for EBITDA 2013. Hopefully, I've clarified the position. Moving on with the next Internet question.</p>

Regarding the debt, without the CSPE allocated to dedicated assets and the &#x20AC;2.4 billion withdrawal, the debt of &#x20AC;39.4 million would have been &#x20AC;2.4 million higher, so &#x20AC;41.6 million.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the past three years, we have demonstrated that we would be circling areas where we had a minority stake. I spoke about some minority stakes earlier that we speak of recurrently in view of the impairments recorded. So we have not abandoned the idea of continuing with the talks to review these minority stakes held by the group in a certain number of companies. I think we have more or less covered the rest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> (1:45:03) I have two questions, could you give us what your return on capital employed was in the different business segments for the year 2012? And my second question is more of a strategic question on your nuclear build in the U.K. In the U.S., there's new nuclear being built by two companies which are getting a guaranteed return by the regulator of 11% with cash recovery as you go on and build every year.</p>
          <p>And so the way I look at it for EDF to go in, and not in their local market, but in an international market, in a non-regulated market, that the return should be at least in the high teens for the project to be viable to EDF shareholders. And so I just want to understand what kind of return characteristics are you working on as you go through this process in the next 12 months in terms of your decision if you go ahead and do it, what kind of return characteristics are you looking at? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tough question. Maybe I'll defer for the first and second questions, this particular question. If the question is related to U.K., it's more or less a regulated market in this regard through the contract for 40 years that we are negotiating with the government. So it's more or less a kind of regulated contract, as you can imagine.</p>
          <p>Now when it comes to the returns, maybe we can give you more precise answer after we are in the process of finalizing the negotiation. I wouldn't answer the question today as far as we are discussing with the British government. But you have in the press most, more or less, the precise indications about this. That's for the U.K.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the world, nuclear is not limited to the U.K. We are not that much involved in developing huge investments in nuclear. We are global architects and operators in the nuclear field, and we're not that much interested in being promoters of IBP, nuclear IBPs in the world.</p>
          <p>So it's a quite different question. Then we can go through the strategic issue, which is what kind of evolution of the nuclear developments in the world, what is the role of EDF in this aspect. And we are more listening to the expertise return of experience and operators rather than investors in nuclear, which is true in most of the countries. But Great Britain where we are a huge part, we manage the most important part of the U.K. electricity market, and we are a big operator in the U.K. like in France, as a matter of fact.</p>
          <p>Part of your question's linked to our future strategy in the U.K., where we have the decision. It's not a tender. We have to take a decision regarding this investment through the negotiation we have with the British government.</p>

          <p>Yes, on the return on capital employed, we do not communicate on different returns on capital employed for our existing business. The only comment I'd like to make is that two years ago, we set new investment criteria for the group that related using the group watt plus 300 basis points, plus country risk, plus or minus business risk. Of course when it is regulated, risk is lower than when it is not regulated.</p>
          <p>Those investment criteria are consistently applied within the group for that reason. We had, as Mr. Proglio's mentioned it earlier, to start a project in South of France, down in Lyon. We are also reviewing some other projects such as one pin call project in Poland, and we stick to those investment criteria, which are quite strict with strict value creation objectives for each of our projects.</p>

          <p>A last question, number five. I said the last question, there'll be &#x2013; okay, go ahead. One last question, or the second to the last.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions. The first is quite precise about CapEx. And the second, it's fine that you spoke about it before concerning outlooks for nuclear. On CapEx, you spoke about your plans. During your presentation, you said you needed to deal with unplanned outages. Out of  the maintenance CapEx you had this year, can you give us the precise figure corresponding to the replacement of steam generators? And could you recall &#x2013; well, if I'm not mistaken, you have a revamping plan for 1,100, 1,300 megawatts. Can you tell us about the timetable for that revamping plan?</p>
          <p>A precise question secondly, about EDF strategy and nuclear, I would like to know &#x2013; apparently what's said at international level about nuclear is changing a bit. Look at China. Their contracts that have been reallocated, so things seems to be picking up again nice and easily. At the same time, I do not believe that you have Japanese engineers who are welcome in China. Are there good outlooks for EDF in terms of construction contracts? And that's it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the specialist here. Dominique could answer you about steam generators, point-by-point, location-by-location, generator-by-generator, but not the prices, says Thomas. So, Dominique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About steam generators, the two generators in 2012, we plan to do this on three generators in 2013. On the alternators and on the main transformers, you have the figures on this slide.</p>
          <p>To give you all the other details on revamping each plant individually, well, nuclear in general and China in particular, you say things have picked up. It never stopped. To my knowledge, the British program has never been stopped. It was decided on by the labor government and was continued by the conservative government. Why?</p>
          <p>Because nuclear meets a need, a sustainable need, for energy, linking national independence and competitiveness for the countries in question. And this is why those countries that have decided to continue to launch nuclear projects have taken a decision where are the countries where we could go, from Russia to China, going to the United States as pointed out earlier. These are countries where nuclear already exists. In China, you are saying that they have started again. There was a small slowdown after Fukushima, and especially after decision taken by the new leadership that's been set up. There's a moment for certain adjustments before the new team took over. The new team will be officialized as of the end of March or the beginning of March.</p>
          <p>Secondly, China, the pace of construction today, right now, you spoke about the slowdown. They're currently building 25 nuclear plants in China. So it's a relative slowdown, the pace of construction about nine nuclear plants per year, and that may jump to 12. At the same time, it's building the first new energy plant with energy and photovoltaic in the world, and they built a small dam called Le Trois Gorges, the first such dam in the world, so huge needs for energy in China. At the same time, they're building two coal-fired plants every week. So that's China and those are the issues in China.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are other countries that we may point out, from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Brazil, Vietnam, Central European countries that have decided to reinforce nuclear. So nuclear is a long and sustainable future around the world, the role to be played by France and a role to be played by EDF.</p>
          <p>I've already said before in the past that given its experience, its renown, its reputation, EDF was the finest, the first and foremost operator in nuclear. There are four main operators in the world today. The first is EDF by far, the Russian who is a top GNPC, the Chinese and the Korean. The Japanese, by definition, are challenged a bit today because of the incidents that occurred.</p>
          <p>Nuclear or the nuclear risk or decisions on nuclear, those decisions are taken by the governments in the countries concerned, decision makers, and by the operator. The operator is therefore decides to be nuclear &#x2013; for a global operator, the one with the best repetitious EDF. The role of EDF in global nuclear is not to be demonstrated any longer. EDF in line of historic &#x2013; with its industrial traditions, plans to be a good partner for the European industry, not only in France, others, in the U.K., Italy and elsewhere, there to prove it.</p>
          <p>Naturally, we cooperate, and I welcome the cooperation that is now very satisfying with Areva. I like to insist on that, by definition; therefore EDF will be a partner. What will be the challenges for the nuclear industry? For EDF, very selfishly, I will say that we will be around the world sustainably. For the industrial &#x2013; for the industry at large, it's much more stressful, implying getting things apace and signing agreements quickly.</p>
          <p>As an operator, we will continue to be the number one global operator in the world and for many years to come. So you must gain markets for the industry and EDF of course will be the flagship of this industry, as it should. I deplore discussions, unnecessary discussions that are organized here and there. Is China of strategic importance for nuclear? I would tend to believe that that is the case, as I said earlier.</p>
          <p>EDF decided at an early stage to provide this nuclear experience in China 30 years ago. And when the first visit organized by the new President of France in China next spring, we'll be celebrating the 30th anniversary of this cooperation. We're the only operators in China, the only partner in Chinese energy that's non-Chinese. We can pat ourselves on the back for that. We are truly credible. We are truly operators in China, and I don't believe I'm betraying the interests of France for the fact that EDF has acted as a partner in energy with China. So of course, it is important, but we are quite serene, with no major uncertainties on the role of EDF. It's extremely competitive and we'll make our contribution to the industry at large.</p>
          <p>I believe there's a question here and over there, maybe, a last question in the room before moving on to the last question on the Internet and thanking you for attending.</p>

            <mark type="ph" /> Weiss Hoff (1:59:33) from JPMorgan. In your introduction, you spoke about the ARENH and the NOME law. What about the close prices integration in the European platform and talks with French authorities and on who's initiative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're referring to the drop in prices in Germany for the continental plate, platform where the links and the links with the points of ARENH. For us, there are no real links. On the one hand, we applied the NOME law, which provides that EDF must sell electricity at the full cost price of nuclear.</p>
          <p>That may be discussed, how it can be calculate. The French Court of Auditors spoke about how to calculate that. We arrived at this &#x20AC;50. So we're talking about a new form of regulation so that we can cover the full cost of nuclear that has nothing to do with volatility on the market, which is due to an economic environment due to the wind effect in the North Sea and not due to an industrial reality of an industrial tool, nuclear in France owned and managed by EDF.</p>
          <p>I believe we are finished with questions on the Internet. Regarding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:01:42), I'd like to add that we shouldn't extrapolate any specific situations. The current prices on the European platform are linked to the crisis, taking into account economic fundamentals, so they're not sustainable. I'm convinced of that.</p>
          <p>Now, we take them into account in our discussions, not in France in particular, as Thomas just said, but in the various European countries. Once again, let us not confuse the immediate situation and the long- or medium-term vision. And of course, we must review issues regarding the price of the CO2, which impacts the price of energy.</p>
          <p>Today, given the current deterioration of the environment, we're not in the best context to try to see where it should be our responsibility, consistent, anticipating on medium- and long-term changes and not eluding the essential issues. These are the issues for us in our day-to-day business, but we'll come back to these matters with you. A last question?</p>
