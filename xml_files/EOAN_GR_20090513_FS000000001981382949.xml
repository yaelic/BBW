          <p>Thank you, Mia. Good afternoon, buenas tardes, bonjourno, dober dan. I guess you'll hear for the last time from me this conference call. Thank you for joining us on our conference call for the first quarter results 2009.</p>
          <p>As usual, Wulf Bernotat, our CEO will first highlight the importance in strategic aspects of our business development in the first quarter and later on Marcus Schenck, our CFO will explain in detail the numbers. This is only my short remarks and I'll hand you over to Wulf.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kiran, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the presentation of the first quarter '09 results. These results demonstrate that our new markets are starting to contribute to our bottom line and we continue to benefit from our prudent hedging strategy.</p>
          <p>In contrast, the economic crisis, adverse foreign exchange developments and regulatory effects have negatively impacted our earnings during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, adjusted EBIT was down 5% on the previous year and adjusted net income fell by 2%. Nevertheless I can confirm that our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. We expect adjusted EBIT to be flat and adjusted net income to be down around 10% mainly due to higher interest expense arising from the financing of our investments.</p>
          <p>Today I'll address four topics in more detail, which came up in various discussions with you following our full-year results presentation on March 10. First, discuss the impact of the economic crisis on our business; second, present details of our investment plan post the announced reduction in CapEx; third, update you on the progress of our efficiency program, PerformtoWin; and finally speak about the latest developments in our regulated business.</p>
          <p>In many markets, forward hedging gives us a relatively high degree of visibility in our generation business. Furthermore, our operations in different geographies and across different customer groups result in a diversified portfolio. However, it's often mentioned in the past E.ON is not completely immune to the economic crisis, specifically E.ON is exposed to this crisis mainly via two effects.</p>
          <p>First, our retail business is impacted by falling demand, especially among our industrial and large commercial customers. This customer group makes up roughly one-third of our portfolio. E.ON's electricity and gas sales to industrial and commercial customers was down 9 to 10% in the first quarter. On the other side gas consumption from residential customers, small and medium sized enterprises and resellers is down only 2% while electricity consumption is more or less stable. Across all segments and customer groups this results in the reduction of energy sales volumes of around 3%.</p>
          <p>As of today, we do not expect the trend seen in the first quarter to be markedly different for the full year. For E.ON, the reduced volumes lead to a loss of expected margin. In addition, we need to resell excess volumes, which we have already purchased but cannot sell to our customers back into the spot market at lower than anticipated prices.</p>
          <p>Second, besides the described volume effect, the economic crisis leads to an increase in the number of customers facing financial difficulties. In order to account for the increasing signs of worsening payment behavior, we have taken prudent provisions. To limit the financial impact, we have initiated concrete operational mitigations on cash collection and bad debt management.</p>
          <p>If the two effects described above are taken together, the economic crisis has impacted adjusted EBIT by approximately 170 million euros. This includes provisions related to the total year 2009.</p>
          <p>Before updating you on our investment plan, let me address some developments within our unregulated gas business. Maybe surprisingly, our upstream business is almost flat year-on-year. Next, to a reduced depreciation charge resulting from lower exploration activity, effect arising from the decreased oil price were partly compensated by stable price developments for gas. The latter positive gas effect will level out during the year as there is a lacked relation to the oil price as well.</p>
          <p>More relevant for this quarter is a development of the gross margin in our supply and sales business. Both prices and volumes came down due to recessionary effect, but also due to intensified competition. However, the reported volumes were in addition impacted by deferral of demand. Our clients used the flexibility within their contracts to delay their purchases in an expectation of lower gas prices driven by the oil indexation.</p>
          <p>To summarize, so far it is less the general recession that has reduced our gas margin, but more intensified competition and a deferral of demand due to the oil price development.</p>
          <p>In our full-year results, we have informed to you that we have updated our investment plan to &#x20AC;30 billion for the period '09 till 2011 in light of the economic and financial circumstances.</p>
          <p>Today, I want to share more details regarding the use of those funds with you. In recent years E.ON has grown mainly through acquisitions. We have used opportunities to establish footprints in Spain, Italy, France and Russia. Going forward, we will develop E.ON mainly via organic investments. Growth investments make up 66% of the total replacement, investment 17%, and maintenance also 17%.</p>
          <p>Reflecting our view of the potential for value creation, we are concentrating growth investments in conventional power generation, renewables and in the upstream gas business. E.ON will invest four billion in E&amp;P. Our strategy remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>We want to produce more natural gas ourselves in order to access even more supply sources. With six supply countries, we're already more diversified than any of our European competitors. By far the largest project is the acquisition of 25% minus one share in Yuzhno Russkoye in exchange for a stake of under 3% in Gerosgaz. We are currently finalizing the contracts and hope to sign them in June.</p>
          <p>Roughly, &#x20AC;12 billion, or 40% of the total investments are dedicated to conventional power generation. We are convinced that in order to reap the benefits from the expected future supply gap, we need to invest in power generation today. Components which we have secured at effective prices support the profitability of these investments.</p>
          <p>We plan to spend between 1.3 and 1.4 billion per year to grow our renewable business. We continue to focus on on and offshore wind farms in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany. Our targets, four gigawatt of renewable capacity by end 2010 and 10 gigawatt by 2015 remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Investments in power and gas networks and in gas storage make up much of the remaining nine billion euros. The most important projects are the connections of offshore wind parks to the main grid in Germany, the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline, and the expansion of our gas storage capacities in Germany and in the U.K.</p>
          <p>In our investments we are planting the seeds for future earnings growth. We're convinced that the 30 billion investments make financial sense and that the amount fits well to our financing and cash flow situation.</p>
          <p>Nuclear energy will continue to play an important role in our generation portfolio, and also forms part of our European growth strategy. In this respect, I'm pleased to comment on the fact that the E.ON-RWE joint venture has won the auctions for the Oldbury and Wylfa sites in the U.K.</p>
          <p>From a technical perspective, these two sites will allow us to build up to four new nuclear power plants in the U.K. The price amounts to significantly less than the 100 million for a potential reactor site.</p>
          <p>The E.ON-RWE joint venture has thus secured options on nuclear new builds in the U.K. at attractive prices compared to peers. E.ON and RWE will now set up a joint project organization to develop these sites. A number of important decisions such as technology selection could already take place in the next 12 months. The construction and thus the financing of the plant itself would have no impact on our current investment plan.</p>
          <p>Let me now briefly update you on the progress of the PerformtoWin initiative. This is key to drive E.ON towards operational excellence but also to enhance and accelerate decision making throughout the Group. We are determined to reduce complexity and realize synergies across our Group. In all areas and along the entire value chain, we are improving efficiency, optimizing organizational structures and business processes and eliminating redundant tasks and unnecessary bureaucracy. We are today close to finishing the so called validation phase of the project.</p>
          <p>As mentioned previously, we are confident to realize 1.5 billion euros of benefits by 2011. Most of the individual projects will be executed by the market units. Due to the cross functional nature, six themes involving several market units will be steered by the corporate center. The PerformtoWin initiative is a step change in how we run our company. The reduction of course is not the starting point of this project but instead is a consequence when you become leaner and faster.</p>
          <p>First benefits will be visible in our 2009 results already. The most pronounced effects however will only arise in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>The fourth topic I would like to address are the latest regulatory developments in Germany. In the fixing of German network charges, the Federal Network Agency makes a distinction between controllable costs on the one hand, which are subject to intensive regulation and non-controllable costs on the other hand, which are supposed to be a pass-through item. The regulator estimates the level of both types of costs on the basis of the data of the past two years.</p>
          <p>Thus the network charges approved last year were based on 2006 figures. Since 2006 however non-controllable costs have risen rapidly. The cost for the mandatory feed-in of renewal energy, for example, is increasing due to volume growth. The cost for balancing power has increased as a result of higher power prices and revenues of the auctioning of interconnected capacities have declined.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, E.ON Netz has filed a hardship case with the regulator requesting to adjust its network charges for the higher non-controllable costs. The Federal Network Agency has recognized a good part of the E.ON Netz request and has accepted a 30% increase of the network charges.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this is a positive development for E.ON Netz. However, the transmission charges flow to a large extent into the non-controllable costs of the distribution networks. As a result, our distribution networks have now asked the regulator to increase their own network charges to reflect the increase of their non-controllable costs.</p>
          <p>In general, we can say that our networks are entering intensive regulation in a very strong position. The efficiency benchmarking of the Federal Network Agency has demonstrated that they are scoring well above the German average. This means that the yearly reduction factor applied to our network charges is close to the sector-wide minimum of 1.25% for the first regulatory period. The yearly inflation adjustment might even offset it. Furthermore network charges will benefit this year from the increase of allowed returns decided last year.</p>
          <p>And finally the incentive regulation system in Germany functions as a revenue cap, not as a price cap. Network earnings are therefore shielded from any demand contraction. In terms of regulation in Germany, the main on-setting issue now is the regulation of E.ON gas transport.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now summarize my introductory remarks. Following a quarter with ups and downs, we can confirm the outlook for the full year. The economic crisis has its implications also on our business, but we are on track to meet our targets. The coming years for E.ON are geared towards performance and streamlining. In this respect, the E.ON management had three priorities to tackle the current environment.</p>
          <p>First, we have reduced CapEx by 6 billion but we continue to invest in the area of 10 billion per annum to drive future earnings. In that exercise financial discipline remains key for all investment decisions.</p>
          <p>Second, after a period of strong expansion, we now want to enhance operational excellence within the E.ON Group.</p>
          <p>And third, our plans to streamline the portfolio remain unchanged. We want to reduce complexity and then work off a high quality portfolio with a mix of short-and long-term growth options.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. Thank you for your attention and I will now hand over to Marcus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah thank you, Wulf. Ladies and gentlemen, the analysts and investors, I believe we had a challenging first quarter of what is to be a challenging full year 2009 for the group.</p>
          <p>As you can see, and I will walk you through the charts, Q1 EBIT is down 5%, EBITDA performed slightly better being down only 3% and operating cash flow has seen a very positive development with an uptick of 22%. I will come to the details.</p>
          <p>Before I go into the market units, let me first point out at group level some major negative effects impacting the 2009 results.</p>
          <p>First of all, we have seen direct effects from the economic crisis that Wulf has described with issues in terms of declines in demand, as well as costs we have incurred as it relates to bad debt. In addition, we have seen translation effects in the major currencies of in total roughly &#x20AC;50 million, and beyond that we have, as expected seen an impact in our gas upstream business as a consequence of falling prices, and that price effect was negative &#x20AC;34 million.</p>
          <p>There are, however, also some other aspects at a group level that I would like to highlight. Before we go into the details, one is the transaction with Statkraft, which has reduced the available generation volume in Nordic. And secondly, I would also like to highlight that in 2008, the reduction in tariffs in the DSOs only kicked in from the second quarter onwards, i.e., the first quarter of 2008 still shows a result before a haircut in DSO tariffs. That is relevant when you subsequently do the like-for-like comparison on the &#x2013; in the Central Europe division.</p>
          <p>Page three gives you an overview about the EBIT development by markets units. Basically by now, the years are more or less comparable say for still some transfer effects within the company, which I will explain later. Those relate in particular to our U.K. business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Central Europe first. Here we have seen EBITs go up by 3%. The sub-segment Central Europe with non-regulated is more or less flat. The key positive effects here where the first time consolidation of Netz. The price effect on the generation piece that has been transferred to EET, with a price effect of &#x20AC;74 million and then in the gas distribution business, we have weather related seen higher margins, &#x20AC;63 million.</p>
          <p>On the flipside, negative effects resulting from the economic crisis. Here we are showing an overall negative impact of 100 million. Let me comment on that in a bit more detail. This includes re-selling volumes during the year of &#x20AC;68 million. The lion's share of that is actually related to two large customer situations that we have where we are counterparty of &#x2013; large industrial customers that are in severe financial distress. And then we have also, and that also relates to the same customers, a bad debt cost of in total &#x20AC;30 million.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are showing in Central Europe also a continued negative impact from the outages of Cumen and Boonspitle which compared to last year's quarter had a negative consequence of &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>The Central Europe West Regulated business is up. Here we have &#x2013; we have on the one hand the negative effect of compared to last year's first quarter lower tariffs and, which is more than offset by higher growth margins, weather related in the gas networks as well as roughly &#x20AC;32 million that we have improved the business from cost cutting activities. The businesses in Eastern Europe are basically flat.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Pan-European Gas. Here before I comment on the specific numbers, I would like to highlight that we are now showing the specific numbers for Pan-European Gas in a new reporting structure as we had promised last year. In the backup you can find the details that explain the specific segmentation in terms of where which piece has been moved. All in all, on the EBIT level, we see a 19% drop.</p>
          <p>In the regulated business, the major negative effect compared to last year's quarter results from a tariff reduction that was introduced in October 2008, this effect is around &#x20AC;31 million. There was also a roughly &#x20AC;30 million cost increase in our German transport business.</p>
          <p>The non-regulated piece. Wulf has commented on this in quite some detail. So let me just highlight only a few points here. The &#x2013; on the upstream business, we have a negative price effect of &#x20AC;34 million, there still is a small portion that is offsetting this, which is a hedge that was in place, but that's only a Q1 effect, upstream still shows in Q1 of this year a result of &#x20AC;88 million in absolute terms.</p>
          <p>We have a higher result from our storage activities, &#x20AC;135 million and then the main negative effect is in the &#x2013; in the gas margin, where we have roughly 100 million resulting from lower volumes, which is the equivalent of around 36 terawatt hours of which 13 is a transfer to E.ON Energy &#x2013; sorry to E.ON Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to U.K., which on first glance looks like a drastic decline, so I'll try to highlight here that there are some specific transfer issues that impact the comparison of the two years. We have in the E.ON U.K. business sold CO2 certificates to E.ON Energy Trading at prices which are clearly below the level that we had &#x2013; we had seen in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Here we're talking about a transfer of 3.6 million tons at a price delta of &#x20AC;8, i.e. &#x20AC;8 less than in the prior year reflecting the currently low prices. Now, there is an offsetting effect in E.ON Energy Trading, which has locked in clean spreads and hence is benefiting from these internal transfer at lower than expected prices. So here we have the fact of a shift of profitability from U.K. into Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>The second, big &#x2013; even bigger effect, the CO2 effect is roughly &#x20AC;30 million. The second effect is the transfer of three long-term gas supply contracts, which have been handed over to Energy Trading. The total effect of that is close to &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>We have in addition seen the generation result at the level of E.ON U.K. see come down in particular compared to last year's first quarter. Here roughly six terawatts hours have been sold internally to Energy Trading at a spread that is nine pounds lower than in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Just to make that feel sort of intuitively reconcilable, I would like to highlight that the 2008 first quarter spreads had mainly been sold in 2006, when we were looking at very high spreads in the &#x2013; clean spreads in the U.K. and the transfer to Energy Trading for the first quarter of 2009 was based on pricing that was done end of 2006, early 2008 when clean dark spreads were at a level of &#x20AC;15 per megawatt hour. So that explains the &#x2013; the severe difference we have there &#x2013; which again then is a consequence why we see this negative result at the level of E.ON U.K.</p>
          <p>The retail business is up &#x20AC;25 million despite debt that ends our contributions to the energy efficiency program.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to Nordic. Here the adjusted EBIT is down &#x20AC;223 million mainly because of two large effects, one is translation, which I mentioned earlier. In total, this is &#x20AC;37 million and the second one is 2.7 terawatt hours less volume, out of which 1.4 terawatt hours is a consequence of the transfer of hydro capacity to Statkraft in the context of our asset swap with them.</p>
          <p>Again here there is an offsetting number in our P&amp;L, which I will show you later then when we talk about minorities but at an EBIT level this causes a decline. The Statkraft effect is &#x20AC;57 million negative. Over to the U.S., EBIT is up 36% and this is the one exception where translation effect actually worked in our favor. This is &#x2013; we have in total a currency effect of &#x20AC;18 million, again just a translation effect but we also have higher earnings on our environmental CapEx and an earlier recovery of fuel and gas costs from our customers.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to Energy Trading. Here we are showing a steep increase over last year. And as I mentioned earlier, we see in a way the flipside of also negative group internal effects mainly in the U.K. that now show up here as positive effects at the level of the market unit Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>If you were to carve out those transfer effects, we would still show also in the optimization business of Energy Trading, for the first quarter of 2009 to show a slightly negative result, which would be in line with last year's first quarter. Just to remind you, as we explained last year, the first quarter of every year in Energy Trading will always be the weakest quarter given the U-shape nature that I think people are familiar with in our transfer pricing mechanism.</p>
          <p>Proprietary trading is up 44 million euros, we think this is a very good and positive results. Just to highlight for the full year, we do not expect to beat the 2008 performance. Some statistics on the volumes and prices for sort of the main market units in Q1 of 2009 compared to Q1 of 2008. In Central Europe in the first quarter of 2008, we achieved an average price of &#x20AC;59 and that is now up to &#x20AC;62 in 2009. Volumes in both quarters were 28 terawatt-hours.</p>
          <p>Nordic, here as far as volume is concerned 10 terawatt-hours in Q1 of 2008, which is down as I mentioned in the context of Nordic by almost 3 terawatt-hours to 7 terawatt-hours. Prices for 2008 were 42 euros on average in Nordic and in 2009 in the same period 48 euros.</p>
          <p>Page 10 gives you our hedging position for the planning periods. I would also like to refer you to page 23 in the backup where we provide more details on our outright power position. I don't want to sort of just quote the numbers here, the only message that I think we would like to bring across is that basically the outright power position is sold for 2009 and 2010 and for 2011 more than 50% of that position has been hedged.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to the segment New Markets. New Markets contribute 159 million euro in EBIT and 309 million euros in EBITDA. Obviously, we have first time consolidation effects, in particular, in Spain where the full 36 million is a consequence of the first time inclusion of the Endesa assets and Viascor.</p>
          <p>And in Italy we have a similar effect. Here we have a positive effect of 70 million euros from the first time inclusion of the former Endesa generation assets, and we have negative effects in a sense that last year's first quarter was in particular showing a penalty payment that we had received for the delayed construction at the Livorno plant.</p>
          <p>E.ON Climate &amp; Renewables is down despite a higher installed asset base. You may ask why that is the case? In Western Europe, we had worse wind conditions than was the case in Q1 of last year. And we also have translation effects here. Don't forget a significant portion of our installed assets base is in the U.K. and we also have assets in the Scandinavian markets.</p>
          <p>We also see lower revenues in the U.S. in particular in our merchant plants, i.e. those windmills where we do not have long-term contracts on the sale side in place, given the subsidy regime in the U.S., a certain portion of the price we've received is driven by the whole sale prices, which have come down and consequently we have lower returns here than was the case last year. This year it's up in particular because most of the increase in the installed asset base in Climate and Renewables in 2008 was actually done in the U.S. Russia is up by 38 million euros.</p>
          <p>Let me now complete the look into our P&amp;L moving over to page 12. Net interest expense is up as expected given higher net financial debt. We, in 2008, had positive &#x2013; book gains from the sale of securities, which were not repeated this year. Restructuring cost is up to 86 million euros given large group-wide projects that are in the implementation phase.</p>
          <p>The non-operating result is up due to 1.4 billion swing in the mark-to-market of derivatives. We also have a 149 million impairment on financial assets. The discontinued operations showed the results of WKE, which is slightly better than last year. And as I highlighted before, on the minority interest line, you can see the flipside of the Statkraft transaction where minorities have come down.</p>
          <p>All in all, the net income attributable to the shareholders of E.ON AG is up 18%. Clearly, I need to highlight here that a large driver of that significant increase is the mark-to-market of derivatives, which is as you know, why we look, at moving on to the next page, the adjusted net income, which decreased on a quarter-on-quarter basis by 2%. The lower EBIT, higher net interest charges and the lower adjusted tax rate caused that effect.</p>
          <p>Let me now comment on the Group cash flow situation. Operating cash flow for the Group is up by roughly 0.5 billion euros. This is mainly driven by working capital effects, which total roughly 500 million euros. The lion's share there stems from a reduced storage volume on the gas side. We have a slight decline in EBITDA roughly 100 million euros, high interest payments of around 200 million euros and then the New Markets contributed roughly 250 million euros positive operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow, on a market unit level is still heavily influenced by internal transfers, not just to Energy Trading that is the biggest one but there can also be from time to time checks transfers within the Group.</p>
          <p>At the Corporate Center, we see the high &#x2013; the impact of the higher interest payments. Maintenance CapEx is basically at the level of 2008 with almost 270 million euros. We look at the investment side, we have in Q1 of this year invested 1.9 billion euros. This is slightly below last year's level. As Wulf pointed out, you can also here clearly see the focus on organic investments.</p>
          <p>Leverage, moving on to the page 16, as you know is a key topic these days for us and obviously also for you. We remain very focused on this issue. Let me make a few remarks here.</p>
          <p>E.ON's 2008 leverage that we were showing at the year end of 2008, is below the average of its major peers. I would also like to highlight that our definition of economic net debt is rather conservative and there are two items that I would like to highlight. One is cash collaterals, deposited for trading activities are not counted as liquid funds in our definition.</p>
          <p>And then second point, I'd like to highlight is that roughly a third of our economic net debt is essentially long-term provisions, especially the nuclear provisions that are basically financial obligations over multiple decades until sort of cash outflow kicks in and they have a &#x2013; hence a different quality, I would say from, when compared to "normal financial liabilities."</p>
          <p>Standard &amp; Poor's have on May 7, confirmed our A flat rating with stable outlook. Hence over to the next page as you can see here, we have a very balanced maturity profile without any significant funding peaks in the coming years.</p>
          <p>As it relates to 2009, this year the net funding needs have essentially all been covered through us raising 6.5 billion euros alone in the last four months.</p>
          <p>Let me come to the last point, the outlook for 2009. As Wulf has already confirmed we stick to our outlook for 2009 and whilst we have seen a bigger than expected impact from the economic crisis in Q1, there were other aspects of the business such as the electricity regulation that seem to come out a little bit better than originally anticipated, which gives us the comfort to confirm the outlook for 2009.</p>
          <p>That would conclude my remarks and hence we are now open to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I just ask on the U.K. business? Obviously there is a lot of moving parts in the first quarter. Can you perhaps give us &#x2013; a sense of how you expect the underlying business to develop during the course of 2009. So, for example, do you expect your sort of &#x2013; the spreads that you have locked in for power generation to improve or to get worse? And similarly the costs in your retail business, are you seeing a significant expansion in margins sort of as the year progresses from what you can currently see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Marcus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well overall as we had already highlighted when we did our &#x2013; announced our full-year results on March 10, we were highlighting that we expect the U.K. business to come down in profitability compared to last year. Clearly, Q1 is &#x2013; has some specific effects but I mean your question is as to whether we do see a major recovery in this business,  and for the remainder of the year that is not the case. We do expect the U.K. business to come out &#x2013; it's really below the 2008 results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you sort of &#x2013; is it possible &#x2013; sort of to quantify that a bit more, but it looks like sort of underlying contractions and sort of dark spread and retail margins, sort of feels like something like about a 30% year-on-year decline in the first quarter. Is that the sort of magnitude we are talking about for the full-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the retail business you should bear in mind that we typically have a tricky &#x2013; a tricky time in the winter months when the profitability is lower because the hedging is such that the &#x2013; basically retail is buying in the winter months and that leads to &#x2013; in the winter months to reasonably weak retail results. The situation reverses in the summer months. I would say year-on-year if your question is you know, the underlying business, carving out currency effects and carving out the internal transfer to Energy Trading and here the line &#x2013; the biggest impact is those three gas contracts that have been moved. Year-on-year the business is close to flat in pounds, and on a same scope of business basis.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon, <mark type="inaudible" /> two questions please. The first is when you went through &#x2013; the Pan-European Gas business and talked about the price effect and the lower volume effect, which contributed a negative 316 million euros, I didn't quite catch your explanation of that. So I wondered if you could expand a little on that?</p>
          <p>And secondly now that so many different aspects of the business have been transferred into Energy Trading, is it possible just to summarize what's in there in terms of physical contracts, so that you transferred some U.K. gas contracts and are there other significant gas contracts in there? And what aspect of that business has got some long-term contracts behind it you can optimize around versus where it was say a year ago, to get a feel for that kind of change and scope of the Energy Trading business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are &#x2013; if your question is whether also sort of, Ruhrgas long-term contracts are now included in Energy Trading that is not the case. It's really the &#x2013; those contracts that we had in the U.K. that have been transferred. As far as the 360 million I believe is the number for hedge in the supply chain business is concerned, 100 million is the lower impact from volumes. As I highlighted here, this is 36 terawatt-hours and the price effect is the remainder of 216. Here our assessment is that roughly 120 million of that is, let's call it, price concessions that have been made to customers due to competitive pressure. I'm not sure whether that answers your question in full.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it does. And also I guess just a follow-up on the U.K. gas contracts then, do they &#x2013; how did the U.K. business take gas at what price does it take gas? Does it take it at the market price essentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it now takes it at the market price. Essentially the situation is there were contracts in place that are in the money. These contracts we do now show inside it. And U.K. essentially receives only the clean spreads i.e. has lost the advantage of buying at more favorable conditions under those long-term contracts. That advantage has been shifted to Energy Trading. This on a full-year basis is a &#x2013; depending on obviously &#x2013; on how the price has developed but can be a three-digit million number.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. So the two questions. Firstly, when you go down to adjusted net income, I notice that you have 300 odd million of tax effects on the non-operating. Does that imply that you've in fact effectively taken an imputed tax on the mark-to-market gains -- the 1.5 billion or is there something else going on? And secondly, you mentioned the potential positive decision on hardship case that E.ON met. Could you put that into a &#x2013; a million euro number I just wanted to know whether that is already in your 2010 guidance. I think you said it's indiscernible 2009. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not sure I fully get your first question, but the issue I think that we need to point out is that at &#x2013; the effective tax rate at the level of adjusted net income is going to &#x2013; there we show in Q1, a low tax rate as a consequence of an expected provision release that results from the sale of a former asset. I'm not going to mention which one. That's one point and sorry what was your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding hardship case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the hardship case. The hardship case in 2009 in absolute numbers, we had filed for roughly 300 million approved. We have seen an increase of 240 million at the level of the TSO. And as we mentioned earlier a certain portion of that will remain within our own DSO's roughly 170 million which is going to be a negative effect in 2009. So, you can see what the net effect of &#x2013; sort of, the hardship case is indeed positive mainly the delta between those two numbers. As far as the impact for 2010 is concerned, I prefer to not comment on this. This so far only deals with the 2009 issues. We are still negotiating with the regulator on a structural solution. This year is a negotiated solution for 2009. We have not yet found although there is an acceptance at the regulator that a structural solution is required but that is not yet achieved, and no comment on any positive or negative impact on 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good afternoon to everybody. Three questions. The first relates to the comments that you made about the economic impact on the Central European business. I picked up that you were talking that the provision had been made in respect of the whole year when it came to bad debt. Can you clarify that that is the 30 odd million that you have paid &#x2013; you have made.  And the second part of that economic impact question is the number that you've taken in the first quarter in relation to the volumes that you've had to resell, only for the first quarter or for your full year estimates relating to those two large industrial customers, and then my second question is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indiscernible features on the U.K. You've basically made a loss in the non-regulated activities in the U.K. in the first quarter. What is actually going wrong with that business?  Have you got negative spreads or are you making a negative margin in your retail activities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your last question, the U.K. &#x2013; the retail business is negative and that is very much driving this. I can also give you an absolute number. Retail business in Q1 was at minus &#x20AC;133 million and that's driving this. As far as the 100 million negative effects from the economic crisis that we mentioned in Central Europe is concerned, this is the vast majority of that 100 million is related to two large customers and this covers what we currently foresee for the full year.  Whether that situation will change or not, too early to tell but that's our current assessment. We do not think these customers will completely go out of business. These are restructuring cases but we have taken certain provisions on certain receivables, which we may not recover.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a follow-up one to that actually which is I knew what everything you're saying about the economic impact. I just wondered if you &#x2013; are you seeing any signs of stabilization or recovery, which have landed you to make these full year provisions? Are there any signs either of the demand stabilizing or buybacks lessening? And the second question is just on the debt factor. I understand that your position is better than your peers, but I think you've been saying that 2.8 to 3.3 times debt factor is the range that will guarantee you a single A and you still believe that if you go above the top of that threshold then it threatens your single A rating? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. Economic crisis I mean, I think what we are seeing is that in the last eight weeks the situation has not worsened. Yeah I mean we have seen a decline, which was a &#x2013;  pretty visible in January, February and it seems to have stabilized at that level. We have not yet seen a recovery, to your first question. On your second question, let me first again reiterate what I said namely that Standard &amp; Poor's has just a few days ago confirmed our single A rating without any question marks behind the outlook. Clearly, we are mindful of the fact that in order to manage the debt factor, when we just work &#x2013; If we just work to look at CapEx, the underlying cash flow we would run into an increasing debt factor and leveraged position but that is why we have also started to work on the disposal program and so far we have no reason to believe that the situation there will not allow us to manage the debt factor in the appropriate way.</p>

          <p>Just with respect to &#x2013; the several questions already asked on the economic impact. You were saying that you see total impact of 170 million and without being specific on any division, you also mentioned that there's a certain amount of provisioning in that, can you split this 170 million in actually effective provision? And secondly you mentioned that in the perform to win you would like &#x2013; that you're going to include the new market units in that. Any idea when we can, or I mean &#x2013; I guess it's probably too early to ask for a number but if so, is there are any idea what kind of potential you see from that in relation to the 1.1 billion or 1.5 billion you're targeting in total so far?</p>

          <p>As far as you second question is concerned, yes. You assumed already correctly that we have no figure yet.

We heard from EnBW last week that you are in negotiations or that at least EnBW could imagine buying further power plants from E.ON. And could you give some update on that and perhaps offer to the brokers concerning the disposal respectively swap of 2.2 gigawatts in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You say that at the very end we talk about swaps, you are not talking about primarily selling assets, although we have sold two power plants to EnBW. As far as those market rumors are concerned, we prefer not to comment on rumors and we will make an announcement if and when we have signed an agreement on the remaining assets in our overall package. So, no news on that score right now but we will let the market know when we know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is regarding the gas business. Obviously you have experienced some volume decreases here in Q1. At the same time we had extremely favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2009. Can you share with us adjusted figure, adjusted by the weather impact here? Secondly, it's regarding hedging of <mark type="inaudible" /> generation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2010, basically 2011, what kind of capacities did you sell, i.e., did you lock in already your supply prices for hard coal or was it small nuclear capacities you sold here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me deal with the first one on the gas business. It is difficult to answer your question precisely because we had two or even three effects as I tried to mention in my initial statement. We had the weather, we had, let's say, the economy and the economic crisis, and we had a competitive situation in the gas business which was different from previous years in that our customers are expecting lower prices for gas supplies in the coming quarters based on the application of the oil indexation formula. And therefore as much as they could, depending on their flexibility, they were not off-taking volumes in the first quarter and deferring effectively some volumes into the coming quarters, depending on their own flexibilities specially when it comes to using their own storage capacity.</p>
          <p>So, therefore it is very, very hard to give you a break down as you requested. The good news is of this last part is that the volumes are not lost for the rest of the year. So, some of the volumes at least we can recover in the coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, as far as your second question is concerned, I mean page 23 is &#x2013; when you look at 23 and 10, I think it is of our presentation. We are showing for sort of the relevant units, Central Europe and Nordic, what the outrights &#x2013; what the hedge of the outright position is, which is nuclear and hydro. And on 10, we are showing the hedge for the overall portfolio. Any delta there is spec business. Obviously there is hardly any spec business in the Nordic region because there we have almost exclusively hydro and nuclear.</p>
          <p>I hope that sort of gives you sufficient details to address your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My two questions. First of all, is &#x2013; what's the progress on the PerformtoWin program in terms of the restructuring initiative? And the second question is, is there anything you can say in terms of progress on disposals? I saw some comments coming out of the press conference. Is there anything you can say about the 10 billion target number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I think number remains intact, we are committed to it, and we've given ourselves two years. I can only very generally tell you the 10 billion target that we are making progress without being able at this time to be too specific on the individual projects. Can you still hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I can confirm that we are indeed making progress on a number of those disposal projects, without being in a position as yet to be specific. We will let you know and everybody in the market know when we have made tangible progress that we can communicate on.</p>
          <p>And on the PerformtoWin, I think we have said where we are &#x2013; we are in the &#x2013; at the end of the validation phase, we have got some smaller projects that can be implemented faster, we have got some larger projects that are affecting more than one market unit, which will take a little longer. But, generally speaking, we are on track as far as our schedule and timetable is concerned and will be able to deliver. So, that's all we can say at this stage. Deborah?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions. I wonder if you could update us a little bit about your negotiations with Gazprom. On Yuzhno Russkoye you seem to be much more confident in your communication that you are going to &#x2013; well, you are very close to a final deal. And I'll sort of add a lazy question, wondering what you expect this asset swap if it comes good, what kind of EBIT contribution you expect this to generate? And as a second question, just wanted to have a feeling how you &#x2013; how happy you are with the first &#x2013; this quarter performance from your assets in Spain and Italy, whether you &#x2013; well you see that's the asset write-down that you took in February was generous or maybe not so generous depending on how the business is going right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start on the Russkoye issue, we are indeed so on the final lap and I think this time we all are very convinced that it is the final lap because it's basically &#x2013; it's the final touch on the legal documentation, we have submitted the issue to our supervisory board, the same process is underway on the Gazprom side, it is the intention to close the deal on the 1 of August, and we have also agreed on a mechanism by which we can get the full EBIT effect for this year still in the remaining month of this year, or if that proves to be too difficult, we will get a cash compensation payment because, as you may know we have agreed to have, let's say, the economic benefit starting on the 1 of January of this year of this transaction. So, retroactively we will get the benefit. As far as EBIT is concerned, I don't know whether, it's the figure Marcus said but it is definitely significantly higher than the dividends we get out of our US gas position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd almost like to leave it there, obviously the EBIT impact this year will as Wulf pointed out depend very much on the day of closing, I mean if the only thing that I would probably say is if it is August 1 then we expect this to be slightly north of a three digit million number &#x2013; slightly north of &#x20AC;100 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. Well, for then the full year, I mean it is then only five months, but we will get a certain portion through the way the contract will be structured, as you notice on an 'as if' basis then.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give that a first crack, I mean Spain, we think is doing okay, that is in line with the expectations, so in that sense the first quarter confirms also our view when we sort of did the impairment when we took the impairment charge, which technically is related to the overall assets, but as we highlighted the negative effects we were &#x2013; in particular seeing in Italy. And that is also confirmed, I would say by the first quarter, where we see lower volumes than expected and at this stage, we also do not yet see a major recovery coming just around the corner. I think this is going to be a difficult year for Italy, during the entire year unless the overall market turns, but I think more we can't say at this stage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon sir. First question is regarding the implications on the regulatory for the store in Germany about the TSO business, so you mentioned the positive outcome regarding that what happened in the oil business, and what's the status for the gas <mark type="inaudible" /> business here, so we can expect probably a statement of the regulator over the next few weeks. Are you also now a bit more relaxed regarding that subject, that's the first question. The second question, regarding the guidance for the full year, is there a dummy included, coming from potential negative earnings impact from smaller disposals or asset swaps, which you have in mind here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the second question first, no there is no dummy included. And as far as a gas transport is concerned, look &#x2013; I mean as you point out, this is right now being negotiated and discussed and anyway I would say it's also not terribly wise, it wouldn't be terribly wise on our side to throw out a specific number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This would be included for the full year, and I mean, I think, we highlighted, so let me just remind you what we said in the context of our March 10 announcement. We said that we are &#x2013; when we are looking at 2010, we were anticipating roughly 500 million negative effect from regulatory issues, when we were to compare what we projected in May '07 for the year 2010, and our current view on 2010, and that 500 included three effects and roughly a third of that stems from our expectation in terms of what's going to happen to the gas transport business; that gives you, I think an indication on the numbers.</p>

Second question, just again to come back on the adjusted net income and these tax provisions, is it correct to say that without &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; without that provision release, the adjusted net income number would be 150 to 160 million lower, have I interpreted that right or is it just the tax avoided on that 150 to 160?</p>

          <p>Gentlemen. Just a quick follow-up on the disposals, I mean I understand you said that you have given yourself time until 2010 but if the economy continues to be weak that's certainly better earlier than later, so with regard to the different assets, is there any issue on the buyer side with regard to financing it. Do you see issues now or is it just the structure of that one asset might be to have a difficult structure, the other asset is highly regulated, that that are the major issues or could you may be elaborate a little bit what are the kind of topics, why you see the deal maybe coming later or earlier, is it financing or is it rather the asset itself which is discussed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me talk about it. It's not primarily the financing, I mean financing is important, we want to have, let's say, sufficient assurances that you want to sell an asset that the buyer can pay.  But and that's why, we ask for binding bids with the respective financing secured, when it comes to looking at potential buyers, but that's not the only issue, it's also the question of different assets we are considering for disposals, and therefore, different let's say buyer communities and, or interest groups, let's put it this way.  And certainly the fact that the regulator changed the position on the TSO for the power business helped us because effectively it increases also the value of the TSO and thereby sort of provokes renewed interest in that specific asset.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just relating to Pan-European Gas. The first question is what does it bring to you to have changed the presentation, you breakdown in another way now that hopefully you provided a cycle number.</p>
          <p>And the second question still on Pan-European Gas, am I right when I am looking at the debit that is down 90%, and I do a correlation with the volume that have gone (1.14.30) 23%, it's on an interim report page 11 where I have 185 terawatt hour and assuming that 174 on wholesale market units are sold on the trading business, is it correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get the question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get this, will you mind to repeat it again John in simple terms for me to understand. Excuse me John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're selling some gas, okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I look at the table, page 11 of your interim report?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have the Pan-European Gas 180 terawatt hour.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of 23%. Is this a &#x2013; is this correlated to the EBIT that is down 90%, am I talking about the same number here because after that I have a second line that is wholesale market unit, that is very vague I have to say, 174 terawatt hour plus 51%, is this 174 sold under trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is, some of that is transfer from Ruhrgas to energy trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's actually the major &#x2013; that's a major effect. We have the, when you look at the decline at Pan-European Gas corrected for Thuga and Ruhrgas International that gives you sort of the mineral Ruhrgas business, you can see we are down roughly 40 terawatt hours, of that 40 terawatt hours roughly 13, 14 had been transferred to energy trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Page 12, my colleague has asked me John, that page 12 shows a breakdown of what you been asking these questions on this, other the market units for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the transferred, there is- is this transfer again Ruhrgas is down, is down in volumes roughly 40 terawatt hours of that 13, 14 terawatt hours is transfer from Ruhrgas to energy trading, internal sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what does it bring to you to have changed this presentation of Pan-European Gas from the old one where we have a concession. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what does it bring us, I think, I would rather turn that around, we had frequently been asked by investors and analysts, why we were showing all our businesses in the breakdown regulated, non-regulated, and we always said, we have technical issues in getting those numbers in time confirmed by the auditors, those technical reasons have been worked on last year, and as we promised in Q1, we would for the first time show this breakdown, we're showing it now. So now this unit is, now you can also answer the question, how much of our business is regulated and how much is non-regulated?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, you want to make comment on that this evening?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, next question comes from Abe Shah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi &#x2013; I just had a question, no one has really talked about the Russian business today, there have been a number of different articles in the press and comments from various government ministries about the potential to defer CapEx on new projects. I wondered if you could give us an updates on the new generation facilities you are building and whether you have any plans to delay those, if indeed you are allowed to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Surgutskaya GRES-2 plant will be delayed by two years. It was originally planned to have that finished, be fully available in 2011, this will now take longer. That's the one plant, where we have a delay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mrs. Karin Brinkmann of UniCredit. May we have your question please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Grussgot everyone. Only two questions for clarifications. The first one, I assume that impact from the Yuzhno Russkoye is already included in your outlook for 2009. And the other question is you mentioned in the forecast the 5000 megawatt of generating capacity, you have to dispose of another agreement with the European Commission, do you have to finish it in 2009 or if you could please update us on this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first answer is yes, and the second answer is, we've got six months for the transaction plus the possibility to extend for another six months. For some reasons, we will now request the extension to be granted, so that we will have six months more and we expect to finalize all transactions within that timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Andreas Thielen of MainFirst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just one more thing, we have been trying to reconcile the impact from the transfers, would it be fair to say that ET is roughly down or that I have roughly 220 to 230 million coming from transfers impacting the EBIT of energy trading, if that sort of roughly correct size and the second is given the decisions taken now by the regulator, would you say, it's fair to say that for the group overall the impact of the 500 million, which you have give and take, I mean taken for granted that you obviously have no insight yet on gas transport that taking that would be unchanged, that the impact should be lower than you have originally thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the first one, the estimate is directionally correct. On the second one, there were always three effects on the regulatory side, when you call it &#x2013; hardship.  Here we have some hope that this will be solved, gas transports here we are &#x2013; here we think this will hit us, and then the reduction in the DSO tariff, that has already hit us, because don't forget, we made our original expectation back in May 2007. And we saw significant haircuts to the DSO tariffs in Q2 of 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the answer would be there is no change, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are, look, I mean as far as the hardship situation is concerned, there is some hope that some improvement with turn out to be better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I guess we have time maybe to take last two questions please. Mia just go ahead with the two last questions please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the next question comes from Vincent de Blic of Cazenove.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions left. First I just wanted to check on your guidance, if the fat EBIT this year and the 11 billion in 2010, was assuming the sale, rather than the swap of the remaining capacity you have to sell in Germany. This is what page 26 of the report seems to imply, but I don't think it was what one of your previous answers was suggesting.</p>
          <p>And the second question is will there be a PPA charged this year for Italy and Spain, I think there was something for Russia in 2008, about &#x20AC;100 million, I was wondering whether there was something for Italy and Spain from 2009 onward.  Thank You</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the outlook is concerned for 9 and 10, we've always said that this is assuming constant portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and as far as the PPA charges for Italy and Spain is concerned, the full year effect it's &#x2013; it's clearly been minimized. It's around 20, &#x20AC;25 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the 9.1 basis?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes, correct.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, we will take the last question, I think Martin Young is waiting for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question comes from Martin Young of Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi once again. I have a couple of follow-up questions, getting back to the loss that you are making in the retail business in the U.K. I know it's not easy to compare your activities against the activities of your competitors, but one of the things that was very notable from <mark type="inaudible" /> this week, that they were commenting that their retail margins were actually at the top of the cycle range.  So, clearly a marked difference between what you are achieving and what they've been achieving.  Just wondered if you could shed some light on what must be the hedging and pricing policy that you have undertaken that's resulted in you incurring a loss in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just following up on Chris's about the tax rate, I don't think you specifically answered whether it was 150 million, we should be taking off the &#x2013; the adjusted net income, or I guess the taxation impact on that we should be round about 50 million? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; what I was saying maybe wasn't clear enough, this effect is a full-year effect, which the way the tax calculation works. It is spreads evenly over the quarter. And the first question on UK retail, I mean I am not commenting on Centrica.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Martin we'll have to get back to you with my colleague, and we'll get back to you on that, ok.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Mia I guess that concludes our conference call. I would like to thank Wulf and Marcus for their great support, not just during this conference call but also the support they've given. It is a dream for any investor relations person to have a CEO and CFO supporting you so strongly.</p>
          <p>Second thing, I want to thank all my colleagues and my team for what they've done all these years and also finally not to forget analysts and investors who have given great confidence in me and trust you have shown towards me and the warm relationship we have developed over all this years. So, this is the opportunity I take to say good bye. I'm still available. My last date is 19th of June. You can still call me but Sascha Bibert is there. Now he is taking over the stuff, so he is going to answer all the difficult questions. I'm going to relax and answer the easy ones.  Wulf?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So, before we finish the call, I would like to take the opportunity Kiran, to thank you for your dedicated and excellent work over the last 17 years. We had numerous conference calls together. This unfortunately is your last, but there is always a last one in one's career and you will do something else in the future. So you will be associated with the financial community in a different capacity, we will see again and there is a better opportunity to say good bye to your deferral party but in this group now, we would like to thank you for all you've done.</p>
