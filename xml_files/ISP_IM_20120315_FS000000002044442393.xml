          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the Presentation of the 2011 Results hosted today by Mr. Enrico Cucchiani, Chief Executive Officer. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. My name is Kiara [:23] and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. As a reminder, there will be a question-and-answer session after the prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Enrico Cucchiani. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, or good morning or good evening wherever you are or you may be and welcome. I am Enrico Cucchiani and Carlo Messina, our General Manager and CFO is here with me on this conference call. Carlo and myself would like to thank you for joining us and for your interest in Intesa Sanpaolo. I also thank you for your patience and I apologize for the delay.</p>
          <p>It is my privilege to share with you the 2011 financials that have just been released. I believe that in a very difficult year, Intesa Sanpaolo has delivered solid results, demonstrating its resilience and ability to provide competitive rewards to shareholders. As I joined the Bank, just a few weeks ago, I cannot take any credit for all this, but I take the opportunity to thank my colleagues and my predecessor Corrado Passera. They are the ones who deserve the full credit.</p>
          <p>So just to set the agenda for the call, I will review 2011. Then I will turn to the actions that we are taking to deliver value in 2012. And then I will set out some early guidelines on the future strategic direction of the bank. At the end of the call we will be delighted to take any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Now we move on to slide number two, please. The 2011 highlights, Intesa Sanpaolo can rely on a very strong capital base. Our core Tier 1 is at 10.1 and the EBA capital ratio is at 9.2%, these ratios are after dividend. As we will see later in detail, we have been very conservative in provisioning and we have strengthened our balance sheet to be prepared also in case of adverse scenarios.</p>
          <p>Had we've been less conservative, our net income before goodwill impairment would have been far higher. Nonetheless we turned in a net profit in excess of 2 billion, which allows us to pay a good dividend with a dividend yield of approximately 3.5%. Efficiency has also improved and the cost income is a healthy and competitive &#x2013; is healthy and competitive at 54.4%. In fact only three banks in Europe among the large ones are more efficient than Intesa Sanpaolo.</p>
          <p>We show a good top line development, a rare event in this environment and an improved operating margin. We also show a significant goodwill impairment, which represents just an accounting adjustment with no impact whatsoever on underlying profitability and capital position. This item will be analyzed in detail later on. All-in-all, I believe that Intesa Sanpaolo is well-positioned to tackle future challenges and to exploit opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide number three to analyze the P&amp;L. Operating income in 2011 is up 2% versus 2010, and is &#x20AC;270 million above consensus. While costs are down for the fifth consecutive year, and they are well below consensus, yielding a very attractive 54.4 cost income ratio, as mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, at the same time, is up 6% and is &#x20AC;350 million above consensus. Loan loss provisions are also up 34%. That is &#x20AC;1.1 billion above consensus, reflecting a very prudent reserving policy and the deliberate decision to build up a counter-cyclical buffer. More on the topic will come in later slides.</p>
          <p>We also have &#x20AC;1 billion of non-recurring charges on Greek sovereign debt and more than &#x20AC;700 million of restructuring costs, that is, dismissals incentives and investments for improved future efficiency. Despite extremely cautious provisioning, we turned in a pre-goodwill impairment net profit which is in excess of &#x20AC;2 billion, which allows us to pay a healthy dividend.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide number four to address one of your key questions that is the goodwill impairment, the biggest item on the P&amp;L. If I may give some editorial comments, goodwill is a rather elusive item. For the sake of simplification, we can say that there are two kinds of goodwill, goodwill related to acquisitions when you pay more than the book value and goodwill related to mergers based on paper against paper share swap at values higher than book. These situations typically reflect multiples prevailing at the time of the transaction.</p>
          <p>The Intesa Sanpaolo goodwill is predominantly of the second kind and, in the end, there are significant areas of discretion, that is, we could have easily adopted methodologies justifying an impairment of significantly lower amount. We have decided to adopt a very aggressive and conservative write-down, in line with our rigorous approach. In the end, goodwill impact paper reserves built up after acquisitions and mergers, and you know very well that when this happens they only the affect balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On the other side, impairments flow through the P&amp;L according to IAS. Despite the big number, there is clearly no impact whatsoever on true profitability, cash flow, liquidity and capital ratios. At the end of the day, Intesa Sanpaolo offers a more conservative representation of its assets and liabilities, period.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide number five to highlight other leaders through which we have further strengthened our balance sheet. If we turn to the right part of the slide, on the third highlighted item that is net tax benefit, we see that we have taken advantage of it to strengthen the balance sheet all together. How have we done that? Well, by significantly increasing loan loss provisions and provisions for performing loans, creating buffers against future uncertainties and investing aggressively in restructuring for future improved efficiency.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide six, where we can appreciate a positive contribution by all business units except public finance. It seems to me that the performance of corporate and investment banking as well as insurance, asset management and financial advisors are particularly noteworthy. The performance of public finance, the only business unit with negative contribution, suffers the impact of the bulk of our Greek government exposure.</p>
          <p>Let's now get into some deeper analysis as we turn to slide number seven to examine the evolution of quarterly performance. I'm sure you're intrigued by our Q4 development. Q4 shows a sharp increase in loan loss provisions. In the coming slides, we will provide you factual evidence why this does not reflect credit deterioration but the deliberate decision to beef up reserves and buffers.</p>
          <p>On this slide, though, I would also like to draw your attention to some important positives. In particular, the increase of operating income even in a deteriorating environment, the sharp decrease in operating costs, minus 5.3%, and the double-digit growth of operating margin. All this is versus Q4 of 2010, but not only we are also ahead of you guys, operating income is &#x20AC;220 million better than consensus and operating margin is &#x20AC;270 million ahead of market forecasts.</p>
          <p>Now on slide number eight, we start our deep dive into the crucial issue of credit quality. As said before, loan loss provisions have indeed increased by 34% and the cost of risk that is net loan loss provisions over loans has increased by 29 basis points. Approximately half of the increase is related to non-recurring items, such as Hungarian foreign exchange mortgages. The other half is related to balance sheet strengthening. For instance, we have further increased the performing loans reserve which now amounts to 80 basis points on performing loans.</p>
          <p>Let me now show in the coming slides why increased provisions do not reflect credit quality deterioration. Slide number nine, while cost of risk goes up, the coverage ratio that is the provisions on problem loans moves in the same direction which is a good sign. If credit quality were to deteriorate, the coverage ratio would clearly move down. At the same time, and let me once again underline the fact that the performing loan reserve substantial to begin with further increases to &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we get additional strong evidence that credit quality is not deteriorating. On the contrary, it is improving. As you can see, and as I said we are on slide 10, the inflow of non-performing loans has improved significantly and has indeed decreased by &#x20AC;1.5 billion, that is minus 12.5%.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we get great comfort from the steadily high recovery ratio. As far as prudent provisioning is concerned, suffice it to say that over the 2009, 2011 timeframe, the recovery ratio of our doubtful loans has exceeded their book value by almost 50%. To sum it up, our prudent reserving approach is -- I would say quite evident. We don't know what is ahead, but we are well prepared if we run into strong headwinds.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to -- from the detail to the big picture. And let us turn to slide number 12, where we see that Intesa Sanpaolo on several KPIs is in line or better than its European peers. Return on tangible equity is significantly below peer average. This gap is determined by, first of all, as we can see in the second lower box by the lower leverage, which reflects lower trading activity and greater focus on traditional commercial banking, which is typical in Italy. And this frankly is not necessarily a bad thing. If we go further to the right at the lower end, we also see that we have higher loan loss provisions, almost double the European average.</p>
          <p>There are two factors leading to this high figure. One in Italy we typically have a very high level of LLP. But two, this ratio is even higher in the case of Intesa Sanpaolo because of our conservative buffers buildup as we have seen in the previous slides. On the other end, if we go to the green area, we see the return on tangible asset is aligned with European peers. And it would be significantly better, if risk cost ratio -- the risk cost ratio were in line with European standards.</p>
          <p>Operating income divided by tangible assets is much better than the European average and the efficiency is far, far higher. As I said, there are only three large European banks that have a cost/ income that is lower than ours. Overall, as a bank from the Eurozone periphery, Intesa Sanpaolo is performing rather well. In comparison to other large Italian players, Intesa Sanpaolo would definitely come across as best-in-class and we would encourage you to run this very simple analysis once the data of the peers are out.</p>
          <p>Intesa Sanpaolo also performs quite well in terms of rewarding shareholders, as we can see in slide number 13. The total amount of cash dividend paid by Intesa Sanpaolo puts our bank in the seventh position out of 17 European peers, ranking well ahead of much larger competitors.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash dividend yield, Intesa Sanpaolo ranks number three, while with a dividend yield of 3.4%, 3.5%, while the payout &#x2013; in terms of payout ratio, there is only one peer that does better than us and marginally so. It is important to once again underline that capital ratios remain high even after dividend payment.</p>
          <p>After this overview of 2011, we now get into 2012 and the actions taken to address an environment that continues to be uncertain and challenging. Please turn to slide number 15. Borrowing from my friend Mohamed El-Erian, I could say that, the new normal is still far away. How far and how bad or how good it will be, nobody knows. The only certainty is that the road to get there is going to be bumpy.</p>
          <p>In our GDP development we consider a small contraction at Eurozone level, according to the ECB outlook. For our base case, we use the conservative IMF forecast, that is, minus 2.2% for Italy. The IMF outlook is the most pessimistic, and our competitors choose more optimistic scenarios. We consciously do so, because we want our troops and our ammunitions to be ready for the battle.</p>
          <p>Our motto is hope for the best but be prepared for the worst. While we have seen a step change in the confidence &#x2013; in confidence in the economic governance of Italy, and a forceful leadership at the ECB, we continue to remain cautious on the European leadership.</p>
          <p>However, we are not scared. We learned from the Chinese who are wise enough to see that in every crisis there are opportunities. If we turn to slide six, we get a little bit of a colorful representation. In Chinese, the word crisis as most of you know; is expressed by one ideogram which is divided in two parts. The upper one means risk, the lower one opportunity. In Darwinian jargon we could say that "the weak get weaker, the smartest and most adaptable prevail." We are focused on the opportunities and we consider ourselves smart and adaptable.</p>
          <p>What are we doing to deal with the scenarios we are facing? Let us find the answers on page 17. We have identified five key short-term levers. Lever number one, re-pricing of loans and services, we believe we have some room for improvement. Lever number two, reallocation of capital from EVA negative to EVA positive targets, which we can identify in a highly granular way that is at customers level, individual customers, products, segments and so on.</p>
          <p>Lever number three, we have set up a special taskforce to manage non-performing loans. Lever number four, we are engaged in the smart use of the LTRO facility such as lower -- lowering the cost of funding, buying back hybrids and engaging in carry trade. Lever number five, we are committed to aggressive cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Now, we have prepared for the storm, but how is 2012 shaping up so far? Let us turn to slide number 12 -- I mean 18. I spare you the reading. I just think it shows we have successfully pioneered the comeback to the wholesale market after several months of abstinence among banks of the Eurozone periphery. And in doing so, we have reaffirmed a very strong credibility on the market.</p>
          <p>We have engaged in lucrative buy-back of hybrids. We have not been shy in drawing from the LTRO, all together we have drawn &#x20AC;36 million and we are making good use of it. In the first quarter, all in all revenues are up 5%, costs are down 1.5%, and operating margin is showing double-digit growth, I repeat double-digit growth. It is too early to call it a success, but it is better to have a good start than to fall behind.</p>
          <p>Now, please allow me to take a glance into the future, bear with me, and let's go to slide 20. As far as banks are concerned, boring is the new sexy. I am afraid; I have to report that for us execution is the strategy. Assuming that you can live with that, it is important for me to share with you my core beliefs, because you don't have numbers against, which to judge me and this will be the principles against which you will measure me and hold me accountable.</p>
          <p>You can see my core beliefs on the left-hand of the slide. Now, let me tell you, how they translate into our five priorities. Priority number one, protect capital and liquidity. Priority number two; deliver sustainable profitability in excess of cost of capital. Again this is a priority, we will not achieve it tomorrow, but we're committed to work very aggressively in that direction.</p>
          <p>Priority number three, deliver best-in-class performance in all the markets we decide to compete. Priority number four, write-down structure of costs. Finally, priority number five, remunerate capital and reward shareholders.</p>
          <p>In order to be competitive and create value in an environment with higher capital requirements, lower leverage, higher cost of capital and possibly prolonged higher risk costs, banks have to adapt their business model. It is not going to be either quick or easy. We have given a lot of thoughts to our transformation journey. The preliminary guidelines start on slide number 21.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond 2012, we have identified a wide range of structural levers to trigger the transformation journey that will sustain our performance and health in the long run. Here are some of the themes that will characterize the transformation journey. Reduced complexity and costs of Retail Banking, while improving the customer experience, activate appropriate growth engines for corporate and Investment Banking that is identifying niches of competitive advantage, internationalizing Italian corporates, also developing a regional strategy for our international subsidiaries, fostering synergies, sharing platforms, factories and best practices.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide number 22. We will also reduce operating costs, both focusing on product factories and simplifying group structure and processes. We would push for digitalization, both to streamline processes and to improve customer services. But in the end, our business is all about people and talent is going to be key to our success.</p>
          <p>Let me now conclude with a few but firm commitments on slide number 23. What you can expect from us is strong &#x2013; generation of strong capital ratios, a robust balance sheet, sustainable cash dividends and for the cash dividends I would say that the 2011 dividends per share level is going to be the floor.</p>
          <p>These are the foundations we are building on. We are committed to deliver best-in-class performance in all markets, as I said, we decide to compete in. And we are committed to exceed expectations. I've done that &#x2013; just that throughout my professional life and I will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Let me now thank you for your attention and I'm &#x2013; we are now ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. And thanks very much all for the presentation and the clarity. One of your points is remuneration of capital and shareholders and good point on the dividends. But also, in terms of return on tangible equity on the two parts, you want strive in increased capital, where are you aiming to get to on capital?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on return, I know you've given us some commentary on your guidance for 2012, but if you could just articulate a little bit more, where the return will improve? Which and where are the moving parts and I know that 2012 is a tough year but if you can give us a bit color on what you see there and where you see perhaps return moving to maybe in 2013, hoping for a slightly more positive economic environment that will be very helpful? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Francesca for your question. The line was a bit disturbed &#x2013; I didn't understand about increase in capital -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so you're saying effectively you want to continue to improve capital. You already have a good level. Where do you think you should be aiming to? And at the same time, where do you think your return on tangible equity can aspire to get to if not this year maybe next year. And a little bit more color on the 2012 guidance, which you have hinted to in your press release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are fine with our capital level. And we do not have any &#x2013; we do not foresee any need to do increase our capital ratios. I &#x2013; as far as the remuneration, I mean the return on capital. I think we live in an extremely volatile environment. And at this point in time, I don't think we are prepared to give you any specific figure. We have to deal with a lot of uncertainties, external uncertainties. I refrained from releasing any figure at this stage. While on the other side, we are very adamant. We almost have a fixation on delivering performance and performing better, significantly better than our peers.</p>
          <p>Let me say something that perhaps many of you would not like. I don't believe so much in planning in highly volatile environments. While I strongly believe on the control part that is why we are developing some controlling models internally that are extremely granular. So that we can intervene on a very timely basis, at the operational level that it is at customer level, product level in order to improve our performance and outsmart our competitors.</p>
          <p>In my experience, my professional experience, that is what I've always tried to do. And maybe I've been lucky, but performance has always exceeded any plan and even my own expectations. And most important, I've always delivered better than peers, significantly better than peers' performance on a constantly improving part. Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Good afternoon, thanks a lot. I just have one question and you're saying these set of results, you are basically trying to anticipate the tough 2012, and increase the reserves and the coverage against your bad loans in your loan book. Now in 2012 you will have some positive support at the top line from the LTRO.</p>
          <p>Is it fair to assume that Intesa will continue with a very conservative policy, and will use any potential extra earning to even go farther and raise even farther, their reserves against asset quality? Basically if you are &#x2013; you will keep, you would remain focused on increasing the reserve against a macroeconomic environment that is deteriorating. So if we should assume that any potential extra earnings coming from the use of ECB funding, it will be used in 2012 to further raise your coverage and your reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We believe we've been very prudent and I think we are prepared, if there is a further deterioration in the market, but we are quite happy. And I mean, I don't think &#x2013; one thing is being prudent and one thing is building up reserves for the sake for building up reserves.</p>
          <p>I think that we also have considered reserves a counter cyclical buffer, but once they are fine, they are fine, and in fact if the situation improves and we are confident at one point they could also go down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have three &#x2013; let's say, two quick questions and one a bit longer. And the first question is on the very good trading gains that you recorded in the fourth quarter, &#x20AC;280 million, if you can give us some details on where these gains were made, which asset class, so just to give some color on that?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the IFS reserve, which was negative. The second question is on the available for sale reserve that at the end of December was &#x20AC;3.3 billion negative, clearly. If you can give us an update given that the strong rally of the BTPs under the Italian sovereign bonds, what is roughly this reserve right now, what kind of improvement so far?</p>
          <p>And the final question on the saving shares many companies in the last years have converted their saving shares including the Allianz Group that you know very well in Italy. They decided at a certain point to convert the rest of the saving shares. And let me ask the question in this way, what are the reasons that you see for not converting the savings shares and getting &#x20AC;0.5 billion of additional capital under Basel III? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the third question and then I'll leave these first two questions to Carlo Messina, General Manager and CFO. Saving shares was a good question. I mean, we are not particularly in love with savings shares. We'll see what we can practically do with them, but certainly they are not a particular efficient source of capital. Carlo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Referring to trading income, you can go to page 41 and page 42. You have all the details of the different incomes that are generating the &#x20AC;1.73 million of result in  the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we have analyzed the losses and in fourth quarter we benefit from real positive results, both on capital market side and also on the proprietary trading and treasury results, and also relating to the customers we have a positive apport of &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>Considering your second question, so the IFS reserve. We have an improvement of &#x20AC;1 billion in the last two months in the total IFS reserves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for the presentation. I just had a few questions. First of all, if you could give us any guidance on what you think the impact from the different situation on the funding markets in the recent weeks, the use of LTRO and also the strong asset repricing which has been conducted by Intesa will have over the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you could share your thoughts on the development in asset quality, surely there is &#x2013; we know, we are in the middle of a recession, but our feeling is that the asset quality is so far more or less old enough, but I think a lot is in the hands of the banks and on how much credit tightening we may get, but I would be keen to get your views.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I understand that you are waiting before you update the business plan targets, but I would appreciate some initial thoughts on, first of all, the opportunities that Intesa may have in Bancassurance and the insurance products given the wealth of experience you can bring? And also the impact of the pension reform on the potential cost cutting that the group has announced last spring? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, considering the impact and the use of LTRO and the re-pricing, we expect to have during 2012, a relevant benefit from both of them, from LTRO, in looking at the reduction of cost of funding and the increase of interest deriving from our government bonds.</p>
          <p>And from pricing to continue the re-pricing that you can see in the slide on net interest margin that is slide 39, as you can see the increase in net interest margin in the fourth quarter related to the spread is &#x20AC;61 million and is all related with the <mark type="ph" /> Marcap (39:15). So we think that in 2012, we can have benefit &#x2013; a significant benefit from the action, of course, in re-pricing. Looking at the asset quality, we think that during 2012 we do not expect a significant negative impact and probably the cost of credit will be lower than in 2011. And looking at business plan and pension, Enrico, if you want to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as insurance, we have just consolidated our several operations. I think they are moving along pretty well. We have a very solid team in place. We are well-positioned. I think we are also doing something interesting in P&amp;C. Pension reform, I don't think is going to have any material impact on us. On the other side, there is one point that you didn't ask explicitly but gives me the opportunity of mentioning it, in the past, there have been rumors about the possibility that what we might list Fideuram, our network of financial advisors, or spin it off or whatever. Well, I would be quite reluctant to do any of that. I think it is a good and interesting unit, it is quite profitable, it generates a lot of value with relatively little capital, so we'd rather keep it in our hands. Next question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, good afternoon. I wanted to do a couple of questions. And first one is on net interest income and the follow-up actually of Matteo's question on asset re-pricing. And if you can some sort of quantify a little bit how much you have done basically in terms of corporate loans and how much is left in your mind before we get into an asset quality situation with some of those companies? And the second issue in terms of net interest income is on the hedging. I mean, to what extent actually that is sustainable beyond 2012 and what are you doing in terms of replacement of that potential hedging?</p>
          <p>And then second question is in terms of use of LTRO, obviously, you are not going to give very detailed numbers, but if you can elaborate a little bit in terms of the use of that money to replace all the finance sources and the amount of sovereign bonds you plan to increase or you have already increased in the first quarter of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as far as re-pricing and shifting from EVA negative to EVA positive customers and products and so on, that is very much predicated upon the maturing loans. And the important thing that you should have is that we have an extremely granular level of information concerning this fact. That is, we know exactly which loan, which customer is EVA negative, when it's going to mature, where it is, and that is what we are going to do. So this is not something, it's not a one-off. It is something that will keep us engaged for the balance of the year and it is something that, obviously, we will continue to do also in the coming years.</p>
          <p>After all, this is, you know, an exercise like going through your portfolio with a very fine comb. I'm not the best person to talk about that because, I mean, for the ones that haven't met me, I am rather hairless but that is the basic exercise, it's a good practice whenever you have a portfolio. And as I said, I mean, in 2012 we put a special emphasis on this, but we will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>As far as the LTRO, I don't think we want to release any specific figures on the specific allocation. But we can tell you that on the hybrid buyback, we set aside &#x20AC;270 million before tax, which is not too bad. And, I mean, for the balance we are going to allocate it to loans and carry trade according to what we'll deem appropriate. The most important thing is that, as you have seen, we have not been a shy bank. We have drawn from the LTRO very aggressively and we are fine and happy with that.</p>
          <p>And we &#x2013; it's difficult to indicate a figure, but I believe that the benefit of the LTRO over the next three years will translate before tax profits in excess of approximately &#x20AC;500 million a year. Again, this is not versus the old plan. It is under the current scenario, that is, had we've not drawn from the LTRO, our performance would probably suffer from the <mark type="ph" /> current market (45:04) money I have mentioned to you. Next question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, related to the hedging facilities, we have now &#x20AC;56 billion of coverage. So we have an amount of facilities that is &#x20AC;56 billion and the average interest rate is 2.8%. So we expect also in 2012 a contribution not lower than the one we had in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the time. A follow-up question on the repricing, could you give us a feeling as to how significant the repricing is by a major kind of lending category, like an SME loan, a large corporate loan and a mortgage consumer loan? That will be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the asset quality. The provisioning that you have taken today, does it already reflect the changing NPL definition from 180 days to 90 days overdue? And, lastly, what is your expectations as regards volumes, lending volumes in particular in 2012? Do you think you will be in a position to take market share? Can you give us any guidance as to where you see volumes kind of evolving? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me address couple of these questions. On repricing what I can tell you I think that on average we have potential room to reprice to the tune of between 30 basis points and 50 basis points on average. Okay? This is the potential. So from a practical point of view, we will see how much of that we get. But, all-in-all, it is a fairly significant amount. As far as volume on 2012, I think we can say a few things. Number one, in Italy, demand is not very high, it's low, or at least quality demand, because companies have been reducing their investments and that on the corporate side. And on the private side, demand for mortgages is moving along the real estate market.</p>
          <p>On the other side, I think that ISP is in the position of selectively expanding its market share. It is not our priority, that is, we don't have a target of growth because in an environment where credit quality is questionable, you want to grow only very selectively. But given the fact that we are the most solid, I mean, we are one of the two, let us say, very solid banks in terms of capital, and we have &#x2013; we don't have the problems that many other players have. I would be surprised if we didn't pick up some good market share.</p>
          <p>In financial services, I belong to a strange school of thought that I'm not &#x2013; I don't think that market share is the North Star. The North Star is the true bottom line, but if there is a chance of picking up some good market share, we are not shy about it.</p>
          <p>Carlo, maybe you want to take up the other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the past due, we had no relevant impact on provisions from the change in criteria from 180 days to 90 days in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what was the impact on the impaired loans itself in terms of the &#x2013; like a couple of basis points higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a couple, absolutely not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing, okay. And then just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not relevant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not relevant. And then just a quick follow-up on the re-pricing, the 30 basis points to 50 basis points, is that doable in one year or would you say, look, it's doable over a three-year period as the loan book grows or how quickly can we see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said before, I mean, it is going to be an ongoing effort, that is, when an underpriced loan comes to maturity, then, of course, we go for the re-pricing. But if the maturity is in 2013 or 2014, we will do when the maturity comes. That is why I said it has to become part of our genes.</p>
          <p>I think in the past perhaps ISP has tended to underprice, okay, or to be a little bit too generous. I think in the future we'll be a little bit more conservative with our pricing. But, again, it's not something that we will be able to deal this year. Do you have, Carlo, can you give an idea of the size of the portfolio that could be re-priced at this year, because it...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is something like &#x20AC;40 billion in the medium terms facilities and it is &#x20AC;100 billion in the short-term maturities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Pedro Fonseca from Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. I just have a question on loan loss charges. Unless I'm mistaken, if you remove the non-recurring items from your loan loss charges in the fourth quarter, it's still a rather high figure of about &#x20AC;1.3 billion, which is a run rate of 130 something basis points.</p>
          <p>And if I'm doing the numbers correctly, could you just give us some further color on this high number? And also give us an idea what to expect 2012 where under your base scenario if we will be in recession, I assume you'll be having higher loan loss charges than 70 basis points or 80 basis points with a consequent impact on earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you go to slide 46, so you have the detail of what we consider not recurrent, so it is something that you can consider just in order to try to say this is the run rate for the next year. And, as you can see, the normalized cost of credit is 88 basis points. So we think that in that range it will be the cost of credit of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe, yes, but if I take up the &#x20AC;2 billion you provisioned in the fourth quarter, that's, in fact, a &#x20AC;700 million one-off and I exclude the Mediocredito Italiano that &#x20AC;700 million, that's still &#x20AC;1.3 billion, that's about 130 something basis points. And I would like, if possible, to have some color on why this number was so high in the fourth quarter beyond the reasons, beyond the one-offs already identified by yourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In any case, as you can see from the past, the fourth quarter is already for a seasonal reason the peak in the year. So, in my opinion, you can consider just between &#x20AC;900 million and &#x20AC;1 billion, the typical amount of net provision in the fourth quarter. Then you have the other quarters that are below this amount. And so, if you want to estimate the amount for the year 2012, you cannot consider the last quarter as the run rate for the all the 2012 year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry for &#x2013; apologies for being so insistent on this point. Now I appreciate that, but it still was a fairly negative quarter even taking to account the fourth quarter. And I just wanted like to see a bit of color if there is any particular reason, I want to be sure why this happened. As well I guess you just said 70 basis points, 80 basis points for next year, which is a pretty good guidance. But I want to confirm if there's any color you can add why the fourth quarter was so high? Is there anything we should know?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that the answer is rather simple. We decided &#x2013; I mean, the fourth quarter, that's the quarter in which you close the accounts. We decided to be very conservative, to take a very conservative position and beef up reserves. And, again, if you look at the Italian banks, I don't think you're going to find other banks that have a provisional buffer on performing loans to the tune of 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't read, I mean, I tried to address this point in the slides, from slide, let's say, from slide seven onward, just because I expected that seeing a jump in fourth quarter reserves, you might think, my god, what happened? Has something gone terribly wrong? Are there some big problems? No, the fact is that if you really look into the inflows of non-performing loans, you see an improvement during the year, you see a recovery ratio that is very good and so on.</p>
          <p>We've just prepared ourselves just in case we run into headwinds that are worse than we expect. If you want to you may say, well, this guy's putting on suspenders and at the same time they have a belt and whatever, maybe that is the case. What I want to be clear is that I'm not doing this exercise simply because I'm a new CEO and I just want to amass a lot of fat.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, I've always run very conservative balance sheets in all the companies I've been responsible for. I think it's a good and healthy practice and particularly so when you have uncertainties about the future. I mean, let's face it, the economy, I mean, it could turn better. But we don't know. And when you have &#x2013; if the IMF prediction is true, that might have an impact also on credit risk. So we are preparing. And, frankly, I think you should appreciate this, the EBA approach has been pro-cyclical, building up reserves is counter cyclical. Personally I think it is a wiser thing to do. And if I were a policy maker, I would encourage banks to beef up reserves in good times. That is what we have done.</p>
          <p>After all, our decision was very simple. The tangible thing is that you reward shareholders with dividends and that we did and we were in a position to do that. We could have come up with a higher net income, with a better bottom line. We decided that instead having to satisfy the shareholders, it was better to be, you know, better prepared for sustainable profitability and distributing sustainable dividends in the future. No further reading into that. Believe me, we have tried to be as transparent as possible as we are among ourselves in sharing with you this information. Next question, sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a final question regarding this topic is, I mean, how do you draw comfort with expectations of 70 basis points to 80 basis points? If you think &#x2013; if you're going to go into economic downturn, are you seeing quality trends in your portfolio that gives you confidence that you can keep the loan loss charges at these levels?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Can you please repeat the question? It was not very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, how do you draw comfort with your expectations that you can keep loan loss charges at 70 to 80 basis points in the context that you have recession? I'm asking are there any sort of quality trends you see in your loan portfolio that give you this confidence that you can achieve this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the figures in 2009, that was the year in which we had a negative GDP of minus 5%, the cost of credit was not so high. So in my opinion, it is not to be considered as by definition an amount of cost of credit to be increased. You have to consider the relation with GDP, and minus 2.2% is absolutely less than minus 5% that we had in 2009. So, in my opinion, it's absolutely reasonable that this could be the level of cost of credit.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, in the end, again, if you go to slide number 10, you see the inflow of non-performing loans has decreased by 12.5% in 2011. Okay. I don't know &#x2013; we also live in a competitive environment. I believe we are the most conservative bank in terms of provisioning. You could provision more, but then you would have other problems.</p>
          <p>I think provisions have to be fair. Fair, of course, is a rather elusive notion, and there is some discretion in the way you define it. We believe and we started from the assumption that we wanted to have a very conservative, prudent approach, and we believe that relative to the rest of the market, we are. I think our provisions relative to the quality of our portfolio is very good. And if you look relative to the European average, Italian cost of risk is very high. Among the Italians, we have, I believe, we are at the higher range, with an improving loan portfolio and a very high recovery rate. Period.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. The question has been partially answered, but just to clarify, you did say openly on the press that you will be using the LTRO money to increase lending in Italy, to put it back into the system and so on and so forth. So I was wondering, assuming the conditions, as Mr. Messina said, they will turn out to be more difficult than management expects. If you do have a plan B, i.e., either giving back the money back after one year, which you can, or eventually going into carry trade or eventually doing other things? I'm not asking you to reveal your secret plans, but eventually if you can give us an idea the way management is thinking? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much, Carlo, for your question. The plan B is very simple, we are flexible. I mean, that is what theoretically we can do. But, I mean, the allocation of these funds is going to be done in a very rational way. And, again, I think that sometimes you really need to have clear ideas on how to run a company. When I illustrated our core beliefs, our core belief number one and it's not number two or number three, it is number one, is performance is the Intesa Sanpaolo North Star that means. That every decision is going to be made following this principle. So if the environment is deteriorating and we're sitting on a nice amount of money, it doesn't mean that we don't feel compelled to give it away and losing money, as simple as that.</p>

          <p>Now we have a question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have six questions but I will be very, very brief. The first is on dividend. Can you tell us what factors led you to reduce the dividend per share versus the $0.08 announced by Mr. Passera, and what your guidance is on the future dividend policy of the bank? Second, capital redeployment, do you consider the capital of the group to be allocated in the right divisions. And if not, where would you move it from and where would you redeploy it to?</p>
          <p>Third, fee expansion. Poland and Turkey used to be the priorities of expansion geographically in Eastern Europe for the group. Do you still consider entering these countries a priority? Four, wealth management. Do you consider replicating the RAS business model with Intesa Sanpaolo wealth management companies? Five, when you referred to consensus, which one do you mean, is it Bloomberg or just as a curiosity? And finally, saving shares are up 10% right now after the comments you made before. Can you please clarify as your approach to this item? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you're shooting like a rifle. Dividend, why not $0.08? Maybe I was talking too fast to Andrea, and I apologize if I did. But if you bear with me, and you go to page 13, perhaps we have the answer. Of course, you can ask all sorts of questions like why is it that in the morning you have light and you don't have dark? Why do you have dark at night and not light? But, I mean, in the end, again, we have some constraints, at least what we believe are constraints and they are the EBA parameters, the core Tier 1 ratios and so on. Okay. So we respect that. And then we also live in a competitive environment.</p>
          <p>If I look at the total amount of dividends, cash dividends paid by Intesa Sanpaolo, it's more than &#x20AC;822 million. We are ranked number seven out of 17 banks. Now you &#x2013; we did not put in the material that is being distributed the names of the other banks. But you can easily reconstruct it from your database given that we have the figures of the dividends and you will see that if you go below &#x2013; you go to number eight, number nine, number 10, number 11 and so on, you will find that these banks are actually larger than Intesa Sanpaolo, they pay less.</p>
          <p>I'm sure that if you were to go back to their plans provided in 2011, you would see that the dividends that they indicated, their guidance in their previous plans were far higher than the dividends they have distributed. In the end, I think that we are all pragmatic, and I mean, we all live in reality, plans are a good thing, but it's more important to stick to what you can do and be realistic about what you cannot do.</p>
          <p>Capital allocation, I am not prepared to give you any indication about how we are going to shift capital from division to division just for the time being be happy with one answer, we are going to work to improve the return on capital, on the capital allocated to any division.</p>
          <p>Three, expansion to Poland and Turkey or where have you. Again we have to be careful, there is a discontinuity. The discontinuity is not internal, the discontinuity is external. Until a few months ago, we lived in an environment which was completely different. In June, May or so a spread, an Italian spread at around 500 was completely unthinkable in this country and you do live in this country then we got to spreads of around 500 or above 500.</p>
          <p>Likewise, one could see that expansion in Poland, Turkey or wherever else as an appealing option. In theory, it is an appealing option but reality is that as I said before for the time being short, medium-term unless we have major modification in the external environment the perimeter of Intesa Sanpaolo is what it is &#x2013; that is, it is not going to be changed. There might be units that we might be happy to dispose of, but guess what? When market conditions are such that it is not easy to do so. There might be players that we might be interested in getting and we might also see that market prices are below anything we're seeing before, but guess what; if we do, we get outside of the boundaries of our parameters.</p>
          <p>So, we better rest our heart and get and stay focused on what? On execution, on doing better what we already do. I mean, the discontinuities in the market are where they are. Basically, all the plans that were done in the past by all players or so are an interesting, can be looked upon as an interesting exercise of little practical relevance nowadays. We have to live in reality and do the best we can with it.</p>
          <p>Consensus, frankly speaking, don't ask me I got this figure. I'm really &#x2013; I use them as a reference. I am not that keen to see whether they are &#x2013; we are on or off by 10 million, 20 million, 0.5% or whatever. I think in some respects the bank is performing pretty well. It's certainly is performing quite well relative to our other Italian peers. It is performing reasonably well relative to some non-peripheral banks as well. And there are some other parameters, in which there is room for improvement.</p>
          <p>And then what is, was the number six? Saving shares. Well, I mean sometimes people tend to read too much into words and that is their own problem. I mean, simply I'd like to reiterate that saving shares nowadays are not the most efficient form of capital for the reasons we all know. I mean, we don't need any comment, everybody knows that. That doesn't mean that we are necessarily going to do something, because it's obvious that there we might have practical issues and problems. So if someone wants to rush into buying them, it's their own problem.</p>
          <p>I don't hear, I mean, I have simply said that they are not a very efficient form of capital, when they were conceived the world was different, it was another story. We are not going to change the world. And finally the wealth management of &#x2013; you mentioned a company that doesn't even exist, that is RAS. There is Allianz. What are you referring to, Allianz Bank?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I believe that I mean, Fideuram is the closest thing to that model. So I mean, it's nothing new, nothing to be invented. Intesa Sanpaolo has a very powerful organization that is Fideuram. And as I said it is what I find most interesting besides the business model or whatever it is &#x2013; that it performs quite well and it generates a very nice return on capital. So that is why I like it and that is why we are going to keep it and possibly improve it, if there is room for improvement.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Alberto Cordara from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a clarification on a comment you made before, about double-digit growth in operating profit, if I understood correctly in Q1, if this is a year-on-year estimate or a Q-on-Q and if this is affected by the capital gain that you have on the bond buyback or not?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the comment that you made before that I thought was very, very interesting. In a situation of crisis you also have opportunity and the strongest become &#x2013; the strong become stronger, the weak become weaker, sometimes the strong become stronger also by buying some of the weaker. So I just wanted to clarify with you, whether you see external growth as one of the possibilities in the current environment, if there are opportunities out there or you definitely leave this possibility out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First question, double-digit growth was relative to Q1, 2010. Yes, it is the gain on the buyback of the hybrids is included, but even if we exclude that we have a healthy growth.</p>
          <p>Second question, Alberto, is on seeing a crisis as an opportunity, I think you've gotten exactly the notion that I wanted &#x2013; the concept that I wanted to convey. They present opportunity not only for the strongest, I mean, Darwin is focusing on the smartest and most adaptable, okay.</p>
          <p>The strongest ones sometimes are the first ones to die, if you look at the dinosaurs, they were the first extinct species. We are not the strongest. We are not the biggest in Europe. It would be presumptuous to say that we are the smartest, but we try at least to be reasonably smart. And if the others get weaker, yes, there will be better opportunities for us. And we will not be shy to capture these opportunities.</p>
          <p>You are saying well, this might also mean that you might have some non-organic growth that is you might gobble up some of the weaker ones. Frankly, I am not counting on that. I started out saying that I consider the perimeter as a constant, short, medium term unless we have significant developments in the macro environment, I think that we are what we are and we have to be focused on organic growth, internally focused.</p>
          <p>And as I said, and I apologized very openly at the beginning when I made that remark. I think that boring is the new sexy, okay. That is we are going to boringly focused on execution, on being the best at the fundamentals, being the best again is a little bit presumptuous. But we are going to be focused at trying or at becoming the best in whatever we do.</p>
          <p>And if there are opportunities you can never rule out anything in life never say never. But the ingoing assumption is that no, we are not going to do any acquisition or anything we are just going to be focused at getting better at what we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Domenico Santoro from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for the presentation. I might probably be more positive than my colleague. I think that you were right. You are actually preparing the balance sheet for tough times and probably other banks in Italy will do the same. So for me it's a good news and it's good news also that you are keeping an eye to your shareholders. Just &#x2013; so let's focus on the numbers for one sec? When I look at the non-performing loans growth quarter-on-quarter in Q4. This is actually 7% up vis-&#xE0;-vis Q3. So I was just wondering how much here there is &#x2013; how much is deterioration of credit quality &#x2013; real deterioration of credit quality or maybe it's also anticipating the trend of Q1?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the non-performing because the past management actually tried to sell probably a bigger chunk of your &#x2013; of the non-performing loans portfolio over the bank. Now that, I mean, with this clean-up of the order loan book probably potential buyer might have more comfort with your coverage ratio. So, I was just wondering whether you expect during this year maybe to sell part of your non-performing loan portfolio and maybe this is going to have an impact also on the provision policy this year.</p>
          <p>Then I know that you don't want to talk about the ECB and ECB funding and the LTRO. But I was just wondering whether you can give us the number right now or what is your exposure to ECB. I see on deposit, a decline of 2% quarter-on-quarter. So, I was just wondering whether you can comment on that. And whether, maybe there is still pressure in Italy on that side. And then again, sorry to be annoying, on the dividend and how shall we look at your &#x2013; at dividend in the future? Would you expect a gradual increase of dividend or maybe shall we apply just a payout ratio? That would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Domenico, for your comments and for your questions, part of which I will leave them to Carlo. But I think that we can to some, one in particular on the sale of some non-performing loans, we cannot speak just in terms of intentions, but we can give you some facts, something that we have done, that we have not mentioned.</p>
          <p>And as far as the dividend policy for the future, again, it is very difficult when you live in an environment where you are constrained. You have capital constraints. And when you live in a situation where the &#x2013; I believe that the business model of banks, of commercial banks has to be revisited in a pre-substantial way given the fact that as I said, we are dealing in an environment where there is a requirement for more capital. There is &#x2013; the leverage has to be lower. Loan, cost of risk will continue to be higher than normal until we get out of the recession and cost of capital is higher.</p>
          <p>So given the constraints and the development of the business model, I mean, it is very difficult to commit to any mathematical formula. I think, and please accept this, that it is wiser or more realistic to stick to principles. I believe that, number one, capital has to be rewarded, okay? And shareholders have to be remunerated and companies should not hold capital, unless they have a better way of employing it.</p>
          <p>So that I think should give you a good framework for guessing what ISP, what Intesa Sanpaolo is going to do in the future. Having said this, I will turn to Carlo for the other specific answers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just looking at liquidity. If you look at page 34, you have the amount of our exposure with ECB, so &#x20AC;37.5 billion is absolutely in line with the end of the year. So this is the amount of our recourse to ECB. And of each &#x20AC;36 billion is LTRO. It is important in my opinion also to look at the unencumbered eligible assets because we have an amount of &#x20AC;50 million. So it is a huge amount, and it is the demonstration of our absolutely very good position looking at the liquidity.</p>
          <p>If you -- just a quick flash on the deterioration or anticipation in credit quality, it is for sure the seasonal peak of the end of the year because it typically at the end of the year. In our opinion, we can consider also an anticipation of what can happen, and what could happen in the first quarter. So probably, first quarter could be better than the last quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Do you think that a potential buyer of non-performing loans can have some more comfort now, and more visibility on the quality of your loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We think that potential buyers can have interest in looking at our non-performing portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything on the table right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask another question on the NII?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe it's also worth remembering that we have very high recovery ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry to be annoying, just a last question on the NII, because my understanding is that you expect right now a contribution from hedging in 2012, which is going to be stable year-on-year that was the answer to the previous question. It's a little bit counterintuitive now that interest rates are going down, so I would just have expected something more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said not lower, so not stable. Not lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it will depend on the dynamics of the interest rates in 2012. So, it is probably that with the interest rate at 0.40 or 0.45, we can have also a slight increase in the contribution from hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It is very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Anna Benassi from Kepler. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. After so many questions and so many interesting answers, I'm left with a question regarding strategy. You have been very clear talking about the foreign potential expansion. I'm more curious of your view here in Italy, you are talking about some idea affecting and some of the business are including Banca dei Territori, how to improve performance and still you are cutting costs after a very good track record in the past few years. My question is all you have in mind that is still at the same perimeter also for the Italian business or you see some opportunities mid-size or small size in the country given the difficult situation still for many of the regional banks?</p>
          <p>The second question regards to EBA, you are at 9.2% and that has been one of the constraints you mentioned for paying a &#x20AC;0.05 dividend instead of &#x20AC;0.08 by the way. I think we will know that you could have paid nothing. So I appreciate that, but do you think that EBA is ready to do again the exercise to take into account at least for our country, but not just our country main difference that happened compare to the portfolios and the market value of the portfolios at the end of September, do you see any change coming on that side?</p>
          <p>The third and last question regards your cost of funding except the LTRO contribution very clear. I'm curious to know what is the situation on the retail funding side particular on the term deposits but also on current accounts after also the change of taxation on the coupons for personal, for private holders. And also you came to the markets pretty much brave at least the first &#x20AC;1 billion issued, but then you came the second time on the wholesale market by meaning and you paid a pretty fat price obviously. Can you explain why that given then you took pretty substantial LTRO at the end of February, what is behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Anna for your questions. Let me take the first two questions and I'll leave the third to Carlo. First question, if I can translate it in simple terms. You're asking whether we are going to participate in a possible consolidation game on the Italian market, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, I mean, the &#x2013; my compulsion would be to answer no. We have all what we need, okay. And we have plenty of homework to do, plenty of opportunities to improve working on our own Banca dei Territori, improving structures, driving down costs and improving customer service. I think that Italian banking system has an opportunity to do better and to modernize itself. I think we have something that is very positive. We are very close locally to the customers, but we can certainly become more efficient and more effective. We have a large market share in many regions.</p>
          <p>There are a few regions where theoretically, we could grow. But frankly, I don't see that as a priority. When you do that, you tend to be defocused. As I said, let's keep our perimeter as fixed let's consider it as fixed. And let us focus on systematic execution improvement, systematic improvement of our own operation. Let us stay focused on execution. As far as the EBA, if I understand, I'm sorry, but from here we don't hear all the questions too well. If I understand your question correctly, it is about a possible new stress test, if there are any developments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I think that the authorities have several times reiterated the fact that no, there will not to be an additional stress test. Do I believe the authorities? Well, I would say that I do tend to believe them. I don't rule out the possibility that there might be another stress test. But the fact is that this stress test turned out to be untimely and turned out to be pro-cyclical and I think it was not in the end very good for the European banking system. I think that we have to move to a different sort of approach with countercyclical measures. That is, I give you two examples, I'm not an expert in regulations. But I would say, that inducing banks to beef-up their provisions, their reserves at good times, that would be higher countercyclical, because then you can draw them down at better times.</p>
          <p>And in other way, another much more effective way would be to have contingent capital. Now forcing banks to raise additional capital at the worst time, worst in terms of performance of markets and so on, is going -- is very bad. It is a very difficult exercise. And even in this respect, I have to say that this bank was enlightened relative to others to the extent that we raised capital at a reasonably good time.</p>
          <p>So to come back to your question, no, I don't think that we're going to see another EBA stress test. I do not rule it out 100%, but I think it is quite unlikely and I think that on the other side it is up to the banks to a little bit -- to be a little bit more enlightened and to be prepared for stress situation and to think about it in good times. That is, I think the crisis -- a crisis always teaches a lot in terms of risk management.</p>
          <p>I think the risk management is something that is a little bit like the manuals on airplanes. Manuals for flying airplanes are written on dead bodies, whenever there is a crash, there is an accident, you improve the manual and that is what is happening with risk management. For the time being, I would not be so concerned about that. But I am concerned about making sure that our bank is well prepared even if we approach stressful situations. Carlo, I'll leave the last question to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, looking at the liquidity and the different alternatives to have funding. If you look at page 32, you have the detail of what we have done until now, so it's a &#x20AC;9 billion already placed which &#x20AC;6.5 is on the retail network and then you have to consider if you look at the page 33 that for us the retail deposit and the banking deposit are the real strategic items. So for us it is very important to continue to have the retail contribution to our funding needs.</p>
          <p>And then the wholesale market is the diversification of the funding. So it is not possible for a bank like us only to have the recourse of LTRO that is for sure a lever to which we can have a contribution to the old funding and the reduction of cost of funding. But a bank like us cannot have different areas of funding retail and wholesale. And looking at wholesale not only the medium-term, but also the commercial paper market that we want to increase and all the liquidity in the market is in our opinion in a position to increase in the next month also the commercial papers funding for our bank.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay. How many more questions are there? Three quick questions, because I think we are running out of time. I am sorry. I don't want to cut you out, but I am sure we are going to have more opportunities to have one-on-one, so to have other meetings but please I &#x2013; we'll take three more short questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just have a quick question on commission. On the fourth quarter commission has been suffering due to the need of the audits, the commercial strategy of going ahead on the liquidity side. Could you elaborate a little bit on what is the view for commission in 2012, because maybe with the volume still not picking up dramatically given the economic condition and the focus on liquidity and the LTRO auction, there could be some interesting development here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Again, I just ask you to go through page 40. Page 40, is the representation of the results in our net fee and commission income. If you look at the yearly analysis and also in the quarterly analysis, you have some indication of what can be the forecast for 2012.</p>
          <p>In 2012, it is reasonable to have a lower contribution looking at the management dealing and consulting activities. But at the same time, we expect an increase in commission from commercial banking activities. Then we have to see what could be the performance, its effects in the market, just to be sure to define a trend in management dealing and consulting activities.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had another question, a follow-on. I don't know if I can ask it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that the LTRO with all the liquidity that's been injected in the system would actually result in lower deposit rate on some area of the deposit component in Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for sure. Because through the LTRO we have a decrease in the government bond yields and all the medium-term funding of the retail activities in Italy is related with the government bond spread. So for sure we have now seen an important reduction, a significant reduction in the cost of funding also on the retail side.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'll try to be very short. Two questions. The first one is a follow-up on the hedging facility. You gave us an update in terms of the overall amount and the average rate. Can you also tell us until when it's going to be in place it's going to be produce effect these hedging facility? I understand that for 2012 it's going to have the full impact.</p>
          <p>And then going forward, last question on the repricing, I understand that you still have room to materially, say, to improve the spread you apply to your client base. My question is, do you think that such repricing policy is going to allow you to defend the overall average net spread? Or on the other hand, do you think there is also room to improve it in terms of <mark type="ph" /> end EBA (97:23)? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to have focus on the hedging facilities. As you know the amount of revenues will depend on the interest rate in the market. So looking at 2012, it is not easy but it is probably affordable forecast of the amount of net, net revenues that we can derive from the facility.</p>
          <p>Looking at the next year, it would depend on the interest rate. If the interest rate will remain at the same level, it is likely that we'll be in the range of this amount. So, for two or three years we can have a contribution on this level. Then it will depend on the interest rate because if the interest rate will increase, the contribution will decrease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear. I was actually asking exactly for how long it was going to last, but you've been clear. But their pricing is going to defend the spread or even improve it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You mentioned before the room that you still have in terms of re-pricing policy. And my question is, do you think that such re-pricing is going to allow you to defend the average spread in terms of NII or do you think there is even room to improve it in 2012 compared to 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is possibility to increase the contribution in net interest income deriving from the loans activity and so it is possible to have a contribution. We didn't increase in the net income &#x2013; the net interest income deriving from the loan side. At the same time, we have to consider the contribution in deposit side, because you have to know that mark-up is one side, but the other side is mark-down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah -- and I was wondering in net terms if you think that the impact on the mark-up side will actually produce a positive impact taking into account also that mark-down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect to have a discontinuity, because in the past we had for sure a very negative contribution from the combination when the interest rates goes -- when the interest rate goes down, we have a negative contribution looking at the combination of mark-down and mark-up. So we think in 2012 we can have some inversion in this mix between mark-down and mark-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Last question and then unfortunately we have to cut it, but we have room for one more short question, please.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to touch -- raise -- I will not forget <mark type="indiscernible" /> (101:46) as you have shown in the presentation is the fifth year in a row that you show a nice cost reduction. Now there is a new agreement with the banking association, do you think there is still another year where you can still show a reduction in cost or is it the risk that we're close to an end of the positive trajectory? I'm talking about 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Domenico. Let, please accept a fairly general and generic answer. I think that there is always room for cost reductions, okay. There is always room for improvement in efficiency. We will work to drive down costs. Of course, there are also other costs other than people and we also are a socially responsible organization. But again there is room for improvement.</p>
          <p>And the first thing that we are doing, we are working to reduce overhead, we have eliminated some amenities and I will not take you that far saying that bankers have become poor, but let's say we take the lead from our Prime Minister and we do try to have a sober lifestyle outside and inside the bank as well. We have adapted to the new environment and we are happy to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But these &#x2013; if I assume that for a bank like Intesa even excluding any additional head count reduction there is still room to reduce significant cost in the administrative expenses part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's see if we can positively surprise you in the years to come. I think that in the end being a lean company and a low cost product producer has to become embedded in our culture in our genes. And again I think we can continue to deliver along these lines.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>If I may, I would like to summarize some key points. 2011 has been a solid year, strong capital base, both in terms of EBA ratios, Core Tier 1. I think you -- most of you will see that we have been very conservative and very prudent in provisioning and altogether, we started out with a strong balance sheet. It's now I would say even stronger.</p>
          <p>We have proved our resilience in with a solid &#x20AC;2 billion pre-goodwill impairment, net income. Dividend-wise, well, I think we ranked pretty well in the European banking scene both in terms of absolute amount distributed payout ratio and dividend yield. Efficiency-wise, again, we're at the forefront and we're just one position shy of the podium with the cost/income 54.4. And again, I think we have shown a healthy growth in operating income and operating margin.</p>
          <p>The biggest item that we have on our P&amp;L, the one that may be shocking in its size, the goodwill impairment well, when we analyze it, we see that I mean, really it means very little to the extent that it has no impact whatsoever on capital ratios, no impact whatsoever on cash flows, liquidity and on real profitability.</p>
          <p>I think we'll try to give you an idea on our philosophy -- management philosophy and approach going forward. We're going to be focused on execution. We are going to be manic about execution. We have identified a few short-term levers to improve our performance in 2012, under very adverse scenarios. And after all, we can say that we've had a good start. Too soon, too early to draw conclusions, but it's always better to have a good start rather than starting with a handicap.</p>
          <p>We have also acknowledged the fact that we have to face the need of a transformation. We are going through a period of discontinuity and the bank has to adjust to the new normal. That is we're going to put the bank through a long transformation journey. The purpose of this transformation journey will be to make sure that the bank is going to be competitive throughout this decade. And to make sure that we become best in class in whatever we do, wherever we compete and that we can reward capital and shareholders in a way that will be of satisfaction to all concerned stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Having said all this, I would like to kindly thank you for your attention and for your questions. They are very important to us. And I want you to know that for us, it is very important to keep in touch with the investment community, with the analysts for one reason, not only because you are our customers, you are a very important customer, but also, because your feedback is invaluable for us.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very, very much and I look forward to seeing you again either personally or in small groups or whatever. And please feel free to contact our Investor Relations wherever you have questions. We intend to be not only a good performing company, but also a very transparent company. Thank you very much indeed. Have a very good afternoon, evening, day, night, whatever. Take care. Bye-bye.</p>
