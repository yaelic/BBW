          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the conference call on GDF SUEZ 2012 Third Quarter Results, organized by GDF SUEZ along with G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GDF SUEZ and Isabelle Kocher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>For your information, this conference is being recorded. Thank you for holding the conference chaired by Mr. G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GDF SUEZ. Mr. Mestrallet, I now hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for being with us very early. I am delighted to be with you to welcome you to this call. I am with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and Isabelle Kocher, and I will be sharing this presentation with Isabelle.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to comment on three key points. First, at the end of September, our results are solid and allow us to confirm all the 2012 financial targets. Second point, we have pursued with success the implementation of our strategy and faced adverse conditions in mature markets, notably in Europe. And three, we have continued to strengthen our distinctive profile.</p>
          <p>So, let's start with our key figures for the Q3. They are solid. Concerning the good performance already achieved by GDF SUEZ in the first semester, you have that on slide number two. This strong set of results have been achieved in a difficult context, in a context which is marked by a steady deterioration in the European market. Revenues have reached &#x20AC;70.9 billion up 8.4% compared to the same period last year. This growth in revenues is coming from all business lines and Isabelle will come back on that.</p>
          <p>EBITDA has increased by 5.8% to reach &#x20AC;12.8 billion in nine months, which is in line with our full year indication of &#x20AC;17 billion. On a normalized weather basis and excluding the impact from French gas tariff, the EBITDA growth over the first nine months of 2012 stands at plus 1%. Our debt amounted to &#x20AC;45.9 billion as it now includes the whole impact of the International Power full integration &#x2013; full acquisition.</p>
          <p>Let's have now a look to full year 2012 expectations. The robust performance posted by GDF SUEZ over the first nine months of 2012 allows us to confirm all our 2012 financial targets. And this &#x2013; despite some unfavorable impacts, first, the stop of two of our nuclear reactors in Belgium, Doel 3 and Tihange 2, around 1,000 megawatt each is stopped until mid January 2013 following, as you know, the 10 years periodic safety reviews and ultrasonic tests performed on these two vessels.</p>
          <p>As you know, the nuclear safety is a top priority for GDF SUEZ and we are currently performing studies by our teams and also studies are performed by international experts to analyze and of course, if possible, to validate and confirm the structural integrity of the vessel. We plan to finalize this thorough analysis by the end of November <mark type="ph" /> and submit in &#x2013; December (04:50) and submit it to the Belgian Nuclear Safety Authority at this date.</p>
          <p>The second impact, the new taxes announced in France. There is a tax on dividend, a cap on financial interest deductibility, an increase in social charges called in France as <mark type="ph" /> Coh&#xE9;sion Sociale (05:16) and the impact of these measures is close to &#x20AC;100 million at the bottom line for 2012. So we confirm net recurring income group share between &#x20AC;3.7 billion and &#x20AC;4.2 billion with an EBITDA indication close to &#x20AC;17 billion. We confirm also a growth CapEx between &#x20AC;10 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio close to 2.5 times and the A category rating. Our commitment to our 2012 dividend at least equal to &#x20AC;1.50 per share and this is secured by our ability to generate strong cash flow and our financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Now page four, a few words on the latest developments of GDF SUEZ, which are strengthening our distinctive profile as a global energy player. Our unique positioning in the LNG value chain has made progress with two new recent medium-term sales agreements signed with two major Asian players, KOGAS from South Korea and GAIL from India, for a total of 36 cargos in 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>Along with the other deals concluded since the summer of 2010 with the Chinese, also Indian partners, with also some diplomats from Malaysia, we now &#x2013; we ship 174 cargos to Asia by 2016. We also announced last week the opening of our new offices in Jakarta in Indonesia dedicated to business development for power generation and exploration, production activities in that country.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to our Energy Services business, a key advantage compared to our competitors, we signed early October a strategic partnership with the city of Barcelona, with the Mayor of Barcelona to design and develop the city, the concept of the City of Tomorrow. We'll provide a unique tool, designed and developed by the group from collection, analysis and optimal use of all available data about the city, concerning energy, electricity, gas, water, traffic, lighting and so on.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is focused on accelerating developments in fast growing markets of perfectly demonstrated by the inauguration two weeks ago of our new 1.1 Gigawatt hydro plant in Brazil at Estreito in the presence of Dilma Rousseff, the President of the Republic of Brazil. This is a very good example of our ability to build assets in markets, where energy needs are the most important and to secure the profitability of our investments, as we sold our stake of guaranteed energy output in the form of a 30 years term power purchase agreements with distribution in companies starting from 2012.</p>
          <p>Brazil &#x2013; slide five, Brazil is at the heart of our strategy in Latin America. With a continuous and successful growth, we have built there a very strong and diversified portfolio of assets. In 2011, the EBITDA contribution from Brazil was close to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Our long term presence in the country provides us competitive advantages. We have in-house technical know-how in engineering. We have <mark type="audio gap" /> (10:06-10:12) in free energy commercialization.</p>
          <p>As a leading private electricity producer in Brazil with over 8,000 megawatt of installed capacity and nearly 4,000 megawatt in construction, we consider our portfolio of assets as an excellent basis on which to build sustainable and profitable growth. We are ready to seize the opportunities in this market and we are currently studying several greenfield hydropower projects, such as S&#xE3;o Manoel hydropower plant and the Tapajos River Basin project.</p>
          <p>And now, I hand over to Isabelle, who will give you some details on our Q3 figures. Isabelle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I will continue this presentation with the details of our Q3 results. So, as G&#xE9;rard mentioned, the revenues stand at &#x20AC;70.9 billion, with plus 8.4% growth. It results in fact from a plus 6.9% organic growth and plus 1.5% from ForEx and mainly impact from U.S. dollar. This growth is supported by all the business lines, as you can see on the slide four. Three main messages to have in mind regarding revenues growth, first of all, Energy International posted a plus 3.9% growth, including the contribution of <mark type="ph" /> generic (12:00) of the old international power assets.</p>
          <p>The trends in the fast-growing countries, which benefited notably from commissioning of new power capacities, it is the case in Brazil, in Chile, in Thailand. These trends are good. They were slowed down by lower prices in major markets, and especially in fact in the U.K. and in North America.</p>
          <p>Second point to have in mind when we look at this turnover evolution, we benefited from a positive effect from weather in France, which has an impact on two business lines, Energy Europe of course and also Infrastructure, with a return to close to average weather conditions, in fact, a slightly cold climate and equivalent of two terawatt hour cold. And this has to be compared with minus 18 terawatt hour last year over the same period. Last year, as you remember, we had very hot weather on the contrary. So these accounts for a change in revenues of around &#x20AC;900 million. Third point to have in mind, Global Gas &amp; LNG posted 48% growth, thanks to a positive price effect from higher commodity prices in the E&amp;P and higher LNG sales, with 16 additional cargoes.</p>
          <p>Secondly, EBITDA on slide seven. So, the revenue growth translates into an EBITDA increase of 5.8%. Three comments on this slide. Firstly, EBITDA organic growth is also 5.8%, as you can see in the little box on the left hand side of the slide, since in fact the <mark type="ph" /> forex (14:07) effects and scope effects are altogether neutral. And indeed, the portfolio optimization program impacts are equally mitigated by positive scope effects and by foreign currency positive impact, mainly due, again, to U.S. dollar increase over Euro.</p>
          <p>As far as the disposal program is concerned, I remind you that we expect &#x20AC;550 million decrease of EBITDA in 2012 full year compared to 2011, related to the transactions we closed in 2011 and 2012 H1. Significant disposals could be done by the end of the year that result in a significant impact on the 2012 EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Second comment on this slide, the tariff and climate effects are detailed on this slide, as you can see. So, you see respectively on the left hand side and on the right hand side in light gray, the EBITDA we as in our P&amp;L, so respectively at the end of the Q3, 2011 and at the end of the Q3 2012. And you have &#x2013; at the same time, in dark gray, the figures as they would have been at climate and tariff normal conditions. And it is a way to appreciate the EBITDA evolution without these external effects.</p>
          <p>So you can see here the significant effect of the &#x20AC;212 million related to last year and reflecting the gas tariff shortfall of Q4, 2011, following the ruling of the Conseil d'Etat of July 10, which conserves the tariff freeze decided by the French government. So it is an EBITDA contribution related to last year. This figure of 2012 &#x20AC;1 million takes into account the weather conditions of these periods and an estimation of the risk of debt recovery and the invoicing costs associated.</p>
          <p>Now, if we exclude this impact of weather and gas tariffs in France, EBITDA increases by 1%, which is a mix of energy margin and the pressure in metro markets and of good performance in other businesses and especially in fast growing countries.</p>
          <p>Third comment on this slide, the indication for full year. For Q4, we expect similar trends with two exceptions. First exception, Energy Europe in this business line, the energy margins will continue to suffer and we will have the impact of outages in Belgium, in especially Doel 3 and Shuweihat 2. In E&amp;P, the production will slow down a little bit as expected as we mentioned already in our budget. So globally, we consent for full year, the indicative EBITDA of &#x20AC;17 billion at average weather conditions and stable regulation.</p>
          <p>The real figure will of course depend on climate as far as tariffs are concerned; we expect probably a shortfall of Q4 since the French government decided a tariff increase of 2% in October 1, instead of 6%. This shortfall would offset the positive tariff effects we had in Q3. However, you would have noticed that our competitors announced their intention to file again an emergency appeal towards Conseil d'Etat as they did last year.</p>
          <p>Let's examine now the business trends. In fact these trends are &#x2013; and I am on slide 8, very similar to the ones seen in H1, 2012 results. Let's start with Energy International. We see a strong performance of the fast growing markets. The first nine months profitability benefited from new generation assets contribution in these areas, such as Estreito in Brazil, CTA &amp; CTH in Chile, Shuweihat 2 in the United Arab Emirates, Al Dur in Bahrain, Glow Phase 5 and Gheco One in Thailand.</p>
          <p>On top of that performance in Latin America was good following the increase in sales prices in Brazil due to inflation. And even if we have seen also the end in Chile of exceptionally good conditions for power sales the growth in Latin is strong. In North America, market conditions were characterized by low energy prices due to low and even very low gas prices. Energy margins are flat except in Texas where the dynamic is positive, but where nevertheless we had a 2012 summer with lower temperatures than in 2011. All-in-all, profitability is down on an organic basis as seen in fact in H1.</p>
          <p>For U.K., Europe, profitability strongly suffers with a double-digit on an organic decrease from poor market conditions only partly mitigated by improved performance of wind assets and strong performance at First Hydro. In the Middle East, we have a stable and a good performance. Thanks to our long-term contract capacity exceeding invest of the Al Hidd partial sell-down. Asia delivered a two digit growth benefiting from the commissioning of new coal &#x2013; new coal plant in Thailand, positive performance of hydro power plants in Laos.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Australia, higher generation volumes coupled with increased prices and that is a reason why we had the significant increase of turnover. But as far as EBITDA is concerned, figures were mitigated by higher CO2 emission costs and as seen in H1, profitability is down in Australia on an organic basis.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to Energy Europe. Energy margins are under pressure as expected with a decrease of &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour in the clean spark spreads since the beginning of the year and then, poor generation activities in Europe are operating in a very tough environment. For the upcoming months, we expect this deterioration of markets and operating conditions to continue with strong pressure on clean spark spreads and then, lower load factors for CCGT plans, the outages of Doel 3 and Tihange 2 until mid-January and the impact of the end of free CO2 allocations in January 1.</p>
          <p>The performance of Global Gas &amp; LNG business line has been strong over the period, in line with our expectations or even a little bit better. With 50 cargoes of LNG sold, it is worth nothing that sales to Asia almost doubled to reach 31 cargoes and for the full year 2012, with a slight decrease of production level our E&amp;P production will reach around 55 million of barrel oil equivalent. The Infrastructure business line benefited from normalized weather conditions and the contribution from the German storage assets acquired late August 2011. On the other hand, performance has been negatively impacted by lower sales of storage capacity in France. EBITDA of the Infrastructure business line was stable compared to the same period in 2011.</p>
          <p>In other services now, in a tough market environment, this business line demonstrated its resistance with a slight contraction of prices, but a significant official program to provide efficiency gains to offset difficult economic conditions. SUEZ Environment was affected by a decrease in volumes of waste as Jean Louis said and Jean-Marc Boursier explained a few days ago, so, the decrease in volume waste treated in Europe compared to last year. EBITDA decreased organically by 3%, but with an improvement compared to end of June, thanks to the enhanced efficiency plant and the satisfactory progress of the Melbourne project.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to the cash flow generation and to the balance sheet. At the end of the September, the cash flow generation is sustained and stable compared to last year. The colder climate in 2012 than in 2011 leads to a higher working capital requirement and it is the reason why the free cash flow doesn't follow exactly the same pace as EBITDA. &#x20AC;5 billion of growth CapEx were invested over the period, slightly less than last year. I'll remind you that we already indicated that we intent to limit a little bit of CapEx over the years to come.</p>
          <p>Net debt amounted to &#x20AC;48.9 billion (sic) [&#x20AC;45.9 billion] (23:49), reflecting mainly the [ph] raw (23:52) impact of the full integration of IP of &#x2013; impact of &#x20AC;8.8 billion. I remind you that this transaction is partly financed by first &#x20AC;3 billion of additional disposals and secondly, the temporary script dividend option this year. This option was chosen at 77% in May and again, at 78% in October by our shareholders. These high rate demonstrates the shareholder's confidence in the group's long-term business strategy. And this operation resulted in a capital increase of &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of ratio and as expected after having just closed the full integration of IPR, net debt represents 2.67 times the EBITDA and by year-end, thanks to our strong cash flow generation and thanks to the disposal program, we expect to reach a net debt level around 2.5 times the 2012 EBITDA. Looking forward, we remain confident to finalize the remaining part of the portfolio optimization program by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, you can see that we successfully pursued our strategy of financing optimization. And since August, the Group has continued its dynamic debt management. You remember that we issued thrice over the period, first in September GDF SUEZ launched a CHF450 million issue in two tranches with maturities of 8 and 12 years. This financing has been swapped into euro floating rate at an average float level of 1.16%. And then in October, we accessed the U.S. bond market for the first time in our history by launching a dual tranche bond issue with maturities of 5 and 10 years for the a total of US$1.5 billion with an average interest rate of 1.39% after being swapped into euros.</p>
          <p>And finally, the debt optimization following the full acquisition of IP has been down rapidly since in less than four months, we reduced to &#x20AC;0.4 billion, the &#x20AC;6 billion bridge loan of International Power full acquisition. And at the same time, we managed the convertible bond issues and the high yield issues of IP.</p>
          <p>So globally speaking, as a consequence of our active debt management, we have reached and you can see that on the slide, we have reached a historic low point in terms of cost of gross debt. And this, it is now 4.32%, that is to say 60 basis points less than at the end of 2008. And we believe that the GDF SUEZ cost of debt and especially with an average net debt maturity of 9.5 years is a good performance in the sector.</p>
          <p>So now I hand over to G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet who will concludes this presentation before the Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Isabelle. To conclude, I'd like to highlight our key messages today.</p>
          <p>First message, our results are strong and we concern our full year targets that more importantly, the successful implementation of our strategy that makes GDF SUEZ completely different from the European utilities. As already mentioned, the market conditions in Europe are difficult. We do not see any improvements for this area coming from the markets in the near future. We are therefore anticipating a difficult 2013. In that context, we rely on our unique business model that allows us to capture long-term growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, as already mentioned, we will intensify our performance plan. We have built an ambitious comprehensive and determined action plan. Its main levers are cost cutting with special focus on G&amp;A, operational performance and also, optimization of procurement, action and working capital requirement on capital expenditure with the objective of reducing the debt. By the way, I confirm the level of the debt at the end of Q3 being &#x20AC;45.9 billon as indicated in the recommendation.</p>
          <p>We will discuss this during our next Investor Day which we will hold on December 6, in Paris and in addition to our performance plan, we will focus during this Investor Day on GDF SUEZ's unique profile, our differentiating positions and the financial profile, and also we will give 2013 financial indications.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll hand over to you and we are ready with Isabelle and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We come now to our first question for today is from Benjamin Leyre from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much and good morning. I have two questions please. The first one is for the sake of clarity. Can you please confirm that your 2012 EBITDA guidance totally excludes the recovery of Q4, 2011 losses as a loss that you expect in Q4 2012 and related to that, what is the earliest you think that this state council could decide to judge that the October tariff decision for October 2012 was not begun?</p>
          <p>And the second question, is can you develop on your potential interest in some of the <mark type="ph" /> household (31:39) of the LNG assets that Repsol is putting for sale at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I confirm that this &#x20AC;17 billion of indicative EBITDA excludes the &#x20AC;212 million related to the complementary billing we did over the third quarter and related to the 2011 shuffle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the LNG assets of Repsol, I would simply indicate that we've been presented this potential acquisition, but we have taken no decision at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Martin Young from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning to everybody. I will limit it to two questions as well. The first one &#x2013; I know, you're not going to give us guidance for 2013. But I guess two very important issues. One, how realistic is that your restart time of mid January for the two Belgium nuclear plants and secondly, in relation to 2013, are you optimistic that the French government will play ball on the tariffs the next year?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question relates to SUEZ Environment, well cited the media that there were talks between SUEZ Environment and Veolia. It seems to me that one of the structures proposed could have led to a dilution of your stake in SUEZ Environment. I just wondered what the group's intentions are towards that stake; does it have a long-term future within the GDF SUEZ group? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the restart of the nuclear plants of course, we will not give any indication of the probability. We'll simply mention that we are concentrating all our efforts from our internal forces, Electrabel, Tractebel Engineering, and also with international experts and advisors be ready to give the file &#x2013; the whole file to the Belgian Nuclear Safety Authority agency, at the end of the November. That I will make no &#x2013; I will give no indication on the probability. All our efforts are concentrated about that.</p>
          <p>On the French tariff, I would simply mention that at this stage, there is no change in the formula and the new law, called the <mark type="ph" /> law of God (35:07) has been voted at the national assembly, but is facing from difficulties at the Senate, has been rejected by the Senate. But this law does not include any change about the formula, first point.</p>
          <p>Second point, as you have noticed, our competitors regrouped in the ANODE Association have sued the decree fixing at 2%. The tariff increase in the October 1 sued under &#x2013; to the State Council Conseil d'Etat and in urgency. So in the coming weeks, there will be on this topic a judgment in urgency by the Conseil d'Etat and we will see what will be this judgment. But of course we are quite in the same case than the last year exactly at the same period.</p>
          <p>About SUEZ Environment, I will simply repeat that SUEZ Environment has issued a press release concerning that SUEZ Environment is not working on the business combination with Veolia Environment. So this is the statement and by the way, you have &#x2013; that is the solid results that in the meantime, SUEZ Environment has published and SUEZ Environment is concentrated on the business value creation. And we consider that this model &#x2013; business model which is being improved by the teams of SUEZ Environment is perfectly ready in this economic environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what about your attitude towards SUEZ Environment within the group given that the priority needs to be managing across the globe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing has changed in the attitude of GDF SUEZ vis-&#xE0;-vis SUEZ Environment. We are supporting its strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Credit Suisse from Michel Debs. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on slide seven, where you have shown us the EBITDA bridge between the nine months 2011 and nine months 2012 and where you have explained to us that if you exclude the impact from tariffs and the weather, EBITDA was &#x20AC;12,454 million nine months, 2011 and &#x20AC;12,573 million nine months, 2012. Can you give us the same kind of bridge on the revenue line, so that we can get a sense of the normalized margin that you have done during the first nine months of 2011 and 2012?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on the slide that where you talked about your financing costs slide 10. You have successfully reduced the average gross cost of your debt to 4.3%. How much more do you think you can do and as a result, how much do you think you can reduce your interest charge next year? Can you expect an earnings, uplift from a reduction in the cost of your debt? Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Isabelle, could you answer the two questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one, it is not extremely relevant to look at an average it is the reason why the elements that we gave in terms of in terms of tariffs and weather reconciliation are on EBITDA. Just to remind that the climate effect accounts for &#x20AC;1 billion in the turnover of 2011. On the second point, you're right. We expect to see our cost of debts to continue to decrease a little bit. I'm not in a situation to give you now figures for next year that we expect to decrease.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Martin Brough from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to ask you a question about the Barcelona contract, because obviously it's being done through the Energy Services division. But Barcelona is an area where SUEZ Environment through Agbar is obviously particularly strong and I wondered whether there was any co-operational partnership between the two divisions there? And whether the Barcelona contract in general could be a model for future expansion either between the two divisions or standalone for Energy Services in Asia where there is obviously a lot of pretty fast growing cities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In that kind of contract concerning, the concept of sort of Cities of Tomorrow, we need among our subsidiaries a leader. In the case of Barcelona, the leader was the Energy Services branch. But it's true that in Barcelona, all our subsidiaries are very much present and Barcelona is &#x2013; and Catalonia, is a place with a very strong presence of GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>The agreement we signed with the Mayor of Barcelona was made in the presence of all the people of Agbar and <mark type="ph" /> La Casa (41:38), because it is a transversal action, transversal contract with the cooperation of all the branches, the Energy Service branch being the leader, but also the SUEZ Environment and of course Aguas De Barcelona, but also the Energy Europe branch.</p>
          <p>And we have same contract in some cities, like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:12) for example. We have put in place, for the use of the buyers, a city dashboard with the concentration of all the information, instant information, concerning the &#x2013; all the utilities and public services in the city. This concern, for example, water and with remote meters put in place by Agbar, the buyer has the instant consumption of water, instant flow for the waste water, it has also all the necessary information on electricity, gas, heating network, cooling network, that we have put in place in some parts of Barcelona.</p>
          <p>So it has a complete dashboard, which is a new product, and we also have implemented some models to prepare the future and also to program the future investments of the cities in their respective public services. So it's a new product, transversal new product, and we are pleased to have been selected by the City of Barcelona and the Mayor of Barcelona as a privileged partner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Julie Arav from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three questions if I may, the first one relates to the nuclear shutdowns in Belgium. What impact on earnings should we expect from Tihange 2 and Doel 3 shutdowns until year end? Can you confirm that it's roughly &#x20AC;25 million per month and per unit?</p>
          <p>My second question is, can we have an update on the long-term gas contracts negotiation with suppliers? Unless I'm wrong, you mentioned in the past that you will be able to further renegotiate 55% of your portfolio this year. Can we have a sense of where the negotiations are up to date? And my last question is on your nuclear strategy and mainly in the U.K., can we have an update on this also? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first point, on the nuclear shutdown, the order of magnitude is the right one, around &#x20AC;23 million per month per unit in EBITDA, and around &#x20AC;15 million at the level of the net current results, per unit and per month. I repeat that, in spite of this &#x2013; those shutdowns in 2012, we have confirmed our guidance. For the long term contracts, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Yes, on the 55% which were due to be possible to be renegotiated, all negotiations have started. In terms of amount of suppliers, half of them &#x2013; more than half of them have been concluded. One is &#x2013; with one supplier, we are in sort of pre-arbitrage, but it's for a small amount of volume, and for the one main suppliers, we expect to have successful, hopefully, conclusion before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So, out best bet today is that, first of all, we will have completed almost all negotiations, certainly but one and secondly, that we may be able to reach our objectives in terms of re-negotiations that we were &#x2013; alluded to at the annual accounts. So, for the time being, it's a positive situation. It is still to be confirmed by the end of this year, but we're reasonably optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, and the third question, about the update on our U.K. Nuclear Policy. In fact, nothing has changed. As you know, we want to keep for GDF SUEZ the nuclear option open, valid. And therefore, we are looking for the potential projects. That's the case in the U.K. So far, we are looking for the necessary clarifications from the U.K. government in the regulatory framework which will be applied to nuclear power generation. This is not the case today. And I'll remind you that the consortium we have formed, NuGen with Iberdrola, has announced that it will take a decision to build or not in 2015. So we are permanently studying the case and reviewing the assistant, but we will take the decision in 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have another question here from Vincent De Blic from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you very much. Three questions, the first one was just a clarification on the 2012 guidance at the EBITDA level. I think you said that this &#x20AC;17 billion doesn't include the &#x20AC;212 million recovery from Q4 2011 for French gas tariff. Can you clarify whether it includes or not the shortfall in H2 2012, which I estimate just under &#x20AC;200 million, so more or less the same amount? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>The second point is on your cost of debt, the graph on cost of <mark type="ph" /> good, (49:11) it is very useful. Can you get us a feel of the evolution of the cost of net debt and whether you anticipate it to decrease? What's your strategy in terms of cash balances? And the third point is just on the French gas storage. You mentioned lower sales of capacity this year. Could you please elaborate a little bit whether it is something which is a one-off, or whether it reflects some more difficult structural environment conditions? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Isabelle, could you answer the first two questions, first on the EBITDA and the inclusion in the 2012 guidance for the EBITDA of the shortfall in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we go back to the slide seven, with this breach with gas tariff shortfall and weather effects. When we confirm the &#x20AC;17 billion for the end of the year, it is the equivalent of dark gray figure; that is to say, without any impact of weather or climate or tariff effect. That is to say, &#x20AC;17 billion, considering that we would be at average weather conditions and without any gap with the tariffs given by the tariff formula.</p>
          <p>On the second point, the main effect, of course, is the decrease of the rate we pay on gross debt, and I mentioned the evolution of this rate. It is extremely positive for the company. And as I mentioned, it will continue next year. It's clear that we see also a slight decrease on the level of remuneration of our cash, but difference with what we had over H1 is not significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you plan to <mark type="inaudible" /> (51:37).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The French gas storage activity, I confirm that the volumes of the gas storage marketed, sold in 2012, are decreasing for the second year, consecutive year. And we anticipate no improvement for 2013, even rather a further deterioration in the volumes sold in the French storage gas market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a very small clarification on the second point, do you intend in the future to hold maybe a bit less cash on your bank accounts, given it's a very low remunerations, or no particular change going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we decreased, as you can see. We decreased the level of cash in the company in the &#x2013; during the last months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And a follow up question comes now again from Benjamin Leyre from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two quick questions, please. First one is, can you elaborate on the amount of the CapEx that is totally committed already for 2013 and 2014 if this is available? And the second point, can you update us on your discussions with Belgian authorities on the possibility of a capacity mechanism in Belgium, and the kind of shape that it could take, and when this could be implemented? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois answer perhaps to the second question. On the first question, we will not give this breakup. But I can confirm to you that we have of course enough flexibility to adopt the guidelines we have given to the market. This year, we will make between &#x20AC;10 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion of CapEx. And for the coming years, and the next year, we have given guidance between &#x20AC;9 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion. And our intention is to be close to the lower end of the range, and we have, of course, enough flexibility to do that, and we'll do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the second issue regarding the capacity mechanism for Belgium, to be frank, there is not that much discussions on this issue in Belgium today and &#x2013; between us and the authorities. The only thing that we can say is that the authorities have mentioned that they will maybe mention that &#x2013; they will maybe consider helping to build new CCGTs in Belgium and to certain ways, subsidize new CCGTs, if they were coming, to allow them to be built.</p>
          <p>But no precise framework has been put on the table. And, in addition, I'd only say that if there was a scheme for one CCGTs or for CCGTs, then it had to encompass all CCGTs, which are present today in Belgium, not only for newcomers. That's the point of the discussions, but again, no precise framework and no real discussions so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And another question comes from Martin Young from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, once again. I've got two quick follow-up questions. The first relates to your target to get into the vicinity of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by the end of the year. If we're working with an EBITDA figure of say &#x20AC;17 billion, that's suggesting a net debt of $42.5 billion. I just wonder if you could give any indication of how you will endeavor to get that split say between what you think business can generate as free cash flow in the final quarter and how much will have to come from disposals. And then secondly, I just wondered this data you've prepared to recommit to our medium term dividend promise, which of course is the half dividend year-on-year at or above the level of the previous year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the first question Isabelle about the net debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I confirm your computation that is to say that we expect &#x20AC;17 billion, which is again an equivalent of the dark blue figure, that green figure we've for Q3 that is to say without any effect of tariffs and the weather and if we take that and if we take the ratio of 2.5 times, we reach a net debt level of &#x20AC;42.5 billion. We will reach this amount through two things. First of all, we expect free cash flow generation done, which will be will be done any time over the last quarter and secondly, as I mentioned, we expect disposals by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any sort of rough split between the two <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:49) or are we more biased towards disposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you repeat please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we're looking at what is essentially a full &#x2013; almost a full &#x20AC;1 billion debt reduction from nine-months to the full year, are we thinking that it should be half of it coming from cash flow, half of it coming from disposals or maybe a little bit aggressive on the disposal side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably not aggressive on the disposal side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question is about dividend. I will simply repeat that we have not changed our dividend policy. It is by the way is supported by the strong generation of free cash flow which have been confirmed in our Q3. After nine-months of this year, the group is generating very, very strong free cash flow. We had several times stated that in case of a tension that is not the case, we would privilege the dividend under CapEx and by the way, we are reducing the level of the CapEx for the coming years, starting in 2013 and therefore, this would facilitate the &#x2013; easily facilitate the financing of the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear, thank you.</p>
