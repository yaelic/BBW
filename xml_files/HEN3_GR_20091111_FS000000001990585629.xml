          <p>Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter conference call. First, I like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the third quarter in 2009. And then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the third quarter financials in greater detail. After that I'll comment on the outlook for 2009 and finally we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation can be accessed via website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation and discussion are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now let me get started. I'll start as said previously with the market environment and the highlights of the third quarter. The recession seems to have reached a certain bottoming out, but recovery as the way we see it, is expected to be slow. So we expect a slow recovery process over the next couple of years. Industrial production in certain sectors are starting to rise again. Sectors like Electronics, which could be driven by the Christmas demand, but also Packaging sector which has only been moderately impacted and we're seeing that the crisis in the Construction sector has overcome its peak.</p>
          <p>The private consumption continues to be a stabilizing factor throughout the entire economy. But we are starting to see increases in raw material pricing again. Crude oil price development in the second quarter was around $59 and in the third quarter at 68. So we're seeing an increase in raw materials. And we continue to see that the inflation rates remained low in most countries, around the 2% mark.</p>
          <p>On the overall highlights and challenges for the third quarter. The volume decrease in our Adhesives division continues to be severe, but we have seen a positive development over the last three quarters. The volume decrease in the first quarter was minus 23%, in the second quarter minus 21% and in the third quarter minus 14%. So while we're seeing an improvement in the overall volume development, I will still like to remind you that minus 14% volume decline is a significant volume decline.</p>
          <p>The mature markets continue to be affected mature, by that I specifically mean Western Europe and North America. On the positive side we continue to see a very strong development of our Laundry &amp; Home Care division and also our Personal Care division. We have announced and implemented new organizational structures in our Adhesive Technologies division. And we've made substantial progress on our strategic priorities, which were defined exactly a year ago. But it's also very positive to see, it's an all-time low in our net working capital, and Lothar will speak more about that in his part of the presentation. So overall we have seen sequentially over second quarter substantial amount improvements in almost all areas.</p>
          <p>Let me start with Laundry &amp; Home Care. We've seen a good organic growth maintained, which is now drilling at approximately 3% for the entire year, but strong and consistent development of our top line in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division. The emerging markets continue to be the growth driver for Laundry &amp; Home Care division with double-digit growth rates. EBIT and the EBIT margin on very high levels despite increasing marketing spends. And on the innovation side Purex 3 in 1, which was announced and brought to market in the middle of the second quarter, continues to do very, very well in our North American marketplace. So overall for our Laundry &amp; Home Care division, we see a strong profitable growth trend that we've seen the entire year.</p>
          <p>On to Personal Care. Personal Care operates in a declining market. And despite declining markets we have seen a consistent strong growth throughout the entire year and also in the third quarter. The emerging markets as with our Home Care continues to be the growth driver also with double-digit growth rates and we've been able to further improve the EBIT margin on a very high level.</p>
          <p>Early on the year, we introduced our Syoss product line in Europe and that has been further expanded in the third quarter with our styling line and right now Syoss is the most successful product introduction that we've had in the past 10 years in our Cosmetics division. So, what we are seeing, we're seeing a positive long-term trend continuing.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Adhesive Technologies. We're seeing a further sequential improvement in organic sales and in EBIT. Lothar as I said will go in to the financial numbers, I gave a very clear indication on the volume where you can see it very clearly. We are seeing slight positive trends in all regions versus the second quarter, meaning two things, certain regions are less negative than before, and other regions are moving in again to positive growth.</p>
          <p>We are starting to see the bottoming-out of the Electronics and the Building Adhesives since Q2, but overall it will be a significant decline year-over-year. We have been able to maintain strong market positions across all businesses, meaning that we have been able in a year that has been quite challenging and still it is to maintain or grow market share positions.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, we've been able to cost reductions to offset the decline in the sales volume and as you'll see in our Adhesives business, the predominant driver for the improvement in our bottom line numbers are through very strict cost controls.</p>
          <p>So the specific countermeasures that we initiated more than year ago and also further &#x2013; and where we further announced more in the second quarter are starting to deliver results; which brings me to the key financials.</p>
          <p>Sales for the third quarter coming to 3.485 billion, which is a decline of 7.3 or in organic terms 2.5. And adjusted EBIT at 385 versus 391 compared to a year ago, so almost like-for-like EBIT. And adjusted EBIT margin, now at 11 points up 60 basis points, compared to a strong third quarter in 2008. And our adjusted earnings per share down seven points to 0.55 per share. Overall, we have improved our adjusted EBIT margin year-on-year.</p>
          <p>With this, I like now to hand over to Lothar, who will take you through the financials in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As usual I will start with &#x2013; look at our net sales, growth evolution over the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of last year. We have total growth for Laundry division of minus 2.9%, Personal Care minus 0.9%, and the Adhesive Technologies minus 12.4, resulting in the total company in minus 7.3.</p>
          <p>There is pretty strong impact from currencies for the total company, it is more than 3%; 2.4% resulting in FX adjusted growth for total company is 3.9%.</p>
          <p>Now in all divisions, we have seen similar strong impact from currencies and the interesting part of it is that it's not the U.S. dollar, which is actually stronger in Q3 this year over Q3 last year, it's in European currencies. So therefore, we have a strong negative impact from the Eastern European currencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of organic growth, we have 2.4 for Laundry, 3.7 for Personal Care, minus 7.6 for Adhesive Technologies resulting in minus 2.5 for the total company.</p>
          <p>Let's first take a look at Laundry &amp; Home Care. The price volume split its price 3%, volume minus 0.6%. And you've seen in previous quarters, that we've &#x2013; over the quarter that had a strong impact from pricing and we have communicated consistently that we're balancing the impact of pricing and volume at least over longer period of time.</p>
          <p>We've had strong, very strong pricing in the first quarter and stronger volume decrease in the first quarter, then a more balanced growth in the second quarter with still 5% price increase and 1.2% volume, so we're now down to three and volume 0.6 negative resulting in total organic sales growth of 2.4.</p>
          <p>Now the good news is we have maintained our pricing particularly in the Laundry &amp; Home Care, division. We've seen a strong performance in Eastern Europe and Middle East and North Africa and we have seen pretty strong contribution from both segments from Laundry and from Home Care contributing to very substantial organic growth of 2.4%, which is over the market for that period of time.</p>
          <p>Next look at Personal Care, where we had a balanced growth of 0.9% from price and 2.8% from volume. This is very similar to previous quarters where we had 1.1 and 2.4 respectively. And total organic growth again is very similar to what we have achieved in the previous two quarters. So very steady development and then resulting in one through nine of 3.6% organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Here again we have balanced impact from price and from volume and we have a strong performance in the emerging markets and perhaps surprisingly in Germany where we've been able to successfully introduce or continue to introduce our innovations.</p>
          <p>The other important element is that we've been able to increase our volume and therefore our organic sales growth in the hair retail sector in spite of the weakness in the hairdresser sector. So we have over compensated the weakness in the hairdresser sector by an even stronger performance in our hair retail division. And that is due to very successful innovations and product launches. And we have communicated that we have innovation rate of close to 40% in our Personal Care division and we've been able to maintain this very strong launching of new products, thereby not only increasing our sales volume, but also as you will see in a moment our margin.</p>
          <p>Quick look at our Adhesives division which has maintained strong impact from pricing, 6% and less negative volume decrease minus 13.6. And as Kasper has mentioned already, that's a strong improvement over the previous quarters where we were negative with more than 20% in terms of volume and we've maintained the strong pricing similar to what we've had in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to be affected by the automotive market and the metal market although we've been able to realize an improvement of 780 basis points in terms of organic growth over Q2. That our growth rates have also benefited from some market recovery particularly in the Electronics sector and the Building sector and in some other smaller sectors.</p>
          <p>Now, recovery doesn't mean that it's been positive, it means it's been less negative than in the previous quarters. Nevertheless that in total resulted in pretty strong performance under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Total Henkel pricing impact 4%, volume minus 6.5%. This is obviously due to the impact from the Adhesives division and it shows that we've been able to maintain our pricing similar to the previous quarters where we had pricing impact of slightly above 4% and have improved our volume considerably.</p>
          <p>Quick look at the regions. We have provided the red figures for total growth and the blue figures showing organic sales growth per region, initially the region as geographic, Europe, Africa, Middle East with 7% &#x2013; minus 7% total growth and minus 0.9 organic growth. Now that is obviously very much supported by our strong performance, still strong performance in Eastern Europe and that's why our organic sales growth in North America was minus 7.8% is much lower than in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of Western Europe, that's similar to what we have experienced in North America. Latin America is still positive, that's similar to what we have experienced in the previous quarters. Latin America has been holding up quite positively. All other regions have been improving over the previous quarters, in particular over Q2 2009 and if we take a look at the emerging regions, there again we've seen a recovery compared to the previous quarters plus 180 basis points versus Q2, our Home and Personal Care division continue to experience double digit sales growth if we back out the impact of our exit in the detergent business in China. Adhesive is still declining compared to last year, but still &#x2013; but improving versus Q2.</p>
          <p>If we look at Asia, Asia is basically on prior-year level in Q3, backing out the impact of our exit from the detergent business in China. So that's a very good positive sign in terms of market development and in terms of our achievement in that particular region.</p>
          <p>Taking a look next at adjusted EBIT by business sector, we have for the first time provided adjusted figures per business units not only for the total company and that's in major part due to the fact that it's pretty imbalanced, the adjustments pertain in major parts to Adhesive Technologies, there are basically no adjustments for Personal Care and only small adjustment for Laundry and Home Care. So therefore we're providing this level of detail in order to provide the clarity that is needed in order to understand the operations development in our business divisions.</p>
          <p>First taking a look at Laundry and Home Care, we have increased our adjusted EBIT from 245 million EBIT, that's a change of 21.8% over last year resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 14%. And that's a change in basis points of 290, that's the all-time high margin in this business division, very strong performance which is driven by lower input cost, which is helped by lower input cost, but also by strict cost control. So we're very happy with our performance in the Laundry and Home Care division with a very strong improvement over the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Personal Care EBIT of 99 million, which is a change of 2.1% over the last year, resulting of an improvement of 40 basis points over a strong performance in the same period of last year. 13.0% provides very good results in the market environment given the level of sales growth that we've been able to achieve. That's above the high level of the prior-year quarter. We've continued our profitable growth path now for several consecutive periods.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies. We experienced further improvement of 200 basis points versus Q2. We're still 100 basis points adjusted EBIT below the figures of the same period of last year. So similar to the sales development, we're below last year, but we're above the prior periods during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>This is very much driven by lower input cost and strict cost control, very much helped by the commodity price decreases, which we have communicated would be taking effect basically in Q2 and Q3, would still be present in Q4, and therefore we do expect that we will see some positive evolution during Q4.</p>
          <p>Key financials Q1 through Q3, that's important for us to look at in terms of our Adhesive Technology division because of the strong downturn that we have experienced in the first quarter. We've recovered adjusted EBIT from 54 in Q1 to 150 in Q3. That's then changing the adjusted EBIT margin from 3.1 to 9.2%. The improvements where quarter-on-quarter and we have successfully adjusted our cost structure through the lower business volume.</p>
          <p>Income statement adjusted sales to gross profit, obviously exceeding the sales decrease minus 7.3% as reported. At the same time we've been able to increase our gross margin comparing to last year by 260 basis points, the adjustments pertained to the restructuring expenses, which we have taken last year and this year.</p>
          <p>Major impact, it's positive impact from maintaining our strong pricing particularly in Home Care and in the Adhesives division and lower direct material costs. Now, partly it has been offset by lower capacity utilization particularly in the Adhesives division, but again we've been able to also adapt our manufacturing footprint thereby improving our operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Income statement adjusted sales to adjusted EBIT; we have adjusted again for the figures that I'll show in a moment. Of the P&amp;L lines of interest we take a look at the marketing, selling and distribution expenses which have decreased by 4% over last year.</p>
          <p>We have increased in the face of the weak markets, our marketing investments in our consumer businesses as a percentage of sales. And we've been able to reduce our distribution costs. So that has helped us a great deal to adapt our structure to the lower sales volume.</p>
          <p>These are the adjustments that we have taken to arrive at adjusted EBIT. EBIT as reported has increased over the same period of last year by 50%, but that &#x2013; this started because of the high amount of restructuring charges that we have taken last year, as you can see the one-time charges were 19 million and the restructuring charges is 181. So that resulted in adjusted EBIT last year of 391, similar exercise one-time charge is 24 and restructuring charges that we have taken in the third quarter 71 resulting in adjusted EBIT of 385. That is only a decrease of 1.5% over the same period of last year. That's an enormous result of the cost measures that we have undertaken.</p>
          <p>Quick look at the one-time charges in the third quarter. It's valuation loss on assets held for sale. We do expect to sell assets in North America and we have revalued them in order to incur the loss that we would have to expect on disposition of this assets. It's actually not an asset that has anything to do with the National Starch acquisition. In the National Starch businesses we've as usual taken the impairment tests and we've not recognized any impairment. So we're still on track in terms of realizing our targets.</p>
          <p>Restructuring charges. In the Adhesive Technologies division we have adapted our organization structure. We've taken 33 million restructuring charges in the third quarter. We have restructuring charges of 27 for the National Starch integration, that's in line with the communication that we have undertaken for National Starch integration cost. And we've had a level of normal restructuring in the Adhesives division of 11 or adding up to 71 million for Q3.</p>
          <p>Quick look at the income statement. Adjusted EBIT through net earnings, nothing special other than higher tax-rate than the same period of last year 28.1%. It's very much in line with our guidance that we have given for this year, deviation or the higher tax-rate is entirely due to a write-down in the deferred tax asset that we have taken in the third quarter and therefore we have resulted in a tax-rate of 28.1% for this quarter.</p>
          <p>Development of net working capital, Kasper has alluded to that already. We've undertaken yet another round of efforts in order to improve our cash flow situation and one of the major levers that we have available is obviously reducing our net working capital, but not only as a result of lower sales volume but also as a result of managing down the structural level of net working capital that we need in order to run our businesses. And as you can see in the third quarter we've reduced, compared to the same period of last year, to 10.3%. That's an increase &#x2013; a success, which is exceeding our own expectations. It's actually exceeding our own targets and we believe that we are on a very successful, very good track in order to manage our inventories and our receivables and payables in a way which permit us to release as much capital as is possible under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities, starting from EBIT, we have lower income taxes paid compared to the same period of last year and we have a release of cash through the change in net working capital, very much resulting from what I've shown on the previous chart. The lowering of our ratio net working capital to where we were able to reduce our tax prepayments. So, lower cash-out for this item.</p>
          <p>The systematic net working capital reduction program has been delivering results. We have released more than 170 or 160 million of cash in Q3 of 2009 as a result of our efforts in managing our cash net working capital.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow. First of all, cash flow from operating activities has improved over the same period of last year by more than &#x2013; almost 200 million. There is a lower expense for purchase of property, plant, and equipment. And again we have communicated that we will manage our CapEx very carefully and the results are visible. So therefore we have had a lower level of CapEx in Q3.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, as reported there again, more than 200 million over the same period of last year.  And if we adjust the free cash flow for the cash-out due for the restructuring, the Global Excellence, and the National Starch programs, we have an improvement from 500 million same period of last year to 700 million this year.</p>
          <p>That's a very strong adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter of this year. It's stronger than the second quarter where we had 453. That obviously &#x2013; that strong performance has helped us to achieve our targets earlier than what we had expected.</p>
          <p>Taking a quick look at our net debt development in Q3 compared to the same period of last year where we were at the level of 5.4 billion, almost 5.4 billion net debt, now we've been able to reduce that level to 3.153. If you look at composition of our net debt, that is a major achievement that we've been able to reduce our net debt in the course of the third quarter through the strong generation of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Very quickly update you on some of the guidance that we have provided during the course of our previous communication. We've provided guidance on EBIT corporate which we reduced now to 80 for the full-year. We provided guidance on the financial results, which again were reduced to 210 million for the full-year. We've provided guidance on what we expect to spend for the National Starch integration during the course of this year. There again we'll reduce it to 60 million for the full-year 2009. We've provided guidance on normal restructuring with 40 million, that remains unchanged. We have provided some guidance on the tax-rate between 28 and 30%, we're right on track, so that won't change. Our guidance on minorities will be 25 rather than 20. CapEx will be slightly higher than what we had initially targeted. Our initial target was 350, it will be more like 360 to 380.</p>
          <p>That leads me to provide you with an update on our restructuring measures. There again the guidance that we've given, we haven't increased our guidance on the savings that we expect from the Global Excellence exercise that we have gone through. Now we have experienced or we have realized already 95 million in the course of this year with Q3 with 35 million, we basically remain with our guidance for the full-year at 125, but that's obviously &#x2013; there is a possibility for an improvement.</p>
          <p>Second guidance and second update is on the timeline for the National Starch savings. We have increased our expectation value for this year to 150. As you can see we have realized already 105 with 30, 35 and 40 there again, we remain with our guidance but there is some upside potential for that as well.</p>
          <p>Finally, quick look at what we have undertaken in terms of further adapting our structure in the business design in our Adhesive Technology division; we have communicated or I have communicated that we have taken a charge of 33 million in Q3. The goal that we have pursued with the measures that are underlying this charge is to restructure our customer focused organization to become faster, more customers oriented. The measures that we have employed were transferring responsibility for production and supply chain further down to the strategic business units, so called decentralizing our structure thereby reducing our complexity and our cost and enhancing customer focus.</p>
          <p>The cost that we have undertaken for this program is 33 in Q3 and we expect another 22 for Q4, 2009. We will be expecting savings of about one third of this total restructuring volume of 55 over the next 24 months. That will greatly help us in improving again our cost situation and leading us further to realize our targets.</p>
          <p>With that I hand over to Kasper.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. Let me go back to approximately a year ago where most of us met in London. In London, we for the first time spoke about our long-term strategic direction, our targets for 12 and our strategic priorities. And at the offset, let me confirm that we still remain committed to our targets for 2012 and what I will do today is I will give you an overview of where we are and the progress we have made and our three strategic priorities, one, achieve a full business potential; two, focus more on our customers and thirdly, strengthen our global team.</p>
          <p>When we met in London a year ago, the triangle looked very similar, I spoke about portfolio of rents, innovation, operational excellence, relationship management and sustainability, people and diversity, and performance orientation. And we're managing the company very strictly around these three priorities and our mission progress against each of the sub developments under the different strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>Now let me go more into detail. On achieving our full business potential as it relates to our portfolio, today we are achieving all-time high market share positions in Europe for Laundry &amp; Home Care business. And as Lothar alluded to, we continue to enjoy strong double-digit growth in Eastern Europe, but also in Middle East/Africa where particularly the later has substantially improved its financial performance over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>In our Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries division, we also are enjoying all-time high market shares in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe and we have a very strong and successful development while retail business in Germany in a very difficult market.</p>
          <p>And lastly we have moved swiftly ahead with integration of National Starch and we are ahead of plan and are committed to execute the integration quicker than originally communicated. That's why we're also seeing the uptick in savings that also showed on previous charts. And we've divested some of our U.S. consumer brands previous this year. So in our portfolio we continue to view &#x2013; to focus on brands, on market share positions and of course regions.</p>
          <p>Moving to our brands. Our top 10 brands deliver more than 40% of our sales. We're continuing to strengthen these brands and over proportionately invest not only in R&amp;D, but also sales and marketing resources into these brands. We committed to reduce complexity around our portfolio. We will continue to divest potential elements of our portfolio that we don't view as core moving forward. And we are seeing our top brands continue to increase in profitability and are the core profitability drivers for our company, also through times of recession.</p>
          <p>Our innovation rate continues to be high at 30%. In our Cosmetics division right now we're enjoying an innovation rate of 40% plus and all of the new innovations we are bringing to market are gross margin accretive. That is one of the criteria we measure very strictly against every time we bring a new product into market. It has to be gross margin accretive for the product it replaces.</p>
          <p>Moving on to purchasing. In 2005 we started out a reorganization or purchasing organization and that has been consistently quarter-by-quarter improved. We are now in the stage where we're looking upon global sourcing, strategic suppliers, and new business models.</p>
          <p>We, as an example, we've concentrated the majority of our packaging spend were less than 40 core suppliers. This is more than a billion plus spend.</p>
          <p>We have agreement on cost reduction targets with more than 60 of our largest suppliers. In our production and supply chain we are streamlining our sites to drive down the yield complexity reduction. We have initiated more than 60 projects, more than half are completed and we have an overall head count reduction of more than 10%.</p>
          <p>In SG&amp;A we have standardize and automated more and more processes we had for IT services, signed outsourcing agreements with three large global suppliers that are replacing the vast majority of all other IT suppliers and we are extending the use of our offshore shared services centers in Manila and Bratislava not only for finance but also for purchasing and HR. We are ahead of plan on all cost-saving initiatives.</p>
          <p>On focus more on our customer, we start out last year by defining this program, we named 2009 as year of the customer. And for our top 20 customers, we have initiated a Top-2-Top context and they have all been established, meaning that all of us have met on several occasions with our top customers. If I take my personal experience, I'm the sponsor or executive sponsor for Wal-Mart, I met three times with the executive management at Wal-Mart and we've seen a similar development for all of our other top customers. This program has not only given us worthwhile or valuable insight on the strategic direction of our core customers but also made us a more valuable partner because we have a much better strategic understanding of where they're taking the business.</p>
          <p>We see sustainability as being one of the core differentiators for Henkel. And we use our targets for sustainability every time we bring new products to market. And I've set a target that each product that we bring to market has to contribute to at least one of the five focal areas. This has also had a very positive impact in the way we engage with our customers as sustainability is becoming a more and more strategic development for how they want to conduct business moving forward.</p>
          <p>On strength in our global team, we've taken a very, very strong look on talent management. We have identified what we call our top talent pool and we've defined an executive training program at Harvard that was initiated earlier on this year and is being implemented across-the-board.</p>
          <p>I believe we have reached the right balance between internal promotions and external hire. It is our strategy to promote from within but we will not compromise on quality and that means that roughly 80% of the promotions are from within, 20% is from external. And we'll continue to benchmark to ensure that we have the right level of capability in-house and so we don't compromise on quality if we were to go &#x2013; if we were to stay with internal hiring or promotion.</p>
          <p>Last year, we applied very strict performance measures and performance-based payments. We continue to do so. So we are on track, we are not there but we are on track and made substantial progress and create a stronger global team.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the outlook for 2009. For the expectations for the fourth quarter for Home and Personal Care, we see a continuation of the good performance at the slightly lower pace versus 1-9. In Adhesive Technologies we see an improved performance versus 1-9, but at a slower rate than the third quarter. I do want to remind you that last year we initiated some very drastic cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter, they were one-offs. And these cost saving initiatives they were one-off and were very dramatic. We've not done this year because we have not deemed them to be necessary.</p>
          <p>We will announce our outlook for 2010 as always in February, this time February 25. And as we have said on every single con call this year, we will continue to consider all options helping us to mitigate the impact of the current economic crisis. You've seen part of the presentation of Lothar where the changes we make in our Adhesives division, announced in May and executed in the second, third, and now also in the fourth quarter, that we will continue to take actions into account should we deem them to be necessary.</p>
          <p>In closing I'd like to say that we believe we closed with a very strong performance in the third quarter. Strong performance from all business groups, continued strong performance from our fast moving Consumer Goods business, and a good comeback from our Adhesives division. However we believe we still have a way to go and we're also confident as I said earlier on that the tasks we've set ourself for 2012 are reachable, but they're also a stretch.</p>
          <p>With this, I like to end this part of the con call and start the question and answer session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Rorsted. Ladies and gentlemen the question and answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question will come from Marco Gulpers from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Marco Gulpers from ING. I've got two questions. The first is on your capacity utilization improvement from Q1, Q2 into Q3, could you share with us where you see capacity utilization heading into, let's say the fourth quarter and moving into next year? We know that your long-term ambition in Adhesives is for 80 to 85%, but could you share with us your view and what further actions you have lined up to improve that? The second question I have is on Home Care in the U.S., could you update us on your progress made with the 3 in 1 Purex launch? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with capacity utilization. First of all, we have improved our capacity utilization particularly in the Adhesives division and that's where I think I'll limit my comments on by 12 percentage points over the course of this year. We're not back to capacity utilization as we would expect as you mentioned 80 to 85%, we're down still at around 60%. So therefore it remains open whether and how next year will evolve. I think that's the more important question because I don't know that we will see big changes in Q4. The real question is whether and what will happen in the course of next year, will we see a stronger recovery which then would bring up our capacity utilization or will we see an extended low level of industrial production particularly in our markets. And therefore we have not undertaken or communicated other measures.</p>
          <p>We have a number of variations and alternatives that we're considering. And there again it depends on whether and what we will see in our markets, which one of those alternatives will eventually bring to bear. For the time being, we've not taken decisions because we need to see how markets are evolving. There's going to be a need to be capable of participating in a stronger recovery because as you've seen, we've adapted our cost structure significantly. And therefore we would be benefiting quite significantly if there were stronger recovery. But obviously nobody knows.</p>
          <p>So therefore the message is that we have improved our capacity utilization. We are not back at a level which we would consider full capacity utilization and therefore we're considering various alternatives that we need to put on hold in order for us to be able to assess what we will see in terms of industrial production next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your question with our product introduction in the U.S., the Purex 3 in 1 that product was introduced into the marketplace in the month of May. We are now almost half year into the sales cycle. And I can confidently report that we've had a &#x2013; not only a very, very good start with initial strong sales in, but the repeat sales continue to be strong. And we are trailing at a market share for that product alone of approximately 1.8 to 2 points of the total market. So a very, very successful introduction to that product. As I said we're approximately six months into the sales cycle of five at this stage.</p>
          <p>So we're starting to see the first rounds of repurchase, which do remain strong. We've also conducted analysis and we are seeing very little cannibalization of our 3 in 1 products from our original Purex product. So, so far that product has been a very strong success. However, I will like to state what I've stated on previous occasion, it is a fundamental change in form factor. And with a new form factor, I think it's important to give the market time to show whether it is accepted in the long run, but so far all lights are on green so to speak.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon. I've got two question please. The first one is regarding pricing for the upcoming quarters. What are your expectations regarding pricing in consumer and regarding pricing in the Adhesives division, given the still very tough environment?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the development of your sales and EBIT in North America. Could you give us a little bit more explanation of what actually happened there? And explain the development that we have seen in Q3. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the pricing. We've been able to maintain our list price throughout the entire year for consumer businesses. And as you can also see we have guided on previous occasions that we believe that raw material will be at low point in the third quarter and rising throughout the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>You can also see that with the increase in the raw material price for oil. So our assumption as of this date that we don't believe that price reductions we'll be taken in our personal and consumer goods at this stage. We are not seeing any other market movements that lead to that indication.</p>
          <p>We are seeing, as we've also indicated on previous occasions, a higher level of promotional spend, but no change in this pricing and with the increase of raw materials, we do not believe that they will come to significant price reductions or price reductions in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the higher level of &#x2013; on promotional spend going to impact your value contribution in a significant way in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not that we expect. We expect that the trend we have seen in the second and third quarter, we expect to continue to see in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to sales and EBIT in North America, one needs to differentiate between the two basic divisions, HPC on one hand and Adhesives on the other hand. We still have a double-digit negative in our Adhesives division in North America. That's one area where we have improved our sales evolution, but it's slightly negative compared to last year. And it's very much affected obviously by the automotive industry in North America, which is down even stronger than our business and also the electronic industry. Now the electronic industry, I mentioned earlier, has been recovering compared to the earlier quarters, but it's still below last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBIT, no I've not mentioned the HPC, which somewhat negative, but only slightly. So therefore we have pretty good development in terms of organic sales growth in our Home and Personal Care division, but strongly negative still in Adhesives.</p>
          <p>With respect to EBIT, it's impacted on one hand by the negative volume in the Adhesive sector, but it's also impacted by the innovation that we've brought to the market in the HPC sector. We haven't invested in 3 in 1, which obviously needs stronger support upon launching. And therefore, we have increased our share of marketing investment in North America thereby reducing for a period of time EBIT contribution from North America also in the HPC sector.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Another question on pricing please, this time in Adhesives where your pricing contribution looks to me to continue to edge up sequentially against tougher comps or I guess price increases last year. I mean it sounds to me like you're actually putting through new price increases or you have put through new price increases in Q2 and Q3. I was just wondering if you could confirm that and say where the price increases are coming from and perhaps talk about some of the reasons why pricing is quite as robust as it is given the economic environment.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on operational excellence or I think you're buying-savings programs. I appreciate you give us less detail on this one relative to National Starch and Global Excellence. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the initiatives or recent initiatives you've taken there. I know you've highlighted some in the presentation but if you could expand on that a bit more and if you could confirm whether you're still looking to deliver 350 million of savings from that particular program by 2012 that'll be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the pricing in Adhesives. We have not implemented price increases in Q2 and Q3. We've maintained our pricing and in fact the variations that you see over the quarters, is more a mix factor. So higher margin products have been experiencing better recovery than the others. So there is no basic &#x2013; basically no price increases which we have undertaken in the markets.</p>
          <p>The quick question is why we have been able to maintain our pricing? Why have we been so robust? I think one important element of it is that while the relationship to our customers is so close that when they are down in terms of sales volume, there is very little that we can do in order to make up for that.</p>
          <p>If you look at the automotive industry or the aircraft industry, some other industries where we have products that are qualified, where if our customers sell, we sell to them. So therefore the pricing stays because the negative volume really does not result in as much pressure on pricing as it does in the HPC sector.</p>
          <p>Our customers either have their sales volume if you look at the automotive industry, for example, and then we sell our products to them, or else they don't, and then we lose the sales volume. So the pricing is under pressure. There is no question about it. We shouldn't be illusionary about our markets.</p>
          <p>There is strong pressure on pricing in HPC. We have communicated that for many months now. And there is also pressure increasing in the Adhesives sector in as much as some of our competitors obviously have experienced stronger pressure on their sales volume. So therefore, we would expect that to intensify certainly for the next several quarters unless we see a stronger recovery in terms of volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the purchasing side, we can confirm the saving target that we initially communicated to the market. And this is a responsibility under Lothar Steinebach. But let me just give a couple of insights to the way we view it.</p>
          <p>I think that the biggest strength we have created in our purchasing organization over the last couple of years is the standardization of system and processes. And the reason why that is so important is it gives us full transparency to where and what we spend. That means also we have a capability to move spend around, which most other companies don't have because they don't have global &#x2013; complete global transparency into their spending.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the outsourcing deals that we have signed recently. But what we've done also initially &#x2013; about approximately two years ago, is implement a supplier relationship management program where we've defined a number of KPIs for our suppliers not only around price but also around innovation.</p>
          <p>And that means that we have made the performance for our suppliers very transparent. And we have on a quarterly basis given feedback to our top suppliers how they performed and unless they perform up to the metrics that we've agreed to, we do remove business. I met up with one of our largest players two weeks ago, which is a category leader in the world, and we moved &#x2013; we will remove all the business from that particular supplier because that supplier had not performed up to the KPIs we've agreed over the last six quarters.</p>
          <p>So through the standardization of process and systems, we now have the capability to very actively &#x2013; very proactively move spend around and I believe that is giving us a significant competitive advantage. That's why we feel comfortable with the target we set ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may add with respect to the service functions we have established a concentrated effort by all the functions under the leadership of one of the heads of the finance division to pursue more aggressively shared service projects resulting in a target of 20% cost reduction over the period that we're looking at through 2012. That will yield a significant contribution in terms of margin supporting the achievement of our targets that customers communicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you just say of that 350 million target, I mean, are you prepared to give us an indication just roughly where you are through the course of that program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're planning on realizing about 100 million per annum. So therefore we realized 100 this year. We expect another 100 next year, another 100 next year.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Celine Pannuti from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First one is input cost gains. I think you did mention that you will have some lower input cost efficient for the full year. Can you quantify what is the impact in Q3? And potentially as well what would be for you the outlook on input cost next year, I presume it's inflation, but if you could give us a number already?</p>
          <p>The second point, coming back on your market share data point in the Home Care &amp; Laundry segment, well it seems that the U.S. you are losing &#x2013; like-for-like is down in the U.S. and yet you've done very well with the 3 in 1. So can you flag what is not doing so well? And equally in Europe there seemed to be a flare up in competition from P&amp;G as you've seen that, and are you comfortably sitting now on your market share? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we start with the input cost, the impact on Q3. We have communicated that we would expect positive impacts for the full year in the low mid single digits. That remains our target for the full year with no outlook for next year yet. Kasper mentioned that we will provide that in February. Obviously we have expectations but it's not ready to be released because we want to see very much how the industrial markets are going to develop and also the year-end weather and what impact might result from the changes in the market which may or may not affect us. So therefore we're not ready to communicate an outlook for next year in that respect.</p>
          <p>To the question on the market share evolution and Laundry in the U.S., it was a little bit difficult to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Yeah, if I understood what you said on the U.S. business, you said that you had a negative growth like-for-like in HPC. Now you've done very well with the 3 in 1. So I presume something has not done so well. I wanted to know what it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was one of our product lines in the U.S. It was insecticide. What you've seen is overall we have grown our market share but it was one product line that has done less well. And in Europe, I think you asked the question about the activity of P&amp;G. We are &#x2013; is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are seeing is we are seeing a highly competitive market environment not only from P&amp;G but from all suppliers in that market. So I can't confirm that anybody is more aggressive than the other. Right now what we are seeing, we are seeing an extremely competitive marketplace in the European and the U.S. marketplace. That has not changed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. It has been the characteristics of the marketplace so far this year.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And now we will take our last question from Harold Thompson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, well done for your contract extension. You will have fun in the upturn.</p>
          <p>On the fixed and variable cost cutting, I mean, there is &#x2013; clearly you've been very aggressive in cutting costs, your margins have held up a lot better, especially in Adhesives despite the very poor revenue environment. If and when the revenue were to accelerate, how much of that variable cost cutting would come back? In other words, you know are there thousands and thousands of people which are kind of on temporary holidays which will come back and therefore the gearing on the upside would not be very good. Could you give a bit a flavor on that? And the second one is on your net debt 3.2 billion at the end of nine months, should that be the right number or maybe a bit better for the full year? If you could give us some guidance on that, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the evolution of our fixed and variable costs when we see a recovery, obviously some will depend on how strong the recovery is going to be. However, if you look at the changes that we have experienced in our work force, I'm sure you've seen that we're down to around 50,000 and that's not by short-term work or anything, that's just reduction in head count. And that's basically the result of the programs that we've undertaken, but also of a very restricted hiring program that we have also established.</p>
          <p>Now this is obviously due to the fact that we have changed our structures. We have not simply made people redundant, we have changed our structure, we have not hired people that we don't need to employ any more. So therefore we have not reduced in a way just the variable part, we've changed our structure. And therefore our expectation is that we will be able to handle a significantly higher volume with the workforce that we have rather lower than higher.</p>
          <p>With respect to the net debt, are we at our targets? The answer is no. We would expect to reduce at least a further 200 million by year-end.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>However, we are well prepared for the future and I am therefore optimistic as we move forward. In addition, I'm also very happy to announce that Lothar Steinebach will stay two more years in his function as CFO.
