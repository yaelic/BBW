          <p>Good morning for those who are in the U.S. Good afternoon for those who are in Europe. We're starting our second quarter results conference call. For those who are following through the Internet, we are starting on page two, highlights for the results. The first one is the results itself. Net income of 2.041 billion with annualized ROE of 27.4; that compares with the first half of the year with a net income of R$4.084 billion and annualized ROE of 27.7. In terms of recurring net income is a little bit higher. We go to R$2.079 billion in recurrent result, with an increase of 5.1% when we compare to the first quarter of 2008 with an annualized ROE of 27.9.</p>
          <p>The second and important highlight is the growth of our credit, the loan portfolio. The growth was 7.5% in the quarter compared to the first quarter, and 41.3 when we compare to June 2007. We continue to concentrate our attention and capital in the sectors where we can get more margin. Vehicles continues to be a very important part of our portfolio. The growth in the quarter, because the market for car finance continues to be heated, the growth it was 10.1% and 61.7 when we compare to June 2007.</p>
          <p>The other sector that was &#x2013; continued to be very important in our strategy is the segment of small and medium-sized companies. This sector, the position in terms of market share of Banco Ita&#xFA; is not the one that we would like to have. So we continue to invest deeply in this segment taking advantage of the better environment that we have in Brazil in terms of growth. So the second quarter in this small and medium-sized company, our growth was 17.9 and in the last 12 months 62.2 (sic) [66.2].</p>
          <p>In terms of mortgage, the growth continues to be important. Even though the segment represents only 2.1% of our total credit portfolio, but the growth was 10.6 in the quarter and 28.6 (sic) [28.5] in the last 12 months. It's a sector that we continue to believe that we'll continue to show large growth in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>The third highlight is our Basel ratio that continues to be very high and good to take advantage of the opportunities that we have in Brazil, especially in terms of credit growth. Out final number for the quarter was 16.4%.</p>
          <p>The fourth highlight is banking charge. Just to remember that in this quarter, since May, so in last two months, we have the new regulation of the Central Bank that puts new controls and rules in terms of banking fees that we can charge. So we are going to give more details in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>The fifth highlight is the income tax. In this quarter we recorded; we have an increase approved by the Congress of Brazil of the Social Contribution rate from 9 to 16. The Financial System is complaining in the Supreme Court about this that we consider to be unconstitutional. So we have tax credits, because of the increase in this rate, and we compensate this quarter. We also will give you more information in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>In slide number 3, we can see the difference between the net income and the recurring net income and the net income that we published. The most important difference were the sale of the shares of BCP from our subsidiary in Portugal to BPI bank that show loss of R$34 million in our stake that we have in this bank.</p>
          <p>We had some gains in sale of the VISA International that we sold shares after the IPO, and we had some gains after the merger between BM&amp;F and Bovespa creating the new company BM&amp;F Bovespa. We received R$42 million in cash because of this transaction. So, our final number recurring 2.079 billion and net income published 2.041 billion.</p>
          <p>On page 4, we see our stockholders' equity that finished with 30.341 billion with growth 3.7 in the quarter and 14.3% when we compare to June last year. Remembering that we didn't issue any shares in this period and we bought back R$1 billion in shares in the first semester of this year.</p>
          <p>The efficiency ratio, 43.9 in the quarter, a little bit above of the 43.3% of the year, but in good line when we compare to other quarters. And our non-performing loans 4.3 is inline in the same level that we had in the first quarter of the year but much lower of the 5.1% that we showed in the first quarter of &#x2013; the first semester of 2007.</p>
          <p>On slide number 5, more detail of our pro forma results. We start with the managerial financial margin in the quarter, 5.867 billion with an increase when we compare with 5.535 billion in the first quarter of this year. So, we have an increase of 6% quarter-over-quarter and 11.4 when we compare to the first semester of 2007. This as we traditionally show is split in two main numbers; financial margin with our customers where we saw an increase of almost 2% quarter-over-quarter, and 16.2 when we compare to the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Financial margin with the market, we spilt in treasury gains and our foreign exchange hedge. In this quarter we were able to show a better result in treasury gains, especially with derivatives in a prefixed position that we have in our securities portfolio. So, the gain in treasury in this quarter 423 million compared to 217 in the first quarter of this year. But when we compare to the first half of the year, we see that in the first semester of 2007 our profits &#x2013; the revenues generated from the treasury gains were 939 million and 640 million this semester. So we have a huge reduction in treasury gains due to the volatility and the market conditions that we had since July of last year. Our hedge gains was 290 million compared to 261 million in the first quarter of the year, in line with the valuation of the real. Banking fees, R$2.494 billion with an increase of 3.7 quarter-over-quarter. We have a more detailed slide coming.</p>
          <p>In terms of results from our insurance and pension plans and capitalization &#x2013; before capitalization company, before retained claims increase of 4.5%, achieving 738 million in the quarter and a growth of 12.1 when we compare to the first semester of last year. So, we finished our managerial financial margin and banking fees with an increase of 4.6% in the quarter and 8.6 when we compare to June 2007. The impact of these numbers. Our results from loan losses that increased 5% in the quarter because of the growth of the credit portfolio itself. And non-interest expenses that increased 6.3 in the quarter and 5.7 semester-over-semester, in line with a little bit higher than inflation showing a good number in terms of control of expenses.</p>
          <p>On page 6, we can see a more detailed &#x2013; more details of our credit portfolio. We see issued R$148 billion with a growth of 7.5% in the second quarter when we compare to the first quarter, and 41.3 when we compare twelve months. This shows that the economy continues to be heated. We are taking advantage especially in the sectors as I mentioned in the beginning of the presentation, the sectors that we have more margins. So, we continue to focus on vehicles, but we can see also growth in terms of credit cards and personal loans. In terms of company loans, our focus continues to be small and medium-sized companies. As I mentioned, we had a very strong growth in the quarter of 17.9. But also, we can see that the big companies, the corporate segment of our clients are more active this quarter. The growth was 5.8 and 36.4% for big companies in the last 12 months. This is mainly because companies are using more the local markets because of the international situation and more difficulty in accessing the capital markets. Our focus in terms of companies continued to be the small and medium-sized where we can use better the capital and have more returns.</p>
          <p>In terms of direct loans, rural growth was 4% in the quarter, and mortgage, as I mentioned, 10.6. Our banks in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay showed a small decrease in the quarter when we see the credit portfolio because of foreign exchange situation in these countries.</p>
          <p>On page 7 we can see that our non-performing loans continued to be stable. We have a little bit better number in terms of individuals, 6.6 when we compare to 7% of non-performing in the first quarter. And a little increase in companies that increased from 1.4% to 1.5% but in average lower than in the previous quarters. Our coverage ratio in our view continue to be very comfortable, 143% when we analyze the conditions of the economy.</p>
          <p>On page 8, provisions for loan losses and credit portfolio. We can see that we made provisions before recoveries of R$1.158 billion. That compares to R$1.830 billion in the first quarter. This increase quarter-over-quarter is because of the growth of our credit portfolio. When we analyze provision losses compared to the total credit portfolio, 6.2 continued to be improving in terms of the growth number.</p>
          <p>On slide number 9, funding and managed resources from our client bases as a total is R$403 billion. We continue to increase our client deposit bases, especially related to retail. We increased in the quarter almost 21%, and 56% in the last 12 months. Debentures issued by our lease company also continued to be a good source of funding for our operations. That increased 21% also in the quarter, and 75% over 12 months.</p>
          <p>Our institutional customers, when we analyze 12 months we see that the deposits from this segment is stable. As I said, we prefer to use more retail deposits than institutional deposits. But anyway, in the quarter we recovered the losses in terms of deposits of the last &#x2013; of the first quarter of this year. In terms of mutual funds the number is quite stable because we're seeing some shift from mutual funds, especially from money market funds, to time deposits.</p>
          <p>On page number 10 we can see a more detailed banking fees revenues and income from banking charge. The total number, R$2.594 billion. This shows an increase of 3.7% in the quarter, even though we can see some reductions because of the new regulation of the Central Bank that was &#x2013; that started in May. So, in this quarter we had two months already with the impact of the new regulations of the Central Bank. So, we can see that this impact on income from banking charge, line B, in the middle of this slide for those who are following, that in the first quarter had R$702 million had decreased to R$635 million. But anyway, we were able to compensate and show this growth of 3.7% in the total banking fees because we start new policies in terms of charging products that were not charged before that is allowed by the new regulations. And also, we compensate with more fees from investment banking in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide number 11, non-interest expenses. As I said, in our view the growth in the last 12 months of 5.7% is a good number. Just always remembering that we are opening branches. We are going to open this year 140 new branches, and we opened almost the same size, the same number in the last 12 months. So, we continue to take good control of expenses and we continue to put a lot of attention in this line because, with this market being more competitive, our control of expenses will be very important to keep profits growing.</p>
          <p>On page 12, we see the efficiency ratio. That continues to improve when we analyze the cumulative number for the last 12 months. It finished 45.4%. So, we continue to decrease quarter-by-quarter this ratio, what is very good, taking advantage of more control of expenses and taking advantage of the growth of our business in terms of credit and fees.</p>
          <p>On page 13, we see here more details in terms of the tax credit that was created because of the increase of the social contribution from 9 to 15%. You can see here that we offset in this quarter the increase of the total increase of this new law, but we still have R$771 million to use in the coming quarters to offset this increase in the social contribution. And we expect that the Supreme Court will give their opinion about our view that it is unconstitutional, this increase, in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>On page 14, we see the market value of our assets, the unrealized gains in a lot of assets that we have in our balance sheet. We see in this quarter we finish with R$6.779 billion of unrealized gains. That shows a huge growth when we compare to the June, 2007, that the number was close to R$2.8 billion. In the quarter we saw some reduction because of the decrease in the shares in the stock market.</p>
          <p>On slide 15 we see the segmentation, pro forma, managerial that we have, these four segments that we usually show in our presentations.</p>
          <p>On page 16 we can see these four segments in more details. On page 16 we can see the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2007 (sic) [2008]. And we show here the recurring net income for the retail bank, for the wholesale bank, for our non-checking account business, that is Itaucred, and the corporation that is where we allocate the excess of capital.</p>
          <p>Starting from the corporation, we can see that quarter-over-quarter that we reduced the excess of capital because of the growth of the credit portfolio and use &#x2013; allocate more capital to the business. So, we reduced the excess of capital allocated to corporation from 6.5 to 4.7. So, this was good news because we are using more the excess of capital to grow the business.</p>
          <p>We can see in the quarter that the retail operations increased the net income, the recurrent net income, from R$1.1 billion to R$1.2 billion. That shows an increase in the ROE of the allocated capital from 34 to 35%. Our wholesale bank, Ita&#xFA; BBA, also increased the recurrent net income from 368 to 414, and also increased their return. Itaucred reduced a little the results and of course reduced their ROE of the capital allocated from 39% to 30% in the quarter. So anyway, it was a very good result in terms of recurrent numbers, with a very good ROE for the three business lines that we have. We understand that we have also this excess of capital that are using and waiting for opportunities for acquisition, also. But we anyway are using this excess of capital. We bought back, as I said, R$1 billion in shares in the first semester and we are increasing our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, to finalize, we have the same numbers comparing the first half of 2008 with the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>With that I finish the presentation and we are open to your questions that you have to us. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley. A quick question. Can you share with us your outlook for the next 12 months? There's obviously been a lot of changes on the macro side with the Central Bank raising interest rates. Can you let us know what is your expectation for, first of all, the macro outlook for 2008 and 2009, and then what that means for your business in terms of the key variables: loan growth, fee growth, net interest margin and profitability? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jorge. This is Alfredo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Alfredo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Jorge, our forecast for the coming year is a little bit different from that we have to-date. We are expecting the economy to reduce the pace of growth. The first quarter was almost 6% in terms of GDP. We expect the interest rate to increase in the coming [inudible] meetings, achieving something around 15% in terms of interest rates. Of course, this will have some impact in the growth of the economy. That is the expectation of the Central Bank, of course, to reduce inflation.</p>
          <p>So, we expect the growth for the year to be around 4.8. So, we are going to see some reduction in the coming quarters. Next year we expect the economy to grow something between 3 and 3.5%. Of course, this environment will be different and the credit portfolio probably will grow less next year. But we are still positive that the numbers will be good in terms of growth for the economy when we compare to other countries, especially in the developing world. Probably, Brazil will have a growth bigger than these countries. And probably &#x2013; it's difficult to measure, but probably this scenario will show some increase in delinquencies in both segments, individuals and companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your &#x2013; thanks, Alfredo. And your expectations on the deceleration of credit growth. I mean, what level of magnitude are we talking about? Where do you think <mark type="inaudible" /> will end? I mean, you're right now at a run rate of 37% year-on-year. Where do you think that will end December 2008, and then December 2009? And then I guess the other very important variable is net interest margins. How does all of this play out in terms of your expectation for margins in '08 and '09?</p>

          <p>Hi Silvio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Silvio de Carvalho speaking. In the second semester we are expecting a reduction, in relation to the first semester. For next year we are &#x2013; but for the year we are expecting that the credit will grow around 25 to 30%,- maybe near 30%. For next year we are expecting around 25% in loan growth.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin, we expect it to be flat during this next quarter in relation to the second quarter of this year. But next year, we expect that will increase a little bit with the scenario that the interest rates will increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question Mr. Kuri. Our next question comes from Saul Martinez from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. How are you? A couple of questions. Actually I wanted to kind of focus on asset quality. And first of all, can you give a little bit more color on the decline of 40 basis points in your NPL ratio in the individual loan segment? I was a little bit surprised by the magnitude of that. Can you give just a little bit of color as to what segments that occurred in? Was that in auto, was that in credit card, unsecured personal lending? If you can just give a little bit more detail on what you're seeing within the individual sub-segments.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you gave some good disclosure about vintages. I think you mentioned that 1.3% of loans originated this quarter were past due more than 15 days, and that was less than what you've seen in the first quarter. But can you give us a sense as to how that number has looked historically? Is 1.3 a high number, is it a low number? And what you expect from the evolution of past vintages going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset quality, in our view, is spread out to all the segments. We don't have the concentration in any segment. In our view, is a result of the credit analysis that we implemented in 2006 and 2007. And these &#x2013; we have this in our models, new variables in credit scoring and in the credit analysis in general. And that's the consequence of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of 1.3% of the vintages, that's the first time that we gave this disclosure. We don't have any historical information. 1.3 we consider that's good, but we have to expect other quarters to analyze more deeply. In our view, 1.3 it's a good number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But &#x2013; so on the first question, Silvio, I mean, can you &#x2013; I mean, so the 40 basis point decline, you've seen declines in auto &#x2013; the auto loan book, the credit card loan book? I mean, that was pretty &#x2013; are you seeing better asset quality across the board within your consumer side or within your individual loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we have more presence of SMEs. That is part of this ratio. But we see a little deterioration in credit cards. But a little improvement in car loans, and the other parts of the credit portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned that you expect the economy to slow down in 2008. And you said you see an expectation of an increase in delinquency in both corporate and individual loans. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more color as to kind of the order of magnitude?</p>
          <p>And also, whether you think the 140% coverage ratio, which has declined, you said you feel comfortable with it, but it has declined quite a bit. Actually, it has declined quite a bit in recent quarters. I mean is that what you should be seeing if you expect to see delinquency rates go up going forward? Shouldn't you have &#x2013; shouldn't you be having a higher coverage ratio as opposed to a lower coverage ratio when &#x2013; if your expectations are for increased delinquency rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We didn't see any sign of that deterioration yet. But because of interest rates is increasing our vision, we affect the credit quality. But we &#x2013; to work in this scenario, we become more stringent in credit analysis. Our <mark type="inaudible" /> are more stringent.</p>
          <p>We think that's where you'll keep these ratios flat or a little bit deterioration. But not so much; it's very small. We consider that the level of the quality ratio that Ita&#xFA; has in this momentum in terms of credit, it's okay. Many of that is related with car loans, we are very comfortable today.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. My question, given that the guidance, some indications on the guidance that's been given is on the SME business, the lending to small and medium-sized companies.</p>
          <p>In the presentation you talked about Ita&#xFA;'s desire to increase its market share. If you can talk a little bit perhaps, Alfredo or Silvio, about how you quantify the market share today and any targets you may have. On my calculation you grew that book by R$4.5 billion in the quarter. Is that the kind of quarterly increase in the loan book that we should expect going forward?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to basically the increase in time deposits on the funding side. You mentioned that you saw a move from money markets to time deposits. Can you quantify some of this movement and the impact on Ita&#xFA;? I would imagine it means less fees, but you now have the funding on the balance sheet to support your growth in assets. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of our strategy related with SME is a consequence of the acquisition related with BankBoston. BankBoston had a big presence &#x2013; relatively big presence in the SME market. And we integrated totally BankBoston during 2007. And at the end of 2007 we are prepared to expanding our operation in SME market.</p>
          <p>Our market share before BankBoston was very small. It's very difficult to quantify this market share. But according to our calculation, it was around 7%. And today it's around 10%, but it's an estimation while we cannot detail is difficult to forecast that. That's our vision and we &#x2013; is our segment that we are very, very focused.</p>
          <p>In terms of fees, that you have this not totally in our book. The rules that was implemented by Central Bank since May '08. But in our target into this year relates to fee growth, it's around 5% in 2008 in relation to 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Any specific comments on the growth rate in the SME segment, R$4.5 billion in the quarter in terms of increased portfolio, is that a reasonable run rate for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is &#x2013; it totally is spread out to all the segments and not in any specific segment. The reason is because we're having platforms focused in relationship with the Company. And we expect to grow SME portfolio around 35% December '08 in relation to December '07, or at most 40%.</p>
          <p>In terms of the costs that you ask me, Jason, in reality we move from money markets found it two times the cost. And this happened during this year and we expect it to continue in this direction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is related to the drop in net income that we saw at Itaucred, as you highlighted in slide 16. Net income there is down 15% in the second quarter from the first quarter. Just wanted to get some more color there, what really is impacting Itaucred?</p>
          <p>Also, when I looked at Taii, it seems like you have reduced or closed about 100 stores from Taii when we look on a year-over-year basis. I think it's around 700 stores that you have now. So, if you could also give us some color on the strategy at Taii?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to expenses. As you show the expenses have been under control. But I was wondering, out of the 140 branches that you plan to open, how many have you opened already in the first half? And what kind of collective labor agreements, what kind of salary increases are you expecting out of that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, Silvio speaking. Let's talk about Taii strategy. Taii, we achieved and in reality it's profitable. Today our operation with <mark type="inaudible" /> and we expect to continue to increase the tradition with <mark type="inaudible" /> which the contribution from the results of the bank. The operation &#x2013; the JV with Lojas Americanas <mark type="inaudible" />. Probably this we'll achieve on the end of this year or in 2009. In our own stores, probably we have &#x2013; first, the market has changed. It's not the same market that when we implemented this operation. I think you have competition with the payroll loans, so the market is more difficult. And we will make some changes in these operations probably. We didn't close exactly the number of store related with Taii. In reality, we implemented some virtual branches inside the supermarkets, inside the Lojas Americanas. If you see the disclosure, you will see the numbers of virtual point that we implemented.</p>
          <p>The drop in net interest margin I think is more a consequence of the duration of the credit portfolio. In the past we have in the accrual base a participation with loans with higher spreads. It was below with new ones with a little bit lower spreads. And this &#x2013; that's basically the reduction. In other words, two companies. The mix and the spreads are a little bit lower. That's the scenario.</p>
          <p>The third question, what &#x2013; the number of branches at Ita&#xFA;, 68 branches in the first semester. And we intend to open 140 branches during this year. In terms of expense increase, we mentioned before that the number that we are supposed to increase it was 12% of the total expense. But I think it can be lower than that. Depends on the negotiation with the union. That didn't start yet.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question, Mr. Pierry. Our next question comes from Daniel Abut with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Silvio and Alfredo. First, on loan growth for next year, I think Silvio said preliminary about 25%. Given that you expect &#x2013; and Alfredo really explained that &#x2013; a much slower economic activity type of year, plus much higher rate, do you still expect auto loans and SME loans to be the key drivers of that 25% loan growth next year, or will there be any change in the mix towards less risky segment? And second, in particular in auto loans, given that you have conducive growth so rapidly there. This quarter it was over 60% year-on-year, would you comment on &#x2013; a bit more on your strategy there? How much of this segment now represents of your overall portfolio? What type of loan-to-value ratio do you apply? You seem to be happy with the asset quality there. I think you even indicated that that was the main reason why the NPLs at the individual segment improved this quarter. But given that this is becoming such a predominant segment within your portfolio, some people are starting to feel a bit a bit, I wouldn't say concerned but let me call curious, about what's your strategy longer term, whether these type of growth rates are sustainable or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, it's Silvio speaking. In relation to the loan growth, we expect 25% and the loan growth probably will happen in the same segment with the more participation of the products that increase more this year. It will be a continuation in next year, more auto loans and more SMEs. And in terms of loan-to-value, we are financed around 70% of the value of the collateral. And then we are confident that these operations will continue with good quality. Just to remember that today credit in relation to GDP in Brazil is 36%. It's not a very, very high level of that compared with other parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just a follow-up, Silvio. How much of your consumer loan portfolio now is coming from auto loans? And how much of that auto loan portfolio is financing of new cars versus used cars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; 40% is in new cars; 60% is pre-owned cars. We have this break down in the slide six and you can see that the car loans is R$36 billion in relation to R$148 billion. It means that the participation of the car loans of the total portfolio is 24%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How large do you think it can get? I mean, if you continue to expect this segment to be one of the drivers next year, at what level do you think you can get in terms of participation? Do you ambition it going to one-third of the portfolio? I mean, how high can it go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it will be around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a final question. You said 70% loan-to-value ratio. Is there a difference between that statistic for used cars versus new cars? Because you said 40% is new cars, 60% pre-owned. I would imagine you use different loan-to-value ratios in the two sub-segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the new cars is around 80%, and in terms of pre-owned cars, it's around 65%.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just a quick question on your overall level of profitability, Silvio and Alfredo. Last year, as you remember, you were affected by the integration of BankBoston. And as you indicated and promised, this year that that was put behind, your ROE has started to rebound. We are now at 27.5% level for the first half. As you head into next year, and given that you are already clearly, a spread that you expected more complicated and tougher environment. Do you think you can sustain these levels of ROE or there may be some negative adjustment next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, we don't give guidance in terms of ROE. But we see, even in this more difficult scenario that we probably will have in the coming quarters, we see a good scenario overall for the bank. We don't see much pressure probably coming from competition in terms of spreads. We see a reduction in the level of the economy. But overall, we see a good environment for banking activities in Brazil. We continue to see growth in terms of credit, probably lower than this year, but it's a important growth yet, probably increase &#x2013; a small increase in delinquencies. But overall, the interest rate will remain high in average in the coming quarters. So, the overall environment, in our view, will continue to be a very good one for banking. So, we expect that our current results continue to be good, even though this different environment that we are going to face in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi. You mentioned during your presentation that you are very well capitalized that you may continue to repurchase shares. And also, that you could be looking at acquisitions. I think this is the same speech you have used several other times. But like, you must be keeping an eye on current valuation of some bank assets outside of Brazil. There has been a major sell-off. Are you tempted yet by these types of valuation? Are you tempted at all to move outside of Brazil more aggressively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not our intention, Mario. We see that there's a lot of alternatives outside, but we will continue to focus our efforts in Brazil. We see a lot of opportunity in Brazil in the coming years. I think the market in Brazil is very good for banking. The prospectus in terms of credit growth, mechanization of the population, increase in income from individuals. So, we see a very good scenario for Brazil in terms of &#x2013; for banking in the coming years. So, we will continue to keep the eyes in Brazil. It doesn't mean that we cannot have some small acquisition or a small business that we can do in countries that we already are established. But we are not planning any huge investment outside Brazil in the coming quarters, in the coming years.</p>
