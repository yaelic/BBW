      <participant id="2" type="corprep">Alfredo Saenz Abad, Chief Executive Officer____________________________________________</participant>
      <participant id="3" type="corprep">Let's see. Summing up what we've done in 2007. On the good evolution that we've shown you of the group and of these business areas is a proof of how Santander can get very good results in a very complex environment for the banks and also in the financial markets. Specifically, we've done it quite well in terms of revenues and cost income ratios, in all areas. At the same time, that we have strengthened the strength of our balance sheet. We've had an EPS growth of over 20%. Practically, unattainable for most international banks and that led us to significantly improve our return on assets and our return on equity. But not everything has been to get results for today. We've been working to build the P&amp;L for the next years.</participant>
      <participant id="4" type="corprep">Santander has invested very strongly this year. We have invested in business network with over 300 new branches and with over 1,500 ATMs, tax rate over 3.5 million in retail banking customers and we've got over 1.5 million customers. We have propelled all these operations in our global businesses and we have acquired the assets of ABN AMRO. All these investments, I am sure will produce excellent evidence in the coming years.</participant>
      <participant id="5" type="corprep">How do we see 2008? I think you'll agree that we have an environment of growth, which is obviously good, but with a lot of uncertainty. The world will continue to grow although below the figures of 2007 because of the deceleration that is taking place in some very developed economies although the emerging economies will still lead the growth. And all-in-all the larger areas for Santander will maintain sufficient momentum then it will continue grow more than Europe, and the UK will be in line with that. And Latin America will continue to give us good deals of growth because of its economic potential, its greater macroeconomic stability and its growing number of banks. And from the financial view point, it will also be a very demanding year as I said before from the past year.</participant>
      <participant id="6" type="corprep">The banks will have to get used to an environment result liquidity surplus as of previous years for taking risks will require an appropriate price and when where customer relations efficiency or cost to income ratios and the process will have a high value. It is an environment in which many of our competitors are considering returning to traditional businesses back to basics. And we have the advantage that we're already there because we really never left it. We never left the basic businesses. Under this environment, those institutions are focused on universal banking on capturing funds as opposed to just lending and being in high growth markets such as the emerging market will give us an advantage. This is a theoretical profile in which Santander fits perfectly well. But it isn't only a theoretical point, it is also a practical point, because in 2008, Santander will phase out that year from an excellent starting point. And there are several reasons for my claim.</participant>
      <participant id="7" type="corprep">First of all, our business is basically retail banking. It is well diversified and therefore our revenues are recurrent and sustainable. Secondly, this business profile is a very high quality, so our risk is low and more importantly it is a predictable risk. Thirdly we have a very strong balance sheet with more than ample liquidity and solvency levels that make us feel very comfortable. Fourthly, our business portfolio has a combination of differentiating activities and developed an emerging market, which contribute to high growth.</participant>
      <participant id="8" type="corprep">Fifth, just growth, or we benefited from investments made in these recent years and we will do that having a good track record in costs. That track record in costs has enabled us to strengthen our front office and assume big investments and capacity while constantly improving our cost to income ratio.</participant>
      <participant id="9" type="corprep">And finally and very importantly, we will have the contribution of the ABN's businesses, which will give us physical mass in Brazil to compete with the country's large players and that makes us the only international bank with a significant presence in a BRIC country. So, Santander faces 2008 with a sound positioning, a great capacity of proven execution which puts us in a better position than our competitors.</participant>
      <participant id="10" type="corprep">And to get the most out of this situation, we have management focus -- a management focus that is quite well defined, and let me break that down. First of all, a greater focus on management of spreads. Secondly, paying priority attention to costs as the basic lever for managing the jobs. Thirdly, a special focus on risks and their impact on the provisions. Fourthly, greater focus, greater importance attached to deposits and we will emphasize strongly our customers as well as the quality of services, all of that without forgetting our discipline in financial and capital management, and our permanent obsession with developing and extracting value from our global reach via global businesses and technology.</participant>
      <participant id="11" type="corprep">With all of that we are confident that in the year 2008 Santander will continue to grow and to create value as we have seen in the medium to long term. And let me finish by saying that in spite of the more difficult environment, we certify this in the EPS expectations announced during September's Investor Day last year. And that's all, thank you very much.</participant>
      <participant id="12" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: Good morning. We'll now open the Q&amp;A session. It will last only until 11:30. We have some 35, 40 minutes for questions. But we'll try to answer all your questions now. If that is not possible, the Investor Relations Department will take care of all questions that are left pending.</participant>
      <participant id="13" type="corprep">The first one we have is from Morgan Stanley, Eva Hernandez. She has three questions.  Could we inform more about the purchase of global business in Brazil, equity, profits, etcetera? Are you expecting any additional impact on capital when Banco Real is fully integrated, it could be in the second semester of 2008, could we give data about provisions and cost for 2008?</participant>
      <participant id="14" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: We'll, let' see. Purchasing global businesses, global clients. In the presentation, we included in one of the annexes, what this business is. This is a business that has an operating income or has had an operating income of &#x20AC;140 million and generates a net profit of &#x20AC;44 million in 2007. The multiples that we expect that we stated on ROI in 2010, that is to be found in on page 59 and the PR is what we paid as to the agreement with ABN Amro which is what we have to do in the consortium. So these figures have been calculated with relatively conservative synergies. The cost to income will be 45% in this business because it is integrated in the business or the wholesale area of Banco Real that's why we bought it, because it was producing a disruption in the capacity to generate business in Brazil.</participant>
      <participant id="15" type="corprep">The second question refers to all the numbers of the goodwill in Banco Real and all the ABN AMRO.</participant>
      <participant id="16" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: We include all that in the core capital that we have given to you, which is 625. The goodwill expected for the entire operation will be around 8 billion, which as I said, has already been included in the core capital figures that we've given to you. As to the timing of the Banco Real operation, which I think was the other question. When will Banco Real be legally integrated into Santander? Well, it will depends on two factors.  One is the freeze out of the minority part of ABN, maybe May, and another one Banco Real will be transferred to Santander more or less on the third quarter. That will be when legally Banco Real will be fully integrated in the Santander Group.</participant>
      <participant id="17" type="corprep">There was one last part regarding provisions and risks. Provisions and cost of the risk in 2008, we don't have different information from the one we gave on the Investor Day. We have no update nor anything that will make us think that we will be out of what we gave you before. It's been improving. On Investor's Day we said, the risk premium would go up and the only place were we've seen a significant increase of the risk premium of the cost of loans is in cars in Mexico and in Spain, where we have a tendency that we've been seeing lately and we mentioned that on the Investor's Day.</participant>
      <participant id="18" type="corprep">&lt;&lt;&lt;Q&gt;</participant>
      <participant id="19" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Well I think the acquisition of Drive was very good business. I think in the last presentation of results I said that we had been very positively surprised by this business, because it is the first time that we had experienced at the Santander Group of this type of business. First of all in the US, and also because of the nature of the business it was new to us and although it is true that some figures might indicate that NPLs are growing, and that is true, it is also true that spreads are growing. Production is at a reasonable level, repossession is increasing and the cost of it as well, but we have a very efficient unit to repossess vehicles and as a whole, Drive's prospects for 2008 are very good, excellent outlook. So, I don't think we should be correcting anything really. Much to the contrary, I would say that our perception is that it's been a very interesting acquisition for the Group.</participant>
      <participant id="20" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt; While I don't remember all of them. There were many questions. Let me take them one-by-one. First of all, consolidation of Banco Real, that was already answered by Jose Antonio a minute ago. Then Societe General, nothing to say. Then the impact of Basel of BIS2. The bank will publish its rules in the spring and as you know, there is a transition period, so initially we will probably need less capital when we strictly apply the Basel rules. But as you know, you can not reduce capital under 90% of BIS1. So, we have to see how these things can be made compatible. But I don't think that's going to have really a lot of impact on our capital figures. And with regards to completion risk, which I think was one of the operations regarding Antonveneta. Well, we don't see any risk there of this getting complicated or not happening. And there is no finalization clause, but it's not required because it's going to be completed and fast. Have I left any out? No. [inaudible]from [inaudible]</participant>
      <participant id="21" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Well, it seems that the different margins are stagnated. What was the first question again? Yes, the exchange rate, the impact of the exchange rate. The exchange rate, perhaps Jose Antonio can say a bit more about this -- about this point. But basically in 2007, we've had exchange rate profits because of a hedge that guarantees that we can transfer our results from Latin American into euros in our consolidated P&amp;L. And for some time now -- for years, we hedge for these results. We have had positive results therefore in the corporate centre; positive results of this hedging operation, which are parallel and similar to the negative ones that we got from the consolidation into our income statement of pounds and dollars. One thing offsets the other, but in different items. If the exchange rate changes direction then perhaps we will see less trading gains. But in turn that will mean better results in the consolidated P&amp;L, because what is been transferred from Latin American units will be worth more. Jose Antonio would you like to add anything to that? And then the other question was? Yes, the spread of Santander consumer finance.</participant>
      <participant id="22" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Consumer finance is the business and we've already said this in the past that when interest rates go up it increases the spread and the other way around. In 2007, we've had a period where interest rate either nominal or real interest rates have gone up, that on the one hand. On the other hand, there's been more competition and that explains why margins are becoming smaller. In 2008 in part we'll probably see a change in the trend, at least when it comes to interest rates, because they might go down. This business we think is going to grow this year in terms of revenue. And we're going to have to make a strong effort in terms of cost. It is true that cost went up in 2007, basically due to expansion programs and investment programs, even at a constant perimeter, but in 2008, our cost budget is more in line with the idea of this business. Now, revenue and cost is going to give us, that combination is going to give us, a very acceptable level of earnings. I don't know whether I left out one of the questions.  No. Javier also has a couple of questions on Brazil.</participant>
      <participant id="23" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Well in leasing that doesn't really affect us, perhaps in Santander Bank but, well that could affect us a bit, but not so much in the other bank, because we have a very limited leasing business. So it's not really going to affect us. It's not significant for us. Now, other regulatory issues, well, we'll have to see what the real impact is. Undoubtedly, in Brazil there's been a rationalization of the conditions to make things simpler and more transparent for the consumer, which is probably a good thing. It's clearly good for the Brazilian consumer. And it's also more rational for the bank. What is its impact? Well, we haven't yet valued this. There is going to be an impact, we don't think it's going to be extraordinarily strong. We do think nevertheless that there will be an impact as a consequence of these changes, which also entail a reduction. But well, in the next few months, we can probably be more explicit about this. Because it's not simply applying the law arithmetically to our fees and commissions, it's a bit more complex than that. But, our first impression although we do think it's going to have a bit of an impact, we don't think it's going to be too important.  [inaudible]</participant>
      <participant id="24" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Well, trading gains, let's start by the second question. We've had the positive effect, well there has been several more because of the selling of a few businesses. But the impact has been in the exchange rate. Of course that effect might be the contrary, the opposite, if the exchange rates change the trend, if they fluctuate as one of your colleagues said.</participant>
      <participant id="25" type="corprep">Regarding the net interest income, our forecast and our budget for 2008 expect a reduction of net interest income. In fact, in September, in Investor's Day, we already said this. If I remember correctly, we expected the revenue of the group that instead of growing 21%, as they did in 2007, as we've seen now they've grown by 21%. We think it's going to grow 12 or 10 to 12% in this year 2008-2009. So we're already getting ahead of that impact of lower volumes. We're already expecting a lower net interest income. And I've said this before and I'd like to confirm it. The guidance that we gave in Investor's Day is still applicable. It's applicable to this question. Was there anything else for this question?  No. [inaudible]</participant>
      <participant id="26" type="corprep">Would you like to answer the first part that you know better?</participant>
      <participant id="27" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Yes. About RFS, the net effect of the RFS transaction was -- RFS I have to say is the company that acquired ABN AMRO. Well, the net effect was 60 million, which comes from -- because of the use of the equity method plus greater financial expenses, &#x20AC;80 million. I also would like to go back to your previous question, is that in the net interest revenue? Well, yes, that is the impact of RFS on our account. Yes, fees and commissions in the Santander network, that's quite logical that they should fall, because we shouldn't forget that about 50% of fees and commissions of the retail network in Spain come from mutual funds. And mutual funds have fallen in 2007 and they will continue to fall this year because of structural reasons and also because of commercial policy reasons. We are going to focus more on deposits, a formula that can give us more liquidity. So, I can anticipate that they will continue to fall, but not because of strange reasons, but simply because the rate of mutual funds and any change on the mutual fund policy has an impact on fees and commissions. He also mentioned provisions for loan losses in wholesale banking in Europe. Well, basically these are generic provisions. And they have a lot to do with the increase of guarantees. It's not so much based on large corporate operations as was the case in 2006. And I think you also asked about costs in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. Well, in Latin America, this year, 2008 we think is going to be very strong in terms of cost. In Brazil and Chile costs won't grow more than inflation. In Mexico perhaps it will grow a point more because it's still going through an expansion period, but of course, I am talking about the local banks and also always measuring cost in local currency.</participant>
      <participant id="28" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: Yes, in effect, as I said, it's that net from taxes. How have we -- this is a price where we value Sovereign at about $13, I think it's $12.9, that's the valuation, where do we get that from?  Well, at that price we are appropriately valuing the possibilities of Sovereign of generating recurrent profits, in the current circumstances. So, how we reach this figure? Well, we of course, talked about it with our auditors. We also looked at the market's opinions and we do think that the value of Sovereign in our books is reasonable. It does reflect the current market circumstances.</participant>
      <participant id="29" type="corprep">What about the generic provisions in Brazil, Chile and Mexico? In Mexico it's 70%, in Brazil and Chile the answer would be yes.</participant>
      <participant id="30" type="corprep">What is your estimate of the provisions, as generic provisions in Abbey given the increase with second half of the year? No. We don't have it.</participant>
      <participant id="31" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: I don't have any figure in my head which will entail change vis-&#xE0;-vis the situation we've had in the past few quarters. And in the budget given the nature of Abbey's portfolio we have about like two portfolios while would represent 95% which is prime mortgages. They have been valued at loan to value. We've already given all the information about this portfolio; it's very prime in nature. We don't expect any significant changes. Now in the UPL portfolio there -- the performance hasn't been that good in terms of NPL. Also, in the presentation I mentioned that production have gone down by 54% and the stock had gone down by 28% at the same time that we increased the spread by 90 or 90 something basis points. So, in terms of the cost of risk in Abbey, I would say that we don't expect significant change from what we have at present.</participant>
      <participant id="32" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: And the other question from Ignacio have been already answered.</participant>
      <participant id="33" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Carlos Garcia&gt;: Carlos Garcia from ING. How do you expect new NLPs to revolve in 2008? If they continue to go up, might you have to increase your provisions? What about by geographical area?  That's I think a bit too much detail that they ask for.</participant>
      <participant id="34" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Well, yes there's going to be more NLPs -- new NLPs this year. We already said that in Investor's Day. We have taken that into account when drawing up the budget. So, the answer will be yes, but -- yes that has already been taken into account in our guidance and with the figures we gave at Investor Day and in our budget. As Alfredo said, if we do it by geographical areas where our NLPs are going to confirm, I think the investor -- the relationship with Investors' Department can answer your question because that will be too much detail to give now.</participant>
      <participant id="35" type="corprep">Will that change the guidance of 50% EPA?  Well, we already answered that.</participant>
      <participant id="36" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: It's basically in Spain. In treasury it's been the weakest fourth quarter, because there was more volatility in the markets and our trading activities in Madrid have generated 30 million in negative trading gains. But there's no specific cause. There's no signal reason for this. Trading in general has not done well that quarter.</participant>
      <participant id="37" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Well, I think that to give you a growth hypothesis of GDP below 2% in Spain would be rather dramatic. Obviously, we have started some sensitivity analysis for different scenarios and a scenario of that type is not reasonable to be expected, I don't think. About the liquidity in commercial policy of Abbey. Abbey, as you know perfectly well, has two businesses, mortgages, solds to intermediaries and solds directly. We continue a policy to grow our business through the sales in the offices and we have done that in 2007 and we will continue in 2008, growing in that business, because I think things are favorable for us given more importance to the growth of margins than wishing to increase the growth in volumes. But I think in the year 2008, we will be with the wind in favor for that market. As for the liquidity, well, we've said that the group has a comfortable liquidity position.</participant>
      <participant id="38" type="corprep">Acquisition about the write-off of intangibles for 351 million in Brazil, is it because of the business bought from Royal Bank of Scotland and which would have been the recurrent write-down? Well, we're talking about purchase of customers from the public sector, which has been done and it has been done during the last two years, which was a bit part of the customer increasing policy of Central Hispano Bank and as a consequence of the acquisition of Banco Real, this policy makes no sense anymore. So what we've done is simply to all of a sudden write-off some things that was accounted for as charged to be written down that meant 70 million a year and therefore it was written-off completely in our books.</participant>
      <participant id="39" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: As regards to Portugal write-down it's four or five concepts, it's not just one. There are some that relate to reclassification of some accounting terms, others relate to the implementation of personal in Portugal in 2008 and some others. But there're four or five different concepts there. One is the classification and the other three, the most relevant is personal for Portugal for that figure of 68 million. And for the second question of the real estate factor.  Well, our positions have been 7% more or less of the portfolio in Spain and there's been a lot of talk of developers we don't have to add any more. But quality of the portfolio here and the market although there's been a lot of talk, we have an exceptionally good portfolio quality. And I think we talked about NPL's below 10 basis points for the developers and we mentioned that before the sales have slowed down and the ratio that we talked about which is the percentages of units pre-sold in the developers portfolio has been going down. It's a bit over 40% now but in September we talked about 45, 46%. Now it's 41, 42. Therefore there's been a deceleration of sales. The percentage of works in our portfolio is 50 some. We have a percentage of houses under construction that have been pre-sold of 40 some and the other is 50, in a process of deceleration of the [inaudible], which is quite well known by all of you.</participant>
      <participant id="40" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: In Brazil, since we still are at a situation which is known by all of you. Our intention just like we did for Abbey is to present to the market in the month of September/October, a detailed plan as to what we aim to achieve in Brazil, in the coming three years, 2008, '09, and '10, with all the synergies and activities that we plan to do in Brazil. Right now, it would be frivolous on our part to say whether we confirm something. As a minimum, we have to do what was foreseen in the acquisition. But to be more specific, we need to take effective control of Banco Real and work during a few months on the plans that we will develop and we will be talking about at -- in September/October more or less.</participant>
      <participant id="41" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: The last series of questions from [inaudible] from -- before we take the phone questions. Expectations of quality of loans and delinquency in consumer finance. Could we give any data for 2008-2009? Is there any change in strategy in the US after the Sovereign announcement in the auto lending field, and then securitization in the production of Drive?</participant>
      <participant id="42" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: Well, in terms of quality of credit we have done what we've said on the Investor's Day, increasing the risk premium. Specifically in Santander Consumer Finance, we would have to elaborate country by country. But we don't see significant changes in some areas we're improving, and others such as Spain, things are getting worse, but we don't see any significant changes in Santander Consumer Finance, Europe. In the US, the write down was mentioned made by Drive for cars. I think that we mentioned that we have a &#x20AC;3.3 billion portfolio in the US. That is a portfolio who designs all the commercial policy is designed for the segment in which it upgrades. So, I want to say that because of situation of the market, we were able, since February-March last year, to bring up the cycle on [inaudible]. Delinquency is pretty much on the line. For 2007 we have a budget that includes those variables to something else like Manheim Index that is used in the US for second hand cars has fallen down, so there'll be some severity in the loans. But with the increase in [inaudible] I don't think we will be affected as for the generation of results. As for securitization, Drive up until the last securitization done in October although it's more expensive, at Drive used to securitized liable to 5% basic funds. The last securitization which was 65, 70 including everything 80 basis points. That which in other businesses is a very high increase as regard to yield of Drives which is over 20 more or less. It's a significant change, but in terms of the business, it is not that significant since, as mentioned before, the yields are going up and cycle is improving. So, it's not a representative for that business. I think it would be for other businesses.</participant>
      <participant id="43" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: Basically, as for the production of mortgages, it has slowed down. Even more than what we have foreseen. And Abbey notices that, especially of the policy that it follows, but the most important item that really Abbey has done significantly as a commercial policy is to reduce drastically the UPLs down through intermedia research and it's concentrated UPLs through the branches. And that's the position, that's the important thing.  As for the rest, nothing new.</participant>
      <participant id="44" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Arturo de Frias&gt;: Good morning. I have two or three questions. One relates to Brazil, you said that surely you will not do the consolidation until the third quarter. The question will be, when you do the consolidation will you take off the effect or will you bring back the effect of the first of January, will you be consolidating the accounts in Brazil for the entire 2008, or the first two quarters will be done as you have done it before through the equity method? Another question, I think you've said something, but will you be interested in what is happening with Societe General? I think the answer will be no, but please clear that up. The third question would be, whether you could make some comments as to how you see the situation of wholesale financing in Spain, how the certificate markets are? Do you consider doing something else; do you think 2008 will be still a difficult year? And then the very last question although, I think it was asked of you 5 or 10 minutes ago, with regards growth of GDP in Spain, could you make a more extensive comment on the situation in Spain, not focusing on developers or delinquency, or a more macro economic comment? The latest date you had are very worrisome. We have had bad employment data, so the slowdown in Spain is going quicker than expected. So I wanted to know what you think about all that?</participant>
      <participant id="45" type="corprep">&lt;&lt;&lt;A&gt;</participant>
      <participant id="46" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alfredo Saenz Abad&gt;: The question about Societe General, he answered it himself.  No, of course, and the wholesale situation in Spain, Jose Antonio you'd better answer that.</participant>
      <participant id="47" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Jose Antonio Alvarez&gt;: It's a matter wholesale financing and I think he spoke about mortgage certificates. We made an [inaudible] in November when the market was at a bad situation. We think that it is true that things have grown but the market is quite receptive to issues of mortgage certificates. We are not thinking about doing something in the short-term, basically because of one reason.  Because the percentages that we have issued on the eligible portfolio the limit is 70, we're at 60 some, so we do not wish to stretch that limit but operations at three to five years can be placed at 20 basis points over LIBOR which is something a level in which we can work and I hope that some of the financial institutions in Spain will be doing something. As for GDP, we don't have much to say. We're from consensus, although the data in these last years have not been good. But it's too soon I think, to infer from these data something similar or worse. No. Our vision is one of decelerations and we have been looking at in the several months that have gone by is a deceleration, especially in the Real Estate Sector. And we think that the deceleration will bring us to 2.4, 2.7 that for consensus is set. We don't think there anything else without that.</participant>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I will begin my presentation on the results of Santander for the year 2007, splitting it up into three sections. First of all, I will talk about fundamental aspects that have been fundamental in the year 2007. Then I will go over the group's results and subsequently, Jose Antonio Alvarez, the CFO of the Santander Group, will develop the main business areas, and finally, I will close, once again, with my opinion on the outlook for this year.</p>
          <p>The first idea I would like to put across is that Santander has achieved excellent results in a much more complex environment than in previous years. It is precisely in such complex environments where we can see, which are the good and well managed banks as compared to the rest and Santander is one of the good banks. The figures at the end of 2007 and the comparison with both of our competitors clearly places us one of the winning banks in this year.</p>
          <p>There are four aspects that make 2007 a great year for the group: The figure of profit, the strong growth of earnings per share, the total return that we have offered to our shareholders and finally, the successful acquisition of ABN Amro, and I will dwell on each one of these points.</p>
          <p>We've closed 2007 with total profits of &#x20AC;2.60 billion after that and capital gains and extraordinary write-offs, which I will comment on later, the attributable profit was &#x20AC;8.111 billion with an increase of 23%. As a result Santander, for the first time ever, is among the world's top five banks by total profits.</p>
          <p>The growth of profit is almost entirely translated into earnings per share, which before capital gains increased 21.4%. This figure already includes in the denominator, the number of regulatorily convertible shares that will be issued in due course for the exchange of the Santander stocks.</p>
          <p>This EPS growth places Santander in the top three within our peer group. That is to say the one which is taken at a basis to established the long-term incentive plans of the group including 20 large international banks, which because of their size, features, degree of competence are the banks to beat.</p>
          <p>The list of these banks can be seen in the lower part of slide. Just as important as year-on-year growth is the quarterly performance of profits and EPS. In our quarterly performance Santander shows a very sound evolution in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In contrast with losses in the last quarters of some of our main international competitors, specifically, the group for the third quarter running offers recurrent profit that exceeds &#x20AC;2 billion and a growth of earnings per share in like-for-like trends since previous quarters without ABN of 26%.</p>
          <p>The sound performance of EPS, our payout policy and the confidence in our capacity to generate earnings enables us to propose to the next shareholder's meeting, an increase of 25% in dividends per share. We increased 25% for the third consecutive year, in other words, we've doubled dividend repay to our shareholders in three years.</p>
          <p>If we look at the total shareholder return in longer periods of time, we see how Santander has remained in the leading group during different periods and it improved its relative position in the last few years. Moreover, in all these periods, we have maintained profit and rising profitability spreads with the benchmark banking NVC, such as the case of the Dow Jones stock Bank.</p>
          <p>While the volume of profits, the growth, and the high shareholder return made 2007 a tremendous year for Santander, the 4th point that we see here, the acquisition of ABN AMRO assets makes it a really great year. Because of the stronger potential to generate profit for the coming years, because of the perfect fit with our strategy in Brazil we will compete head-on with the country's largest banks. And because of the efficient way in which the operation was financed, enabling us to meet our strict financial criteria without a capital increase.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize now the assets acquired from ABN AMRO and which have been the latest movements regarding them. As you know, as a result of the initial agreement with our partners Royal Bank of Scotland and Fortis, we acquired the businesses of ABN AMRO in Latin America with other global clients, the Antonveneta Group in Italy, the proceeds from the sale of some small consumer businesses in Europe, as well as the proportional part of shared businesses. All of that for a total in euros of 19.9 billion.</p>
          <p>In parallel and during the process of segregation of the different units, we thought that it was advisable to keep the majority of business in Brazil, so we have acquired global customers for &#x20AC;750 from RBS. We are also looking at the possibility that the asset management business in Brazil will go to Santander. The strategic fit is clear.</p>
          <p>The global customers are an independent unit from an accounting and reporting viewpoint, but not from an operational viewpoint since they're fully integrated in Banco Real with whom they share all services. Maintaining this business we avoid risk of execution in the separation while at the same time we will be able to generate synergies with the group's wholesale banking. The financial fit is also attractive and we have an ROI expected -- ROI of 9% approximately. In the appendicies, you will find details of the operation.</p>
          <p>After all these operations, the total estimated investment is around &#x20AC;10.5 billion which will enable us to obtain an ROI of 19% in 2010 and an increase in the earnings per share after the first full year of management.</p>
          <p>To conclude this part, I will use a slide that explains the positive strategic impact of this operation for Santander. Santander's strategy is to place all its businesses in the lower right quadrant, the good quadrant, where we have strong market positions with the market shares close to -- or above 10% and with very good cost to income ratios, below 50%.</p>
          <p>As you can see our big business in retail banking is already there. At Abbey we're working on this. With a mortgage market share of 9% we have improved strongly its cost to income ratio in the last three years, and we are at 50% now vis-&#xE0;-vis the 70%, which Abbey had when we bought it. The acquisition of Banco Real will enable us to place Brazil in this good quadrant. Our market share for the whole of Brazil has risen from 5% to more than 10% and the cost to income ratio remains below 50%.</p>
          <p>Finally, this framework also explains the decision to sell Antonveneta. Even recording the synergies in this for the next year, that group would still be outside of the good quadrant for which we would need additional investments. Its sale has enabled us to obtain the returns envisaged for the next few years without making new investments.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at the group's results. In previous quarters, to describe the results of the group, I will use the little house scheme that includes the main aspects. First of all, the strong growth of results and especially of earnings per share, their sustainability and quality. The second driver is the strength of recurrent revenues in all the group's units. A third important point is the continuous improvement in efficiency. And fourthly, we have to say that our provisions remained in line with expectations, which produces a big rise in net operating income, net of provisions. And finally the fifth point, which would be the first of the foundations of the building of results is our strong and sound balance sheet in terms of credit quality, solvency and liquidity. On all these points I will elaborate now.</p>
          <p>I will go over the account from the bottom to the top. The total profits are &#x20AC;9.060 billion, excluding capital gains we have 8.111 billion, a figure that includes a net impact of ABN of &#x20AC;60 million. This figure of 60 million is made up of a profit figure of 2 million because of the profits from Banco Real and financing cost after taxes of 81 million, which is the cost of &#x20AC;13 billion we paid since acquisition to date.</p>
          <p>It does not include any profits from Antonveneta. Without the Real, we have earned 8,000 -- &#x20AC;0.51 million, 22% higher than in 2006. Or in other words, we have made 1.468 additional billions than in the previous year. Let me say that this growth exceeds the profits obtained by the third largest bank in Spain in the year 2007.</p>
          <p>How did we achieve this growth? Well, we have done it the same way as in other quarters with an excellent vertical quality of our income statement. Gross operating income was up by 21%, doubling the growth in costs. The soundness of revenues brings us to arrive at 32% in net operating income, which after provisions was 30%.</p>
          <p>Moreover, our zero exposure to subprime mortgages and our marginal presence in complex structured products means that we have not had any impact on earnings from these items. And I repeat this to make it -- crystal clear, zero impact on Santander's income statement. I would now briefly, look at the main lines always excluding ABN AMRO.</p>
          <p>The fundamental source of growth continues to be the different revenues, net interest income fees and insurance which together generated 85% of the total increase in revenues.</p>
          <p>The net interest income increased 24.2% the highest base of the year. Fees rose 15% and an insurance activity of 26%. This positive performance is due to a larger business volume accompanied by an improvement in customer spreads in most of the groups units and therefore in the totality of the sale.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, a rise in the number of customers and greater loyalty that we are obtaining in our businesses also gain from financial transactions also registered a strong rise partly because of the euro-dollar position on the euro-sterling which as you know acts as a hedge against the negative impact of the business areas of converting exchange rates to euros.</p>
          <p>Besides the excellent year-on-year growth, revenues are very consistent. This chart shows how the core revenues, the net interest income with the dividend plus fees plus the insurance activities increased quarter-after-quarter over the last three years. This performance is really the best reflection of the business rise of our units and the soundness and recurrence that we get from a high degree of geographic and business diversification.</p>
          <p>The third point that I would like to speak about as a basic lever of our results, is improvement in cost income ratio. For many years, we have been improving our cost income ratio by jointly managing revenues and costs. We ended the year 2006 and 2007 with costs of around 10% each point. As a result, we moved from our cost income ratio 53% in 2005 to 42% in 2007, improving by almost 9 points in three years.</p>
          <p>This figure, it is Santander, the bank that has improved the most in this period among its peer group, and we have been consistently getting ahead. And we will continue this trend of improvement in 2008, where I shall tell you that we have very demanding budget in terms of cost.</p>
          <p>The fourth point, which is key for P&amp;L account is provisions. On the left hand side, we see how the group's total loan-loss provisions made in 2007 rise 41%. If we eliminate the impact of the integration of drive which was not consolidated in 2006, the increase for the year was 24%. And this increase is consistent with the group's growth strategy in volumes and revenues and changing the mix of some units.</p>
          <p>As we see on the right hand side, the net operating income, net of provisions, brought by almost to 30%, almost inline with the increase of 32% in the gross operating income. So, nothing new about provisions as regards what we have been saying in the previous quarters and nothing new either in a more detailed analysis by business areas.</p>
          <p>The increase of specific provisions is likely due to two factors. The consolidation of drive which was not included in 2006 which accounted for two-thirds of the rise in Europe. And the increase in Latin America, mostly Brazil and Mexico, because of the greater activity they've had on the change of mix as well.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, all the increase was due to the greater volume of business from the change of mix, since the NPLs remain basically unchanged in both years. In Mexico, that a growth and mix effect was accentuated for the strong expansion in the credit card business, which has a deterioration in its NPL ratio, but Santander continues to be lower than that of our competitors. Nevertheless, in these last quarters, we have slowed down that growth going from an increase of 48% in 2006 to only an increase of 8% in 2007.</p>
          <p>The movement in generic provisions were also equal to those that we spoke about in the third quarter. The reduction due to lower needs in wholesale banking in contrast, with high ones in 2006. On the contrary, we have larger provisions in Brazil and in Chile.</p>
          <p>The fifth factor is a very strong balance sheet. In the last few years the international banking sector has been tempted to grow faster by assuming more financial market and credit risk than naturally, required by our relations with customers. We never entered into these dynamics.</p>
          <p>We know that during good times we need to have the strictest discipline in risks and this is what we've done. Therefore, in an uncertain environment like today's, the current one, our strong balance sheet gives us a big competitive advantage because of two things. First of all, our group has a low-to-medium risk profile and one that is predictable. Our portfolio is basically retail and very diversified, We have a high quality of our risks with NPLs which are very, very low and with high coverages and we have a very marginal position in complex structured products.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we manage the balance sheet very cautiously. This is reflected in our comfortable position of liquidity, high solvency with our core capital above 6% and a conservative managed coverage to preserve our capital base.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to go into further details on each of these aspects. As I said earlier, our risk profile is firstly backed by a lending portfolio that is essentially retail. 91% of it is generated by our retail networks and by consumer banking, compared to only 9% from wholesale banking.</p>
          <p>This has two implications: firstly, that our loans are generated by many small operations which means that risk is low and predictable. And second, our wholesale banking is not leveraged on financing large operations in order to attain its results.</p>
          <p>Our loans are also appropriately diversified by geographic area. Only 5% of loans are to non-investment grade countries. Europe accounts for 88% of the total and Spain and the UK are the only countries with significant shares in total lending.</p>
          <p>The next slide looks precisely at this point. More specifically, I am referring to Santander's mortgage activity in Spain and in the UK. In Spain, mortgages, which account for 28% of total loans are an instrument to link good customers. For example 96% of home mortgages are to finance first residence.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our traditional exigency in risks means our guaranties and customers are of high quality. The portfolios average loan to value in other words the credit as a percentage of the home's value is very comfortable 50%.</p>
          <p>So too is the average annual payment of our customers at their -- for their home as a percentage of household income which at 29% is lower than the average during the 1990 despite the rise in interest rates and in house prices. Moreover, for Spain, that rate is 36%, moreover loans to real estate developers converted into mortgages for new customers only represent 7% of total lending and show no problems of bad debt.</p>
          <p>The quality of our credit portfolio in Spain is reflected in the evolution of the NPL ratio of the Santander branch network and of Banesto. Their ratios have risen the least among their peer group.</p>
          <p>In the UK, Abbey's origin as a building society means that mortgages are its main business, 86% of total lending and they are of high quality as they are aimed as the most prime segment of the market. 99% of mortgages for homes are for the first residents. And the quality ratios of mortgages are also very good. The average loan to value of the portfolio is 46% and the income multiple, the value of the loan, to total income is 3.1 times.</p>
          <p>Lastly, social housing represents 5% of total lending. This refers to a regulated sector with a guarantee of various public administrations making social housing a business with virtually no NPLs. The high quality of credit or credit quality has consistently enabled Abbey since 2003 to have one of the best NPL ratios in the system. At the end of 2007, only 0.69% of loans were in arrears of more than three months compared to the latest figure for the market which is of 1.06%.</p>
          <p>The second aspect I would like to emphasize is that we also maintain notable high -- notable risk quality standards. The NPL ratio is 0.95%, certainly higher than in previous quarters. Coverage remains high at a 151%. These figures compare very well with international standards. The average of European banks included in our peer group is double in NPLs and has half of our coverage levels.</p>
          <p>A key element in coverage is a large volume of generic provisions 6.027 billion, which continue to increase during the year. And the third aspect that I would like to underline is the fact that we have very marginal exposure to complex structured products. We have no exposure to sub-prime mortgages. We have a low volume in structure derivative products and a very marginal exposure to other problem products. And even more important, as I said at the beginning of my presentation is that unlike in many other international banks, they have had no negative impact on our results.</p>
          <p>Liquidity, the first idea I'd like to convey is that we have a comfortable liquidity position. Given our retail banking nature, we have a structurally liquid balance sheet. In Latin America the deposits are larger than loans, therefore there no problems there. And convertible currencies, euro, sterling and dollar are deposits and capital finance 75% of lending. The rest is finance medium to long-term with a structure tailored to our needs.</p>
          <p>As well as, fiscal starting point, Santander has wide access to the liquidity markets. Our high ratings which enabled us to issue securities at the worst moment in 2007, because of our scant recourse to short-term financing which only represents 70% of the outstanding balance issued. And lastly by the Group's high discounting capacity in the European Central Bank, which means have been available around 30 billion. For only $0.03 we do not envisage liquidity tensions in coming quarters, which will enable us to meet the demand for loans by our customers as we have done so far.</p>
          <p>The second idea is that Santander is very solvent with core capital at target level of 6.25%. This is a basic aspect in today's climate of intensive territory capital by international banks hit the hardest by the loss of value of our assets. This high solvency comes from three sources. The strong generation of ordinary profits, active management of businesses in 2007 which combines big investments such as that of ABN AMRO, with significant disposals such as a sale of Antonveneta, Intesa Sanpaolo, and the pension fund management institutions in Latin America. Optimization of the balance sheet which produces more efficient use of available capital and whose best example was the sale and renting of premises in Spain which also generated a capital gain of 1.6 million -- billion, and a detail of these operations we will see on the next slide.</p>
          <p>As a result of these factors we were able to complete the acquisition of ABN AMRO assets without the need for the initial envisaged capital increase. Lastly, I would like to point out that as well as the already solid capital position, we have additional sources of capital such as unrealized capital gains and generic provisions, which could contribute more than 1 percentage point of core capital.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we have obtained &#x20AC;2,348 million in net capital gains from the sale of non-core business, excluding &#x20AC;605 million from the sales of Ciudad Santander last month. Of this figure, 1.398 billion was allocated to various provisions, Sovereign value adjustment of 737 million. For this adjustment we value the Sovereign stake according to the expected recurring profits.</p>
          <p>This adjustment has nothing to do with the write-down done by Sovereign in its balance sheet, almost all of which corresponds to the amortization of the goodwill of all the acquisitions. In consequence, none of these write-downs is a result of the US subprime prices.</p>
          <p>Early amortization of goodwill from the purchase of payrolls in Brazil. As you know it is a normal practice in this country to acquire the payrolls of public entities. Something we have done since the end of 2007, entering 2007. After the acquisition of Banco Real, we decided to stop this policy and make an early amortization. We also assigned &#x20AC;242 million to pensions and early retirements. After these applications, net capital gains recorded on the income statement were &#x20AC;950 million.</p>
          <p>And lastly, and in order to preserve the capital base, the group covers the book value of its subsidiaries abroad via structured options. Banco Real has already been incorporated and we have covered a 100% of the estimated book value and this coverage joins that also made by the group's other results of the subsidiaries in Latin America, the US and the UK.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to give the floor to our Chief Financial Officer, Jose Antonio Alvarez, who is going to talk about the different business areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As the CEO said, I am now going to look at the different business areas. And in order to have time for questions at the end, you will see that on this occasion my presentation is going to be shorter, although in the appendixes, you will find all the information that we usually give in all the business areas. And in any case, I am at your disposal during the Q&amp;A session where you can ask whatever clarifications you think you need on the business areas.</p>
          <p>And if I start by the main segments, the key elements to emphasize our issues &#x2013; there is a certain recurrency I have to say &#x2013; is the high horizontal quality or in other words all of the units are contributing to profit growth and diversification by geographic area and business.  Of course the transfer there as you get in dollars or euros but when we take a look at the financial management you will see that there is a clear correlation with the profits we obtained. And therefore all the areas in their currency management are growing at more than 20%. And then we have a high level of diversification in our businesses.</p>
          <p>So we can generate recurring businesses.  We have nine units which are generating more than 500 million in net profits a year. So, strong growth plus diversification, I think give us a very good, very good possibilities to generate value and profit. If we take a look first of all at Continental Europe, I would like to express the series of ideas in 2007 we have been working basically on individual customers.</p>
          <p>We are still working on the idea to lock in our clients focusing on return rather than volume. The environment has changed. In 2007 there has been less growth in the mortgage business and stronger growth in personal banking SMEs and corporate banking.</p>
          <p>We have made strong investments. We will take a look at this when we look at the cost. The cost of the global businesses have grown more, because we're focusing on all these businesses. And in terms of earnings, actually our profits are growing at 27%, although I wanted to mention the evolution of the net operating income. As you can see, it looks like its not growing very much, the net operating income in retail banking. But that doesn't reflect underlying trends, because there's several things there.</p>
          <p>The increase in cost in Santander's consumer finance because of some start-ups that we began in Santander in Russia. Apart from the seasonal profile in Portugal and in fact on the revenue of the Santander branch network of the placement of convertible bonds. That has not represented in our accounts and therefore this is penalizing the generation of results of network in Spain.</p>
          <p>The global businesses, you can see that from previous years' figures, there is more volatility there. After an exceptionally good first quarter, it has become weaker during the rest of the year. And this is why the net operating income is what you see there on screen.</p>
          <p>If now we talk about the main units of Continental Europe we see a lot of soundness in our units. All units-- all retail units have double-digit growth in revenues. All of this causes to bring this growth to around 20% or more in net operating income in Banesto. We have proved these results that we don't have this year; all of them grew more than 20%.</p>
          <p>In consumer finance, it is true that the parameter has changed because of the inclusion of Drive. Without Drive, profits would grow at 8%. Consumer is the area that has suffered the most in margin because of an increase in interest rate. I will talk more about this later on. And Portugal, again grew by more than 20%.</p>
          <p>In total global businesses, the main component is global wholesale banking, where profits are growing strongly. Costs have grown. I already mentioned that we have been developing global project and we have reduced our loan loss provisions. We will take a look at this in further detail.</p>
          <p>Now there's been a strong growth of generic provisions because of some specific transactions and we already signed the first quarters of the year that was decreasing and therefore this is why we see a strong growth of achievable profits opposite to what had been last year. If we focus now on the different units the Santander branch network had an excellent year in terms of spreads. Our spread has gone up by 53 basis points this year. I think this is one of the best in the industry. And the net interest income has grown 22%. We've grown quite well although there's been a displacement of the business from the mortgage business that group could have <mark type="inaudible" /> in corporate banking that is growing 18% and in terms of provisions the cost of credit is still very low 0.09% in the year.</p>
          <p>And Banesto it already presented its earnings. It has met its objectives. You know that they have public objectives in terms of market share return on equity efficiency and NPL ratio. They have a very good profile in terms of growth very low NPL ratio, 0.47% is by how much its grown and it has done better than its peers and is soluble. Santander consumer finance, I mentioned before that there was a change in the parameter. In Europe there has been an impact of interest rates and slowdown in spread when interest rates go up in this business. That has an impact that is noticed six or twelve months after. Here we also have higher cost because of start-ups. In the UK, France, Russia etcetera we have a series of operations are just starting that still are not bringing any revenue. Drive exceeds forecast in revenues and profits. The NPL ratio remains stable. And in a more complex American context, we are able to allow the FICO, the rating in the US, as it takes time that we improve the spread. So we feel reasonably comfortable given the evolution of Drive.</p>
          <p>In Portugal, the environment is still extremely competitive. There is strong competition. The spreads have been falling but now they seem to be stabilizing. We do believe that this will improve the spreads. If we look at the figures in the balance sheet, we haven't grown our balance sheet because of falls in assets and liabilities which should combine very well with the increase in revenue. The fall in volume is in companies -- in large companies, large corporations where margins are very small. There are excellent results from Portugal that gives us a figure of 20%.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the UK now, I would say that Abbey is very consistent in generation of results. It hustles, so met with expectations in a more complicated environment. The personal services, is not growing as much but we have grown up 7% with lower fees and a net interest income of 11%. So, we are very satisfied of the present growth of the revenues in Abbey from personal financial services and others.</p>
          <p>Besides that, some quite important for Abbey where we've finished the first three year plan. We have rolled out Parten&#xF3;n and we are launching new products, investment firms and that. We have launched project to cooperate and develop private banking, wholesale banking and also the card business that has grown quite well.</p>
          <p>If we focus on revenue performance, we see that there are three drivers. The net interest income has worked very well because of higher spread. We have 14 basis points and a combination of narrowing in mortgages 8 basis points and I said that because the spread in mortgages in the UK has improved gradually. In the second part of the year we have spreads of 50 or 60 basis points in a higher spread than those we had a year ago. So this a trend that will change and will be more effective as the market continues in 2009. In personal loans, we have increased by 90 basis points and deposit 12 basis points. So that has led to improving this. We have 14 basis points and growth in volumes that are more modest but we have an 11% growth in net interest revenues and we have all this. In terms of provisions there's not very many new. The quality of our portfolio is pretty high, I'm speaking about mortgages. And in personal loans we've fallen by 54%. That's a reduction of 34% in the portfolio so we have no concerns in that.</p>
          <p>For Latin America, I would say that the growth figures are very high. The main areas in management have been the same as for the retail business in Europe, getting more customers, locking them in, although commercial franchises are very high in Latin America. We've opened up 300 branches, more than 1000 ATMs and 1600 new points in call centers. And the growth of the business is derived from that we see that in retail banking, we see that the evolution of the net operating income down below is very favorable. We had one of 1.2, $1.3 million and in the fourth quarter, we closed to $1.9 billion. So, the underlying trends are very good, and revenues grow by 40% more or less. And after provisions, we will move to profit a growth of 27% in the managed currency which is the dollar. Per country, just as we said in Europe, they'll grow about 10%, here they'll grow above 20%.</p>
          <p>Sales increased the difference between revenues and costs, Brazil and Mexico are growing in profits above 30%. Chile by over 20%, practically 30 before minority interest and the rest of the countries do it by 16%. Argentina and Venezuela are growing quite well but we have the restructuring in Puerto Rico and some other operations in Colombia that distort the basis.</p>
          <p>Private banking. This is a business which is also growing close to 30%. Now for countries, Brazil, we have strong growth of business of 30%, the risk premium and that was mentioned by the CEO is stable.</p>
          <p>If we look at the quarter-by-quarter, there are some situations that are located between 3.6, 3.7, 4% and we have been 6 or 7% with the risk premium has been at that situation. In Mexico, a large volumes there is a change in the NPL for cards that was mentioned before. So, the risk premium, for the entire brand goes from 1.2 to 3%, and that of cards, mostly around 5 to 12%. That's below the market. But there has been a strong increase of NPLs in cards. It's the only significant change in the behavior of credit that we have in the region in Chile.</p>
          <p>For many years, we've increased a lot more in the minority areas and revenues are going well. The strong increase in provisions. But, after three years of growth of the retail area, over 20-25%, and the wholesale area at a one digit growth. This is the tendency we were expecting because of the nature of the credit portfolio that have been generated in the past years.</p>
          <p>And finally, in financial management, let me say something about the results of the FX coverage of results. We have a significant increase in return on volume and the exchange rate is at 80 -- 85% or 15-20. It is the coverage of the area that has been at 4 -- $4.2 billion and these are the results. This is a greatest change that takes place here besides higher cost because of some global projects sponsorships and draw downs, but mostly the main change comes from the results of effects foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>If we look at this transparently, the secondary segments, a very few changes here in the previous quarter. We have to say that retail banking continues to represent 80% if we take into account insurance and assets, we have 80, 85% of the operating areas profit. It represents 16% when we speak about wholesale banking. Both grow very strongly and asset management and insurance as we will see because of the investments in Spain are growing slowly. The total area of growth is 26%.</p>
          <p>If we see that in retail banking, it is based on profits and net operating income is growing over 20%. In wholesale banking now, after a second part of the year which was very, very complex, pre-tax profit was 28% and 78 of total gross operating income comes from customers. The lower need for provisions in 2006 as compared to the previous year brings up the rise in profit before taxes.</p>
          <p>And the asset management and insurance which accounts for 4% of the group's profit before taxes has been quite homogenous, and it has been affected by the no growth of the investment funds in Spain.</p>
          <p>In wholesale banking now, I will concentrate on two -- the two most relevant aspects, the growth of revenue 13%, which has two different aspects. Both have come from customer treasury grow by 24% with an increase in investment bank, 66%. And I'd like to point to the increasingly accelerated growth of global transaction banking that is growing at 16% and it has accelerated its growth quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>The second network aspect or noteworthy aspect is provisions, which we have quarterly growth in the last quarter there was a provision for generic for 100 million and in the previous ones there was a free up or no provisions when some of the provisions will clear that from the previous year. This joint effect makes that to need to have fall of 84% in generic provisions, although the distribution of 52 million in 2007 is not homogeneous, we have figured that as negative in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Finally, asset management and insurance, I talked about the investment funds, the insurance area is growing at 22% and in Latin America we are growing at a pace of 50 some percent and I will give this call to the CEO who will give us the conclusions on the prospects for 2008.</p>

          <p>Marco Carraro from Standard &amp; Poor's has several questions. One of them is already answered, which was the consolidation of Banco Real. On ABN, what is the strategy with regards to Societe General? And what about Peru, can you tell us a bit about the M&amp;A strategy in Peru perhaps?  What about Basel II, how's that that going to effect your core capital and do you see any risk in completing the Antonveneta operation with a Monte dei Paschi di Siena and if there are any penalization clauses in case Paschi decides to take a step back.&gt;&gt;</p>

          <p>The contribution of RSS to the income statement, could you clarify this using the equity method? The trading question has already been answered, but in regard to the Santander Network, what about the evolution in fees and commissions? It seems a bit weak. Why is that? And what is the estimate of your cost of risk for 2008?  Provisions for loan losses in the fourth quarter increased quite a lot? Has there been any extraordinary operation and if not why is that? And what cost performance can we expect in the three most important Latin American countries?&gt;&gt;</p>

What is the rationale for the calculation of the write-down of Sovereign? The 737 million, is that after-taxes? We already said that, yes. Have you also included 25% of Sovereign losses when you use the equity method for the corporate centre, that would be my first question on Sovereign. Sorry, Antonio, would you like to answer that question before you go on with other questions?&gt;&gt;</p>

          <p>There're two questions that we could answer directly. In Brazil, minus 126 million would be the influence of that and the growth of personnel cost which is very strong in the fourth quarter in Brazil. I think these are details that could be answered later.&gt;&gt;</p>

          <p>Two questions have been answered. The impact from capital of goodwill of the ABN AMRO is included in 625 capital and the details on fees in Santander. The one through the Internet would relate to Abbey. Have we &#x2013; now there's a crunch in the loan book and the process for the quarter.  Is that due to the lesser number of personal loans or is it because of the mortgage situation?&gt;&gt;</p>

          <p>In answer to your first question that of consolidation. In effect asw we said before, we consider that we will have absolute control and therefore will globally integrate Brazil from September on more or less at that time. Although we won't be able to do it in the global accounts of the group for comparative effects.  We will include the P&amp;L of Brazil, of course, although I don't think we can include it in the global accounts.&gt;&gt;</p>
