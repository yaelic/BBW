          <p>Thank you very much, Andrew, and thank you everyone again for joining us for the fourth quarter 2007 Southern Copper earnings conference call. As you know, the Southern Copper Board recently appointed Mr. Genaro Guerrero as Chief Financial Officer of the company. Before I leave you with him, let me give you some background information on Mr. Guerrero. Genaro Guerrero is an industrial engineer that joined what today is Minera Mexico in 1983. During his long career with our corporation, he has served in several positions in the finance area of Grupo Mexico and Southern Copper, among them Minera Mexico's Treasurer and CFO of ASARCO. Before being appointed as new CFO of SCC, he held a financial role in Southern Peru Limited, a subsidiary of Southern Copper. Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, our CEO, will also participate in today's conference call.</p>
          <p>I will leave you with Genaro Guerrero.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Raul and hello, good morning everyone. I'm very glad to participate for the first time in this conference call and the agenda that we are going to talk -- I'll try to cover today is including prices, reductions and sales volumes, then we are going to review some of our financial results, capital expenditures, and then after that, we are going to open a session or a forum for questions.</p>
          <p>Before we go into the details on the fourth quarter of 2007 and the year of 2007, I will like to mention that Southern announced today, this morning, our share purchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $3 million of corporations common stock. The share purchase will take place from time to time based on the market conditions and some other factors that have to be analyzed in its opportunity. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash.</p>
          <p>Now after that, let's focus now on the fourth quarter '07 and the last year's performance. But before that, I would like to say that even though the last quarter results have been affected by the legal -- by the illegal strike in Cananea, the earnings for the year of 2007 has a percent a record high for Southern Copper Corporation. This has been a consequence of a very good average metal prices and especially in two of our main products that are copper and molybdenum.  And also we have got a very nice increase on molybdenum production and of course in the sales of that metal.</p>
          <p>But we'd like to start first with copper prices. The LME fourth quarter of 2007 average copper price was $3.26 per pound. That represents 2% higher than the same quarter of 2006. The average price for the full year of 2007 was $3.23 per pound, 6% higher than the $3.05 per pound in 2006.</p>
          <p>The 2007 copper market was characterized by a strong demand and a weak supply response. The U.S. housing downturn impacted global demand by about 1% and at the same time the emerging economies growth on the world copper demand of course led by China increased it by 5% in 2007.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we think that the strong demand of emerging economies will overcome any weakness of volatility coming from the developed economies. On the supply side, new projects and expansions that would contribute with more copper would be somehow offset by lower production from existing operations as well as delays on capital goods deliveries, technical and labor problems at the operations.</p>
          <p>The full year 2007 copper production was 1,306 million pounds, only 2% lower than 2006. The fourth quarter mine copper production was 278 million pounds. This production was 30% below the 396 million pounds of copper produced during the fourth quarter of 2006. The reduction of 118 million pounds in production quarter-to-quarter was mainly as a consequence of Cananea's illegal stoppage and a lower ore grade of Toquepala mine in Peru.</p>
          <p>Since I have now mentioned the illegal stoppage in Cananea, let me update on where we are in this -- in the situation of this facility. On January 11 as probably you know the Mexican Labor Ministry through its Federal Arbitration and Reconciliation Council declared the strike illegal and asked the workers to be back at their jobs within 24 hours. The return to regular production will be gradual due to the rehabilitation of the installations. At this time one of our SX/EW plants in Cananea is back to work and we are expecting the second one to be producing in the next following weeks. Considering our expected ramping up of operations, Cananea copper production will be around 300 million pounds in 2008. That represents 38% higher than the 217 million pounds produced during 2007.</p>
          <p>Now in respect to the 2008 copper production plan, Southern Copper Corporation is expecting to produce 1.4 billion pounds of copper. Smelting and refining operations in terms of copper production, the Peruvian Ilo smelter has reached fuel capacity during the fourth quarter after its modernization. Given this smelter modernization and environmentally driven project &#x2013; I am very enthusiastic to report to the market that the average sulfur capture of the smelter was 95% in 2007, higher than the 92% required by Peruvian environmental regulations.</p>
          <p>Smelting and refining production was lower by 32% and 37% respectively for the fourth quarter 2007 compared to the fourth quarter 2006. The production plan for 2008 is 1.2 billion pounds for the smelter production and around 1.2 billion pounds for refined copper production. This is including the SX/EW production.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about the copper sales. For the fourth quarter 2007, 293 million pounds were sold, 28% lower than the 404 million pounds sold in the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Shifting to the molybdenum, the molybdenum prices were $32.1 per pound for the fourth quarter 2007, 28% higher than the same quarter in 2006. For the full year, the average price was $29.9 per pound, 22% higher than 2006. For the full year, molybdenum production increased 37% from 26 million pounds to 36 million pounds. During fourth quarter '07, molybdenum production increases 15% growing from 8.2 million pounds to 9.4 million pounds. This proportion increases with the result of higher upgrades in the Toquepala, Cuajone and Caridad mines. Due to such production increase, fourth quarter molybdenum sales volume increased from 8.7 to 9.7 million pounds, 11% positive variance and a 40% positive variance for the full year compared with 2006. The better molybdenum prices combined with the production increases contributed significantly to Southern Copper Corporation profitability in the fourth quarter and in 2007. Southern is expecting to produce 33 million pounds of molybdenum for 2008 year.</p>
          <p>Well that has been a relation of prices, production and sales volumes, and now I would like to comment some of our financial results.</p>
          <p>The sales for the year of 2007 increased to a record of $6.1 billion from $5.5 billion. This is basically the result of a higher average copper and molybdenum and silver prices, and higher molybdenum volumes as we have mentioned. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreases 355 million when compared to the fourth quarter '06. The decrease in net sales was the result of lower volumes sold of copper, zinc and silver. The lower volume sales were partially offset by higher molybdenum and silver prices and higher molybdenum sales volume.</p>
          <p>Copper prices protection swaps during the year has been included in net sales. These swaps were favorable for around $8 million during the quarter, during the last quarter, and for the full year $11 million.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about cost, total operating costs for fourth quarter '07 was 664 million compared to 682 million in the same period of 2006. Cost of sales at the Mexican units decreased by 71 million due to the strike. Workers' participation and mining royalties also decreased the cost by $23 million during the period. But in the other hand, $37 million of higher cost was recorded from our Peruvian operations due to a higher labor, a higher fuel and power costs. An increase in third parties concentrate purchase explained the remaining difference of the $48 million reduction in Southern Copper Corporation cost of sales.</p>
          <p>Now going a little bit down in the P&amp;L, our administrative expenses increased $9 million. This is basically due as a result of adjustments in the retirement plan for Mexico and the appreciation of the Peru currency in respect to the dollar and some increasing consulting fees. The depreciation $11 million more due to the capitalization of the Ilo smelter modernization project and higher amortization of Leach material cost.</p>
          <p>In relation with exploration, 10 million higher after including the cost of Tia Maria feasibility studies and Los Chancas feasibility study, both of them finish during the last quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Now talking about EBITDA, for the full year 2007, EBITDA increased by $448 million, 3,765 million equivalent of 62% of sales compared to an EBITDA of $3,360 million in 2006. Year-over-year net sales decreases by 22% and operating costs and expenses by 3% yielding an operating income reduction of 35%. The company's operating income amounted to 630 million in the quarter, which compares unfavorably with last year's fourth quarter operating income of $968 million. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $712 million, 30% lower than last year's fourth quarter EBITDA of $1,020 million. The EBITDA margin was 55% of sales lower than the 62% of sales registered in 2006.</p>
          <p>Now the net income for the year of 2007 was $2.2 billion, 9% higher than the 2 billion dollars achieved in 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 net income decreases $311 million from $655 million year-over-year, a 52% reduction. Earnings per share amounted to $1.06 per fully diluted shares compared to $2.23 for fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter a non-cash charge to income tax of $90 million was recorded to recognize the effect on taxes of Minera Mexico's dividends paid to Southern Copper Corporation during 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, our capital expenditures. The capital expenditures including exploration expense amounted $82 million during the fourth quarter of 2007, a year-over-year decrease when compared to the 131 million extended in the fourth quarter of 2006. The difference comes from the completion of the Ilo smelter modernization and that happens in January 2007. The company has an investment program that will increase total copper production in about 270,000 tons by 2011. The 39% increase in production will be achieved at a capital cost of $2,108 million. As has been informed to the market, the program is focusing on a group of projects based in Peru and let me inform you on new developments regarding these projects.</p>
          <p>The first one is Tia Maria project. This project is located in the Arequipa region. The total resource is 638 million tons of mineral with an average copper ore grade of 0.39%. And when finished, this project at the end of 2010 will produce 120,000 tons of copper per year and for the next 19 years. The company is quickly building the dry and wet areas of the project and the 2008 budget for the project is $65 million.</p>
          <p>On the expansion, for the Toquepala and Cuajone mines, as well as the Ilo metallurgical facilities, the company has started the process for contracting feasibility and environmental impact of studies. The result of these studies are expected to be ready at the end of 2008. The total budget of these studies for the year of 2008 is around $36 million.</p>
          <p>For 2008 the company capital expenditure south of rise amount is $530 million. Out of those 100 million will go to the Peruvian expansions that we already mentioned, and around $150 million will be for maintenance capital in Peru and Mexico, and the remaining will be used for several projects that will improve of course our Southern Copper Corporation's productivity.</p>
          <p>Now talking about payment of dividends, the policy of the company is to review through each of the Board meetings the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Then accordingly the company declares a quarterly dividend of $1.40 per common shares to be paid on February 29, 2008 to common shareholders of record at the close of business of February 12, 2008.</p>
          <p>Well that is basically what I have to report through this conference call. And then I will like to open the forum for questions. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Mr. Oscar Cabrera. Go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Couple of questions please. On the first one, can you tell us what your expectations for zinc and silver production are for 2008 as well as lead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar, how are you doing? This is Genaro. And well in respect to zinc, our guidance for 2008 zinc production is 300 million pounds of production for the year. You have zinc -- for silver it should be around the same that we have been producing in 2007 depending on when the company solves the problem for the unit that's on strike, that number will go up obviously. Lead, we will maintain our current production trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now this is where the question was going. There has been reports that perhaps a couple of the mines in Mexico will be closed. Do you foresee any closures on your mines on the same lead side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes the 600 million pounds of zinc already are including the decision of --on the closing or the stop of operations in Tasco. The company has decided to stop that mine. The company is going to continue exploring the mine and continue having it but at this time the decision is to stop operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Genaro. And then secondly on your CapEx expenditures, you have a budget of $2.1 billion over the next five years, $530 million in 2008. How do you foresee the expenditures happening in 2009 like I mean is that is that going to be a $1.5 billion year in terms of expenditures because how can you get Tia Maria to operate in 2010 if you don't have that kind of expenditure before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand your question, Oscar, and yeah, there is a very intensive capital expenditure program for the following, follow four years. This year well as we mentioned, we are going to expand the 530-- that is including of course maintenance and other projects. And for 2009, we are expecting to expand $950 million in projects plus maintenance. For 2010, we are expecting to invest $965 million plus maintenance, and for 2011, at the end of our projects, this number is going to decrease to $127 million plus the maintenance of the year. The maintenance of the year is usually around $150 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow-up on that if I can. What do you think then your dividend policy will -- do you foresee that changing in 2009 and 2010 for your capital expenditures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. We are continuing as I have mentioned reviewing with the Board of Directors in respect to our cash availability and so what is going to be the dividends clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks very much. And I would like to hear you as-- Looking forward to catching up at some point, and I'll let the next guy ask questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Oscar.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Jordi Dominguez. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. My first question comes along the lines of the income tax. We saw the income tax rate, they rise by a couple of points in 2006 versus 2007. Is it because of differentials in Peruvian tax versus Mexican tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jordi, well, I suppose that your question is to that if we can--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Revert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, reverted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think not reverted, but go back to the percentages of tax rate that you had 2006 or do we expect 34-35% levels in 2008 going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, we can go back to those levels of income taxes or income tax rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what levels should we expect in 2008 and going forward-31, 32% or closer to 35?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me -- I am going to use your question in order to explain a little bit what happened with this income tax amount that we recorded in the fourth quarter. And this of course is a charge to income tax, it's a non-cash item and was recorded to recognize the effects on taxes for Minera Mexico dividend state to Southern Copper, its parent company. More specifically these facts deferred recognition on the P&amp;L, the rise from the difference between the effective tax rate in Mexico and the effective tax rate in U.S. applied the difference over the portion of the dividend state from the Mexican subsidiary, that is Minera Mexico, to its parent company or to its parent, to the U.S. parent that is Southern Copper Corporation. Again, this recognition is a non-cash charge and correspond to the portion of dividends paid by Minera Mexico during 2007. This actually is a catch-up for the whole year. Then for the future, well that is -- I would say that that is going to depend on the calculation of the effective tax rate in Mexico versus the effective tax rate in U.S. and of course that will be affected by several tax credits and our tax plan for the following years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for the -- thank you for your explanation. And one last question if I may ask. You mentioned the mining production level for 2008 that you guys expect. Do you guys expect a recovery in the smelting and refining production for 2008 as well to 2006 levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are expecting to recover that and we are expecting to improve it a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give a little color on the levels that we see-- we expect 1.3 billion pounds for its smelting and refining more or less along those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah, I mentioned 1.2 billion pounds for the smelting and refining for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Salud.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Veb from Nomura. Just have a question on the cost front. I would like to know what was the cash cost per pound in the fourth quarter of 2007 and for the full-year 2007 and how do you expect this cash cost going forward in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Veb. The company cash cost per pound produced in the fourth quarter-- and this is before subtracting by product's revenues was $1.57 per pound. This is higher $0.47 than the $1.10 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2006. This increase is mainly due to the copper production reduction that represents around $0.44. Cash cost inflation explains the remaining difference -- we got a little bit higher costs. Including the effect on by-products revenues, the company cash cost was negative $0.27 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2007. These figures compares with a negative cash cost of $0.28 per pound for the same period of 2006. Now for the full year of 2007, cash cost before by-products credits was $1.36 per pound. These compared to the $1.28 per pound for 2006, an $0.08 increase year to year. The company estimation for the full cash cost for the year of 2008 is around $1.33 per pound.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Stephanie Leacha speaking for Harry Matria I have a quick question regarding-- I know you outlined the CapEx distribution based on the 2.1 growth investment -- 2.1 billion growth investment. I was curious to know is there any possibility that you guys could come to market to finance some of that or would you just continue to manage your dividends?</p>

          <p>No I think that there is a very sound possibility to go to the market and try to get financed for those projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any kind of timing with doing that? Can you by any chance give the CapEx distribution again? I think I missed it earlier.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Jorge Rodriguez. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is regarding the ore grades at Toquepala. Do you have the actual figure of the decline in ore grades and is this something that may linger on for the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Let me check if -- Mr. Gonzalez Rocha, are you in the line? Yes, probably we missed him. Then I'll pass this question to Raul Jacob, who has some information in relation with that. Go ahead Raul, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Genaro. In 2006 the company declared new reserves for the Toquepala mine. As a consequence of this review in the reserve base of this operation, we also adjust the long-term ore grade of the Toquepala operation. That year in 2007 the average ore grade for Toquepala was 0.74% for copper. For the year 2008, our current production plan indicates that we will have an ore grade of 0.62% for the Toquepala mine. So that will affect our production of copper in concentrates coming from this operation. But at the same time we will have some more copper coming from Cuajone that will improve or basically set off somehow the loss in production at Toquepala.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Rodrigo Heredia. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is, what is your copper and molybdenum sales forecasts for the 2008? And second one is, what do you think about this recent change in the union position here in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Rodrigo. Let's try to cover first your first question. In terms of sales of copper, well we can consider that our sales are going to be &#x2013; our production for -- the production estimate that I gave you for 2008. That was 300 &#x2013; hold on &#x2013; that was 1.4 billion pounds of copper. And for molybdenum, 33 million pounds of molybdenum. Can you repeat your second question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what do you think about this recent change in the union position here in Mexico regarding the meeting that was yesterday between the union and the governmental agency here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodrigo, about these questions, let me pass the question to our counsel in Southern Copper Corporation. This is Mr. Armando Ortega who is going to take care of your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I think we are simply hearing and reading what the union declared yesterday. We are not sure whether the union has a different position or not. Unfortunately that union is untrustworthy and I think we wait and see. I don't think at this juncture we have any more elements to have an opinion, an educated opinion as to where these gentlemen are leading or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Armando.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we don't have any other questions, thank you very much for your attention and for joining us in this conference call. Is there any other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Dan Richman. Go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I noticed on your December 31st balance sheet, a new category of current asset called "Investments" with a balance of almost $118 million. Could you tell us what this is and perhaps it's related to my next question. I noticed under other non-current other liabilities, they increased 58.9 million in the fourth quarter. Could you tell me what the major elements of this increase in other liabilities is and which balance sheet or expense accounts that charge for the debit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Dan, in relation to the first question, this has been separated from the cash and marketable -- could you repeat because this is a series of investments in different papers that with different maturities that are not cash and marketable and that's the reason that we have separated that from the dollar. It's $117 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the increase in other non-current liabilities of 58 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in that respect, I don't have the breakdown at this moment in front of me and at the top of my head. I know that there are, those are reclassifications, but well if you are interested on the detail of that, we can provide you the breakdown, well later on during the day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That was in my e-mail to you yesterday.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We know them. And we have your e-mail. And then we will prepare our report and we will send that to you.</p>
