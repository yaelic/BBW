          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to our First Quarter Telephone Conference of BMW AG in 2010. With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management, and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Reithofer will give you all an update on the business performance during the first quarter, and Dr. Eichiner will then take you through our financial results for the first quarter of this year. Afterwards, we will have time for a Q&amp;A session. Mr. Reithofer, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The BMW Group with its three strong brands stands for premium. It is through our innovative strength that we will continue to push forward into new segments and tap new customer groups. With strategy Number ONE, we set the perfect foundation to achieve sustainable and profitable growth. Today, we see that our strategy is paying off and that the individual activities are taking effect, and we are confident that we will meet our 2012 growth targets and our vision for 2020.</p>
          <p>The business performance in the first quarter of 2010 was positive. We have achieved positive pre-tax results of &#x20AC;508 million. this results in a net profit of &#x20AC;324 million, and the EBIT in the Automobiles segment is positive at &#x20AC;291 million.</p>
          <p>We managed to increase sales significantly in the first three months of this year, and we remain confident that we will reach our 2010 target. We plan to achieve sales growth at the Group level in the solid &#x2013; I would like to say &#x2013; in the solid one-digit percentage range to over 1.3 million cars.</p>
          <p>In the Automobiles segment, we plan to post an EBIT margin in the lower one-digit percentage range. And finally, we expect the Group result significantly above the 2009 level.</p>
          <p>This positive development in the first quarter demonstrates that our efforts and the optimizations introduced in all areas of the company are paying off. The reduction of our cost of retail will remain a top priority for us. But I have to say, we are on the right track here as well. We will build upon the momentum from the economic recovery with the launch of our new models and our customers will be able to choose from a highly attractive product portfolio, offering a variety of possibilities for sheer driving pleasure with regard to both technology and design, after all design is the number one reason people buy cars and this is not going to change.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is fair to say everything has been in line with our plan. We have approached the economic crisis as an opportunity to improve and have became a stronger and leaner company for it. At the same time, we are starting a new chapter of strategy Number ONE. How do we position ourselves for a successful future?</p>
          <p>For this, we are breaking new ground and building some necessary foundation. Here are just three examples of our efforts. First, tapping into new sales channels; second, zero emission e-mobility; and third, a sustainable production of future mobility concept.</p>
          <p>On to first point, this aspect deals with new growth potential and includes the business opportunity of selling engines through third parties. We entered into an exclusive partnership with Carbon Motors Corporation in the United States. This deal includes our commitment to deliver over 240,000 high-efficiency diesel engines with BMW Advanced Diesel technology, to be used in U.S. law enforcement cars from 2013 to 2019.</p>
          <p>Regarding the second point, our ideas about future mobility primarily focus on electric power. Our global field test with the MINI E has been a great success; I have really to say has been a great success. In fact, a passionate international MINI E community has already developed.</p>
          <p>Just see for yourselves what our customer Tom Moloughney from New Jersey has written in his blog. So far he has covered more than 25,000 miles, or 40,000 kilometers, with his MINI E, and this is only the beginning. As early as this year, we will launch a new fleet of MINI E cars in other countries, including France and China. And next year, we will add an e-mobility test with the BMW brand.</p>
          <p>The BMW ActiveE will take the idea of practical everyday use even further. The test fleet will be launched in several countries, among them China. Just a week ago we signed a cooperation agreement with the Chinese government and local energy suppliers. Another project in the pipeline for China is the launch of a so-called New Energy Vehicle. This is to be developed and produced locally together with our joint venture partner, Brilliance. Because mobility of this kind exists without borders, we need global standards.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we need to define the rules for a single e-mobility market. This is the crucial first step before we can responsibly allocate the resources needed to manufacture these technologies on a production scale. Key regulatory issues in this field are, technological requirement on vehicle and infrastructure, the responsibility in the value chain regarding the environmental impact, and the classification of different drive concepts. All these points have been raised in our meeting with the German Chancellor on Monday.</p>
          <p>The fact is the BMW Group is determined to continue to drive the development of e-mobility with its breakthrough innovations. The development of new drive systems is part of efficient dynamics and consists of the full range of cars, from fuel-efficient combustion engines to hybrid drives and plug-in hybrids, as well as our Megacity Vehicle. The Megacity Vehicle will be our first series-produced e-car. It will be launched in 2013 as a BMW sub-brand.</p>
          <p>And finally my third point. In April, we announced in Seattle that we would build a joint venture carbon fiber plant with an investment volume of &#x20AC;100 million for the first stage. Carbon fiber reinforced materials will play an important role in the serious production of our Megacity Vehicle and other vehicle concepts.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that future mobility concepts also need to be sustainable produced, the BMW Group is creating a whole new meaning of sustainable production. Now, others are following our lead in this area.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this year BMW was given the distinction of being named the most valued automotive brand in the world by Millward Brown, a market research group. While we are, of course, delighted to receive this distinction it serves as another source of motivation for all of us as a company to continue accomplishing even greater things.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we are taking a major step towards reaching our profitability targets laid out for the year 2012 in strategy Number ONE. Our current products, concept cars and our groundbreaking innovations continue to define the true meaning of premium for the global auto industry.</p>
          <p>I look now forward to your questions later. Thank you for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. The BMW Group grew its earnings significantly in the first quarter of 2010. We strengthened our profitability even further. In addition, we continued to implement our efficiency measures. This will remain a priority for us going forward. We generated &#x20AC;12.4 billion in Group revenues and a robust profit before tax of &#x20AC;508 million in the first quarter. This clearly shows that we took advantage of the global recession to optimize our cost structures.</p>
          <p>Once again, our company has returned to improving the bottom line. Our goal is and will remain to achieve profitable, sustainable growth. The key performance indicators defined by strategy Number ONE continue to guide us.</p>
          <p>The Automotives segment posted an EBIT of &#x20AC;291 million. This segment more than tripled its EBIT compared to the last quarter of 2009. This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 2.7%. One of the main drivers of this result are the rise in market demand. We sold more vehicles compared to last year's first quarter in nearly every European country, in Americas and in Asia.</p>
          <p>The share of vehicles sold in China rose from 9.2% in the last quarter of 2009 to 12.2. We did not expect to see this dynamic development so soon after the recession. Moving forward, we expect the benefit from the rise in demand thanks to our new models.</p>
          <p>In a continuing effort to raise profitability, we took measures to increase margins. We managed market supply according to demand and reallocated vehicles. This enabled a reduction in sales incentives and better margins. Our new and attractive models supported this. Incentive levels already started to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009. This trend continued in the first quarter of 2010. We recorded another improvement here, despite the phase out of the 5 Series Sedan.</p>
          <p>Inventories in the first quarter rose due to the higher production. There are two reasons for this; strong sales growth in China and the launch of the 5 Series Sedan in Europe at the end of March. A longer transport times for vehicles to the emerging markets, particularly very for those being sent to Asia, result in an increase in the number of vehicles in transit.</p>
          <p>These vehicles are accounted for at production cost. The related expenses are not booked until the corresponding revenues are recognized. The lead time effect is also responsible for the rise in working capital in first quarter. This rise was a primary reason for the decline in our free cash flow in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;9.7 billion, our liquidity remained high in the first quarter as well. We will keep our liquidity close to &#x20AC;9 billion for the time being. This will enable us to deal with any unforeseen volatilities arising on the capital markets. As planned, will probably fund most of the pension obligations remaining in Germany in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services segment generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;222 million in the first quarter. This segment, therefore, tripled the profit before tax achieved in the same quarter last year. The main drivers were significant margin growth in new businesses, an improvement in refinancing conditions, as well as a more stable risk situation. Please refer to our interim report for further key figures in our various segments.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is off to a stronger start into the new financial year. Efficiency improvements achieved thus far and new attractive models has given us an added tailwind. We will continue to improve our margins, including scaling back the incentives offered as a result of the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>Sales of a new 5 Series Sedan will have a positive effect on earnings in second quarter. We anticipate that the world economy will continue to recover in second quarter. We will benefit from rising demand for premium vehicles in both established and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We expect earnings to continue improving in the quarter underway. We are confident about achieving the goals we have announced for 2010. Moreover, we are convinced that we will make visible progress in hitting our profitability targets for 2012.</p>
          <p>Certain risks still exist in the financial markets. Although the pace of the global economic recovery is uncertain, we remain cautiously optimistic. We have laid the foundation for a continued profitable growth. Our attractive portfolio and improved cost base are company's strength. These strengths will serve us well in the current growth phase. We expect earnings to continue to show a positive dynamic development over the long term.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Now I look forward to answering your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now starting the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Okay, our first question comes from John Lawson of Citi. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much indeed and good afternoon. I wondered if I could first ask about the disposition of your net interest-bearing assets in automotive. The amount of intercompany loan has come down from 8 billion to around 3 billion. Have you made a deliberate decision to reduce this intercompany funding? In other words, is this permanent or is it just a coincidence of some events?</p>
          <p>And perhaps on a similar line, just to ask about the gross industrial liquidity, about 9.7 billion was a bit of a surprise to me, and I guess you're signaling that you've got a determination to keep it this quite a high number going forward. I mean is there anything in the credit market conditions which make you particularly cautious here? Or in other words, what would it need to persuade you to review that very high level of gross liquidity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. I think it was an excellent first question. Now I give &#x2013; hand over to Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we used higher financial &#x2013; high financial flexibility in order to improve our capital cost situation. And after all, I would say, we feel quite comfortable with this high level of liquidity, because our view is the crisis maybe -- could come back a bit, so there are risk on horizons. You know what's going on in Greece and we have still a high unemployment rate in very important markets and we don't know how long the party in China will last. So that's the reason why we're still a bit careful on the looking forward. And we're not prepared to do simply extrapolate the achievements of the first quarter, so we have to be a bit careful. And very importantly, we would like to keep our rating stable, so that is another reason why we think we should be on a safe side here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our next question is from Arndt Ellinghorst of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. Just following on John's question, I think he was also asking whether this level of intra-group funding is now sustainable or whether we should expect some reversals in the other direction moving forward. And also on your net cash position, I think in the last call you mentioned that you're targeting 1.5 billion at least of free cash flow in the Autos division this year. Could you confirm that this is still the target for this year?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on pricing. You mentioned that pricing is improving in the Autos division. Now we just saw figures from the U.S., at least Autodata is reporting that for you, US$3,500 incentives per car compared to five or even a bit more last year. Is this level of discounts that you are happy with or do you have a target level of support per unit in the U.S.? Is that 2,500? Could you give us a bit of a ballpark feeling where you would feel comfortable with your pricing or how much you could still bring it down? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Arndt. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to your question about the reduction of the inter-group receivables, so I mean we didn't take a decision to keep it now on that level. I think we are trying to optimize our situation on a going forward basis. We understood your concerns out of the many discussions we had, so we feel quite comfortable that the cash is now in the Automotive segment. That is clearly taken into consideration, but I don't want to say now that there is a clear target how much they should be on the way forward. We want to have some flexibility here if it comes up to be used. Now free cash flow target, very clearly we want to go for the free cash flow target we announced to you. And we think with the strong operating cash flow coming from the new products, they should be able to be achieved.</p>
          <p>And the question on cost of retail, I mean, we are absolutely clear that we have to go even further, that we are not satisfied with the level of cost of retail we have achieved so far. And our target always was and still is to achieve a level we had before the crisis, so talking 2007, but we are absolutely aware that this could not be achieved in one step or in one year. So we will work it down in the course of 2011, and I think in the end of '11 we should be there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that means &#x2013; and if I just check it, in 2007 you operated &#x2013; well, I mean, actually in 2007 your discounts in the U.S. were at a level of 4, $5,000, so I would have to go back to 2003 levels or something. Would that be 1.5, $2,000 per unit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to say because it depends on the product. I would expect that if you look at the new products, the level has to be significantly lower. That is our expectation. If you look now at new 5 to come to the market, the new X3 come into the market, later on the 3 Series, I would expect lower levels than we have today. But then if you look at older cars, of course, at end of the lifecycle they will come back up again. So as we now have a very fresh product portfolio, we should get the right tailwind in order to bring it further down by another &#x2013; in average, let's say, at least $1,000, something like that. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next question, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Kristina Church of Barclays Capital. Go ahead, madam. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Kristina Church from Barclays Capital. I've got a couple of questions. Firstly on the Financial Services division. It was a very strong quarter for the Financial Services and I was just wondering what your &#x2013; the signs are you think for this division going forward? Whether you could talk a little bit about the residual value development, particularly in Germany now that we're paying for scrappage? And also about the level of deposits, would custom net deposits will come down a little? I'm just wondering what sort of level we are looking to keep those deposits at going forward.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on China, just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on sort of how much of your profits from China are going into the EBIT level and how much are going in at equity? Because I was just looking at the level of equity investments and it seems going down year-on-year. and presumably China's profitability has gone up quite significantly. So is that going through at &#x2013; is some of that going through at EBIT level? And then finally just on FX, I just wanted to confirm what your outlook is for the FX for the rest of the year with the movements in the dollar recently? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Kristina. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting with the SF business and the residual value, so actually the situation is like this. We have our positive development in the UK and in the U.S. So the question is, is it sustainable? Of course. And in the European markets, especially in Germany, we have more or less now a stable situation. So a lot of the reason that we are still a bit careful and so we didn't reverse provisions on this side in the first quarter. So that is what I have to say about residual values. And as I said, it depends on the recovery of economy, especially in the U.S., so on the employment rate and things like that still a bit risky from our few plants, so let's see what's coming. But the trend is positive and we have to look at this in the course of the second quarter. But as I said so far, there was no reversal.</p>
          <p>Now deposit, you have to see that in a financial crisis we took the advantage of deposits that we gathered and increased deposits, but at a significant cost as you said. At the point in time, interest rate in Germany was up by close to 5%, something like that for deposit. So actually we are able to refinance that much better. So if you look at our last ABS transaction, we are at 1.35 interest rate level, so &#x2013; and we took advantage to refinance the deposits and to bring the cost of capital a bit down. So that was the reason behind that. Now talking about China, clearly, it is an EBIT relevant profit, very much, and not so much on equity side.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Good. Thank you very much. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FX, so &#x2013; I forgot something, so sorry. On the currency side you raised a question about the outlook for the rest of the year in currency side. I mean, we are nearly fully hedged for 2010 and expect tailwind in a mid range double digit million euro territory. Also a rise a bit from the British pound and British pound is still a bit a risky, but the rest is quite fine.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jochen Gehrke of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Sorry, just to come back on this currency point early on. Just to clarify, first of all, have we seen any positive impact of ForEx in the first quarter? I know you don't provide the walk-down on a quarterly level, but just indicatively. And then secondly really to your hedging policy, has that changed at all over the years? So I know in the past when you thought it was above your fair value, you more did tactical hedging. Is this still the same procedure, so you in collars mostly don't fully benefit right now and this is more in 2011? Then could you just update us on your hedging policy?</p>
          <p>And then secondly more strategically, Mr. Reithofer, you outlined your strategy regarding electric vehicles and the Megacity Vehicle in 2013. Just on that point, would you agree that in electric vehicles obviously the scale is a major issue here to bring down cost, and therefore it does make sense to maybe find a partner for some crucial parts at least. Is this going to be the case? Or is this really &#x2013; do you feel comfortable that BMW can do a stand-alone project and what seems to be more of a mid-sized vehicle in this market field? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So, well, I have to say hedging didn't have a big influence in the first quarter, so overall it was not significant. There was no big headwind and no big tailwind, so that's more or less really level. And now your question about our policy and our procedures, we didn't change the procedures. We are looking at purchasing power equilibrium and it depends how far we are away from this &#x2013; those levels, and this is triggering the actions we are taking. Now natural situation is, for example, the dollar is coming very close to that. We are very active now in a market, especially for 2011. So it's still the procedure we said to you that we are following up.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And then Mr. Reithofer.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Mr. Gehrke, you ask what about economies of scale. I mean, if you see the situation at the moment, when we discuss e-mobility or electric cars then we are at the beginning of a process to industrialize components, substructures and we are at the beginning. If you see what we have done &#x2013; I mean, we entered into a contract with SB LiMotive. As you know, SB LiMotive is a joint venture between Bosch and Samsung for the cells, for the lithium-ion cells. And I mean it is a realistic outlook if I say, SB LiMotive will look for other customers as well, because they are interested not just to supply BMW, I think they are interested if I see the next five years to supply more than one customer. I mean, if I discuss with them such an issue, then they tell me, of course, we are interested in economies of scale as well. So &#x2013; and that is the realistic way to get there.</p>
          <p>If I ask myself, at the moment what is the most expensive part or substructure, however you would like to call that of electric vehicle? It is the battery at the moment and we have to look into the cell supply, into the battery construction and we have to look of course for economies of scale. If you ask me what will happen between the year 2013 and 2015, electric cars will be more expensive than cars with the combustion engines, but that is normal at the beginning of a process. But I think I mentioned very often when we had discussions that you have to see it that way. If I see, for example, the United States of America, you can only earn good credits if you deliver plug-in hybrids for the year 2016 onwards or if you deliver electric cars. And if you are a large vehicle manufacturer, it seems to be that you need then electric vehicles or you need plug-in hybrids, otherwise I think the outlook of a car company as large vehicle manufacturer in the United States is not a very bright one.</p>
          <p>And if I &#x2013; that means what would I like to say, it is a must to have those vehicles. So if I go to China, I mean, China is definitely on the track towards electro-mobility. I mean, a realistic view as well that we have cars with combustion engines, let me say at least until the year 2030, but we will have more and more electric vehicles. And I mean, realistic is &#x2013; I mean, Chancellor Merkel said on Monday, she would like to see 1 million cars in Germany in the year 2020. We talk about, I think, 0.5% of the total German market of about 45 million cars. So &#x2013; and you have to see all these things together. I mean, we have to make our money during the next 10 years with combustion engines, with hybrids, with plug-in hybrids, and we have to build up step-by-step electro-mobility, all of us. So &#x2013; and we have to talk our supply industry how can we have better economies of scale. If I see the most expensive part, I said it already, the battery, it will take time. I mean, on Monday it was mentioned, if we are in a very good situation, then the battery &#x2013; the cost of a battery will be between 5,000 and &#x20AC;7,000 in the year 2020. At the moment we talk about 10,000 to &#x20AC;15,000. So that this is the best outlook I can give you at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two questions. The first one, sorry if you made already a statement on that. My line was interrupted for a couple of seconds. The first question is on the recovery curve. Is it fair to still expect a gradual improvement quarter-by-quarter this year for your operating and pre-tax earnings or at least so for the second quarter? And do we talk about a significant improvement in the second quarter if you look at your order pipeline? And the second question, on cost reductions there are some media reports today that you expect more procurement savings together with Daimler than before. What are we talking about? What amounts of money, one &#x2013; 200 million, maybe 500 million? So what is the change here?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Recovery, I mean, actually we are still hesitating really to extrapolate the development of the first quarter. Of course, if you make a rough calculation and multiply by four and you add the additional effect coming from the new 5 Series, maybe you come to a different view on that. But can we do that? I think there are still a lot of risk in our business, and what's going on around us make us a bit nervous. I mentioned already the crisis in the Eurozone. It has already an influence on sales increase, for example, where they are heavily down. So if other markets are impacted by this, we could see the same picture. And as I said, nobody knows how long the positive market in China will be at a level it is actually, and so that's the reason why we are still a bit careful about just extrapolating the positive effect through the end of this year. And our view is over the end of the second quarter we should be clear about what is sustainable and what is not sustainable, and then clearly we can give a better figure to you. That's why actually we stay with the guidance we gave you.</p>
          <p>That's one thing. And the other is about the cooperation with Daimler, from our perspective there is no change in the strategy. We are working together on modules. We try to make progress there. It's an ongoing work for us and there's nothing new on that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank. I have two questions that in the Automotive cash flow statement a negative effect change in provisions of 370 million, is that a positive effect in the P&amp;L of the Auto division? And in the other comprehensive income, a negative effect of our 530 million from hedging instruments, could you say a word on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all about the provisions, clearly, we had to use provisions we made in the last year for tax payments, right. That is a number about roughly around 300 million, and you have to take this into consideration if you look at our free cash flow of all this. So this is one of the reasons the free cash flow was as negative as it is. It's coming from &#x2013; I mean, we talked to you about this. It has to do with the transfer pricing we had, and so that was already provisioned and now we had to reverse those provisions and to pay it. So that's what we did. And the other question was about the P&amp;L effect on the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was the &#x2013; about the other comprehensive income the 533 million negative in hedging instruments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's actually the fair evaluation of those instruments and that is what you see in that number, right.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Actually it's two questions. The one is you talked about reversal of provisions because of better residuals as well your development. Maybe you can give us a figure here, was it only in Financial Services division here hampering the earnings line and/or was it also in the Automotive sector? And the other question is on the average sales per unit. This came down significantly by &#x20AC;4,000 per car here, so what you are expecting for the quarters to come here? How much will that go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, to make that very clear, we didn't reverse any provisions for residual value losses, so it was not done in the first quarter. That's what I said. Of the reversal we did, well, the tax provisions, right, that we had to reverse in the first quarter and what we paid out the cash in order to save interest payments. So that is what happened on provision side and we had to accrue some provisions for pension. So this also valid for the first quarter. Now the revenue you're referring in your second question, revenue per unit, is it what -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, revenue per unit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Per unit. So you have to know that, I mean, to get the accurate figure, you have to look at wholesale, not retail. I mean, you only know the retail number that it is a bit too highly. The wholesale was lower, it was around 300,000 units. So &#x2013; and if you look at this, you would see that the revenue per car increased by 2% in the first quarter. That is the accurate number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one, you mentioned a negative effect that you had from the higher level of production for the wholesale units on your free cash flow. But on the other hand, obviously these additional 20,000 units should obviously have also been beneficial for your fixed costs absorption. So I was just wondering if you could maybe quantify the effect that lower average cost per car had on your Auto EBIT in Q1. And then the second one, on your cash flow, it seems like you had a very low CapEx number in Q1, lower than normally the case on a quarterly basis. So I'm just wondering, is this a sustainable figure going forward or mainly a quarterly swing. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. To start &#x2013; I'd like to start with your second question, it's about the CapEx. I mean, it is not something that is sustainable. We will not really bring &#x2013; are prepared to bring the CapEx figure so much down. We would be at the same percentage level as last year. You know our target is around 7% and this will be roughly the figure we will see at the end of the year. And the effect on the cost side, I mean it's a double-digit million amount that came from the increased production against the wholesale.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just three quick questions hopefully. On job cuts, was there any costs there for redundancy? China, you say you don't know how long the party is going to last, but you were confident enough to increase your volume target for China. So presumably there is something within your sales organization that says that China is still good for you, but you can talk about that. And then on funding for the Financial Services, how sustainable is that refunding that you have done and how long will that mean that the margin can stay the level reported in Q1? I mean if rates go up, will you need to &#x2013; will that mean that the funding costs go up and therefore your margin comes down again? That is the quick question.</p>
          <p>Then I've got a longer strategic question. You talked about in the press conference about the fact that you know the cost &#x2013; you negotiated the cost for the 1 Series, 3 Series Europe's supplies. You know the variable cost, you know the fixed cost if you deliver the &#x2013; the volumes you're going to make these margins. I wonder if you could just tell us, I mean, have you got fixed contracts for these for purchasing for the 1 Series and 3 Series? What is the risk for raw material cost to change from your budgets as you see them now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think we start with Norbert Reithofer, China and volume, and then Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in China, if you see the first quarter, volume development in the first quarter, we were able to double volume in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. That means that was for us a very good development, I have to say, and I can only say it was a very good development for us. We thought it is fair enough to increase our prognosis for China. At the beginning of the year we said, we will be able to sell more than 100,000 units in China, and during the Beijing Motor Show we said it will be 120,000 units. And that is at the moment the prognosis we can make. That is very realistic how I can see it.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Reithofer. And now we come to Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question about cost for the job cut reductions, so in the first quarter it was really a low double-digit number that you have to take into account. Now the FS situation, I may have to see that now we have built up a portfolio with a healthy margin, and that is in a portfolio and I think that will be sustainable for a while until really the interest rate will go up and we have a tougher situation in refinancing. We've done a lot of refinancing already, so it's not so much open this year. On the bond side, it's roughly a bit more than 4 billion that is left, so I feel quite comfortable that the &#x2013; that situation will be quite healthy for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>And talking about the contracts we closed so far with our suppliers, first off we have to see mobile contracts for products that will have their start of production in late '11 and in '12 and '13, but we know where we are there. But one thing is still a bit of a discussion that is the raw material prices, because raw material to a certain extent we are the ones are buying them. So, for example, steel there, we have a long-term contract. And if something is increasing on that side, then I think we have to handle that. That's clear. But on the parts, the cost for the different parts is something where we know where we are with our suppliers, because nearly all the contracts for those new cars are now finalized.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely yes. Definitely, because 3 Series will not come next year, right. But we have to look at our situation in a premium car the price of steel doesn't have such a big influence, right. It's not as relevant as for a mass product, right. So that is a different percentage number if we compare to the mass production cars and that's why we're not so much concerned about that. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentleman. Good afternoon. I just have one question, back to the topic of residual values again, and you made it very clear that you have not released provisions of the residual values. But if you look at the data that I know you guys look at, the Mannheim Index in the U.S., your used car prices are probably trading at or near record high, if not achieving new records in the market. You've also cited higher residuals in the UK. I guess, Germany still weak, but stabilizing. So while we acknowledge that you did not release provisions, you must be making profit on off-lease vehicles that are sold from your dealers in the current period. How significant is that? You must be making several thousand euros per used &#x2013; per CPO in the U.S., for example. Can you quantify that? I imagine it's quite significant.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. And one last question then on that topic. At what point would you release provisions. You say you want to stay conservative; you haven't released provisions yet for future period. How much higher do your used vehicle prices have to go before you bite the bullet on that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I absolutely understand your expectation there. To be really &#x2013; to be clear about, so our view is &#x2013; the question is, is the trend sustainable? And we said, at the end of the second quarter we should know we really could rely on that trend or not. And as we are re-evaluating the whole portfolio on a quarterly basis, this will be definitely the point in time, but this is back in the discussion again.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. Philippe Barrier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have two questions. First with regards to also the Financial Services, actually the level reached in Q1 has topped the three quarter of profitability level of &#x20AC;200 million. I would like to know if it is really sustainable as we understand that the cost of financing is done, default risk is stabilizing? But anyway &#x20AC;200 million is a great performance, and I would like to know if it is sustainable for the next quarter. And second question is regarding the working capital. Inventories have been up in Q1 in order to prepare sales of the new 5 Series. You expect a significant decrease in inventories level at the end of Q2 when the 5 Series will be on the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the Financial Services side, I think that the trend we see in earnings is something that is quite sustainable, unless another big &#x2013; something very serious would happen in the financial markets. So you just remember what happened after Lehman and how the used car prices went down, and how fast and quickly this was going forward. So that is what we still have in our mind when we are talking about risk. But if incidents like this are not happening, we should see a sustainable profit situation on that level for Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Now working capital, the trend for the next quarters. In a growing environment, still we have to increase our production, that's one thing. On the other side we are working to manage our inventory levels down on a daily supply base. So that is what we are doing. After all I expect that the working capital will be more or less level I don't expect that we would see further increasing working capital and a negative influence on free cash flow. Because the cash flow situation, if you look at this, should improve now with a good margins we will get from the introduction of the 5 Series Sedan.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I have two very simple questions and a third. Just on China, what are the revenues in Q1, the net revenues? What are they up year-on-year? And then secondly, you've talked about the provisions. You made about 2 billion of provisions in 2008 with regard to residual value credit losses. How much of that has already been used and roughly how much is left?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the Automotive division, you've talked about low financing cost benefiting Financial Services. I don't know if you can give us some idea as to what kind of level the finance cost you assumed, interest cost in Auto just compared to the previous peak. I mean, is it kind of 1% or 2 percentage benefit from where you were in '06, '07? Just give us some sort of idea of the magnitude that you're saying. Financial Services is clearly benefiting, but I presume Autos is as well, but to what kind of scale? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about China, we are not disclosing revenue numbers, but I mean what I had already mentioned is that on retail side we sold nearly 12.2% of the cars in the first quarter in China. And that &#x2013; now if you look at the price level in China, clearly I would say that revenue share would be even higher. But that is, I mean, a good indicator I can give to you.</p>
          <p>As we said, we have not reversed so far the provisions within Financial Services business. Of course, on a way forward we are getting better used car prices. Selling the maturities this is slowly eating up a bit of those provisions then. But the re-evaluation of the portfolio has not been done so far. And as I said already, we will look at this at the end of the second quarter, and if everything is on a good trend, maybe then we can talk about reversing provisions. So far we didn't do it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So I think we are very excellent in our time management today. So we have time for one last question, from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the last question on the queue, sir. It's from Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is very good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for letting me in once more. It's a very quick one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've lost a bit more than 300 million in free cash flow in Autos in the first quarter. You're targeting more than 1.5 billion and you're telling us that your working capital will pretty much be balanced. Shouldn't that give us a pretty good feeling for your EBIT for the remaining quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner? Okay. So we have --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all coming back to what we really said. So we said we'd be at a level of 1.4 to 1.5 billion on the free cash flow side. Now if we see that we had a one-off effect, I explained it, with the tax payment, around 300 million, then we would have been &#x2013; if we adjust that we'd have been close to a level situation in first quarter. And now we have to ramp up and get to this 1.4 billion, and clearly my expectation is that the profit would play a part in there and that is in line with the guidance we've given you so far.</p>
