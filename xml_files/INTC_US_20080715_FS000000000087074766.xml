          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Second Quarter 2008 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Amity and I will be your operator for today.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Amity, and welcome everyone to Intel's Q2 2008 earnings conference call.  Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith.  This call is being webcast live and a replay will be posted to our website at approximately 5 PM Pacific Time and will remain there for approximately two months. As usual, Paul will be discussing the highlights and progress of the quarter and Stacy will then provide details of our financial performance in Q2 as well as the outlook for both the third quarter and full year 2008. Following Stacy's comments, we will be happy to take questions.</p>
          <p>A few important items before we begin; first, the press release about earnings went out at approximately 1:15 Pacific time and is now posted on our investor website, intc.com, along with updated financial statements for anyone who still needs access to that information. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our investor website.</p>
          <p>As we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin. Our second quarter results were very positive on a number of fronts. First, revenue for the quarter was a record, the fourth quarter in a row that we achieved such a result. Demand for our leading edge computing products around the world continues to be strong, with revenue and unit shipments toward the high end of the seasonal norm, when factoring in the divestiture of the NOR business. We realized record unit shipments in mobile microprocessors, chipsets, and wireless communication units in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency continues to provide considerable operating leverage, with operating income growing 67% from a year ago. For the second quarter in a row, we bought back $2.5 billion worth of stock, returning cash to our stockholders.</p>
          <p>Our 45 nanometer manufacturing process is performing superbly. We remain on track to ship over 100 million units before the end of the year on this process technology. At this stage of our process ramp, yields and throughput times are better than at same time on our 65 nanometer ramp. These results are lowering unit costs ahead of our original plans and are providing us with increased flexibility in meeting diverse customer requirements. We will reach the 45-nanometer shipment crossover point for microprocessors during this, the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me briefly discuss a few product highlights. In servers, we had record channel shipments. This demonstrates that demand for our products coming from small and medium businesses around the world continues to be healthy. We also enjoyed some noteworthy design wins at both Cray and DreamWorks, reflecting that our current and future product roadmaps are delivering the performance that meets the most demanding customer requirements.</p>
          <p>In mobile, we enjoyed very strong unit growth both sequentially and year over year. As notebook computers continue to decline in price, we see demand growing in response. We saw notebook unit shipments cross over desktop in the overall client PC category in the second quarter. That's sooner than we had expected.</p>
          <p>We launched our new Atom processor during the second quarter and are exceeding our ramp-time targets as demand for this new product is very robust. We expect unit shipments of Atom processors to grow sharply in the second half.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. The strategic direction we laid out two years ago at our Investor meeting, coupled with our restructuring efforts are coming together and yielding tangible results that we committed to our stockholders. Our product line is superbly positioned. Our new growth initiatives are ramping and showing promise, and our manufacturing execution is outstanding.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we plan to bring exciting new products to market, such as our new Centrino 2 platform launched just yesterday, as well as Dunnington, our six-core server processor targeted at high-end server workloads scheduled to launch later this quarter. These are the kinds of innovations that create real differentiation for our customers and allow us to maintain product leadership.</p>
          <p>A final word on the economic environment, we are very aware of the global economic issues that dominate the financial markets these days. We are watching these very carefully. In the first half of 2008, we saw order patterns play out as anticipated at the beginning of the year. Inventories remain at healthy levels and our global footprint is helping us benefit from demand for Internet computing.</p>
          <p>As you look into the third quarter, we see continued healthy demand for our products, leading us to the third quarter outlook that we provided.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call back over to Stacy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. Intel delivered strong financial results in the second quarter. Better than expected demand in the microprocessor and chipset businesses led to record second quarter revenue of $9.5 billion. Compared to the second quarter of 2007, revenue grew 9% with gross margin up more than 8 points. Operating profit was up 67% year over year, and operating income as a percentage of revenue was up 8 points year over year to 24%.</p>
          <p>Revenue for the second quarter was above the midpoint of the range forecasted in April and down 2% from the first quarter. Excluding the revenue associated with the NOR business, revenue was flat to the first quarter, at the high end of the seasonal range.</p>
          <p>Microprocessor unit sales were above the seasonal pattern, and average selling prices were lower. More than half of total revenue, $5.4 billion, came from the Digital Enterprise Group. Revenue from this group was flat compared to the first quarter and up 11% from the prior year. Microprocessor revenue in the Digital Enterprise Group showed particular strength with revenue up 14% from the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The Mobility Group accounted for more than a third of total revenue. This revenue of $3.8 billion was up 3% from the first quarter and up 15% from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Looking at a geographical breakout, all geographies experienced year-over-year growth in the second quarter. After adjusting for the impact of the NOR Flash divestiture and supply agreement with Numonyx, all geographies performed a little better than average seasonality.</p>
          <p>Gross margin dollars were $5.2 billion, flat compared to the first quarter. Gross margin percentage of 55.4% was up over 1.5 points from the first quarter and up over 8 points from the second quarter of 2007. Versus the midpoint of the outlook range set in April, second quarter gross margin was down 0.5 point. A little less than a point decline came from average selling prices being lower, primarily due to the growth in shipments and the lower price segments of the notebook market.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D and MG&amp;A were approximately $2.9 billion, within the forecasted range of 2.8 to $2.9 billion, and up 3% from the first quarter. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $96 million, which was lower than the outlook that we provided of approximately $250 million, as an assessment of capacity resulted in less restructuring and asset impairment charges.</p>
          <p>The number of employees is down by 2,700 from the first quarter to below 82,000, primarily due to employees transferred to Numonyx. As we complete the second year of the restructuring program announced in 2006, the number of employees is down more than 20,000 from the second quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Gains, losses on equity investments, and interest and other income of $58 million was lower than our outlook of $75 million, and lower than the first quarter of $109 million. Relative to the first quarter, improvements in the trading asset portfolio were offset by lower interest income and impairments of marketable equity securities.</p>
          <p>The provision for taxes in the second quarter was at a 31% effective tax rate, lower than the 33% previously forecasted due to tax settlements.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, total inventories were flat for the first quarter at $3.3 billion. Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $11.5 billion, $1.7 billion less than the first quarter. Cash flow from operations was over $2.5 billion. Capital spending was $1.2 billion. Dividend payments were $800 million, and stock repurchases were $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>As we turn now to the outlook for the third quarter, please keep in mind unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do include the effects of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after July 14. I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods.</p>
          <p>We are planning for revenue to be between 10 and $10.6 billion. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 9% from the second quarter. On a year-to-year basis, the outlook anticipates revenue growth of 2%. Excluding the decline in NOR revenue, the growth would be approximately 6% year over year.</p>
          <p>Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is 58% plus or minus a couple of points, 2.5 points higher than the second quarter, as microprocessor unit volume increases in the seasonally up third quarter and as unit costs decline on 45-nanometer products.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond the third quarter as volume increases and costs decline, we expect gross margin to improve further in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Spending for R&amp;D and MG&amp;A in the third quarter should be approximately $2.9 billion. Additionally, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $60 million. Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net loss of $30 million. We maintained the midpoint of our outlook for gross margin for the full year at 57% and have narrowed the outlook range to plus or minus a couple of points.</p>
          <p>Spending for R&amp;D and MG&amp;A for the full year is now forecasted to be approximately $11.7 billion. R&amp;D spending is forecasted to be approximately $6 billion, flat to the prior forecast. And MG&amp;A spending is forecasted to be approximately $5.7 billion, up 200 million from the prior forecast, primarily due to legal and profit dependent expenses.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for each of the remaining quarters in the year is expected to be 33%, unchanged from our prior outlook.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue growth of 9% and operating profit growth of 67% year over year mark the end of a strong first half.  As we look into the second half of the year, we are planning for growth and improving financial results driven by our product leadership, the ramp of the Atom processor, the build-out of three 45-nanometer high volume factories, declining unit costs, and the impact of our restructuring program.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Kevin for Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Stacy and Paul. Before we begin our Q&amp;A segment, I want to remind the financial community of our upcoming Intel Developer Forum taking place on August 19 through 21 in San Francisco. There will be seven keynotes during the forum covering a wide range of technology trends and Intel product plans from the Digital Enterprise to ultra-mobility to software. We will also hold a number of briefings for investors and analysts as well. For registration and other information, please go to intel.com/idf.</p>
          <p>I'll now be happy to take your questions. In order to allow more of you to participate on this call, we will limit each person to one question and one follow-up if you have one. The operator will introduce each of you and prompt your question and I will then ask if you have a follow-up. The operator will then introduce the next questioner.</p>
          <p>Okay Amity, we are now ready for our first question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you; good afternoon guys. Guys just quickly on gross margins for the June quarter being below midpoint you're pointing to the low-end notebook market, was that all Atom driven or were you still selling some Celeron to that market? And if it was all Atom, how do we get comfortable about gross margin progression in September as Atom ramping becomes even a bigger percentage of the overall mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was not Atom. Atom launched in the second quarter, but the units shipped on Atom were pretty small in the second quarter. We expect it to ramp rapidly into the second half of the year. If it was what I would call the traditional notebook market. As Paul said, it's now more than 50% of the market. We're seeing a lot of unit growth in emerging markets. We're seeing growth in channels such as the retail channels. That growth is good for us but it tends to be at a lower price point. So you are seeing TAM expansion at some of these lower price points and that brought the average price down in the second quarter from what we expected.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just real quick guys, just given the buybacks in the first half of the year, what can we expect in the back half? You guys are going at a pretty significant clip relative to what you did in 2006 and 2007. What's the philosophy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I had said back in Q1 that the cash balance was a little higher than we were targeting. We brought down the cash balance by about $3 billion over the course of the first half. And we've done about &#x2013; we've done $5 billion worth of buybacks between Q1 and Q2. The cash balance is getting more into the range of what I'm targeting. At this point, I'm not going to give a buyback forecast nor am I going to give a cash forecast for Q3.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. Stacy, just in guiding a fairly solid revenue outlook in the 10 to 10.6, could you give us some framework for how you perceive the desktop area to be proceeding? Again, it sounds like you are expecting a fairly robust notebook and perhaps even Atom lower-end notebook forecast. Could you give us some color on desktop, notebook, server?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess I would point back to what we've seen so far in the first half. We really have seen demand holding up across the different segments of the computing related business, with particular strength in the notebook growth that we spoke about at some of these price points. And then in the server market, I think the strength of our product line really benefited us in Q1.  Q2 tends to be a seasonally lower quarter for servers, but I would expect that to also be strong as we get into the second half.</p>
          <p>I think underlying your question is demand. We saw demand pretty normal through the second quarter across the segments of our business and across the different geographies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, do you have a follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, obviously you are holding the gross margin for the full year guidance and guiding it up fairly meaningfully in the third quarter to the 58% range. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what gets you there given the strength you are seeing in the lower end notebook segment and the mix there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's a pretty simple margin reconciliation going from Q2 to Q3.  There are two elements that are worth roughly the same amount of gross margin improvement. We see our costs improve quarter on quarter pretty dramatically as we go from Q2 to Q3. And then we see volume in the CPU segment up seasonally and those two things get you to 58%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, a question about the outlook for revenues. It's good in Q2. You are guiding strongly in Q3. To what extent is your confidence being helped by share gains and/or the Montevina launch? Did that give you some confidence in how you look at Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glen, I think it's a combination; it's Paul. I think it's a combination of things. What we've seen from our customers is &#x2013; I think the overarching comment is on the notebook market accelerating around the globe at multiple price points. We also expect and we will see more of Atom based notebooks in the third and fourth quarters. And that's why we'll continue to break those &#x2013; we will break those numbers out for you in our commentary so that you can have &#x2013; draw some trend lines around those. But in general, we were able to cover the shipment shortfall on Montevina in Q2 with Santa Rosa. We replaced all that volume so our customers were able to keep on shipping.  And now Montevina is ramping very rapidly in the consumer segments that have launched today or yesterday.</p>
          <p>I won't comment on share gain but we'll let the numbers speak for themselves when they all come out. But it has to be pretty clear that with the kind of mobile volumes we had in the second quarter that we did pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glen, do you have some follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I guess just drilling down from that response, you talked about the low end of the notebook market taking some mix in Q2. But now you've got Montevina coming forward for you in Q3. Does that stem the shift towards the low end, or do you think it's really more a function of emerging market versus Western markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a bunch of things. A lot of this is dependent on the economy.</p>
          <p>The prime purchaser of notebooks still remains as a segment business, large enterprise. And they tend to buy relatively high-end notebooks, and Montevina will start shipping into that segment later this quarter, when we launched the Centrino 2 Pro product lines. That is one that we've got fairly &#x2013; we're fairly bullish about for the second half as that ramps and replaces the pre-existing SKUs that are out there. But in general, I think what we're seeing is just a fundamental shift to notebooks. We've been seeing it for years and the crossover happened six months sooner than we thought.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, Excuse me, I have a bit of a cold here. But you talked about the pricing on the notebook side of the market. Can you tell a little bit about what's going on in pricing in desktops and servers please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We are not going to give you any ASP granularity in each of those areas, but in servers we had a very strong Q1 in MP, and in Q2 DP was a bit more &#x2013; a bit heavier, so that tends to drive the mix a little bit to the lower priced numbers. I would expect MP to pick up in the second half of the year as is traditional. The fourth quarter is normally the big server quarter. But as you can tell, we are being a little bit cautious about that given the overall economic environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of desktop, there are two trends. There is a continuing trend in emerging markets with lower priced desktops, but there is also a trend for refresh rates in corporate around our vPro product line, which have above average selling prices. So the combination of the two has kept the desktop pricing on average relatively constant.</p>

          <p>Yes, I think as we run the model &#x2013; I actually would have to go back and double check this, Ross, but I think as we run the model as volatility goes up a bit, the stock option expense goes up a bit. You are right; we have quite a few &#x2013; fewer employees and we have not expanded the stock option program in terms of number of options granted per employee, so I think it's just the volatility.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon guys, thanks so much. First question, Paul, last quarter you gave us a little bit of color about the NAND business and your thoughts around either fixing it or &#x2013; fixing it one way or the other. I wonder if you could update us on where we are there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't give a lot more color than I gave you last quarter, James, but we are taking some actions to limit the amount of supply growth in this environment. As you know, the NAND pricing continues to still be very weak, so we are focusing on supply and on cost. At the same time, we are focused on trying to get a better pricing environment for our products by shifting some of it to more innovative stacking products and to SSTs. At the same we're doing that, we're still looking for longer term solutions. I have not wavered in my commitment to have their business not be a long-term drag on our P&amp;L.</p>

          <p>If I could just follow up on the DreamWorks win, could you just help us understand, in the competitive situation there, was that your products versus AMD's older products before they introduced say the new Barcelona chip or was that decision made before AMD was able to ramp the new chip?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was based upon our roadmap going forward versus their assessment of competitive roadmaps going forward. They don't make just a one quarter or even a one year decision because a tremendous amount of the effort here is involved in software optimization. And the software optimization around Intel is relatively unique versus other vendors' products. So I consider this a multi-year win. It's a multi-year framework that binds it together. It's software and hardware and it is I think reflective of the very competitive roadmap we have not just in servers but also in workstations as Larrabee comes on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, first question for Stacy. Stacy, you noted that the part of the call or the small miss on gross margins was because of a one point incremental drag from lower ASPs. Was that incremental to your expectations because my recollection is a couple of one-timers were disappearing: your inventory reserves on chipsets, NOR flash was obviously contributing to better margins and you did have a better unit cost structure into the quarter? So I was just curious about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was slightly less than a point and it was to the outlook that I set. If you look at this from a quarter-on-quarter basis, with the exception of the ASP, we got the good news from the two areas I was expecting. We had articulated that we have some good news as we had chipsets that qualified for sale in the quarter and we're shipping them in the second quarter. So we got good news there, and we got good news from the NOR divestiture. The piece that was unexpected to the outlook was being a little bit down in ASP.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sumit, any follow-ups?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have one separate follow-up. On the Atom, there has been talk about constraints with respect to supplying the existing demand. Could you update us on what your sense is versus market expectations on your supply and is that constraining your outlook for Q3 in any way, shape, or form?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is no. It's not constraining our outlook for Q3. It's well within the bounds of the 10 to 10.6 that we gave you. We have been increasing our planned production of Atom for this year and next every 40 days, since the beginning of &#x2013; actually since last November. Demand continues to roll up and not just in netbook segments but also in embedded and the consumer electronics segments. It looks like the design wins are really quite robust.</p>
          <p>And so we continue to add more and more zeroes to the numbers we're building for this year and next year. I don't expect it to be any kind of limiter for revenue growth this year at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sumit, if can just add on that, the supply constraints we're seeing with Atom are specifically at the back end, the test constraints. We have plenty of die; and as Paul said, it's well contained inside the revenue guidance we gave, but as demand is going up month by month, we are jumping to keep enough test capacity in place for the demand we set.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the other part of that, Sumit, is to make sure we have enough chipsets.  At the same time the Atom processor growth is jumping up, we have to also be able to build a chipset for each of those, which is one of the reasons you saw our factory utilization assessment go up over time in this quarter then dropping down.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Following up from the earlier question, as the Atom ramps in volume over the next two quarters, presumably primarily for notebooks, is the Atom gross margin below, above, or roughly equal to overall corporate gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to make sure it's clear &#x2013; I think it is, but to make sure it's clear, the ramp of Atom is encompassed in a 58% gross margin in Q3 and what I expect to be a higher gross margin in Q4. My view of Atom hasn't changed from what I showed at the Analyst meeting. If you recall, I was showing the Atom platform. I used end of 2009 as the comparison point because at that point, we had ramped Atom volume. We had ramped quad-core volume to be a fairly significant percent of the total. And what I showed you at that time was inclusive of the chipset, so the CPU plus the chipset.</p>
          <p>I expected the Atom platform to be about 10 product margin points lower than the mainstream of the product line which was dual-core, and quad-core to be about 10 product margin points higher than that. So my view hasn't changed, and I'll update that again in Q1 next year when we have the Investor meeting.</p>

          <p>I don't think I want to give you that granularity. The Tigerton, it probably did.

What I was talking about earlier was a mix between MP and DP and that was encompassing both old and new products.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much; Paul, just a quick question on the Atom. What is the relative gross margin of Atom versus Celeron? And as we ramp this product in second half do you see this possibly replacing the low end Celeron products in notebooks and if so, what will the impact be on the net gross margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the second part of that and I'll throw it back to Stacy for the first part, which I think he has already answered it. We can try it again. At this point in time, we do not see it replacing Celeron. If you look at the products that are being built, the netbook products that are being built around Atom, they are all lower price, lower features, smaller screen size notebooks aimed at first-time buyers or the second, third, or fourth machine in a household. And I don't see it cannibalizing at least in terms of current sales out. And I think we have really hit on a net product category here.</p>
          <p>Over time, we're still sorting out the brand activity in our mainstream notebooks. Clearly Centrino and Core is where the thrust is going to be and we're trying to &#x2013; we will sort out and ultimately talk about where Pentium-based notebooks and Celeron based notebooks live as these categories sort themselves out. But I think it's premature to say that except that we don't see any cannibalization</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Uche, unfortunately I am not going to go into any more granularity than I did at the last Analyst Meeting. We expect this to be a very healthy product margin product. What we are seeing today is demand that's exceeding our expectations. And it's all in to my gross margin forecast for the year and for Q3.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do actually. Let me just to go back a little bit to Montevina. We saw a slight push-out. Obviously that doesn't &#x2013; shouldn't have impact this quarter. But is it possible, however, that in terms of the back-to-school deals that you may have missed some business as a consequence from Montevina and is that something you hope to recapture in Q3, hence the gross margin impact that we see remaining strong? I just wanted to first of all understand &#x2013; I may need some help fully understanding what really happened with that push-out. I understand it was something to do with radio. If it possible to clarify it, that would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The principal reason was graphics and integrated graphics and then radio as well, but the combination of those two was about a 30-day slip on consumer SKUs.  A couple things on back-to-school; first of all, as the industry has gotten more efficient over the last few years, particularly in notebook manufacturing, the cycle times have come down both from a transit standpoint and an assembly standpoint. And our customers are all using hubs and so forth nowadays as manufacturing techniques.</p>
          <p>So the amount of &#x2013; the earliness that you used to see in shipping semiconductors into manufacturers to hit something like to back-to-school weekends is a lot shorter than it used to be. As a result, I don't think we missed much, if any of the back-to-school cycle. Number one, some of our customers are doing multiple SKUs and will have multiple back-to-school refreshes and Montevina will be prominent in those second rounds. And I think the good news of the product stands for itself. There are still not really benchmarks coming out on our new products versus the competition's new products. But when they come out, given our testing internally, I expect we'll do very, very well.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys; I guess just a question or a curiosity on the ASP trends in laptops. It seems that the emerging markets are what drove the downward trend in ASPs, but it seems to me that emerging markets have always been the big driver there. So I guess I'm wondering why now would it cause this sudden downward trend in ASPs and why wouldn't that continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say emerging market. If we did, I misspoke. What's happening in the notebook business and we showed this graphically at the Analyst meeting is that consumer purchases of notebooks as a percent of consumer PC purchases has grown from 15 &#x2013; 20% up to 50%-ish, which is roughly where corporate is. Corporate is a little bit higher than that.</p>
          <p>So what has happened is the consumer market on a worldwide basis and for PCs is shifting to notebooks. And consumer price points on notebooks are lower than enterprise price points on notebooks because of the typical configurations and the builds behind them. So I think it's nothing more than price/volume expansion of the consumer portion of the business on a worldwide basis. As netbooks ramp up in the second half of this year, those I do expect to be predominantly focused on emerging markets, but we are just seeing the beginning of that now.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

It seems like we all understand what's going on in US. What are you seeing in particular out there in China as far as demand goes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically in China, the quarter had an early interruption obviously with the Chengdu earthquake, and Intel and virtually everyone that I know that operates in China had some impact early in the quarter from the disruption of sales for essentially a big part of the country, the western part of the country. That notwithstanding, the other trends in China are very good. Olympics build-up is very &#x2013; has got a lot of excitement. There are WiMAX trials on notebooks in China for the yachting events, a lot of excitement around that. So I would expect it as the replacement machines and rebuilding schools and so forth happen in China that there will be some recovery from the demand that was lost earlier this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our overall strategy on chipsets is to continue to build the best in the world and to drive as high a percentage of our microprocessors with chipsets as the market demands. We've done exceptionally well in notebooks and have historically done well in servers and okay in desktop. A lot of the companies you talked about in your litany there were desktop suppliers, low end desktop suppliers in particular, and they have made the economic decision to not participate in that marketplace.</p>
          <p>There are some structural changes coming up in terms of the kinds of buses that we'll expose publicly with the Nehalem generation. Much has been written about that.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can you remind us in terms of tick-tock hit that you get in terms of gross margins when you ramp early next year the 32-nanometer node, what's the usual or the gross margin hit in terms of points that you would expect because of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Stacy. So, what I showed you at the Analyst meeting is still how I'm viewing this, which is in the year in which we launch a new process technology, so 2009 will be the year in which we launch 32-nanometer process technology. You tend to see a couple of points of elevation in other cost of sales off of a base of a couple of points. That's over the year. It can spike a little bit more than that in a specific quarter. But it tends to be a couple of points of gross margin.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, some of that is a classification of the research and development heads. In the year in which they're working on a process that's going in production, they are classified as other cost of sales. In the year which they're working on process that's not going in production, they are classified as R&amp;D. That's one of the reasons you saw our spending this year go up was that classification. That was about a couple hundred million dollars worth of spending in 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Paul, you talked about better than expected strength in the Atom processor. When I think about source of that demand, I put it in basically three buckets, so incremental first time buyers &#x2013; lower price points, the increased number of notebook PCs per person, and then thirdly potential substitution. I think you already touched on the fact you don't believe any substitution is happening. But the demand in those first two buckets, how would you split that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't use your second category &#x2013; not PCs per person, PCs per household. And many households are going from one PC to multiple PCs with these machines and that was some of the early purchases and those purchases happened actually in the affluent cities or the Tier 1 cities of some of the emerging market countries like China, where it became sort of a fashion item or machines for the kids.</p>
          <p>I think that in &#x2013; who the heck knows but my guess is that this year, year one of netbooks, 80 to 90% of the volume will fall in those first two categories. There may be some substitution. And in year two and year three, I think it's just too soon to call. But our view is that these new price points combined with a limited amount of features which is required to enable the price points are likely to generate a new segment in the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I do. So as you think about the basic metrics of semiconductors; you've got the price lever, the computing &#x2013; performance lever, and then the power consumption lever; I think what I just heard you say is that a major catalyst for adoption of Atom is certainly the price at a reduced computing performance. How much is the computing performance, limited adoption and how do you...</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is less than a third of the performance of our Centrino. We're dealing with something which is not &#x2013; most of us wouldn't use. And you are dealing with something that is principally designed for net access, for web access, not really to run robust applications. And I think it's likely to stay that way for quite some time. As a comparative, you would not want to run YouTube video on these things all day long. You would not want to do any photo editing on these all day long or even for a little bit of time. So I really think it's a first time buyer thing and it will sort itself out, just like there is a different market for lower price, lower performing cars than higher-end cars.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys for taking the questions and congratulations, back on the Atom acceptance obviously coming in very strong. Can you talk maybe, Stacy, about the offsets of Atom's adoption, the curve of that pricing versus what you are seeing in the upside to 45-nanometer cost cuts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cody, actually I'm not sure I understand your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are getting improvement to gross margins because of cost reductions coming down with the 45-nanometer ramp. Atom is coming up; it's got a lesser gross margin mix impact. So how does those two offset each other maybe as we look into the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the answer I'd have to give to that is they are in the 58% gross margin that I have forecasted for Q3. So even with the Atom ramp, <mark type="inaudible" /> cost down it's likely to ship at a lower average selling price. But when I focus on the traditional &#x2013; what I'll call the microprocessor business without Atom, my costs come down in that segment of the business as well. So what I did is quantify for you the overall cost. I think it's probably more on the traditional microprocessor business and less on Atom as we go across at least the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so even with the Atom adoption, even with the overall cost reductions coming &#x2013; ASPs coming down, you are still well outrunning those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me say it a different way. Even if I didn't have Atom in the second half of the year, my costs would be coming down nicely. I see my factories are running pretty full. My 45-nanometer process is healthy. I am running good yields and product characteristics. So my costs would be coming down even without the effect of Atom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly can you &#x2013; I know that you said you would start to characterize as Atom starts to become more meaningful just getting into a ramp. But Atom is getting a lot of attention here and will likely continue. Can you characterize even weeks ahead, months ahead of where you thought you'd be, percentage ahead of where you thought you'd be or when we might be able to get a little more data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it depends on what point you start from. Versus last November, we're 5 &#x2013; 6x the volume for the year we thought that we were. Just a month ago, we were 10% above it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But versus maybe your expectations going into the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into the quarter, it would be &#x2013; for Q2, it came in about as we expected. Remember Q2 was the launch quarter for the thing. So it's just we knew how much we had to build ramped and that's pretty much what we sold. When you get into the Q3 again, as Paul said, it depends on what time period you choose. But I guess from the beginning of Q2, we now look at Q3 as probably 50% higher than we expected, something on that order.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of John Lau of Jefferies Company. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Paul, in taking a step back, your guidance was very strong, especially in light of the uncertainty out there. Can you give us what the normal seasonality is and more importantly, whether that guidance is based on the feedback that you get? I guess how comfortable are you with the visibility this year versus the prior years given the uncertainty? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're equally on the hook this year versus other years; so we're relatively comfortable, very comfortable with the guidance we've given out. Normal seasonality is about 9% I think Q2 to Q3 typically.</p>
          <p>One of the things that gives me comfort is our chipset shipments in Q2. We said that chipsets were a record in Q2. Chipsets, as you may know, are a leading indicator of microprocessor or PC assembly. They get soldered on &#x2013; they get purchased and then soldered onto motherboards multiple weeks ahead of the microprocessor, typically four to six weeks depending on the vendor. So the fact that we had very strong chipset shipments, record shipments and strong over the course of the quarter I think is a very good kind of a pointer for Q3, in addition to all the other data we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, if I could just add to that, for Q2 we would typically see the second quarter down a couple of percent and if you strip out the impact of the NOR business divestiture, we were flat. And for Q3, as Paul said, normal seasonality was 8.5 to 9%, in that kind of a range and that's consistent with our outlook. The midpoint of our outlook is right in there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stacy, a couple of clarifications on the gross margin, first on the NAND side. What kind of an impact is NAND having on your gross margins now? I mean if you were to exit NAND today, how will that impact your gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross margin would be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But by how much is my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that was tongue-in-cheek. As you know from prior calls, we don't break it out that level of granularity. I will give you a little color commentary on what we saw on NAND in Q2 and what I expect over the course of the rest of this year. The price environment continues to be weak. NAND for us in Q2 came in as we expected. The gross margin impact didn't worsen from Q1, so it stayed the same. We have costs coming down as the pricing comes down, which helps us. And frankly, that's what I expect into the second half. I expect it to continue weak, pricing environment, but my costs come down nicely. So I think it doesn't have either a positive or a negative effect on the overall corporate gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my follow-up is I guess pretty much of all of last year and earlier this year, you saw a pretty good benefit from mix shift to notebooks and now it seems like the notebook CPU pricing is probably close or even below the pricing of the desktop CPUs. So my question is are the margins still better in notebooks for you compared to your desktop segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Notebook prices are still nicely above the desktop prices and I don't see them converging frankly any time on the horizon simply because there is a premium associated with power/performance characteristics on those product lines vis-&#xE0;-vis the desktop.</p>
          <p>So while they are coming down, I think we've said this in the last couple of calls. This is something we expect. It's a natural consequence of price/volume expansion of the market. And they are not moving to intercept desktop anytime soon from our perspective. And one of the ways that we're going to mitigate that is with Atom and netbooks coming in give us a much lower cost structure to be able to ride this curve than we did during the equivalent expansion of the desktop cycle 5 &#x2013; 6 years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Srini. Amity, we're going to take two more questions if you could, two questioners.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If we look at the gross margin guidance for the year, 57%, and the implied margins, 58% and then 60% in Q4, how much is built in those forecasts that corporate adoption of Montevina will be healthy and the same level that we see with Santa Rosa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you are asking me am I baking in an ASP increase to get there, that would be pretty unusual. The big drivers of gross margin as we go from Q2 to Q3 are, as I said, the cost coming down and the volume. And I expect my costs to come down again in Q4 and volume to be up again in Q4. Those are really the drivers. I am not anticipating a mix shift to the high end or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask this another way, Stacy. So if your mix on notebooks is similar to what you saw in Q2, can you still get to 57% for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, I'd expect notebooks will continue to grow as a percent of our output.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then, Paul, one last comment just on the healthy chipset strength you saw in Q2; any comments on what you're seeing in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing strange. Everything we see so far in terms of demand for chipsets is equally strong from the strength we saw in Q2. We'll know a lot more three months from now when we see what the shipments are lining up for the fourth quarter. But right now in terms of the mix, particularly towards the newer chipsets, demand is very strong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Obviously, Atom has been a lot of the questions of this call. We mostly focused on the netbook market for Atom. I'm curious; what do you expect the embedded market to be relative to netbook sales? And as a follow-on, I'm wondering if you have to make any ASP compromises for embedded applications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part of the question is no. At this point in time the budgetaries we're putting out for embedded applications are in the same range as the desktop version, the higher power version of Atom that we are shipping into PC space. And that's because essentially they are being used as the PC processors. Most of these things will run Windows or Linux. They're Internet connections, general purpose reprogrammable machines. The embedded market is moving pretty rapidly in that direction.</p>
          <p>In terms of the mix, gosh, that's hard to say. The problem is that, as you may know, the time from design win to production ramp for an embedded design, particularly some of these ones that are in regulated environments, can be one to two years. And so if we add up all the designs wins, it's very strong. I don't think that it would outship PC application, the PC uses, but I think it will be a very strong part of the product line.</p>
