          <p>Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Brandon, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
          <p>We'll be discussing the first quarter results at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners which is one of the largest MLPs in America and at Kinder Morgan, Inc. which owns a general partner of KMP and significant limited partner interest.</p>
          <p>98% of the distributions going up to KMI come from KMP. The other 2% comes from our 20% ownership of Natural Gas Pipeline of America. To combine, the Kinder Morgan companies now have a combined enterprise value in excess of $55 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me start with an overview of what happened in the first quarter and some strategic thoughts. Then, I'll turn it over to Park Shaper, our President, who will go through the financials in detail and then we'll take any and all questions that you may have.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by discussing KMP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. Today, we increased our quarterly cash distribution per unit to $1.14, or $4.56 annualized, that's a 7% increase over the first quarter of 2010 and it's the 40 &#x2013; yes, 40th distribution increase since we took over this company in February of 1997. And it's the fifth quarter in a row that we've raised the distribution.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter distributable cash flow before certain items was a little over $382 million; that was up 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Our distributable cash flow per unit which we think is the most effective way of judging and comparing earnings and operations was a $1.21 this quarter compared to $1.18 for the first quarter last year. With all five of our businesses produced a stronger first quarter results than in the comparable period last year, our total segment earnings before DD&amp;A were about $880 million, that's up 6% from the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Given our solid asset performance along with the current oil prices and interest rates, we are now on pace to generate excess cash flow of almost $100 million for 2011, versus our annual budget target of $37 million of excess cash flow. We previously announced that we expected to declare cash distributions of $4.60 per unit for 2011, which would be a 4.5% increased over 2010, we now expect to meet or exceed that target. We'll continue to monitor in light of these developments in our increases of performance. And if we stay at this level, we will look at increasing the distributions from KMP later this year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to each of the segments. The products pipeline business had a strong performance in the first quarter. About two-thirds of the growth was driven by good results from the Cochin pipeline system and our Pacific operations. For the first quarter, our total refined products volumes increased 4.4% compared to the same period last year. Gasoline volumes were up 2.3%, diesel volumes up 11.3% and jet fuel volumes up 3.2%. Before you get too excited about that, we published the details on these volumes on our volume page that's an attachment. And as you will see, the strong growth here came from the plantation pipeline volumes. So we would not expect this size of growth and volumes to continue throughout the year.</p>
          <p>On the NGL side, the volumes were up 12.4% versus the first quarter of 2010 due to the strong performance of our Cochin NGL pipeline. Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment, was also had strong performance in the quarter, and the growth there was driven by contributions from the recently completed Fayetteville Express Pipeline from the KinderHawk joint venture in the Haynesville Shale, from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline expansion and from good results at our Casper-Douglas processing assets and the Texas intrastate pipeline system.</p>
          <p>On the negative side in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, we had lower volumes and transportation revenues at Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission and we had lower results at Rockies Express solely due to a contractual agreement regarding fuel recoveries. Looking ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunities in the shale plays that will help drive future growth in this segment. The overall segment transport volumes were up 9% (sic) [10%] (05:20) due largely to Fayetteville Express coming on line and the force majeure that impacted Rockies Express for a portion of the first quarter in 2010.</p>
          <p>At the Texas Intrastates, sales volumes were up 1% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our CO2 business, growth in the first quarter was attributable to higher oil prices and higher NGL prices on our unhedged volumes. These higher oil prices more than offset the expected lower production in the first quarter, as our average WTI crude oil price was about $8 per barrel higher for quarter one of 2011 than it was in the comparable period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to oil production, oil production was lower at the SACROC unit for the first quarter of 2010, running about 28,900 barrels per day versus 30,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010, but basically flat to plan in this first quarter of 2011. At the Yates Field, production was down compared to the same period last year, but just slightly below plan, due primarily to some weather issues in February, the cost is about $5 million and several thousand barrels of production.</p>
          <p>At the Katz Field, we're now getting results from our recently initiated enhanced oil recovery activities, but the production response is slower than we'd anticipated, which I might say actually could be positive for the project longer term, i.e., more uniform flow through the formation, may be what we are seeing now. We now expect for 2011 to realize an incremental 600 barrels of additional oil production at Katz compared to 2010, down from 1,000 incremental barrels that we targeted in our budget for 2011.</p>
          <p>In the Terminals business, we produced very nice fourth quarter segment earnings; up 13% year-to-year. About 80% of that increase was driven by organic growth. That organic growth came from strong results at our liquids terminals on the Houston Ship Channel, reflecting customer demand and higher rates on contract renewals and we had a significant increase in bulk tonnage. For example, our total bulk tonnage was up almost 11% for the quarter. We had a record coal volumes at our Pier IX facility in Virginia and we had a 21% increase in steel volumes across the segment compared to the first quarter of 2010. Acquisitions accounted for the other 20% of the strong growth at terminals, due primarily to the Slay and Watco transactions.</p>
          <p>With regard to ethanol handling, this segment &#x2013; in this segment, it was basically flat with the first quarter of 2010 at 15.7 million barrels. Combined, the terminals and products pipelines as segments handled about 23 million barrels of ethanol in the quarter, up slightly from the same period a year ago. And we continue to handle about 30% of all the ethanol used in the United States.</p>
          <p>At Kinder Morgan Canada, the growth for the quarter was driven by increased deliveries into Washington State on the Trans Mountain pipeline system and our mainline throughput on Trans Mountain was up about 12% compared to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Now, let me discuss some of our other developments across KMP which are really important to the future growth of both KMP and KMI. I'll start with the Products Pipeline segment. In the segment, our expansion at the Carson Terminal in California is running ahead of schedule, that's a $77 million project and added 560,000 barrels of additional storage for refined products in Carson, California. Two of those tanks are now expected to be in service in November of this year, that's about eight months sooner than planned. The project is still running on budget insofar as costs are concerned. At our expansion project at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California which is a $48 million project, we are also running ahead of schedule and on budget. We now expect to have two of the three 150,000 barrel storage tanks in service in December of this year, three months earlier than planned. In our Natural Gas Pipeline segments, a lot of things going on there, we continue to take advantage of tremendous opportunity for new infrastructure in the shale plays. For those of you who attended or listened in on our analyst conference earlier this year, we talked a lot about this; all of those opportunities we talked about at that time still remain in place now. In fact, I'd say we're even a little more enthusiastic about our opportunities.</p>
          <p>Starting with the Eagle Ford Gathering, that's a joint venture between ourselves and Copano Energy. Since we last talked, we've entered into a long-term agreement with Anadarko. And now including funding our 50% interest in this joint venture, we've committed about $166 million to expansion projects in the Eagle Ford shale play. This system will result &#x2013; this investment will result in a system of about 400 miles of existing and newly constructed pipelines. When they are fully powered with compression, these pipelines will have the capacity to gather over 700 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. We expect all of that 700 million cubic feet per day of capacity to be fully subscribed during calendar year 2011. And we're looking to pursue additional opportunities in the Eagle Ford shale play in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our Fayetteville Express pipeline is now fully in service. At KinderHawk Field Services, that's a natural gas gathering and treating joint venture between KMP and Petrohawk in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana. We continue to experience growth in volume. We now have about 400 miles of pipeline with over 2 Bcf a day of capacity and our throughput is now approximately 940 million cubic feet a day. The throughput is expected to reach 1.2 Bcf a day by year end 2011. Also in the Natural Gas Group, KMI reached a settlement in principle with FERC staff and our customers in the first quarter on the Section 5 rate case. Pending approval, the settlement will have a full year impact on KMP of less than $10 million. The 2011 impact will be even less than that because the settlement will only be effective for a portion of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our CO2 segment, the main development there is one we also discussed at the Analyst Conference, namely that, the fact that we are experiencing very nice growth in demand for CO2 in the Permian Basin. And that's led us to continue to see real opportunities to expand our production of CO2 in Southwest Colorado and expand the pipeline infrastructure that transports that CO2 to our customers in the Permian Basin. And in fact, today our board authorized expenditures for the preliminary engineering work on the expansion in Southwest Colorado. So we are beginning to kick that project off.</p>
          <p>On the Terminal side, as detailed in our recent conference, tremendous increase in demand for coal exports and this will be a driver of future growth for our Terminals segment. We've entered into two significant contracts with customers to handle coal and we're actively pursuing a number of additional coal export opportunities. Specifically, we now have a 15 year agreement with Massey to handle up to $6 million &#x2013; 6 million tons of coal annually through our IMT Terminal in Myrtle Grove, Louisiana on the lower Mississippi River. We'll be investing about $70 million to expand that terminal. We expect that expansion to be completed and the tons begin to move in 2012.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've entered into an agreement with a large western coal producer to handle up to 2.2 million tons of Colorado coal annually at the &#x2013; at our Houston bulk terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. To accommodate this tonnage, we'll invest about $18 million in expanding the facility. This will be the first time that western coal has been exported from the Port of Houston and again, we see great opportunities to further expand our handling of export coal on both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>On another matter in our Terminals group KMP formed a crude oil joint venture with Deeprock Energy Resources and Mercuria Energy Trading in Cushing, Oklahoma. We are investing about $25 million for a 50% stake in an existing crude oil tank farm that has storage capacity of one million barrels and for the construction of three new storage tanks that will have an incremental storage capacity of 750,000 barrels. These new tanks are expected to be in service by the third quarter of this year. We also have an option to participate in additional expansion of Deeprock's remaining undeveloped land in the Cushing area which is extensive.</p>
          <p>We've also completed construction on our Deer Park Rail Terminal in the Houston Ship Channel area and related ethanol handling assets, that $19 million project included building a new ethanol unit-train facility, we now have space for multiple unit trains, and that project is supported by long-term customer contracts and the first trains have already arrived this month.</p>
          <p>Finally on the Terminals group on our Watco Companies joint venture we continue to pursue new opportunities with the rail company. We anticipate making additional investments with and in Watco during 2011 to complement our existing terminal network and provide customers additional transportation services particularly with regard to moving crude oil by unit trains from shale plays both in Texas and elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Now turning to KMI, again today we reported the first quarter cash available for dividends at $251 million in the quarter. We're on target to meet or exceed our previously disclosed annual budget of $820 million in cash available to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>We declared a dividend for the first quarter of $0.14 per share. The additional dividend is pro-rated to February 16, 2011 that's the date that KMI closed its IPO, based on a full quarter the dividend will be $0.29 per share or $1.16 annualized just as we promised in our S-1 and in our road show for the KMI IPO.</p>
          <p>If present trends continue and we are able to increase the distribution at KMP, we will pass those increases on to the KMI shareholders by increasing the dividend above the $1.16 target. In short, our strategy at Kinder Morgan is pretty simple and it applies to both KMP and KMI. We have a great set of stable assets. We have growing cash flow coming out of those assets. We're going to do our best to grow that cash flow and then distribute it out both in terms of distributions to our unit-holders at KMP and KMR and in dividends to our shareholders at KMI.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Park.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Rich. Time to go over the numbers, I'll start with KMP and so the first financial page that distributed along with the earnings release is the face of the income statement. Now this does include the impact of certain items, we don't think it's overly meaningful. But you can see down towards the bottom, the distribution per unit of $1.14 up from $1.07 a year ago as Rich mentioned that 7% growth year-over-year.</p>
          <p>But I'm going to turn to the second page in the release and really start towards the bottom, you'll see the DCF per unit $1.21 up from $1.18 a year ago and actually ahead of our budget of $1.16 for the quarter. So very strong performance in the quarter, our excess coverage was $21 million, that's $1.21 compared to the distribution of $1.14.</p>
          <p>Jumping up above that, you'll see the DCF before certain items or I guess, right above that is the net income. We think DCF per unit is more meaningful and a better measure of the distributions that we're going to be able to pay. But net income per unit before certain items is about 43.5 cents.</p>
          <p>DCF before certain items as Rich mentioned, $382 million, it's up almost $29 million from a year ago, up over 8% and actually above our budget for the quarter. One of the main reasons why it was above our budget is directly above that the sustaining capital expenditures $36 million for the quarter above last year, which was $33 million. But it's actually below our budget for the quarter and so we had a pick up relative to budget on the sustaining CapEx side.</p>
          <p>That being said, our annual budget is about $225 million and we do expect that we will come in right about that annual budget. So a large part of this is just a shift from the first quarter to later quarters.</p>
          <p>Above that you have the contributions from some joint ventures essentially this is backing out equity earnings and adding in distributions. And you can see in the first quarter of '11 those distributions exceeded the equity earnings by about $3 million.</p>
          <p>Book cash taxes, again there we're backing out book taxes adding in cash taxes, but cash taxes were lower than book taxes for the quarter and so that's a positive $10 million. And then above that DD&amp;A is up a little bit from a year ago and then there is limited partners' net income before certain items, which is up about 8% also from a year ago.</p>
          <p>To see what's driving the net income I'll jump up to the top and talk about the segment earnings before DD&amp;A starting with products pipelines, it's up about 10% from a year ago actually up nicely relative to its budget &#x2013; relative to budget the pick was driven primarily by Cochin and then also by Southeast terminals.</p>
          <p>Now for the year on Products Pipelines, we expect them to come in right about their budget. On the Natural Gas Pipelines side, up slightly from a year ago, a little bit under its budget, the reason why we were under budget was largely related to KMI and Rockies Express as Rich mentioned. When we look at Natural Gas Pipelines for the year, we expect them to come in right around their budget.</p>
          <p>One thing to point out on the Natural Gas Pipelines side is this does not, the segment earnings before DD&amp;A does not include all of the DD&amp;A from our joint ventures that gets added in down below and actually within the $267 million that I pointed out. But if you wanted to see the real earning power of the Natural Gas Pipelines you would add that DD&amp;A back. And I'll talk about that number in total in a minute, when I talk about the full year expectations.</p>
          <p>On the CO2 side, up over $10 million from a year ago, a hair under budget for the quarter, although almost all the reduction from budget was a function of the extended cold weather that we had during February that really caused a little bit of production loss at the Yates and a little bit of losses or reductions on some of our other assets, absent that effect actually CO2 would have been on budget.</p>
          <p>And as Rich mentioned, CO2 is favorable due to price and in volumes are pretty close to plan at SACROC, a little bit below at Yates and a little bit below at Katz and then on budget to a little bit above on the natural gas liquid side.</p>
          <p>When you look at CO2 for the full year, clearly what the forward curve for oil prices where it is right now. We expect CO2 to come in well above its budget actually by about $35 million. And so again very nice opportunity there in the CO2 segment driven by high oil prices.</p>
          <p>On the terminal side on budget up about $19 million or almost 13% for the quarter, debt on budget for the quarter and we also expected to be on budget for the year.</p>
          <p>And then at Kinder Morgan Canada, nicely above last year by about $3 million, a little bit above its budget. We do expect Kinder Morgan Canada to be above budget for the year. It takes you to a little under $880 million of segment earnings before DD&amp;A compared to $827 million a year ago or an increase of over $50 million or about 6%.</p>
          <p>And then I gave you kind of the highlights for this forecast relative to budget for the segments. But if you add all together we expect the segments to be above budget by about $35 million, that would take us to about $3.67 billion of segment earnings before DD&amp;A or if you add it in the DD&amp;A associated with the joint ventures it would take us to right about $3.85 billion of segment earnings before DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So again, expect the segments as we look at it right now to be above budget for the year. G&amp;A starting to drop down under the segment earnings contribution, you'll see about $101 million up from about $99 million a year ago, it was a little bit above our budget for the quarter about $5 million above our budget. But most of that is timing as we look at the forecast right now, we expect the G&amp;A will come in right about budget for the year.</p>
          <p>Interest, a little under $132 million for the quarter, up from $116 million a year ago, but actually favorable to budget by about $7 million. The increase relative to a year ago is largely a result of an increase in balance, which is a function of the investing that we've done in the last year. And then a little bit as a result of an increase in average rates.</p>
          <p>As we look at it for the year, we actually expect currently that interest will come in under budget by about $23 million that's a function of the current forward curve for interest rates, the refinancing that we did in the first quarter. And so that's driving again that's savings and interest.</p>
          <p>Net income before certain items, a little under $424 million, up over $40 million from the first quarter of 2010 or about a 10.5% growth year-on-year. Let me talk about the certain items and really one in particular, but starting with the first one allocated non-cash long-term compensation. This is the same item that has shown up here since 2007, when the MBO transaction closed and it is an accounting expense related to compensation that KMP will never have to pay for and in truth the public shareholders at KMI will never pay for this.</p>
          <p>But the accounting rules require that we allocate this expense out. So it shows up there and in truth the big item, which is the line right beneath that is very similar. So that $83 million is related to $100 million special bonus that will be paid to non-senior management employees here at Kinder Morgan in late May.</p>
          <p>That $100 million will be funded by a reduction in dividends to certain of the investor shareholders to the non-public shareholders of KMI. And it's completely funded by that reduction in dividends. KMP will never pay a penny of that. KMI will never pay a penny of that, but for accounting purposes it has to be represented here. And so again the expense has to be recognized on the income statement and this, that's why it's showing us here and part of it gets allocated down to KMP.</p>
          <p>Now this is KMP's portion, once again an expense that KMP will never be responsible for, will never have to pay a penny for. The rest of the certain items are small and essentially cancel each other out, so essentially almost all of the net certain items before the quarter are that one large charge, which again KMP is not responsible for.</p>
          <p>So that's really the summary on the performance for the quarter. Just going back one page and looking at the income statement, I've said, as I've skipped over it, that it was distorted by the certain items and really the biggest item is that $100 million special bonus.</p>
          <p>So if you look at G&amp;A on the first page, you'll see it's up by $88 million, well that is all, that special bonus coming through. So again, it's just not meaningful on that case. Similarly income taxes are impacted by that special bonus, they're up by about $6 million, again that's being driven by that certain item. So I think it's much easier to understand what's going on with the business when you look at the second page.</p>
          <p>One other thing to point out as Rich mentioned, and I'll jump back and just talk about the full year forecast. I talked about the segments being up by about $35 million as we look at the current year. G&amp;A essentially being flat, interest being favorable by about $23 million. And when you drop all that down, it's about $57 million, $58 million as we look at &#x2013; for improvement in terms of distributable cash flow. That takes our expected excess coverage to $9,200 million. And as Rich said, we'll continue to monitor that and as we get later in the year then we may increase the distribution, if that holds.</p>
          <p>One other thing to think about there it actually take, so if you look at our current forecast for distributable cash flow per unit, it's almost $4.89, which is $0.28, $0.29 above our current distribution &#x2013; our expected target distribution of $4.60, it's also, if you look at that is really $4.885, if you look at that compared to the $4.43 that we generated in distributable cash flow per unit in 2010, it's over 10% growth, which again I think it's just showing the strength of the set of assets that we own.</p>
          <p>Now one thing I do want to point out, well that distributable cash flow per unit, again based on our current forecast is up 10% and does it mean that we can increase the distribution by 10%, because as you increase the distribution that distributable cash flow per unit actually comes down as a result of what goes to the general partner or in other way to say it is the distributable cash flow per unit is just per limited partner of unit.</p>
          <p>What it does mean though is if we actually came in at that level and we wanted to have no excess coverage, which I don't believe &#x2013; is where we'll end up, but just as you understand where we are it does mean that we could increase the distribution by 7.5% from where we were a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now again &#x2013; and that's just walking through the current forecast so that you understand the significance of the numbers. As Rich said and I said a few minutes ago, excess coverage $90 million to $100 million right now, we'll continue to monitor that and later in the year we'll figure out if we want to take the distribution up beyond our budgeted target of $4.60 per unit.</p>
          <p>And then the third page is our &#x2013; the volumes and a couple of comments there, Rich mentioned that, but it is new on the volume page this quarter. We have broken our Plantation from some of the other products pipelines. So that you can see by product the volumes at Pacific, CALNEV and Central Florida then you can see by product the volume change at Plantation and then we'll give you a total. So again, you can see here that a lot of the growth this quarter came from Plantation and again driven by some refinery expansions and by allocations on a competing pipeline.</p>
          <p>And one other thing to mention there and this is in the text of the press release, but just to provide a little bit more explanation. We present NGL sales volumes in the CO2 section as our net amount, and our net amount actually declined versus a year ago, well the gross production at the plant actually went up and again that was in the press release.</p>
          <p>The reason why our net share declined was a contractual relationship that really had increased our share through the end of 2010. And so this was expected, it was in our budget, but really we're happy with the plant performance, the plant is performing very well. So operationally things are going very well, it's just a contractual reduction. And in truth that contractual reduction is offset somewhat by some other contractual rights we have to net profits interest in the plants and so from a true dollar perspective, the impact isn't as significant as this reduction implies.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll go to the balance sheet, should be the last financial page on the KMP release. Now &#x2013; and walking down this fairly quickly; cash and cash equivalents up a little bit, so this is comparing end of the first quarter to the beginning of the year. Other current assets are down about $100 million, restricted deposits and accounts receivable really constitute that reduction.</p>
          <p>PP&amp;E is up and really that's a function of expansion CapEx less depreciation for the quarter. Now investment is we did &#x2013; the one acquisition we did in the quarter was of the Deeprock asset as Rich mentioned, that is a minority interest and so we equity account for that. And so that shows up on this line, we also invested some more in our Eagle Ford joint venture and so that &#x2013; that &#x2013; and the Watco investment really closed this quarter. And so that was another increase, offset by really a reduction here in Rockies Express, which is just a function of distribution.</p>
          <p>Deferred charges and other assets is down a little bit, that's just a function of the mark-to-market of the hedges. Total assets $21.8 billion basically flat with where we were at the beginning of the year. On the liability side; notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt, that's $1.3 billion we actually did have a maturity that we paid off in the first quarter of '10. And then we had a couple of future maturities that became current, so the make-up of the $1.3 billion. Commercial paper at the end of the quarter was about $340 million. And then we have a maturity in mid-March of 2012 for about $450 million.</p>
          <p>And then we have another $500 million which can be put to us at the beginning of February of 2012 and because it can be put to us then it shows up in current maturity. That being said, the coupon on this debt is 9%, it's the debt that we issued in December of 2008, when nobody could access the capital markets and we did it essentially to show that we could.</p>
          <p>We would love for that to be put to us and we would love to not pay 9% on that debt. I don't think it's going to happen. If any of you are holders and you want to put to us then please do, we'll be happy to pay that down. But what's likely to happen there is it will stay in current maturity until a year from now until the first quarter of 2012, when people are very unlikely to put it to us, and then it will go back into long-term debt, then it's actually due in February of '19.</p>
          <p>Other current liabilities essentially unchanged. Long-term debt, I'll talk about that when I talk about total debt in a minute. Value of interest rate swaps, that just fluctuates with the forward curve on interest rates. And then other long-term liabilities, this is primarily changes in the mark-to-market of the hedges.</p>
          <p>Partners' capital; accumulated other comprehensive loss, that's the mark-to-market of the hedges and in other partners' capital that's net income plus any equity issuance less distributions. And so really that take us down to total debt, $11.6 billion compared to $11.4 billion at the beginning of the year. So total debt has gone up by $160 million and I'll walk you through what caused that in a minute. But, first let's look at debt to EBITDA; EBITDA is about $3.2 billion for the last 12 months it's up from about $3.1 billion for 2010. And so our debt to EBITDA ratio is now just a hair over 3.6, when before it was actually about 3.66, it did round to 3.7. But anyway debt to EBITDA has come down, that's consistent with our expectations. We think it shows a very strong balance sheet and we fully expect to maintain a very strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So the change in debt for the quarter, $160 million. The uses of cash: CapEx was about $216 million; acquisitions were about $16 million, again that was Deeprock; contributions to joint ventures $22 million; and in the Chevron settlement, which was the last big piece of the FERC settlement was $63 million and that did go out during the quarter. Sources of cash: We issued equity through the ATM program, generating about $83 million and then KMR distributions resulted in a retention of cash of about $104 million. And then for working capital and other items they were a use of cash of about $30 million.</p>
          <p>And here is how that $30 million breaks down; AR and AP were a source of cash of about $60 million; accrued interest was a use of cash of almost $150 million. And so really all that is, is the first quarter and the third quarter are the quarters when we have large interest payments. We pay on our long-term debt, we pay semi-annually and they're just heavily concentrated in the first quarter and the third quarter. And so really this reflects the payments that went out in the first quarter, a lot less cash will go out in the second quarter and that accrual will go back up.</p>
          <p>Other current assets and other current liabilities were a source of cash of about $14 million. We had excess coverage of about $21 million. Then we had some other CapEx timing and distributions in excess of equity earnings plus DD&amp;A and some other items of about $22 million. And so those all total to use of cash of about $30 million, but it is really, accrued interest was the &#x2013; was the primary use, everything else was offsetting that.</p>
          <p>Now I mentioned CapEx about $216 million and contributions to joint ventures of $22 million, I'll give you a little bit of detail there. Products expansion CapEx was about $17 million in the quarter spread across a variety of smaller projects including the Travis Air Force Base and the Carson project. Natural gas was about $15 million, again spread across a number of smaller projects or finishing up other projects. CO2 was about $112 million, SACROC is clearly the biggest piece of that, although Katz is a big piece of that as well.</p>
          <p>On the Terminals side about $56 million, tank expansion at Carteret in New Jersey, the completion of the Deer Park Rail Terminal, continued expansion at Vancouver Wharves, and a number of smaller projects and then Kinder Morgan Canada was about $2 million. And then the equity contributions, again the $22 million, about $14 million went to the Eagle Ford joint venture and about $8 million went to Red Cedar.</p>
          <p>And that is it for KMP. And so with that, I will turn to the KMI financials.</p>
          <p>I think the main thing to remember about KMI is, it is very simple and very straight forward and it's all laid out for you on the first page, the first financial page of KMI. And really what we're tracking is the cash available to pay dividends. You can see it sums to $250 million, that is up from $230 million a year ago, that's about 9% growth. But the main thing is, we're on track to generate $820 million or a little bit more of cash available to pay dividends. There are some things that impact some quarters and not others and I'm going to walk through that so that you kind of understand, seasonality is probably the wrong term, but just how those things play out across the year. But again I think the main thing is we're on track to generate $820 million of cash available to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>Primary source of that cash are distributions from KMP, but you can see from the General Partner $285 million and then $24 million on the KMP unit, $15 million on the KMR shares. And then NGPL about a $4 million distribution in the quarter. And then G&amp;A was about $2 million and interest expense about $75 million. This is cash interest here. And then cash available to pay dividends before cash taxes was the $251 million. And so cash taxes are zero during the quarter and that's just because we typically have very small payments in the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Now what happens though is the second quarter gets doubled up on cash tax payments because we make one in April and one in June. And I'll talk about &#x2013; a little bit more about that later. But again, I think this is really all you need to know about KMI. It's getting tremendous distributions out of KMP, some minor additional distributions from NGPL, had to pay a little bit of G&amp;A, had to pay some interest and the rest of the cash and estimated cash taxes, the rest of the cash is available to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>And that being said, because this is the first time that we're going to talk about KMI since this IPO, the next page is the face of the KMI income statement. And so I'm going to walk through this page and the page that follows that reconciles the cash available to pay dividends to the income statement. And it's all going to sound very complicated. But the main thing to remember is it is not the business nor the fundamentals that are complicated, it's the accounting that's complicated.</p>
          <p>And so I'm going to walk through this to help you understand it, but really what's relevant is the first page, which is very simple. So looking at the second page again this is the face of the income statement. So the things that complicate this, KMP is consolidated here. It also includes certain items, both the KMP certain items and the KMI certain items. But we don't think this page is overly meaningful. Those certain items at KMP in this quarter include the special bonus, the $83 million that I went through and it's $87 million on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>At KMI you also have an impact from that special bonus. You also have at KMI a receipt from a settlement from the insurance company related to shareholder litigation of $46 million of cash or on an after book tax basis, $29 million. That is impacting this number. That receipt of cash, which we did receive in the first quarter, is not in our $251 million nor is it in our $820 million, because that's a one-time item, that's not recurring. So we're not counting it towards our cash available to pay dividends. What we're doing is paying down debt with it and when we get to the balance sheet, I'm going to show you that.</p>
          <p>The other stuff that's included in here are all of the purchase accounting items that KMI had to make, all of those entries it had to make, at the time of the MBO in 2007. And <mark type="ph" /> Ken (44:06) went through a little bit of this and actually much better than I can, at the conference, but just to remind you high level what those items include, one, KMI had to write-up the carrying value of assets of KMP on KMI's books.</p>
          <p>What that means is that KMI carries KMP's assets at a different valuation than where KMP carries its assets. Now that's really a balance sheet item and I'm going to show you those distortions on the balance sheet. But it does impact depreciation, which does impact net income, another reason why net income just isn't real meaningful. So basically what you have here is deprecation at KMI for KMP's assets, that's even greater than what KMP recognizes.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, at the time of the MBO, KMI, and again this is &#x2013; none of this is impacting KMP, KMI had to take our existing hedges and mark them to the forward curve at that point in time and only recognizes differences, only recognizes income based upon the differences of the transactions and that mark-to-market forward curve at the time of the close of the MBO. Really what we're saying there is for any transaction that's been hedged, KMI realizes different income on its income statement than KMP does. So, again, just another distortion.</p>
          <p>And then the third thing that is &#x2013; that's fairly significant on the first accounting side is really escaping me right now, I can't remember what &#x2013; what else I was going to mention. Yeah the debt at KMI also add to the mark-to-market in essence at that point in time, which means that KMP, KMI book interest expense doesn't really reflect what it's paying in interest.</p>
          <p>And so the income statements there will always show it to you and so that you can see that, but we don't believe it's meaningful. But we'll also show to you is the next page, which is basically going from income from continuing operations, which you can see on the income statement $201 million to our cash available to pay dividends which is $250 million. Now, again I'm just going to walk through kind of how this reconciliation works at a high level to help you understand it. I don't believe that this is overly meaningful. In subsequent quarters, I don't expect to spend much time on it, but we will present the information for you.</p>
          <p>So at the top you start with income from continuing operations. And that in the next three lines all come from the income statement, so from the prior page. And essentially we add back to income from continuing operations DD&amp;A and amortization of excess cost of investments. So that's just adding back non-cash items as we're trying to get to a cash number. And then what we do is we take out income from equity investments, because we're going to again I try to go from income to cash. And so that comes directly from the income statements. Right below that we add back distributions from equity investments. And so we're taking out equity income, adding in distributions because we're talking about a cash number here, we're trying to convert from income to cash.</p>
          <p>The distributions from equity investments are split on the two lines because most of that comes from KMP. And then where you can find this on KMP's financial statements is in the cash flow statement. And in the cash flow statement, we have to split those between operating cash flows and investing cash flow. And so we've split it here to make it a little bit easier to track back to KMP, but realize that this includes KMI as well. And I should have said that at the beginning; all of these line items to this point and almost all the way down include both KMI and KMP. And then we'll back out the portion of KMP of &#x2013; that KMI does not own down below. So really when you look at these distributions from equity investments, you're not going to be able to find those exact numbers on KMP's cash flow statements.</p>
          <p>Then we take out the certain items, the KMP certain items, that's really the pre-tax number. So $88 million versus the $ 83.6 million that we were looking at on KMP, but those are the same numbers. And then the KMI purchase accounting, now again this is a pre-tax number and this doesn't include the purchased accounting impact on DD&amp;A nor does it include the purchase accounting impact on interest, but it's just what &#x2013; what remains.</p>
          <p>The difference between cash and book taxes, and again this is for both KMI and KMP. And then the difference between cash and book interest expense for KMI is shown there. For KMP, when we do our distributable cash flow calculation we just use book interest expense and so that's why we're not &#x2013; why we're not including any change for KMP.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures, you will see this number $36 million is really all KMP. KMI has very little sustaining capital expenditures. And so all of that again, all the way down to the second to last line that includes impacts for both KMI and KMP. And so our number right now still includes both KMI and KMP. We have to back out the portion of KMP that KMI does not own or really does not have access to. And so the first thing that we do is really split between these two lines. But the first line is the declared distribution on a limited partner of units owned by the public or not owned by KMI. This includes both KMP units and KMR shares that some of you all &#x2013; if you all dig into this, you may be getting and you may think, well, wait, we're going for cash here. And the KMR shares, the distributions on those are paid in shares and not in cash and that cash is retained. Well that's true, it is retained but it's retained by KMP. And what we're totaling for here is the cash available to KMI for dividends. KMI has no access to any cash that's retained by KMP. Even though KMI must consolidate KMP for accounting purposes, KMI has no legal access to KMP's assets or to its cash. Again, accounting is not the same as the law. And KMP -KMI has no legal access to that cash. That is KMP's cash.</p>
          <p>So again the cash that comes from KMR shares that's with KMP. Also when you get to the next line, any excess cash flow that KMP generate is retained at KMP; KMI has no access to that. And so that's backed out on the other line. The other things that you get on the other line are any remaining KMI certain items and also some timing effects, because the income statement is done on a declared basis and our cash available for dividends is done on a paid basis. Then there are some timing impacts that flow through that line. So again high level, those are the items that reconcile income from continuing operations to cash available for dividend.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll go to the balance sheet. And you'll see on the balance sheet, we've tried to split it between again KMI consolidated KMP, we've tried to split the line items between KMI and KMP. One thing on the cash and cash equivalents for KMI, down significantly from the beginning of the year, but you may remember that we had a debt issuance that was due early January that we refinanced with a debt issuance that went out in December of 2010. That just meant we had excess cash on our balance sheet at the end of the year it was huge to pay down retire bad debt in January. So that's why the debt balance went down so much.</p>
          <p>Other current assets, again, that's both KMI and KMP. And then you'll see PP&amp;E is split between KMI and KMP. Now here in a number of these lines the KMI lines include the purchase accounting impact, so the KMP line is misrepresented, essentially the true carrying value for those assets at KMP. And in the KMI line includes the purchased accounting impact. Same thing goes for investments and for goodwill.</p>
          <p>And so really I don't think there is a whole lot of meaning in looking at those items on the balance sheet. I think the main thing is, down here in short-term debt and long-term debt we'll aggregate that down below. For KMI, the main component in a short-term debt is just KMI's outstanding borrowings under its credit facility.</p>
          <p>But really let's just drop all the way down to KMI's debt net of its cash and cash equivalent. You'll see the end of the quarter about $3.17 billion, that's down about $25 million from &#x2013; really a little under $3.2 billion at the beginning of the year. And then if you look at a kind of comparable to a debt to EBITDA ratio and if you look at distributions received at KMI, it's about $1.26 billion for the last 12 months, up from 1.24 billion. And so the ratio of debt to distribution received is about 2.5 times, down from 2.6 times and again representing that KMI has a very strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now as we look forward at KMI's level, we expect that we'll end the year little bit under $3.15 billion and so it will be down from the beginning of the year by, call it, $50 million. Now that is assuming that we actually sell KMR shares during the year that are equivalent to the distributions that we received during the year. There is a decent chance that we won't sell any KMR this year and what that will mean is that this debt number will go up by $45 million. And so in that case we'll end up right around $3.2 billion, right around where we started the year.</p>
          <p>And then one other thing I'll walk through is, as I said, our debt went down by about $25 million. This will give you a sense of some of the things that happened in the first quarter that may not recur going forward, of some of the things that will happen in the second quarter. Cash generated in the quarter, $250 million. Now the dividends paid in the quarter, we paid a normal dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010 that was $205 million. We also paid the dividend, essentially kind of accelerated for the first half of &#x2013; the first quarter of '11, during which we were not public.</p>
          <p>Now that dividend would have been $105 million, but $64 million of it was not paid out in order to fund the $100 million special bonus that goes out in May of this year. So again what happened is that it would have been $105 million, it was reduced by $64 million, $64 million is the after-tax impact of that $100 million payment to again the non-senior management employees. And so the net amount is an incremental dividend of $41 million. Now we also received in the quarter about $46 million from the insurance settlement and then we had IPO expenses which are one-time items of about $14 million. And then we had working capital and other items that were use of cash of about $12 million.</p>
          <p>And so those things get you to &#x2013; gets you to the reduction in debt of about $25 million. Now the other thing to think about is we paid a bigger dividend in the first quarter than we normally would, but we also got the insurance settlement in the first quarter. So those kind of offset.</p>
          <p>As we look at the second quarter, few things to keep in mind. One, we will have two cash tax payments in the second quarter; so one in April and one in June. So cash taxes in the second quarter will be unusually large, just like in the first quarter they were unusually small, they were zero. And the other things that will happen is we will pay a lower dividend than we normally would in the second quarter, it will be $99 million and the normal quarterly dividend of $205 million.</p>
          <p>So we'll pay a lower dividend, but then we will also pay out the $100 million. But, again, remember we've essentially already retained the cash or held back the cash that will fund that. But that $100 million will go out in the second quarter. And so really all I'm doing is preparing you for when I walk through this reconciliation three months from now, I'll be talking about those items. But the main thing to keep in mind at KMI &#x2013; strong performance in line with our expectations, maybe a little bit above; we will generate $820 million of cash; we will pay out about $820 million of cash in dividends; and our debt will come down by $50 million or if we don't sell the KMR shares, we'll essentially remain flat. And really that was a long explanation of KMI. I expect in future quarters it will be much shorter because KMI really is very simple.</p>
          <p>With that I'll give it back to Rich.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Couple of quick questions. First on the Eagle Ford JV. Beyond the capital you guys are spending to enhance your gathering scale, how are you thinking about capturing the opportunities for condensate and crude oil takeaway capacity? You've obviously got the asset leverage there given your products pipes and interstate footprints. So I'm just curious how you're thinking longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we think that's a very good opportunity for us. And we think we will be capturing a lot of that volume and &#x2013; but we don't believe in making announcements until the horses are in the corral. And so when we get to that point, we will have &#x2013; we'll make those announcements. But we're very bullish on the opportunities for our condensate down there and it's not just our products pipeline experience, it's also the fact as we said many times we have an awful lot of natural gas infrastructure down there. And some of that can be converted and used for our condensate purposes. So, we feel very good about the opportunities there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one clarification I'll make just, Darren, because you kind of introduced the question around Eagle Ford joint venture. There are a lot of opportunities for us in Copano within the joint venture. There are also a lot of opportunities for us outside of the joint venture and we'll be pursuing both of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the condensate line would be a 100% Kinder Morgan venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Has there been any update on the ability to leverage that Cochin line for either Marcellus NGLs or Bakken crude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Cochin &#x2013; we're working on Bakken crude opportunities now with the major producer in the Bakken and we'll just have to see whether and if the producer can make arrangements with end users off of the Cochin system; in other words interconnecting with either other pipes or with refineries that are near the Cochin system. So that's the update on that.</p>
          <p>We continue to look at the Marcellus situation but we will not move that project forward unless and until we have shipper commitments to support it. And we don't have those at this point, so we'll just see what develops there. Also on the Cochin line as we said before we expect to have the contracts to move additional E-P mix further east on the Cochin line too. Cochin of course, as Park said, had a really very good first quarter, which was driven by a lot of cold weather up in that area but also by more movements to the Eastern part of the system. So Cochin is off to a good start this year and we expect to be able to continue to grow the uses of that pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question from me on the Terminals side, I'm just trying to get my arms around the magnitude of that coal export opportunity that you see. So if you were to include the tonnage related to the two contracts you spoke of, can you roughly quantify how much of an opportunity this could be for you? And also is it too premature for you to put a price tag out there as it could relate to incremental capital spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all if you add up the two projects that we've disclosed at IMT and at our Houston Ship Channel facility, those total about $90 million of expenditures; $70 million on one and $18 million on the other. And that will be moving up to 8.8 &#x2013; 8.2 million tons of coal, which is obviously a lot of coal; that's 6 million tons max at IMT and 2.2 million tons on the Houston Ship Channel. So that's kind of where we are today. But as we've said at the Analyst Conference, the encouraging thing is that this demand for export coal capacity remains very large and we have other opportunities at other terminals on both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast to handle additional volumes and that would require additional capital expenditures. We estimated that it could be as much as 28 million tons to 30 million tons of additional coal export capacity on top of this 8.2 million tons that we've already locked in on.</p>
          <p>And I don't know, Jeff is in the room, do you have any idea on what the capital would be to -</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About $175 million of additional expenditures to handle that additional 28 million tons to 30 million tons of coal, that would be in several different terminals and we're certainly not saying we're there yet. We have strong interest from a number of shippers, but again it is dependent on them locking in their long-term contracts, because obviously we're not going to do these deals unless, like we have at IMT and at Houston, unless we have long-term contracts. And of course we've already ramped up significantly our throughput and our capacity at our Newport News facility, Pier IX, where we're now this year going to move about 12 million tons of export coal through that facility.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Three quick things if I could touch on. And the first thing is you opened and talked about a little bit maybe excess cash flow being on a run rate basis, $100 million and it seems like you sort of hinted at the possibility of, if it stays this way, raising above your expectations at KMP. And I guess my question is, what's the production <mark type="ph" /> slide (64:22) issues at Katz and Yates, what's your thought on not just increasing coverage as opposed to paying it out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we said we have not made a decision on whether to pay it out; we'll just continue to watch for the rest of the year. Actually the numbers Park was sharing with you for upside were done a few days ago and we've actually had an additional run-up in WTI prices so that number may go even higher. But, it's a balancing process and I think Park was very clear in saying that we're certainly not talking about taking all of this excess and taking it to increase the distribution, we want to preserve excess coverage. Just pointing out we're off to a very good start for the year and we will consider on a going forward basis whether and by how much to increase the distribution.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then finally I mean you mentioned obviously the abundance of shale opportunity out there and you've spoken about the Eagle Ford. Are you looking at other &#x2013; seeing a lot of other opportunities similar to your KinderHawk where joint ventures with producers, or producers are looking to do more joint ventures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are. We're seeing good interest in that and the important thing, I think is for us again to only do it if we feel it makes economic sense obviously, and if we can satisfy that producer's needs, and what I mean by that is that clearly these producers on one hand are very interested in raising cash from taking in a partner or selling outright their systems in these shale plays. But they want to make certain that as they ramp up in those shale plays, they have plenty of ability to connect the new wells. And so it's a balancing process, and it has to be very carefully done. But yeah I think we've said this every quarter; we continue to look at those. I think they're very good opportunities; the whole shale play, very good opportunities and the Eagle Ford is the top of the list certainly, but there are other opportunities also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe could you give me just a little bit more detail on the cat field and your comments that the production response was slower than anticipated, but it's actually a positive for the long-term production, maybe just how does the production profile look differently now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure I've got the expert sitting right here, Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we put the budget together last fall, we had a production growth expectation beginning in first quarter, which was an average of early response that we saw in analog fields in the Panhandle of Oklahoma and other reservoir studies that we had done. It looks as though it's going to be the later end of the window of what we had forecasted at the budget time. In fact we've already started to see an initial production uptick in late March, early April. Three of our patterns, the smaller ones in fact, are beginning to show an initial production response and the three wells are showing a little bit of CO2 production. So it's lagging a little bit, maybe by about three months or so from what we put in the budget, but the early indications that we're seeing now is that it ought to start ramping up at this point in time for the balance of year. Of course we're going to watch it very closely and see how it actually behaves, but the comment that Rich made about late response, as long as it's not too late, could be a positive in that an early response is certainly a negative because it's usually an indicator that a small feed zone has flooded very quickly, thereby leaving it to rob CO2 from uniformly sweeping through the rest of the reservoir for the remainder of its life. So we're encouraged at this point in time that we haven't seen anything negative in that respect and hopefully the sweep efficiency will continue to be uniform, much more uniform than SACROC and therefore this will minimize operating costs of recycled CO2 long-term. So again it's very early in the game. We don't see any reason to be concerned about it; in fact I think it's well within the range of expectations that we had for this project going into it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...ask about the gas, the gas pipeline segment you sort of &#x2013; you're tracking below budget there, is that just sort of the KMIGT maybe not coming in as strong or KinderHawk coming in as strong, what's kind of driving that and how do you see that shifting as we go forward in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think as Park said for the year we expect the gas pipeline segment to be right at its plan for the year. What happened in the first quarter was that we had a contractual on the Rockies Express. This is a line where we passed through our fuel cost to customers, but in one case we had one of our shippers add a fuel cap on it and we had to true that up the volumes, the cost for the latter part of 2010 and 2011, and that hit in the first quarter on Rockies Express.</p>
          <p>On KMIGT, we are a little bit below the margin differential between &#x2013; or basis differential between the Rockies and the areas in the Midwest that KMIGT serves have not been very good, and so KMIGT on some of its programs like its PALS, its Park and Loan program had not done as well as we expected.</p>
          <p>No, KinderHawk is on target and we're actually getting very good performance in that segment from our processing assets up in Wyoming; they are not large, but they are performing very well. So overall everything pretty well balances out we think for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and here I'll just give you a little bit more detail. But as Rich said KMIGT for forecast for the year, a little bit under budget, because of what we saw in the first quarter plus impact from the rate case. We're actually a little bit under budget, operationally performing fine but just has this contractual issue on the fuel cap. The intrastates are right about their budget and then that is offset by TransColorado, Casper/Douglas, Red Cedar, Fayetteville Express, and KinderHawk are all projected to be above budget. So again TransColorado, Red Cedar, Casper/Douglas, Fayetteville Express and KinderHawk all expected to be above budget. And so overall, I think the segment is doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. And then just if I could do one more, how does sort of the integration of the &#x2013; or getting into the Watco and the rail business, are you seeing more opportunities where you'd like to expand into more rail transactions whether it's through Watco or in other ways?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have Jeff Armstrong who runs our Terminals Group is here and I'll just let him answer that directly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah absolutely. One of the things that we've seen as a benefit is Watco was one of the early movers of doing crude by rail out of the Bakken for some producers. And what we're seeing is in addition to the equity investment we made in Watco is forming another venture with them to provide third-party facilities to really unit train opportunities and I think the first one that we'll see. Watco owns a short line very close to Cushing and looking at some opportunities around there that will probably develop here in the very near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very positive on this and we've talked about this some before, if you look at it from 30,000 feet what's happening in some of these plays is two things: number one there is a lot of oil coming to market, coming faster than pipelines could be built to handle it; and secondly, you have this tremendous price differential. Everybody looks at CNBC or whatever and sees the difference between WTI and Brent. But there's also if you look closely there is a whale of it &#x2013; almost as much difference between WTI and St. James for example in Louisiana. So there is a tremendous need not just to get the crude out some time before pipelines are built but also a need to be able to be selective about where you're going to move that crude. And that's where unit train operations handling oil with the trains is very important and that's one of the big reasons why we did &#x2013; made our preferred &#x2013; our investment preferred stock in Watco and why we're now encouraging and working toward these joint ventures. And I think you'll see some announcements probably in this quarter on some specific projects there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're looking at from a unit train basis that are out there most of these contracts are five years plus as Rich said. I think the key is getting them up and up and operating on a quick basis to take advantage of these <mark type="ph" /> harps (74:50) that are out there. But we're certainly making sure any of our contracts more than cover any of the capital costs associated with these investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then when you're looking at the expansion on the coal export facilities, how quick a turnaround is there? I guess where I'm going with this is that you make $175 million investment, but I would think that you turn that investment into cash flow pretty quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so. Again I think well if I am following, Yves, for example in the two projects we've talked about on the Ship Channel because we already had the land there, we have to do some additional work, we expect to be operational in July of this year. On the project in Louisiana, we expect to be in operation mid-year 2012. So these things could be built out pretty quickly. So I think you get a good return and you get it pretty quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are we talking like 12 months for a project then?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it really I guess is more market specific, but I think 12 months is probably a good rule of thumb that's out there with regard to the expansion. Some of the smaller drips of the &#x2013; smaller incremental expansions will be on quicker than that. And some of the larger mega projects may be a little bit longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And some of that will be air permitting, right, Jeff? And so I mean that can be a variable depending upon where you are and what permits you already have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just two quick ones. The first I characterize perhaps is being na&#xEF;ve. Rich, you said that the Board approves to go ahead with engineering on the CO2 pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why do you need Board approval for the engineering and how big a project could we be talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we just shared with the Board what we thought the outline of the overall project would be and got their approval to spend around $10 million on two different parts of the project just to get the thing kicked off. And there is no question that there is going to be additional demand there and there is no question that we're going to ramp-up our production at &#x2013; in Southwest Colorado. The question is how much and the beauty of it is that we can do it on an incremental basis. And that's what some of these engineering dollars are going to go for. So we're just starting to crawl before you walk, walk before you run on that, but there's clearly a tremendous demand for additional CO2 and we're very intent on meeting that demand.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from John Edwards with Morgan Keegan. Your line is now open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi John, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty well. Just one question, Rich. Just any update on &#x2013; you had talked earlier quarters on proposed projects coming out of the Marcellus. I'm just &#x2013; what's the latest and greatest there? I think you mentioned there was some volumes coming out of it at the Analyst Meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we've mentioned, I think we've said for some time now that clearly, we're not going to build a project of that size and capital cost, unless we have long-term throughput commitments from shippers either producers in the Marcellus or aggregators in the Marcellus or users up in the Sarnia. And until and unless we get those commitments, we're not going to build anything. So that's where we stand right now. We're still looking at the situation, but unless and until we get to contracts we are not doing it. As I said earlier we are having better results on using Cochin to move ethane, EP mix and propane from the west to the east across the line. And those look pretty promising and that's what we're honing in on now. And then on the batch line basis also using it to move oil, as I indicated in response to previous questions, so there is really no &#x2013; nothing new on the Marcellus efforts at this point in time, but we continue to look at a lot of different ways to use Cochin, it's really a great opportunity for us.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Brian Zarahn with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.</p>

          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Rich. On the excess cash flow, I'll ask the same question in a different way. What would be a range of distribution coverage ratio you would be comfortable with? Would it be similar to your guidance or your budget of about 1.03 times or what would be the upper end of that range you would be comfortable with for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, we've previously, I think our budget speaks for itself. Our budget had $37 million of coverage and now we're saying that $37 million has perhaps morphed into $100 million or so. But we haven't made any exact determination; we'll just make that as we go forward during the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I'd say, Brian it depends upon the circumstances, depends upon what's generating the excess coverage, what's going on with our assets, what's going on with the overall economy and environment and I think we'll just make that decision as we go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To put it this way, it's a nice problem to have and we hope that that nice problem continues for the next quarter or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. So what's clearly a gas storage facility, any update on the contract renewal process?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I mean it comes up for renewal first quarter next year. We are in discussions with them and if we can get a deal that's satisfactory for us and for them that works renewing we'll do it otherwise we certainly are looking at other ways to get much better value out of that asset as we move into 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's put it this way that, it will be a positive for us, either we will get better terms with the present user or we will take it over ourselves and we can do better with it as &#x2013; because this is contracted at a different time. So that's going to be a plus for us in 2012 and beyond. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (81:53) asset.</p>

          <p>All right. Final question on KMI, is there any change to your budget on cash taxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's slightly favorable, but I mean it's so small it's essentially a budget number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you and thanks to all of you for listening in. I know it took a long time to get through some of this and I think in the future the KMI portion of it will be a little shorter. But we appreciate your attention. We think we had a very good quarter and we're looking forward to a very good year. Thank you.</p>
