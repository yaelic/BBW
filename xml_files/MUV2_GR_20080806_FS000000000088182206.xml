          <p>Well, good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the first half 2008 results of the Munich Re Group.  Today's call is hosted by Nikolaus von Bomhard, CEO of the Munich Re Group; as well as, J&#xF6;rg Schneider, our CFO. After the presentation, there will be time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>And with that, I hand over to our CEO, Nikolaus von Bomhard.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon to everybody. Thank you, Sascha, for the introduction. And I would go right to slide three, and give some introductory notes on the basis of this slide.  First of all, the results for the first half year 2008, we will be showing today in more detail. We consider the 1.4 billion a very robust and solid result for the first six month considering the challenging environment in the capital markets. We also see this result as a strong message that the operating businesses are doing well and that the strategy is right.</p>
          <p>As you know, the backbone of our strategy is that we do consider ourselves an underwriting company, so it's all about underwriting discipline and underwriting excellence. At the same time, at the heart of our value proposition is diversification, be it across business segments or over geographies.</p>
          <p>The second important ingredient of how we do our business is the integrated risk management, which we consider quite sophisticated, and along with it comes what we call our asset-liability management. That of course was of utmost importance over the last six month, and as you do know we started managing investment risk differently quite sometime ago, quite a couple of years ago, reducing investment risks, more specifically the sensitivity to investment market. This is an immediate consequence of our integrated risk management and our AL management.</p>
          <p>Well, the equity position as it stands by the end of the second quarter was after hedges below 7% and we were considering the benchmark portfolio, which is the result of our asset-liability management actually quite underweighed in equities.  Well, on the other hand, even considering all that we did with asset-liability management and so forth, of course, as a major investor in the capital market, we are and stay exposed to developments in the capital market. This is almost a no-brainer. And the movement that we have seen therefore had to impact our results somehow and someday, as long as the markets didn't recover, and actually our CFO, J&#xF6;rg Schneider did make mention of that on numerous occasions.</p>
          <p>So what we have seen now in the equity markets was deviating what was the basis of our earnings target that we published late last year, because we could do no better than assuming a normal development in the capital market. And what we had seen in the first half year of this year was not normal. So, this does not put fundamentally into question our exposure to risky assets. As we see it, we will not change our overall policy here, but of course it change and had to change what we expected as a result in the current year.</p>
          <p>The good news in all that of course is that the capital position of the Munich Re Group is rock solid.  It's excellent, and that in these difficult markets, even is, first of all, distinguishing us from peers, and may give us some opportunities to take up going forward.</p>
          <p>The next good news here is that all the capital efficiency measures will be executed as published and announced so far. No change to either capital repatriation through share buybacks or dividend policy. So far a general view from the group perspective, and briefly only highlighting two of our major business segments, and starting with P&amp;C reinsurance, I am still on slide three.</p>
          <p>Here it is important that the underwriting and risk appetite of course is predefined, it's not just sort of left up to the underwriter to decide that, so is it with the risk tolerances that goes for both sides of the balance sheet, but certainly also for the liability side. We still and probably as long as I live never will have volume targets in our reinsurance business. We are strict and adhere to value-based management, and over the years now we have become pretty ruthless when it comes to cycle management and all that comes with it, including drop in turnover.</p>
          <p>The increase of businesses of course that are less exposed to volatile markets or cycles are a important piece of our strategic modeling, that means we will continue to develop niche businesses, and Midland is an living example of that strategy. Unfortunately, of course, barriers to entry in the reinsurance business are still relatively low. We feel that they are starting to grow higher, but they are still relatively low. On the other hand, we ourselves do not consider us a commodity provider, when it comes to reinsurance. We have a very deep and long lasting experience in the business, and a unique client access; in other words, we have the leading position in many of our markets, and this we do consider our franchise value, which should make us better in reinsurance than most of our peers.</p>
          <p>Touching briefly on primary insurance, Mr. Oletzky, the new CEO of ERGO late last year presented his vision of ERGO for 2012, the let's say founding blocks of his vision are &#x2013; have been and are a multichannel distribution approach, and here, of course <mark type="inaudible" /> is the strengthening of the broker channel. The second important issue is diversification geographically, internationalization of ERGO's businesses. They are well underway. The next important step will be taking over the majority in the Austrian insurance company, Bank Austria Creditanstalt Versicherung, which was so far owned as a majority owner by Vienna Insurance Group.</p>
          <p>At the same time, and that is certainly a challenge is to develop the position of ERGO in the provision market, this goes first of all for Germany in life. Business in Germany, of course, we have an uphill struggle still to grow our new businesses. It's not about growth for its own sake, it's about growth that economically make sense, and that is not an easy one in Germany so far, but we think with the initiative underway for new products in the German life market, we should do better going forward. And the last and another important founding block of his vision, which recently also made it to the media top lines, headlines is the further development of what ERGO calls its operation model, and that is actually all about improving the relative competitive position of ERGO by becoming even better on efficiency.</p>
          <p>So far maybe two major business segments of the group, let me start with one further statement that I will repeat towards the end. We are committed to our mid-term targets that includes all that we have published under the heading of Changing Gear. This path will be followed, but it will not be linear all the time. So there will be ups and downs, but the earnings per share target of &#x20AC;18 by 2010 through a mix of earnings growth, efficiency measures, and capital management is to stand.</p>
          <p>And as I said, this may give some light on the horizon, the current markets will hopefully open up more opportunities for those who stand solidly on both their feet, and may even be that the reinsurance cycle, sooner or later, as a consequence of tighter capital positions may turn the corner, and the markets turn a little harder, here or there.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, another opportunity as we see it is of course all that comes with credit risk. We are ready to increase our position. We did so in the recent past very prudently and slowly, but we are ready to do it both on the asset and liability side of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>To sum it up, still on slide three, of course, I can't say that I am particularly pleased about the current environment, because I don't like to change our earnings target. On the other hand of course this kind of environment should open up chances for someone like us.  We are not gambling, so we are very serious when it comes to take up these chances, but we are ready to do so.  So, you can rest assure that we will no &#x2013; never overstretch ourselves, and do what we can digest, no more and no less.  That's it as regard to slide three, and I have one more slide to come slide four, and that is a challenging slide. And if you have questions, you will have to put them later on to J&#xF6;rg Schneider.</p>
          <p>Well, some of you may have been surprised by the timing of our announcement of our change of the guidance as regard to our targets. The good news was, as I could see, that most of the analysts, and most them reported back to us, considered what we did rather an accounting event than a real earnings event. And the point being that our target for 2008, as I said earlier on, was of course based on normalized assumptions as regards either the development on the claim side, when it comes to huge individual losses, cat or man-made, or of course, the capital market. And if you look back to 2007, we actually incessantly repeated that 2007, even though being an extremely good year, on a normalized basis would have been much closer to 3.0 to 3.1 billion than to the 3.9. This, on the background of all this, of course, we also made, several times mentioned the fact that when it comes to impairments, banks will show them earlier than the insurance companies, and if the markets don't recover, we sooner or later will have to come up with some impairments as well.</p>
          <p>And in July <mark type="inaudible" /> we felt that assuming a quick recovery of the equity markets would be rather dreaming of something nice than being realistic, and that is why we felt with the earnings guidance that we had out that we should and must react swiftly. Maybe five messages as regards to this slide. One is this slide tries to reconcile what an external viewer could have calculated as a possible consequence of the market's behavior, and we put right into the second big line what the actual impact was. The figures actually are calibrated as a starting point to year-end 2007.</p>
          <p>One good news here, if you go to the right side of that slide, that apparently we managed quite well because what you could have expected as a result of all that would have been a 2.7 hit on shareholders' equity, and actually the hit was by 0.5 billion smaller, and that is a mixture of foresight and very active and successful asset management. Our view is the benefit goes to all our ALM team, but at least as much to our asset manager, MEAG, who at the right point in time, either hedged or managed down our equity position and kept their fingers off credit risk as long as they had to.</p>
          <p>Another message here is that if you sum up all write-ups, impairments, realized gains and losses on disposal, including derivatives, from the shareholder position actually the hit was relatively minor. It was a negative double digit million hit only. It may surprise to why is our result actually short, because, and this is what you see in the blue square here in the second line, this is the 0.3 billion that is the impact of underperformance on our P&amp;L due to the fact that in the first half year '08 we did not realize gains on our equities, but normally assuming a market development with equities increasing the value over time we would have realized. So we worked into our 4.5 return on investments, and assumed return over time on our equities of somewhere between 7.5 to 8%, mostly or more or less half is dividend, other half is harvesting, since we had zero harvesting in the first half year, this is where we had sort of a hold in our P&amp;L of somewhere close to &#x20AC;300 million, and that is actually whether we solved it lower than it should have been.</p>
          <p>And maybe two more smaller messages, but very important. The one is the blue box at the lower end of the slide, even if the capital markets would not now change or if they even did recover, we have sort of a still outrunning impairment duty to realize in our P&amp;L, and that has to do with a six month rule of impairment according to the IFRS standards. So even if markets would move sideways, for example, or slightly recover, there may be some more impairment. It really depends on the level of recovery, and on the timing of recovery.</p>
          <p>And maybe an even more surprising, but not for the specialists of course, remark is if markets did really recover well, it might and will actually hector or will lead to a revaluation of our derivatives, but that then would work the other way around, it would be to the expense of our P&amp;L and the write-ups according to the IFRS rules on the underlyings we would not see. It's actually then up to the decision of the management whether or not we do realize these appreciations of our equities. But, from a pure accounting standpoint, we would rather with a recovery of the equity markets see a further downturn of our bottom line. This is all to the slide. If there is any question, it can be referred to J&#xF6;rg, but before answering cells, will now give you more detail on the financials.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Nikolaus. Good afternoon. I will start with slide six that is the overview of the consolidated result. Our gross premiums written were slightly down. The foreign exchange-driven decline in reinsurance was offset by growth from acquisitions, but also from positive organic developments.</p>
          <p>In reinsurance, the combined ratio was 99.6, somewhat above our 98% target. For the second quarter, it was better than in the first quarter with 95.4%. In primary insurance, we were with 91 clearly below our target of 95, and again on a very good level, also in comparison with the market.  The group investment result was down 42%, Nikolaus has described most of the reasons. It was due to the impairments and lower realized gains. The operating result was down by 24%, and the consolidated result down 700 million, and this reduction also owing to the declining investment result.</p>
          <p>Let me put a little more light on that investment result. On slide seven, you can see on the upper part the calculation of our return on investments for the second quarter on a standalone basis, and on the lower part the first half year. The regular income in the first quarter was relatively strong with 5.4% return. This is not surprising, because we have almost all the dividend income from our shares in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The gains/losses on the disposal of investments were very low with 134 million only. And the write-downs/write-ups on of investments, the contribution was minus 671, very high and very negative figure. So this led us to the investment result of 3.7% instead of well above 4.5, which one would expect for a second quarter.</p>
          <p>On the lower part first half year similar developments with regular income, which was a little bit down, minus 5.2% in comparison to last year's number for two reasons. One was the lower reinsurance deposit after the cancellation of a couple of very large reinsurance treaties, and the second was the impact from currencies. Since the investment income from foreign investments translated into euros comes up with a lower number there. The impact has been over 100 million just from that source.</p>
          <p>The other income and expenses are also somewhat around 300 million lower, minus 500 instead of minus 200 last year. This is the impact from the revaluation of the asset for unit-linked life policies.  There is a balancing effect on the expense side, and therefore this is huge for the Company, this impact of some &#x20AC;300 million difference in comparison to last year, it's minus 20 &#x2013; 220 instead of plus around &#x20AC;80 million last year.</p>
          <p>Gains and losses on the disposal of investments were just 876 million and write-downs/write-ups minus 1.1 billion, these two were the major drivers of the decline. And I would like to go into that in &#x2013; with some more detail on the two following slides.</p>
          <p>First, write-down/write-ups. Thanks to our very careful investment policy with regard to credit risk, we had very little depreciations on fixed-interest securities only &#x20AC;30 million. The depreciations to the write-downs on equities on balance were minus 2.163 billion, and this is due to three accounting rules. First being the application of hedge accounting. So wherever we have a clear hedge connection between an underlying asset here mostly and in particular, stock position, and a derivative, be it put option or forward sales, we can apply hedge accounting that means when the derivative goes up in case of declining stock markets, the underlying goes down, but not only on the balance sheet, but also through the P&amp;L. So these expenses are immediately booked, contribution 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Second rule, "once impaired always impaired." So that means whenever we had an impairment on an individual stock in a company of our group, each decline of its value is immediately reflected on the P&amp;L, minus 700 million. Third rule, the 20% or six month rule, it was mainly the 20% rule, which this year &#x2013; in the last half year was &#x20AC;500 million. The derivatives were correspondingly up &#x20AC;1.1 billion, and this partially compensates the write-downs on the shares.</p>
          <p>Overall, total net write-downs/write -ups were minus 1.164 billion, and the change was minus &#x20AC;724 million, which was quite substantial. The net effect after policyholders was some &#x20AC;836 million from these total write-downs/write-ups.</p>
          <p>Second major impact on slide nine that is lower gains on disposal. And I would especially like to point your attention to the previous year numbers in the second column. There were some gains from disposals of fixed-interest securities, mainly from the first quarter. We had very little gains from disposal of shares, second line, in comparison to 1.75 billion in the preceding year. We had some gains from disposals of derivatives, which were sold just before expiry, and there were almost no gains from disposal from real estate instead of the huge gains from the transactions in 2007, which were done at exactly the right point in time.</p>
          <p>Total net realized gains were 876, with a net impact of slightly above 600 million after policyholders and taxes, and the change in comparison to last year was minus 1.1 billion. And this was due to our quite careful policy in weak markets where we did not sell to the same amount as we did last year.</p>
          <p>And last but not least on the last &#x2013; on the next slide 10, there is the impact on our unrealized gains and losses on shareholders' equity from the weak capital markets. The investments were reduced by 5.6% or &#x20AC;10 billion to 166 billion compared to last year, and this was a reduction of 5.6 billion of non-fixed-interest securities, mainly equities, and minus 4.2 from fixed-interest securities.</p>
          <p>The currency impact within these numbers was &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Going into the lines below, what was the reason. First for &#x2013; on the right hand side for the non-fixed-interest securities, there is a change of unrealized gains and losses, 1.9 billion was the net effect on the shareholders' equity after policyholders and taxes. And there was an impact of &#x20AC;2.4 billion from sales, write-down, and especially from the currency impact.</p>
          <p>On the other side, on the left side of the slide, there is the same calculation for fixed-interest securities with rising interest rates, the unrealized gains and losses went down quite substantially with &#x20AC;1.7 billion, and net of policyholders and taxes, &#x20AC;753 million. And the amortized costs went down by 2.4 billion with sales, purchases, and basically also with currency effect. So, this decline from the interest rate increases, what does it mean to us?</p>
          <p>On one hand, this is a loss of market value, a loss of shareholders' equity. On the other hand, from an economic point of view, we are the beneficiary of such development, because the duration of our liabilities on average is higher than the duration of our asset portfolio especially in primary and reinsurance life. And therefore, this is a pure accounting effect. And on an economic basis, rising interest rates are to some extent good for us. That brings me to the development of the shareholders' equity on slide 11.</p>
          <p>First, there is an overall reduction of &#x20AC;4 billion, and what it is due to, that is a decline of the unrealized gains and losses of 2.771 billion.  Whereas on the other hand, a consolidated result of 1.4 billion, and a very strong distribution to shareholders with 1.1 billion dividend and an additional billion from share buybacks. The development of the shareholders' equity in the second quarter alone was minus &#x20AC;2.285 billion, and this is widely explained by the share buybacks, the dividend, which &#x2013; and the reduction of the exchange rates in the last three months.</p>
          <p>To summarize it all, the impact from the weak capital markets were to some extent limited, and this is due to what Nikolaus described before, we brought down our exposure to equities very substantially as you can see on Slide 12 of this presentation, and especially when you compare there is a long development down from 15% exposure to equities or after hedges 13.1% a year ago down to 13.8 or 10.8% after hedges at the end of 2007, and then you see a sharp decline, and that is not only due to market development, but even though due to active management which Nikolaus described before. This derisking policy is not only part of our asset management philosophy, but I would call it an essential of the whole policy of the group of companies.</p>
          <p>On slide 13 on the left-hand side, the various elements of derisking in the last couple of years except for the lowered equity gearing, reduced concentration risk, very moderate credit risks still. On the bottom insurance risks, with high diversification of different line of business, and in between a strong asset-liability management, and this was very much reflected by the market development of the Munich Re stock, which you can see on the right hand side. We have a significantly reduced Beta from the Munich Re stock, which is now below one for two uninterrupted year, so this derisking is really reflected in a significant reduction of our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>Coming now to the segment results on page 14, that's the overview, just a preliminary remark here, ERGO optimized its capital base by paying a dividend of 1 billion to its parent company, Munich Re AG and the minority shareholders. For Munich Re AG, it was an income of &#x20AC;947 million, and this is now reflected in the segment results, and illustrated in the chart here by the shaded areas of the bars which are shown here. So, adjusted for this dividend of ERGO, there was a decline &#x2013; reduction of all the operating profit and consolidated results, which was due to the lower investment result. There is not much more to explain here except for primary insurance life and health, you see there an increase in operating result and in consolidated result, but this is due to very technical effect. It's very difficult to translate for German life insurance companies, the profit-sharing rules between shareholders and policyholders from the basis on which it is calculated, that is local GAAP and annual basis into the basis of IFRS on a quarterly basis. And we used here some simplification rules, which work in very strange ways here. And so this result from the life and health business was somewhat inflated, and you should not expect it to be repeated in the second half of the year.  So, this cannot be extrapolated. In primary insurance property-casualty, we had a relatively strong result which was not disturbed by any accounting effect.</p>
          <p>Few remarks on the two segments.  Reinsurance, the overview on page 16, the organic growth and acquisitions partly compensate for the negative currency development. So, a very slight decline in the turnover here. The investment result went up, but just due to an ERGO dividend of 947 million.  The combined ratio was higher than expected for the first half, and quite normal and rather positive in the second quarter. The operating result on an adjusted basis adjusted for the ERGO dividend was 1.6 billion instead of the 2.6 billion here, and therefore down which cannot surprise under these circumstances.</p>
          <p>Premium development on page 17, and it's the minus 300 million, and that means that a negative foreign exchange effect of 922 was two-thirds compensated by the result of exhibitions and organic changes.  The acquisitions were the acquisition of Midland and Sterling with a contribution of roughly 160 million each for the second quarter. Midland in property-casualty and Sterling in health reinsurance. The organic growth in property-casualty made up for the remainder of the foreign exchange effect to be compensated. So, we have a flat development there. In health insurance, apart from the development &#x2013; from the acquisition of Sterling, good development here. In reinsurance life, you see minus 12.4% largely explained by currency effect, but also from the reduction of large accounts here with very high volume, low margin and low embedded values.</p>
          <p>Property-casualty on the next slide, you see the development of the combined ratio over the last year. We had a quite strong impact this year from natural catastrophes with 6.6 percentage points or five &#x2013; &#x20AC;425 million. And additionally, we had &#x20AC;352 million from man-made catastrophes. On an adjusted basis, so without man-made, without NatCat, we see a slight deterioration in comparison to last year, which fits quite well to the market developments, which Nikolaus will describe later on, when he would inform you about the development of the latest contract renewals.</p>
          <p>But before a few remarks on primary insurance, the overview on page 20. The organic growth in property-casualty and health made up for 1.8% increase. Investment result was only half of that of the preceding year. Combined ratio strong with 91%, and operating result rather satisfactory, but as I said before was somewhat inflated by accounting effects on primary life insurance.</p>
          <p>The premium development on page 21, we had a quite pleasant organic growth from our Eastern European subsidiary companies, especially from motor business and engineering business, which also came in at a rather satisfying profitability. We had organic growth in health, on one hand new business abroad and also increase in premiums from our &#x2013; with our flagship DKV.  And the investment change here is the acquisition of our new subsidiary, DAUM Direct from Korea. In life, you see a decline of 2.6% premium income, but this is IFRS premiums. Apart from it, there is a growing importance as you can see two slides later of investment-oriented product, which went up with 36%, and therefore in total the total premium income, not only the IFRS premiums, were up 1.9%.</p>
          <p>New business is shown on the following slide with an annual premium equivalent that is the fourth column of the upper schedule here which went up 15%. That sounds very high, but in Germany this is due to the increase in regular premiums mainly due to the fourth Riester stage, which came in more or less automatically. In our international business, we had a very nice increase from single premiums. But overall, we are not totally satisfied with the development on &#x2013; of our distribution here, which is especially in Germany somewhat below market average.</p>
          <p>A brief look on the next slide. We put a lot of emphasis in product development and distribution on unit-linked and investment-type products of different kinds. We will see substantial growth.  Currently, most of the business is either in &#x2013; it comes either in the form of normal mutual unit-linked business or the more sophisticated product have to be written out of Luxembourg.  We hope that we can do that in future also in a different regulatory environment in Germany. On the right hand side, you can see that the share of these investment-oriented products in the total premium is already some 15% in the first half this year. Good news from the combined ratio in property-causality primary insurance, I don't want to say like always because I am always grateful for it, but I have a lot of confidence in our ERGO colleagues to run that success on a sustainable basis. So, we had some fluctuations from one quarter to the next, which has to also with the change in business mix with more motor business coming in, fortunately not from Germany but from countries with a better profitability with that regard. And we had in the second quarter also natural catastrophe claims, which were slightly higher than the year before, especially with the storm Hilal, and we had a declining expense ratio, which was reduced mainly due to lower administrative expenses so far for the moment with primary insurance.</p>
          <p>And now back to Nikolaus for his report on the latest renewal and some remarks on capital management.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Thank you, J&#xF6;rg. I am back.  First of all, starting with the reinsurance renewals July 2008, I have to mention that we have more material in the backup of our presentation, so I have to restrict myself to the slides you have in the bronze package. Slide 26, here you see a break-up first of all of the businesses that were up for renewal on July 1. And if we summarize it up, it's about 10% of our treaty book that was up for renewal. And to make a long story short, in view of pressure on the, luckily on the prices in the first place and less so on conditions, our volume &#x2013; our turnover in reinsurance came down by something close to 9%. This is a consequence of active cycle management, and does not worry us in the first place. Of course, the rate decrease of something round about 3.5% is more worrying, but this is nicely &#x2013; it's a euphemism, nicely in line what we have seen actually over the year up to today. If we look at the entire &#x2013; almost entire book that has been renewed now through the year, close to 95% of that book now, we could see that on average over the year the rate decrease has been somewhere close to 3% -- slightly below 3%.  So, this is in line, it's not a dramatic increase of that rate &#x2013; decrease. This is the good news here.  But we are working in the soft market environment. No doubt about that. The down cycle overall, if we look back a year from today, probably has been a little bit less pronounced than people would have suspected at the time. This is good news, and of course, when it comes to where did all that happen, where did we see the rate decreases and so forth, it's a very, very mixed basket.  It would be related to renewals certainly we would mention casualty in the first place, casualty U.S. may be even the frontrunner. There we shut off quite some businesses this year on the non-proportional, way more than on proportional.  But, if you want more detail on this, I would really like to leave it up for questions later on.</p>
          <p>If we go one slide further, then we see the name of the game clearly is cycle management when it comes to reinsurance P&amp;C.  These days this is nothing new. One should not have volume targets as we don't and what we try to do and do it as I see it quite successfully is to be really also up to our underwriters when it comes to reviewing what they do. So, we have a couple of peer reviews underway actually permanently, and we are also getting better in doing that. And the consequences that had to be drawn are drawn immediately. At the same time, as a service, maybe a service for both ends, we are exchanging way more information again with cedants reviewing also their underwriting specifically when we have proportional reinsurance participations.</p>
          <p>And last not least very important is that due to the extent possible, dynamically monitor what's going on at the underwriting &#x2013; on the underwriting front with IT tools.  We are also getting better and better there. So after all a strategic founding block for us in reinsurance is that we go into the niches, as I said earlier on, we try to find the businesses that are less, let's say, exposed to cycles and volatility, and that we are quite successful, and if you wonder why our top line over the year or over the last half year did not really drop so much as we always talk about cycle management, this is why, because we could refill partly with other businesses, not in the first place to make-up the top line again, but rather to grow net income sustainably.  So, we do indeed actively manage our portfolio, very much so, and the fact that you always see something between 15 and 20% of the businesses cancelled and partly replaced, I think is a nice proof of that activity as such.</p>
          <p>Differential terms, when it comes to setting conditions with our lines play more and more an important role, maybe less so in the smaller, as we call them, renewals in the course of the year, but certainly so on the January 1 renewal with the big, big treaties, they are called premiums, to date. A little bit of good news was there in all that sort of gloomy outlook for the industry overall, U.S. hurricane risks and U.S. hurricane exposures have been priced as we see it on a decent profitable level again in July 1, and this is an important renewal, and also we see a little bit of a turning the corner in Australia. Of course, losses helped sometimes. It's of course you pay the bill first, and then you get return. But, at least, it's a good time that the market is reacting to that. And of course, we hope not for the losses, but for more obvious returns.</p>
          <p>Well, I am turning two slides over, I am entering the topic of financial strength and capital efficiency.  First of all, let me say that we do of course not disclose economic capital buffers on a quarterly basis, we do it on a yearly basis, and at year end '07, the buffer was quite big, standing close to 18 billion due to repatriation of capital. And, of course, to &#x2013; as a consequence of the capital markets development, this position is now a lesser one. It's reduced.  But, of course, we come from a higher level.  So, this is nothing to worry us. Quite to the contrary, as I said earlier in my introductory notes today, a position that we have on our capital is such that we have a solid stand to take up opportunities, and I must say there is less of a criticism in the sense that we are way, way, way too much capitalized, because some people tended to forget sometimes how important a solid capital position is for a major, if not the most important reinsurance player. We are expected to be the last man standing. So, we have to be solidly capitalized. And at the same time, we don't want to be dependent too much on other people's goodwill. So, debt leverage and interest coverage are on as we see decent level. They still leave us with some flexibility, when we think the timing is right, but we are not dependent also when it comes to repossession or other means to shed-off risk from our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Well, last but not least, two more slides to come.  Why?  Because, of course, when it comes to manage our capital, we always talked about the local balance sheet so much in the past. And we thought it would be good to show you why it is so important, and why there are some big differences between economic view, the IFRS equity view, and the local balance sheet view.</p>
          <p>And this is slide 30 now. There you see that the differences are enormous, and even the development is very different. Let's just go right to the right hand side, HGB, our local GAAP balance sheet, there you see that the equities position, even though we had these very successful years, it shrink, in fact, it's almost counterintuitive. It's less than it's used to be, whereas on the economic view, you clearly see how much economic value have been produced over the last years. And to sum it up maybe one more slide 31.</p>
          <p>Here we tried to &#x2013; of course, in a pretty robust way to show you where the pockets hit, where all the value that has been produced over the last years did disappear if you like. And we always said, and you do know it that the German way to set up a balance sheet with HGB is a pretty conservative way to do it. And what we try to do here is visualizing these &#x2013; the major components. And there's these two that have been discussed many times, the equalization provisions or the equalization reserves and other similar provisions, and valuations reserves that are made up both by reserves on investments or participations.</p>
          <p>We, in theory of course, can manage the two, but only indirectly, and one has to be very careful when you do it. All that is being repatriated as capital to our shareholders must come out of the two dark blue equity positions, so this kind of draw has always to be refilled once we pay back capital. And of course, we did pay back quite some, so that also contributed to the shrinkage of this position with a dividend of ERGO, which is a consequence of our asset capital management.  Of course, we refilled and we will continue to do so within reasonable terms.</p>
          <p>The equalization reserve is not the one that lends itself most obviously to management, because it has an algorithm that is used to sort of fill the equalization reserve that goes 15 years back. So one has to really think twice what one does, but of course, we can manage it to some extent and maybe more so even the so called similar provisions. When it comes to valuation reserves, we talked in the first place about reserves on investments, and here of course the question is do we want and when do we want to realize these. Of course, it cannot be in our interest to overstretch the capital position in the local balance sheet, because this is the solvency position after all, when it comes to local authorities, so far, and it is the source of dividends and share buybacks. So if we expose the company too much on the asset side by realizing all possible gains there, we might run into very volatile situation.</p>
          <p>Well finishing it off, last slide. Guidance for the consolidated result in '08, of course, after the experience we have made with the guidance we put our first, we are cautious.  But what we dare to say is that the result for the current year should come in well above 2 billion. Of course that still has a proviso that has to include the extreme, extreme events, that of course is not worked into this number, but what is foreseeable as of today is worked into that number, and of course, the RORAC according to this number should be well above 10%.</p>
          <p>The premium, of course not so much &#x2013; not of so much important to us; it would probably stay more or less unchanged given that the currencies will stay stable. Very important to many of you, a little less to me is the combined ratio. Here we think we still can come up with 98.  We need a little bit, a little bit of luck when it comes into &#x2013; when we go into the second half as we got NatCat slightly above what we budget for, but this is not completely out of reach, that's why the 98 is still there.  On the primary side, as J&#xF6;rg put it very nicely beforehand, we are well within that range. We are below 95 as of today, and we do not see any reason why we shouldn't achieve the 95.</p>
          <p>The return on investment target, which was considered not very ambitious over the last years, this year turned out to be quite ambitious. Of course, we left the assumption as it is, 4.5.  But as of today, we would say it would probably come in rather slightly south of 4.0. That, of course, all then will contribute to what we call a lower target range for the current year.</p>
          <p>Yes, the most important thing, however I think is that the mid-term target are to stand, and this I can reconfirm, the mid-term targets are to stand both earnings per share and RORAC. There is no change necessary what we see right now, we consider the July a turmoil, but a limited in time turmoil. We are not nervous about it, we think we can manage, we are on course, and we will stay on course.</p>
          <p>So far thank you very much, and now Sascha, I hand it back to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you very much. And two questions. One is on the expense ratio, there seems to be some seasonality in reinsurance, it went down some 32% in the second quarter '07 to 27.7. And I just wondered, what's at work there, is it a consolidation effect or anything? And the other is on the stated &#x2013; the reported balance sheet for the second quarter, the line, other liabilities, which appears towards the bottom, and went down quite sharply. It went down from 10.8 billion, the figure is 10.762 to 9.328, it's position F IV, I think it is.  And I just wondered what's is at work there, whether you are reducing your debt or something? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the expense ratio, no, there is no seasonality in it. It's rather strongly fluctuating, that is true, that has to do with commission ratios and also very much sometimes with deferred acquisition cost effect. So, it should only be looked at on a longer-term basis, on an annual basis.  With regard to your second question, I come back to that in a couple of seconds, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. Just two questions please.  First one on the distributable earnings at the end of June, I wondered if you could give us a sense of what that number would be in comparison to the 0.7 billion at the end of last year. And also perhaps you could give us a sense of what steps you can take to increase that number, and at levels which you think you can get that by whatever measure at your disposal?  The second point is just on the regular investment income. If you look at the next accounts, and you take the total regular investment income and you take out the life and health business, the investment income fell from 2.044 billion in the first half of last year to 1.789 billion in the first half of this year, which is a 12.5% fall. And I just wonder, if you could give us a sense of what are the moving parts in that? Obviously currency is one. But is it a case of its falling assets and lower running yields? And also I guess on that point, why is your investment income is falling?  I would have thought it should be rising given the increase in yields, and as you just said yourself, the increase in spreads. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is true, James. It should be, in the long run, it should be driving due to the higher interest rate level, but there is a very strong currency impact involved here. So, for example, Q2 versus Q2 last year, it's a decline in the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate of some 13.8% or so. So it's rather big. And that is the impact here. And also we have lower deposits from the big life treaties I mentioned before, and these also very high volumes, which now go down. And to the last question of Michael Huttner, and there is really an impact from a decreasing amount owed to bank as to June here. This is due to paying off loans in the amount of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, so nothing spectacular here. And James could you repeat your first question here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was on the HGB revenue reserve, which I think, according to the slide was 700 million at the end of last year. I just wondered what that figure was at the end of June, given obviously the move you had after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We do not set up HGB accounts on a quarterly basis, and therefore we do not want to disclose these numbers, because we do internal calculations, which are also not audited. But it went substantially up due to the effect of the ERGO dividend, which was mentioned. We financed our share buyback and our dividend out of that, but in addition we also did some intra-group transactions to raise the level of the revenue reserve, and that was the reason why it is currently in the order of some &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is there much you can do to get that up further? I mean, are there sort of other intra-group transactions? Because obviously two billion doesn't give you a lot of headroom to play with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One could also consider doing more transactions of that kind, but just within boundaries, because as you can see the capital markets move, and therefore what is currently an unrealized gain can transform into a zero number or so. So, we would just do that very carefully. What we can also do is we can transfer participation internally within the group, but that shouldn't be done to a large extent. So there is some buffer left, but not enormous amounts. But it's enough to serve the purpose that is to finance our very solid and uninterrupted stream of share buybacks and distribution of dividends.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. First one. You commented on the renewed business in July.  I was just wondering, one of your competitors mentioned something about new businesses being some opportunities there, and that actually net, net perhaps the rate environment was not too bad. So I was just wondering if you could comment on the new business, whether you saw the same sort of rates? The second question is you also mentioned about the IT systems and you are seeing better data management effectively a more real time data management from your perspective. I was wondering whether you might give us a bit more color there, what that data is, how quickly you are getting the information, and whether it's regional, global, or what sort of level you're seeing that information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First of the all, as regard to the new business, I don't have a number at hand. Of course, we did also the exercise once that we put altogether cancelled business and new business, and this rough calculation did also show a rate decrease still. There was one competitor who shows an, I think, it's zero sum gain. If we did that and we did that exercise too, in our case it still would have been negative. Of course, the new business is better than the old business, otherwise we wouldn't have taken it on our balance sheet. But, I can't give you a separate number for new business alone. One thing is for sure, it must sort of come in at a level that is compatible to our RORAC requirement, and it did that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But then it would broadly similar to the renewed business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But of course the cancelled had been worse, there is no question, but it is not the way that we sort of, each change at the market is such, it's tough to kick out cancelled business, take in new business, and you come up with a better book afterwards. That would mean that competitors leave very interesting business on the table and unfortunately, even though the market is a little bit in-transparent here and there to get transparent, and we have the brokers on the game too to make sure that these inefficiencies are managed away.</p>
          <p>Well, the second question, of course, is that the point is that you come as close as possible to your underwriters. Of course, it's a dream to do it on a daily basis, we try to get as close as possible, and it's a very important tool also for the managers in the hierarchy when they run their books to know, as close as possible, what's going on. So what do we look at? Of course we look at underwriting margins and rate developments. So, as we always say, the underwriters do not have their own risk capital are not incentivised even on the return on the risk capital, they are rather incentivised by penetrating the market with certain margins. And what we try to come with these tools is the margin development. But the key fact in all that and this is the most challenging one is loss expectation. What is the loss expectation that goes into their numbers, and then you see that is not so easy to follow up. Because the loading has to do with risk capital, and that is easier, but when it comes to loss expectation, and that's why we do the revenues really it becomes a little more of a difficult exercise, but it's all about margin and rate development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now move to our next question today from William Morgan from Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have got three questions. The first one is on the P&amp;C reinsurance business. I guess you are talking about cutting your book back more, it sounds like you are talking more liberally about a kind of soft market environment now. And so while you mentioned that clearly there are some acquisitions that could help stabilize the top line, and there is some top line opportunity, I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what extent you might see the top line declining as we look into 2009, for example? I know you don't measure top line, you don't have top line targets, but I just wondered if you could give us a bit of a sense on that. And related to it, I guess, if I normalize the large caps in the second quarter, and if I calculate the combined ratio based upon, I guess, now we would calculate it out of your reported numbers, it looks like your underlying, and you having on four points below than expected cap, it's maybe about 100 in the second quarter.  Now I know you're looking at it on a quarterly basis, it's not exactly represented. But you are still kind of running presumably at 98 for the six months a little bit. I just wondered, if you are perhaps starting to see the kind of profitability at the P&amp;C side starting to wane somewhat, and whether or not that could be accelerating if you start up the other business more, if you have been doing these, your renewals?</p>
          <p>The second question I have just related to some of these impairments. I mean, obviously, you've kind of given some kind of general guidance, and obviously the movements in the equity markets are quite volatile, and it's hard to exactly predict.  But do you have any sense in terms of what the incremental impairments are that you have got in your P&amp;L since the half year, if you are unable to say it &#x2013; are you able to say what at the half year was the value of equities on your balance sheet that have already been impaired?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the question on the P&amp;C reinsurance and cutting back, and more talk of the soft market these days. We &#x2013; first of all, we should not talk the market down ourselves in the first place. It is always a two step &#x2013; edged sword that we stop talking about soft markets too early, because then it may be self-fulfilling prophecy, but we always said we think market started to move. We always said as well that the markets will not fall off the clip right away, and this is exactly what has happened. The bad thing about this is when will it all stop, and it's very difficult to predict. That's why &#x2013; and you are right in assuming we don't run our book on a top line basis. We do not foresee what will happen generally, one with the capital markets being in too much turmoil still, and with the capital positions of some peers only expected more or less typical what to foresee what they will do. So, what will happen to the top line, we couldn't actually really care less. You might use it as a proxy, but I think, it's a difficult and dangerous proxy even, because as J&#xF6;rg mentioned, we cut down a lot in life reinsurance on huge quota shares so that means a lot less top line, that at the same time was will refilled partly with much smaller treaties with much higher profitability.</p>
          <p>So that's why we actually tried to develop our net income in the first place. And we think for smart, intelligent people there's still room to grow your net income, specifically when you go onto the niches. But in the traditional raw bread and butter Reinsurance business, as of today, I can say it's not easy to grow your book. Actually, you probably will have to shrink it. It may change by January 1; I am not sure. I hope it will. As regards the combined ratio question, actually, we think, yes, the loss ratios will go up a little bit because that's an obvious consequence of the market turning softer, but it will not be something that will change the picture overnight dramatically.</p>
          <p>If you do take out NatCat budget and real burden through NatCat, we are still well in the 90% range. We're not north of 100% combined yet because we move up closer and closer, but still we are in the green zone, if you like. And I don't &#x2013; but I can't tell you really when we will cross that line. We will &#x2013; since we do not run our book on combined ratio, actually crossing it does not necessarily mean that now we are in big trouble. It depends on the business split, on the split of lines of business that you have. But since we did cut down on the longer tale business recently, of course, the combined ratio should rather be lower than higher. If we cut down on workers' comp, as we did, that would mean lower combined ratio should be better.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, of course, we did move up on the layers scale, and that normally means that you need, as we did with the NatCat budget, we increased it also last year. But you might need, in very good years, more of a not affected range of combined ratios. So the volatility might increase a little bit for the fact that we move up higher in the exposure zones. Overall, again, we're still in the green zone, but it's very difficult to predict what will happen over the next half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the impairment, you asked about what we expect for the second half. This is difficult to predict. I have a number in our internal estimation. This is based on a capital market scenario where capital markets stay more or less on the same level with a very moderate performance in the second half. In this case, the six month rule would buy it, and we would see impairments in a mid triple digit million range, mid to high triple digit million range.</p>
          <p>Please bear with me that I don't want to give you the precise number because it's so difficult to predict with the individual stocks moving differently from the average, and also the individual situation with hedged or non-hedged being so difficult. Therefore, this should give you a good indication. And this is, by the way, nothing which worries us in any way, because it has all been digested in the capital position. Next question.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Can I just ask about the M&amp;A? Just looking at your profit produced from the two deals that really were contributing in second quarter, they didn't seem to earn very much; this is the health business and the specialty underwriting business. Could you maybe discuss those results and say a little bit about the outlook? And then I suppose related, could you maybe comment &#x2013; I think there was a comment on the screens from you before on seeing prices generally still quite high, and not wanting to get involved. Could you maybe comment where you see interesting M&amp;A opportunities at the moment, whether it's closed books, or open books or emerging markets, or whatever? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ben. Thank you. First of all, of course, it's a little early, when we talk about the more recent acquisitions, to come up with a statement saying this is extremely good business or this is just good business. What one can say today is we very closely follow up, of course, all the integration of these businesses that, against the business plan that was the basis for our decision to acquire, so far has been kept. Take Midland as an example. Even though they have some ups and downs in the cattle market in the U.S., Midland is still performing the way it should. And also, in terms of market development at the front end of the operational businesses, no surprises yet. So we're well on course.</p>
          <p>And that goes, actually, for all the acquisitions I'm aware of. But, of course, I'm not involved with the small-small ones, but with the bigger ones. And our people in group development, who are responsible for the methodology of the cross-merger integration, very, very closely follow up the development of these businesses to make sure that we, with a high discipline. First of all, make the decision and then actually execute &#x2013; which is actually way more value-creating normally than the acquisition as such, execute with all what we wanted to do and change with these businesses after the acquisition, after the closing. Maybe, J&#xF6;rg, can you come in already with a little bit more spice as regards the acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just three months which we report now. There are a couple of integration expenses involved and, therefore, this is not a sustainable income. For Midland, it's 3.3 million for the first quarter which is part of the group and, for Sterling, it's 1.1 billion. Also, for the first &#x2013; their first quarter, that is, the second, so they were consolidated as of April 1. For the full year, we expect substantially higher numbers for both. Midland, there was an impact, not only from expenses for the integration, but also from the couple of natural catastrophes there, so nothing which has surprised us at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and then coming to the other question, prices, well, we have a strategy out there and we always said that, specifically, when it comes to Primary Insurance and International Health, external growth may play a role. But, unfortunately, at least when it comes to Primary, a couple of other competitors seem to have a pretty similar strategy. So we bang our heads all the time with the same competitors when it comes to M&amp;A. Take, for example, CEE Eastern Europe. And we're always second or third winner only, and that has to do with the pricing. It's amazing to me and to us that these prices are still paid.</p>
          <p>Actually, the same is holding true for a couple of bank assurance acquisitions recently. Somehow, we apparently are too modest when it comes to set the terminal value and the growth expectations. And in many of these instances, the seller, apparently, is expecting that you leave on the table the entire value of the new business when you acquire, and this a non-acceptable for us. Because normally, let's take a 15 year new business agreement, and if you leave the entire value on the table, then you have to negotiate for life then when the 15 years have run out. Or you have to, God knows, how outperform these business plans. And we take a very skeptical view there.</p>
          <p>That's why, pricing wise, we hardly ever come to terms. If we acquire, it's mostly these niche businesses where you have a lot less of competitors in the game. But we have the patience and the discipline to wait. If we will not come up with one single acquisition this year, I don't mind at all. Bigger acquisitions I even foresee a lot less. Unless prices and pricing change a lot, we will keep our powder dry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, just to follow up, you're not interested at the moment in the kind of deals that Swiss Re is doing, these opportunities out of banks or <mark type="inaudible" />, from the U.S. are some --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is a very specific business, of course. We have in the past, and most likely in the future, we will not be an active player in the Admin Re businesses. We have the old reasons still valid. We like mortality risk, we like morbidity risk. We can imagine, sooner or later, maybe also going into variable annuity businesses in reinsurance because we have the hedging platform in the process of being built. But, if you do Admin Re business, of course, a lot more comes on your table and we are not interested in running all what comes with administration and what have you. So Admin Re, most likely for the foreseeable future, will not be our businesses. And, let's not forget, we're not alone there either. Maybe banks are a little less present these days, but banks are in this game too, hedge funds are in the game to some extent, so you're not alone. So margins are under pressure there. But I would not dare to say margins are good or bad.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  We will move to our next question today from William Hawkins from KBW.  Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. The first one, Nikolaus and J&#xF6;rg, I just wanted to reconcile two comments that you made about the impact of market movements in the first half. Nikolaus, when you talked to slide four, you said that adding everything up, the impact to the shareholder and market movements was only a double-digit million figure. But then, J&#xF6;rg, when you talked about slide to eight and nine, you flagged impairments to the shareholder of 836 and then capital gains at 600 million, which would net up to be about 236 million, which I would judge to be more than just a double-digit figure. I'm not sure if there's something else I'm missing, but I just wondered if you could reconcile those two sets of comments, please.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, interested in your comments about the renewals. In the slides at the back you show that &#x2013; and you flagged a 9% reduction in your July volumes. You flagged, I think, a 4% reduction in your volumes in January. And yet, in your year-to-date slide, 57, you actually show that your volumes are flat year-to-date which, obviously, is implying that your volumes were up very significantly in April. Either that, or there's something else going on. So I just wondered if you could reconcile how we get from July and January to the year-to-date flat number. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. The year-to-date number, indeed, has shown a more or less development in terms of turnover. I don't have now the first quarter numbers at hand, but the reason of the secret sort of sits, I think, in the first quarter. Because one treaty I do even remember specifically, when we acquired DAUM Direct in Korea, we immediately agreed upon a huge quota shift treaty that added a lot of top line at the time which, of course, refilled missing top line due to cancellations of reinsurance businesses. And, at the same time, of course, niche businesses filled in. But I cannot now reconcile differences between quarter one, quarter two and the, let's say aggregation of the two that quickly. If I come up with any meaningful answer within our, let's say, today's presentation, I will later on revert to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I check, you didn't give us the waterfall slide for April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, again, my assumption from looking at this is that, if you did, that waterfall slide would show a big increase. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's correct. So, good news for me; there was no slide. And I can tell you, yes, there would have been an increase. And the increase would have been triggered by DAUM Direct, our niche businesses and I don't &#x2013; I can ask my colleagues if there's one item -- bigger item that I have forgotten, I will mention it. But, rest assured, it is not because we try to make sure top line increases. We actually at the time I remember that we have been a little bit surprised that the top line was even up. And it triggered a lot of questions to the poor gentlemen and ladies who did the underwriting and came up with a higher top line, because it was completely compensated.</p>
          <p>But the good news is, after all these checks, the news is good news; there's nothing there to worry us. They are still in managing the cycle. And the fact that we stayed firm on the top line, overall, in the first half of the year, really is contributing &#x2013; or can be contributed or traced back to all these specialties. So far, well now, it is up &#x2013; as I said, this slide four, the answers will come from J&#xF6;rg now he's ready.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much Nikolaus. Thank you very much, Nikolaus. So, William, the difference between the two statements, what Nikolaus said is that the impact from gains on disposals, losses on disposals, write-downs, the write-ups of equities was minus 50 or so, so a double-digit number only.</p>
          <p>What I showed you on the slides nine and eight is, on eight the impairments of equities, but all the other assets here, and the same on slide nine for the gains and losses on disposals. And if you see, for example, on slide nine, that we had some 226 million from the sale of AFS fixed interests, for example, some gains also from the sale of real estate. And this is all not part of the number which Nikolaus mentioned. Nikolaus just referred to the piece which was caused by equity movements, yeah. So derivatives &#x2013; but no overall change, so just a reclassification here and there and with no clear direction. So, also, with no clear direction from short, or from younger years to older years or so; nothing of that kind. Just some movement, but not a general trend here, with more or less a zero overall impact. Your second question, underlying earnings power. Did you refer to Life and Health Reinsurance, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I take out the major contracts, these contracts have caused me some headache when I looked at the numbers after Q1 and also after Q2, because we had enormous movements in almost all lines of the P&amp;L due to these contracts. And it's very difficult to sort it all out. The overall effect of the cancellation was net positive. That means, without the cancellations, we would have had lower earnings.</p>
          <p>What is the reason behind it? That, I cannot precisely say. I assume that there are also some true-up effects from accounting built into it yeah. So you cannot just make it a sustainable number out of that. And so the accounting should have been made with some buffers due to the sheer size of that. And these buffers are now expiring, are now resolved, out of the system. Therefore, the underlying profitability would most probably be a little bit lower than it was here, adjusted for the part of the investment results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe generalizing it, in general, we do not foresee anything that will get us off track when it comes to Life and Health Reinsurance, also result wise. We had a little bit of more difficulty on Health Reinsurance over the last two years, over its last year and current year, but it's doing okay; it's nothing very serious. And you also asked about the top line drag. And, J&#xF6;rg should correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we are close to the end of that story. And the underlying growth is still there because, as you probably know, once you have an agreement with a client in Life Reinsurance, it's a living book. And he adds new risks to this living book every year. Alone, by that, we grow our book organically, unless our service is such that the client wants to cancel the business and then cancel it right and cut.</p>
          <p>And, of course, producing the new business connections in Life is the real challenge. This does not happen on January 1. It happens all through the year. And that is why we have set up the new strategy in Life Reinsurance, where we also use a couple of very different distinct services to make us an interesting partner and partly refilling links of the value chain of our clients. Maybe an example from the UK and one from Asia. In the UK, it's about IT, administering more of the business of our clients and having them focusing on further development; we even could help there, but, certainly, having them doing the sales. In Asia it's, for example, bank assurers that start to develop more the bank assurance business, but do not want to have to deal with administration, underwriting and what have you. And also, they really would like to see almost all of the value chain being run and done by the reinsurance companies.</p>
          <p>This would be a new business and that, of course, would be a very interesting business to us. But alone, take Canada as the proxy, Canadian book where we have a very, very strong market position, there's no, hardly any new clients out there possibly that we could take on. But the business is growing, as such, because it's living books. That is quite opposite to the Admin Re book that I mentioned before. We love living books.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  We now move to our next question from Stephan Kalb from Sal. Oppenheim.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Most of my questions have been answered, with the exception of the U.S. renewals. Could you give a little bit more information on the price trends in the divisions PC, NatCat and Casualty, and maybe also comment the current demand situation in those segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a difficult one because it's so specific. But one thing is for sure, we have &#x2013; if you look to the U.S. and take property first, property has been difficult for us, with one exception that has been the NatCat business. So the NatCat business, as I mentioned earlier on, the wind exposed businesses have been resilient to pressure. So that's why, at least overall, we could renew our treaties. Property overall, and certainly saw in the industrial area is more of a problem, but way more so this year was Casualty. Casualty was under a hell lot of pressure. And it was interesting to see that the excess of loss treaties have been under more pressure than the proportional treaties. So that's why we did cut back quite drastically in the U.S. this year, actually all renewals in these businesses. And we are talking triple-digit million dollars here.</p>
          <p>When it comes to demand and development, of course, we see retentions being increased also in the U.S. That is a matter and a fact. It's a little bit strange sometimes to me that the primary insurers increase there retentions when the markets turn softer. But that's probably because they have more capital and, hopefully, or, from their point of view, not for that reason, we as reinsurers, of course, will cut back our businesses. We believe America is trying to be prepared once the market turns. As I said earlier, on the &#x2013; for a global basis we cannot predict when that will happen; it may take time. But I think with the development of the equity markets, and probably interest rates now not being increased too much, that will be helpful.</p>
          <p>So, overall, we are seeing the U.S. market is pretty challenging these days. And the rate decreases there are in the upper end of the single digits, both Property and Casualty. We talk 5 to 10% rate decreases. So it's more than what we showed on our overall book. It's a challenging market.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Michael Haid, Cheuvreux. Two questions, first, 425 million NatCat losses and the 352 million manmade losses. They are both gross and net the same figures, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, that's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you confirm that only 79 million net loss from natural catastrophes were booked in the second quarter '08, 79 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because I was wondering; it seems a little low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was 120 and 79; that is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, Michael, it looks low, but a lot of the natural catastrophes did not hit the attachment of the reinsurer. So the primary insurance industry should have been relatively more affected of these kinds of natural catastrophes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. The second question, also I am afraid on Life Health Re. I am aware that you have not renewed some large treaties, but when I look at the investment portfolio in the second quarter last year, you had total investments of 28 billion, in the second quarter this year 16 billion, so a difference of &#x20AC;12 billion. And when I look at the policyholder reserves, those went down only by four billion. And this looks a little bit puzzling to me, so can you explain somehow what happened, how the nature of the business has changed, if at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So one is currency effects, and then there is the interest rate rises which also play a role, because the liabilities side does not react to interest rate movements, at least not to the necessary extent. And the third reason are deposits, which are booked under, you see it here. Deposits only 4.888 now on the end of June. So it's a couple of reasons. And it's driven by currency effects, interest rate movements, large cancellation of the large treaties, so nothing of an economically serious effect here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So, no operating, no change in the nature of the operating business or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just a move from these traditional long-term life contracts with a strong saving element to other type of products. And a move from continental Europe, especially from Germany to international business, mainly in the Anglo Saxon world.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our final question today comes from Thorsten Wenzel from DZ Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Thorsten Wenzel, DZ Bank, good afternoon. Two quick questions. The first one is concerning the available for sale equity portfolio of 16.6 billion. And I think this number still includes 3.4 billion in net unrealized gains. Could you split this number into the shareholder share and the policyholder share, please? I assume from the slide in the backup that at least a very large part of this can be assigned to shareholders.</p>
          <p>And then my second question, if I may, concerning capitalization. The capital buffer in terms of rating agency models was, I think, a mid single-digit billion amount, end '07. Would it now be fair to assume that this number is more or less zero? These are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say zero, and I have to repeat that it's not so easy to precisely say how much excess capital there still is, because there are also a lot of analyst adjustments involved, for example, for the hedging activities. And, therefore, I can't give you a precise number. But it is lower than it was at the end of last year. But we are still on a very comfortable level.</p>
          <p>To your first question, that is right, the 3.7 billion are our unrealized gains on equities. We do not disclose up to now the split between policyholders' sphere and shareholders' sphere. But you rightly, you correctly draw the conclusion from the slide in the backup that the bulk of these unrealized gains sit with the shareholders. So, in general, you can say the negative unrealized losses are to an over-proportional amount with the policyholder, which shouldn't worry them, because it's basically the result of the rising interest rate, so unrealized losses on fixed interest securities. And from an economical point of view it's anyway good for us that, as I said before, that interest rates have risen. But, and the bulk of the equities unrealized gains are with the shareholder.</p>

          <p>Well, good afternoon, it's actually Bob Yates from Fox-Pitt, Kelton. If I could just refer to slide 51 in the backup, it follows on a little bit from the past question, but it's different. And that is, there, you show the unrealized gains on the off-balance sheet and there is a figure for at equity of minus 2.2 billion. And below that, the policyholders' participation of 1.3 billion positive seems to relieve the shareholders of a large proportion of that unrealized loss. I wonder what the unrealized loss was, and why and to what level of confidence the loss can be attributed to the policyholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob , this is true that this 1.7 billion in the mid of the slide is the participation of the policy, 1.251 is it. This off-balance sheet reserve, this negative reserve are mainly from what we call loans here. That is in German, <mark type="inaudible" />, so basically bank loans. And these are losses which are purely due to the interest rate movements and, therefore, they recover over time. And, therefore, this is a very valid assumption that they will be borne by the policyholders proportionally to their participation in the business. Does it answer your question, Bob?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, it's fixed income essentially?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah absolutely.  Fixed income and some receivables but they are totally unimportant.  It's fully fixed income.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  And now we will take a follow-up question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan.  Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I wanted to come back to the cash flow, and I understand that you did give an answer. But 1.1 billion this seems, or whatever 1.4 billion, the swing in that line improvement, and to say, well, it's just one of those things. I wish I could have one of those things land on my desk every day, that would be quite nice. But, more seriously, could you just give us a clue? Is this, because you made acquisitions, I counted of 1.1 billion, so you actually spent money. And then you had the buybacks and the dividends. A lot of cash actually went out. And I just wondered where this improvement in bank loans came from. It's not, I can't think that it was a movement in earnings, the earnings weren't that high. I am just wondering what it was.</p>
          <p>And then I had another question which is a little bit of kind of fishing question. I hear a lot of people in the industry saying well if we had a big NatCat it would be really good, because then premium rates could rise. What would be the cost to you, if you would estimate, if we had an event, a hurricane which would, say, cost twice as much as Katrina, or something of that order of magnitude? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second question. Michael, we, of course, do not publish for all the return periods and probabilities the possible hit to the Munich RE P&amp;L or balance sheet. But what we can say is we overall do expose the balance sheet with in what  I called earlier on, the risk appetite. Within the strategic risk management framework we set all the different risk appetites. And, of course, the most exposed area is actually not U.S. hurricane. It's, rather, European storm. And then, accordingly, we set the budgets and the pricing. And the more you take on a single risk, of course, the higher the prices.</p>
          <p>But the overall, take an Atlantic hurricane, what we published some time ago was that for a 1,000 year event we do expect something in the, let's say, around about three billion range. That's a 1,000 year event. And this is probably quite a good proxy for what could happen. But it will really depend on the hurricane and where it hits and so forth. But we do expose the balance sheet. Will that, and that was the underlying of your question, what will that mean to the market? Actually, I think it's a pity that the market sometimes apparently seems to need these events. Because an event like such, that this was in what we did expect should not change a single thing in the market unless we have a drop out of players. If capacity completely disappears because they over-stretch their balance sheet, of course, that means less capacity in the game. It will have, one way or the other, some effect.</p>
          <p>But, actually, the occurrence of such an event should not change the pricing at all. And if you remember, we were once criticized by some Bermudan players when we had Katrina, and in the aftermath we did not increase prices for European storm. And we said why should we, because nothing had changed in Europe, at least our assumptions didn't change. So that is why the underlying of your question I think actually should not occur. But Munich RE is exposed, but we stay within what we think is reasonable for our shareholders. And such an event, of course, would still be, in the first place, an earnings event for us.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Michael, it's bad timing because it seems to be one of the last questions, and I more or less lost I must admit. So we have to come back to your questions off line, yes?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it will be brief one and short one, because thank you for your questions all the time. As said on today's mornings press conference, we, the management at Munich RE, is not at all nervous about what we have seen in the capital markets so far. We think and we are convinced we are on course and that we will stay on course with the execution of our strategy and the mid-term targets we have set out. So this actually we consider what happened rather as a testing of our different systems. And we feel that out of this, if you call it a crisis, Munich RE should rather come out stronger than weaker, and that is very different from the last one. So far, thank you all and a good afternoon. Bye, bye.</p>
