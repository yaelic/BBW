          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enbridge Inc. 2009 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Vern Yu.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, and welcome everyone to Enbridge's Q1 2009 earnings call. With me this morning are Pat Daniel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; and Colin Gruending, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to point out that we may refer to forward-looking information during the call. By its nature forward &#x2013; this information provides certain assumptions and expectations about the future, so we remind you it's subject to risks and uncertainties affecting every business including ours. Our slides include a summary of more significant risk and factors that may affect the future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed more fulsomely in our public disclosure document available both on SEDAR and EDGAR.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind everyone this call is webcast and the supporting slides are available on our website, www.enbridge.com/investor. A replay of this call will be available later today, and a full transcript will be posted to the website shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p>The Q&amp;A format will be the same as the past few earnings calls. The initial Q&amp;A will be restricted to the investment analyst community and followed by questions from the media. I would also like to remind everyone, Pat Murray and I are available for detailed Q&amp;A after the call.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks, Vern, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2009 first-quarter review. As we reported earlier today, our adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $269 million, and that's $0.74 per common share and a 13% increase over to 2008.</p>
          <p>We're also pleased to report stronger performance year-over-year in all of our business units. Of course, Liquids Pipelines continues to lead the way as a result of the very robust growth secured through our $12 billion of expansion projects.</p>
          <p>Sponsored Investments also improved due to the distribution increases that were announced at both vehicles in 2008, and also as the result of the increased ownership in Enbridge Energy Partners due to the fourth quarter 2008 equity injection that we made.</p>
          <p>These first-quarter results are slightly ahead of our expectations, which put us in great shape to meet our 2009 guidance of $2.18 to $2.32 per share, and also in terms of our longer term guidance of 10-plus percent average earnings per share growth through 2012. So we're right on target.</p>
          <p>Richard Bird is going to review the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a moment. This morning, I am going to keep my remarks on the strategic update relatively brief, because as you know, I'll be speaking again later today at the Annual General Meeting. But instead, this morning what I'd like to do is to use my time to speak to a number of very significant accomplishments that we've had so far this year.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was a very busy one and it was very gratifying as we began to place a number of expansion projects into service. These are projects that as you know we've been working on for some time now.</p>
          <p>On April 1 for example, we placed the final phase of Southern Access expansion into service. This new pipeline between Delavan, Wisconsin, and the Flanagan, Illinois, hub is the second phase of the Southern Access project.</p>
          <p>And together, Phase I, which was placed into service last April, and Phase II add 400,000 barrels a day of incremental capacity to our mainline crude oil system. The new pipeline now also provides substantial low-cost expansion capability, simply with the addition of future pumping capacity.</p>
          <p>During Q1, we also placed into service our Spearhead Pipeline Expansion, which increases the capacity of this line from 125,000 barrels a day to 193,000 barrels a day, and demand from Western Canadian shippers for access to the Cushing market has been significant and has continued to grow since we first started Spearhead a number of years ago.</p>
          <p>The Line 4 Extension from Edmonton to Hardisty, Alberta, was also completed in the first quarter, which eliminated the bottleneck on our mainline system through that area. I think it's of note that we are very pleased to report that all of these assets were placed into service on time and within budget.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good progress on both the Southern Lights project, which will ship 180,000 barrels a day of diluent from Chicago back to Western Canada, as well as the largest of our mainline expansion projects which is Alberta Clipper, to increase mainline capacity by another 450,000 barrels a day. Both of these projects are on schedule and are expected to go into service in mid- to late 2010.</p>
          <p>Recently, we've also talked about opportunities for further expansion of our natural gas assets. And we recently announced a non-binding Open Season on the proposed LaCrosse Pipeline, which would carry at least a bcf a day of gas from the Carthage, Texas, hub to a variety of pipeline interconnections that get that gas into the Florida and the Southeast markets in the U.S.</p>
          <p>This pipeline is really necessitated by the growing supply of the Haynesville Shale, which is one of the most active gas plays and most prolific in the United States. Our proposed LaCrosse Pipeline provides what we think is a very creative and flexible solution to relieve market constraints that are going to be affecting producers in that booming region.</p>
          <p>Turning to the renewal side of the business, earlier this quarter, we formally opened our 190-megawatt Ontario Wind facility, which is located on the eastern shores of Lake Huron. Construction on this project was substantially complete at year-end 2008, but it's now in full operation with all the 115 wind turbines supplying power to the grid.</p>
          <p>So, at the completion of this wind farm, Enbridge's share of power produced from our four wind farms is equivalent to about 35% of the power that we consume on our Canadian crude oil mainline system. So wind power production is becoming a significant part of our story.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Enbridge-led 38-member Alberta Saline Aquifer Project, which is known as ASAP announced the completion of the first phase of its work and the start of Phase II, which includes the construction of a pilot project that actually began injecting CO2 into a saline aquifer. We believe we're still in the early stages that carbon capture and storage has the potential to transform the environmental footprint of the energy economy and also to significantly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only in Canada, but throughout North America.</p>
          <p>Finally, we were happy to announce the successful sale of our investment in the OCENSA pipeline. With this sale, we've really now divested ourselves of our two international ventures. And I would like to stress that this is not a change in the company's strategic direction, in fact those were very strong performing assets.</p>
          <p>However, the attractiveness of the offers were just too good to pass up given the high-quality organic growth projects that we're financing here in North America right now. We still believe though that there will be select opportunities where Enbridge can replicate the performance that we've had in both Spain and Colombia in the international marketplace, and we'll continue to search these out over time.</p>
          <p>So let me now just pass it on to Richard Bird to review the quarterly financials and the company's liquidity position, then I'll come back and conclude it in a couple of minutes. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As Pat mentioned, we released our first quarter results earlier this morning and reported net income was $558 million or $1.54 per share. That's up from $251 million last year or $0.70 per share in 2008.</p>
          <p>The significant increase in reported earnings of course is attributable to the $329 million gain on the sale of our investment in OCENSA, which Pat just mentioned. That was partially offset by a $15 million mark-to-market loss on derivative financial instruments used to lock-in returns within our Oxable and Energy Services businesses.</p>
          <p>Excluding one-time and non-operating factors, our adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were 269 million or $0.74 per common share. That's an increase of 13% in adjusted earnings over the first quarter of 2008, but the rate of growth will accelerate as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings increased in each of our segments, excluding of course international. As Pat mentioned, this increase actually exceeded our expectations and sets us up very well to meet our 2009 earnings per share guidance range, the midpoint of which represents a 20% increase in earnings per share from 2008.</p>
          <p>Diving into the detail, starting with Liquids Pipelines. First quarter adjusted earnings rose $21 million to 97 million in 2009. Most of the increase was due to the recognition of allowance for equity during construction on Southern Lights, as well as within the Enbridge System on the Alberta Clipper project. Both increased as a result of the capital base growing during their construction periods.</p>
          <p>Earnings also increased within the Athabasca segment due to the Waupisoo Pipeline being placed into service in the second quarter of 2008. These positive impacts were offset partially by higher operating costs within the Enbridge System, including pipeline integrity spending.</p>
          <p>Gas pipeline results are just slightly higher than 2008, and that's as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar and as well the impact of increased demand for the Vector transportation corridor. These were offset by depreciating asset base within Alliance, as well as continuing lost revenue early in the quarter, related to Hurricane Gustav and Ike within the offshore assets.</p>
          <p>Sponsored investments made an increased contribution. Adjusted earnings increased 8 million, due primarily to the increased ownership within Enbridge Energy Partners, as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. As a result of the $500 million equity injection made in late 2008, our effective ownership increased from 15% to 27% of Enbridge Energy Partners.</p>
          <p>EEP's adjusted results were lower than the prior year, looking at EEP's performance by itself, mainly due to weaker performance within the natural gas segment as a result of the lower commodity price environment. Enbridge Income Fund's contribution went up as a result of the two distribution increases announced last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to gas distribution and services. Adjusted earnings increased 9 million, due mainly to strong performance from our Energy Services business, which was able to realize higher margins and volumes from a contango oil market and low risk transportation arbitrage opportunities.</p>
          <p>This increase was partially offset by decreased earnings within Enbridge Gas Distribution, that's as a result of a change in our customer billing practice, where a larger portion of the customer's bill will be a fixed component and a lesser amount will be variable. As a result, earnings at Enbridge Gas Distribution will be lower in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, but higher in the second and third quarters. And with increased capture of incentive regulation benefits, which is going well, they'll be higher for the full year, versus 2008.</p>
          <p>As already noted, international's contribution decreased as a result of the sale of CLH in the second quarter of 2008. As well as the sale of OCENSA on March 17 of this year. And finally, in corporate costs are $5 million lower than in 2008, as a result of a number of small factors including a higher corporate income tax recovery and some foreign exchange gains as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>So that's a review of the earnings drivers, and I'd now like to spend a moment just updating our financial outlook. As a quick reminder, I'm working off with page 10 now of the slide deck, our investment in OCENSA generated net after-tax cash proceeds in Canadian dollars of 512 million, and the final gain in Canadian dollars was 329 million, reflecting both the favorable exchange rate hedges that we had in place and effective tax planning.</p>
          <p>This sale substantially reduced our equity needs for our commercially secured projects as indicated in the funding requirement chart on page 10. And in fact, it completely eliminated them in 2009. We do continue to explore alternatives to proactively deepen our equity base in order to accommodate additional investment opportunities, and those alternatives include both asset sales and asset monetizations.</p>
          <p>From a liquidity perspective, moving to slide 11, our remaining net funding requirement for 2009 is now $2.4 billion, and that includes the remaining capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends for 2009, less the remaining funds from operations we'll generate this year. And we continue to carry a significant amount of unutilized credit facilities.</p>
          <p>At the end of March, committed credit facilities for Enbridge and its subsidiaries totaled $6.7 billion, of which 3.2 billion is either drawn or is allocated to backstop commercial paper programs. The remaining 3.5 billion of unutilized capacity is available to provide bridge funding for our capital programs prior to putting in place permanent financing or to accommodate additional investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we have a very substantial liquidity surplus for attractive opportunities even without accessing capital markets. However, we are starting to see improvement in long-term debt market pricing in both Canada and the U.S.</p>
          <p>On that note, I will turn it back to Pat for his concluding comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thanks, Richard. So the first quarter of 2009 has started the year off better than expected, with increased contributions from all operating segments and placing us now well on our way to achieving our 2009 guidance. And probably even more importantly, we're now placing into service, on-time and on-budget, assets that will enable the company to have an average earnings per share growth rate through 2012 of 10 plus percent, bringing with that of course a comparable increase in dividend.</p>
          <p>So, on that note, I think we can move to the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just had a question --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just had a question on the financing slide on page 10. So as you look at the total capital expenditures over the period of 12.5 billion, how much of the Fort Hills project is included in that number at this point, if anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There is about two billion in there for Fort Hills and that's right at the back-end of the five-year period. So we're still carrying an assumption of in-service in 2012, pending further guidance from the sponsors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess as you think about that funding requirement, should Fort Hills slip back to the second part of the decade, would you think there is a high probability of other projects coming in to absorb that magnitude of capital need, or would that just be a funding benefit where there would be just less debt and equity funding requirements in '10 through '12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working on a number of other alternatives right now, Andrew, and I think it's fair to say that we would expect in combination of other oil opportunities or some of the gas proposals that we're working on that we would fill that in. Hard to be very specific with you right now, but we do have a number of things on the go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kuske with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. To what extent are you seeing productivity improvements for labor within Alberta and then to what extent is that giving you an ability to come in under budget on some of your projects, and therefore open up some headroom on your financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Andrew, to a very significant extent we're seeing improvements in productivity. And I'll speak primarily to pipeline construction productivity. And I think it's fair to say that the general principles that I'll refer to are applying to upstream construction as well in the oil sands. But we &#x2013; to give you a measure of that, we have seen over a three times &#x2013; three to four times improvement in the well reject rate associated with pipeline construction, which is one of the key measures that we use on productivity on pipeline construction.</p>
          <p>And that has been very significant, so we're seeing very significant improvements in productivity from a year ago when we didn't have the kind of tightness that has started to develop in the labor market. So that's the case, and also we're seeing far more competitive bidding from contractors for new projects and are now able to move away from the time and materials to contracts that we were writing to fixed bid contracts. So that should result in a significant decrease in cost over time as well. So we're very pleased to see those improvements in productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any specific quantification of that benefit and how that translates into your capital program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't quantify it other than to say that the construction cost has most recently been about a half of the cost. So if you &#x2013; what portion of that would be impacted by the reject rate on wells, for example, it's hard to say. But we're dealing with, by far, the biggest component of the total cost of laying the pipeline and that's the 50% associated with contractors. So I think you can expect to see some notable decreases in cost, but hard to quantify, because it's kind of early stage at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I may, just on the intra-Alberta market. What are your expectations for the bidding process on a Curl Pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have put information in front of the sponsor of the Curl Lake project and would expect at some point over the next six months to find out whether we're in that race or not. But it'll depend a lot on, I'm sure the sponsors timing with regard to sanctioning the project and their decision making as to who their pipeline provider will be. But we certainly hope to be in the race.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of &#x2013; from Linda Ezergailis with TD Newcrest. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. My question is more on the operational side. I am wondering, as I look forward to the balance of 2009 and 2010, how I might think of both Energy Services' outperformance and what I view to be slightly light contribution from the Enbridge System excluding AEDC versus my expectations going forward.</p>
          <p>So what sort of run rates might we expect? And you've given us some color on Energy Services Q1, but maybe on the Enbridge System earnings, if you can give us some color on whether you incurred any penalties under your ITS, or is there a timing consideration or anything else that we might want to model into our full-year numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, could you respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'll take a stab at that. The Enbridge System, in the first quarter, you're seeing some drag from higher costs; that's partly employee-related costs. That's probably an ongoing effect, there also were some fairly significant integrity spend in the first quarter. That's in part, I think, something that isn't indicative of the run rate. So I think we'll see better performance on the cost front as we move ahead there.</p>
          <p>And Energy Services, as I think you already observed, Linda, had a strong quarter. There continues to be some good opportunities, but I wouldn't like to suggest that the first quarter is indicative of the run rate in that business. It will probably be the best quarter of the year, perhaps the best quarter for some time. And all of that is, as we indicated earlier, is rolled up in our assessment of where we stand with respect to guidance, and we're certainly well on track if not a bit ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. In terms of the Enbridge System, can you clarify what's going on with the ITS? Like is that integrity spend kind of normal, within the full-year context or would that be a higher amount than we would have seen in previous years? And perhaps you can help us quantify what the breakdown was as the ongoing employee costs versus kind of the more one-time integrity spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I don't think we're going to parse it down into too much more detail than that. The integrity spend with respect to the ITS is as provided for in the ITS, and we do have an understanding with cap with respect to how much we will spend. So I think generally on an annual basis we will be in line with that, but a little more heavily weighted towards the first quarter this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Bob Hastings with Canaccord. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to clarify on that last point on the Enbridge Systems, I notice that the equity earnings AEDC were up very significantly. And so, as I'm sure Linda did as well, the &#x2013; when you do the calculation, that was up 13 million, but Enbridge System is only up seven. Is the full difference of that just the two items that you mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They would be the largest part of that difference, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to clear up the difference between slide 10 and 11, I notice that the debt remaining to be funded in slide 10 was $2 billion over the period.

          <p>Yes. On &#x2013; Bob, on slide 10, that's the debt to be funded between 2008 and 2012. Slide 11 is just the total funding needs of cap after we take into account funds from operations this year, CapEx and debt to be refinanced this year. So that's &#x2013; there is a difference that slide 11 includes refinancing and slide 10 does not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're still very early stages there, Robert. We haven't really got deeply involved in the renegotiation, as you know it's a pretty active time in the industry both for our customers and for us so &#x2013; no, we really don't have anything further in terms of progress from our last report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just kind of with the early discussions you're having. Is it still the case that there is nothing that you're seeing in terms of issues that would materially change the outlook for the next ITS versus what you're operating under right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair to say. I think the spirit under which the original incentive tolling agreement was put in place and then the renewals done over the years is very much the same one of sharing benefit through cost reduction and productivity improvements and the metrics that we've used for crude quality and scheduling. So certainly the overall spirit of cooperation is very much the same going into those discussions. So we haven't had any major issues that have come up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and if I can just turn to the financing down at Enbridge Energy Partners, can you give some extra color there. We've seen a decent pick up in the Enbridge Energy Partners price. And I guess just from the Enbridge Inc. perspective, what are the kind of considerations you're looking at and at what point do the economics start to make sense to you, to prefer EEP to look externally for financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me kind of start back at the start, as I guess implied by the final part of your question, and that our preference always has been for EEP to be a self-financing vehicle. However, with the MLP market being as hard hit as it has been, we've not wanted to be out raising equity in that environment. And as you know, through Enbridge, provided support to EEP as recently as last fall, obviously much to our benefit as you see from our results as well. So their benefit and ours.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to monitor the market, we will continue to look at the potential for EEP issuing units if the market strengthens to the point where we think it should. We've also indicated that we could potentially take a further interest in EEP or we could take an interest in a particular project that EEP is working on as ways of providing that kind of financing most effectively to the partnership. Even though the units have strengthened, they are still well off their all-time high and hence we've got little ways to go in that market before we feel comfortable in going through the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, when you mentioned kind of the all-time high, that &#x2013; roughly in the range &#x2013; I know you don't want to get to specific numbers, but is that kind of in the range where you'd feel comfortable in the economics to Enbridge Inc. for EEP to go up for external unit financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'd rather not suggest that because there are a lot of other factors that could come into play rather than just one specific number. So I would rather not, Robert, but there are a whole lot of things we'd have to take into consideration.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Regarding Enbridge Offshore System, what were the earnings contribution in the last quarter versus a year ago? And I have a follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was just looking that up, --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, Q1 was $7.4 million, versus $5.4 million in Q1 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the follow-up question is, ever since the first investment in this pipeline system, annual earnings have never really reached the target level, which I think at the time was about 28 million to $30 million. And I appreciate that there were factors &#x2013; many factors beyond Enbridge's fields -- influence. But in far as Enbridge can affect these results, what is Enbridge proposing to do this year and next year to bring these results up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Win, you're right. As we have indicated before, we probably for the &#x2013; one of the first times in Enbridge's history, our timing of an acquisition wasn't great and that we were hit with Hurricanes Rita and Katrina the summer after we acquired those assets and then had another bad hurricane year last year in the form of Ike primarily. We &#x2013; first of all, there are a number of very encouraging factors in the Gulf of Mexico now.</p>
          <p>Thunder Horse, for example, is now producing 200,000 MMBtu, so it is up and actually, in excess of where I believe they had expected it to be. So it was slow coming on post-hurricane Rita, Katrina, but is now exceeding expectation. I think that is one of many indicators that as a lot of this production comes on, we will move back up into the target range that we had initially.</p>
          <p>Not only that, as we look at new investments in the Gulf and there are a number of opportunities for expansions and extensions in the Gulf. We are further refining our model to reduce the risk associated with these investments such that we have some kind of demand charge, ship or pay commitment and minimum return tied in, and that will gradually bring these assets back on size in terms of performance level. So we are still very encouraged by the overall geological prospectivity in the Gulf and opportunities to continue to expand, it'll be on a more conservative business model than the original assets.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Most of my questions have been hit but maybe just a follow up on LaCrosse. If this were a pipeline &#x2013; if it returns were met, if you will &#x2013; and it was going to be in service for like 2011, early 2012. When would we actually have to have sanctioning of the project? Is this something that could be done in sort of one construction season or how long might that take?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are in early stages on it, Carl, as you know. We've gone out, we've got an Open Season running through until the 15 of May and would expect to get pretty positive response, because we think that's the right market to head to, and I'll come back to that in a minute. But we would be looking at construction in 2010 and 2011, as you suggesting on stream in 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with respect to, Pat, you just alluded to the markets you're trying to hit and I understand certainly the wanting to avoid Perryville at this point. But as you guys sort of go down to FGT, are you primarily looking just to bypass Perryville and basically interconnect with the Northeast pipes? Or is it fundamentally trying to get that gas down into Southeast markets, Florida markets? And in part, I am trying to figure out how much of this is producer-push Haynesville-driven versus perhaps tapping into some long-term Florida demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very much the latter of the two alternatives that you suggest. It's not to pick necessarily other interconnect points to get into the U.S. Northeast. And I'll come back to that in a minute, but to hit what we think will be a very strong growth market in the Southeast by tying into Florida gas transmission and other points to the Southeast. We're -- as we sit looking at this overall shale map in North America and the large Marcellus Shale sitting up in the northeast. We think that longer term that probably this Haynesville gas is going to find the best home and the best markets and the best net back for the producer by getting into the Southeast market. And there are a number of proposals to get from Carthage over to Perryville, we think that hitting the FGT connect is probably the best way to go for producer net back.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Well, just to kind of step back on Rockies Alliance for a second, the key thing of course is to get as much volume commitment as we can to the pipeline. That's one of the things that made Questar such an attractive partner right from the outset, because they do bring volume along with them. And so we're certainly welcoming Spectra into the mix, and our &#x2013; again, a ways to go as a result of some of the slowdown in drilling in the Rockies, but hope to build producer your support for that line.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Just to explore a little further, the progress now that you're heading into Phase II and eventually Phase III now in the large CO2 sequestration project. Obviously, you're showing leadership on the issue, I'm just curious as to if you have any specific first rights of refusal to the ultimate pipeline build or what proration of cost, you're &#x2013; I guess a more expensive phase. I know there's Federal provincial money, but they probably won't cover up all of that. Just wondering how that is sort of evolving or shaking out, will all 38 partners stay with Phase II and Phase III, that kind of thing?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to answer the first part of it, Sam, we do have the exclusive pipeline rights and the sequestering rights on the project and other partners will look after the upstream capture of the CO2.

          <p>One third &#x2013; yes. So in terms of &#x2013; yes one-third Federal, one-third provincial and one-third partners, and that one-third of the that partners is split 38 ways.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Equally, very good. A follow up, you mentioned now your 33%, I guess, hedged if you may with renewable energy against your energy consumption. Is it a general target or do you have a general target to head towards 100% hedged with respect to your portfolio or you haven't really defined that yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, Sam, I don't know that hedged is the right word. And what we indicated is that we produced wind &#x2013; our share of the wind power that we produced amounts to 35% of the power we use in the crude oil mainline system which is one of the biggest areas of power consumption in the company. And so we've got a general guideline that at some point over the next four to five years we would like to be generating enough renewable to cover our power requirement in the company. And that doesn't mean to say that, that power is going to go to powering our pump stations. But just as a general offset from a corporate social responsibility point of view, we would like to be in that range. So I wouldn't look at it as a hedge. There is no financial connection at all between the power we generate in the wind power business and our power usage. But just generally, the ability to offset our power consumption with a green energy alternative.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. Just a little clarification on your corporate costs. They were down, you said your tax rate recovery went up and I wonder if you could maybe expand on that a little bit? And if you have any guidance sort of where you expect that to be for the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>I think that's probably seeing our corporate tax &#x2013; corporate segment tax costs in the first quarter.

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's a bit of an anomaly, which is why we've backed it out in terms of what our run rate earnings are. There was some legislative changes, clarifying the applicability of the SIFT tax, and previous to that we had thought that some of our internal partnership structures were actually going to be subject to the SIFT tax even though, they are not publicly traded entities. And so we had been providing for the SIFT tax against those entities, which was at a slightly higher rate that would be applicable in the absence of the SIFT tax. The legislation clarified that those entities wouldn't be caught and so we've reflected that change as a one-time adjustment.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to get a better sense of what your outlook for crude pipeline additions will be post 2012, in part because you've got a tremendous amount of capacity coming online as does one of your competitors. So when you look out post 2012 with the current volumetric production or projected production, what do you think will happen beyond 2012 as far as new crude oil pipelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think there are probably two or three areas of opportunity. First of all, as mentioned earlier that the Curl Project with Imperial Oil seems to be going ahead. And I think the potential is there for one or two other projects to proceed, and hence, that corridor from Fort McMurray down to Edmonton is going to be an area of opportunity for us, whether it's Curl, whether it's BP, Husky on Sunrise, opportunities through that corridor.</p>
          <p>The second probably &#x2013; or an area of bottleneck may be the second biggest area of opportunity is going to be from Cushing South, where we're finding that crude has started to bottleneck in Cushing and there needs to be additional capacity South and hence our joint venture with BP to look at use of their BP 1 line to get to Cushing and then a new build from Cushing South. So I think that, that would probably be the second area of influence.</p>
          <p>I would then &#x2013; in addition to that add the Eastern part of pad two to satisfy the Toledo, Detroit area, the expansions that Marathon has underway, and Husky, again, we have to win all of this business. But that will be a further area of opportunity. And then &#x2013; and I'll put this a little bit on the outer end of that ultimately Gateway.</p>
          <p>We still have strong support from both producers and refiners to proceed with filing an application on Gateway. And even though from a capacity point of view there will not be a need for ex-Alberta capacity for some time. Gateway is becoming more and more a pricing play and an optionality play for producers that could cause it to go before there's actually a shortage in capacity ex the province. So probably in that order, Andrew, I think those would be the areas of focus for us.</p>

          <p>And then a somewhat related questions, just in the context of when you're talking to shippers and prospective shippers about your new pipeline projects. On a return basis, have your thoughts or your discussions with shippers really been revised around returns with the NEB's recent decision on TQM and their shift to an <mark type="inaudible" /> type approach, which should buy us up returns over a period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The discussions with shippers that hasn't really become an issue with regard to a lot of new build opportunities, but certainly it does apply to some existing assets that we have and the potential for an upward movement in the overall return. And realize that we also have some indexing within existing deals that could move upward as a result of that move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It might be worth adding to that, Pat, that &#x2013; just as an example, Alberta Clipper, which between Canada and the U.S. is over $3 billion worth of capital, does drive its returns off of the multipipeline rate of return. It's multipipeline plus 225 basis points. So to the extent that the TQM decision were ultimately extended to a revision of the generic multi pipeline rate of return formula, that would have quite a significant impact on Alberta Clipper and there is probably upwards of another billion of capital in various other projects that are similarly geared off of that number.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's safe to say that you're going to be filing documents with the NEB on the 25 or thereabouts of May, with regards to the potential application of the TQM decision to other assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we'll work with the Board and with the industry to try and work out what's the logical implication of not just the TQM decision, but the general shift in capital markets that we've see in the last &#x2013; in a while in terms of risk premiums in. And of course, it's not just &#x2013; the oil pipeline side of the business, either that's relevant here. Although, we have an incentive deal in place on the Ontario distribution business. It ultimately has upside potential associated with that as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In some of your recent presentation materials you've begun to include a more specific chart on gas projects in development. You've included an other category, it amounts to, just eyeballing the chart, about seven billion. How do we look at that in terms of what your fair share of that is and over what timeframe does it come into service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I know exactly the chart you're referring to, Petro, and basically it's to put beside our wave -- our original wave two of liquids projects, a series of opportunities on the gas side that we think could well build in behind or in place of that wave two. And we specifically haven't specified projects in there because it's a little too early in the development cycle to say.</p>
          <p>However, we're encouraged by the general trends and direction and opportunities that are coming our way, whether it's a combination of Rockies Alliance and the LaCrosse pipeline, the Haynesville, there's some absolutely good and strong opportunities coming out of these shale plays, possible extensions and expansions of Alliance in the Northeast BC area and also the work that we're doing offshore in order to tie in some of the new deepwater discoveries in the offshore Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>So we have not been able to be really specific in that, but are just very encouraged by the general level of development in the gas business today.</p>
          <p>I guess, Petro, I could maybe just &#x2013; sorry, go ahead. Do we have another question?</p>

          <p>Thank you. On the Gateway line, a quick question. The producers are fully funding the costs to get to the permit as you spend them, is that correct?</p>

          <p>With the caveat that all that's committed at this point is 100 million. So if it took more than that to get to the finish line, and that is the budget, but if it took more than that we would have to go back to the producers for further funding.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. First, what's your outlook for volumes on Spearhead? Do you see that filling as the season progresses? And do you intend to replace the retired capacity at Cushing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, do you want to respond to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know the capacity in Spearhead goes from 125 up to 190 and &#x2013; or to 195. I am not sure exactly what the production outlook is, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take a stab at that. Spearhead has been quite significantly apportioned for some time. But the expansion isn't just driven by hoping the volumes will come, we conducted an Open Season and have binding contracts for sufficient of the additional capacity that's being added to provide the expected level of returns on the project.</p>
          <p>So I really expect we'll see throughput mount up over a period of time, probably pretty close to the full capacity of the line which is up to now I think 195,000 barrels a day. The one caveat on that, as Pat mentioned earlier, is that Cushing is going to start to get bottlenecked and so there will need to be a solution in the not too far distant future to allow all that crude to flow from Cushing South.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And the capacity that you retired or Segan retired that 500,000 barrels of aging tankage, do you see that being replaced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've added an awful lot of tankage at Cushing over the last little while. There is a certain amount that's retired in the normal course. so that's older smaller tanks. So I think we already have more than replaced it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, I think we've had a net add there, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
