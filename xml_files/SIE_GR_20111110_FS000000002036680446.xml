          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2011 Analyst Conference in London. Siemens' President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher and Chief Financial Officer, Joe K&#xE4;ser, will present to you this afternoon Q4 and full fiscal year results.</p>
          <p>In addition, Peter will give a progress report on our achievements in the light of the strategic framework for value creation One Siemens and an outlook for fiscal year 2012. The earnings release, the FLASHLIGHT and all other documents were published this morning. This conference is being webcast. You can download all the files including this afternoon's presentation from our website. You will also find a replay of the webcast which will be available soon after the conference.</p>
          <p>But also, I would like to refer to the Safe Harbor statement on page number two of the presentation. After the presentation, we will have time for Q&amp;A session and so with that, I'd like to hand over to you, Peter.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Mariel, thank you very much. Welcome and good afternoon to everybody. The City of London needs urban infrastructure transport solutions, so we hope we will have more attendance in a couple of minutes. Siemens is ready to help. I &#x2013; and we want to update you in terms of &#x2013; in our year one of the One Siemens' financial target system. Share with you basically what we have achieved in 2011, but then also focus on the capital efficient growth initiative, what we plan mid-term and finally, the guidance for 2012.</p>
          <p>The strong operational finish delivered in the fourth quarter closed an outstanding fiscal year 2011 where we achieved our goals for the full year. Siemens also proved to be an anchor of stability in an increasing uncertain macroeconomic environment. First, our order intake grew significantly, by 16%. Second, organic revenue growth growing more than two times global GDP, 7%. And third, income from continuing operations excluding the impact from legal and regulatory matters, like the Areva ruling, reached &#x20AC;7.6 billion. The guidance was achieved despite impairment charges in the Solar business of &#x20AC;231 million in the fourth quarter and particle therapy charges of &#x20AC;381 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We delivered on our numbers in 2011 and we made significant progress in streamlining also our portfolio further below the sector. Among others, the most important transactions were the sale of SIS, our Siemens IT Services, to Atos. And it's also our clear intention to list Osram when the capital market conditions have stabilized. Osram delivered 7% comparable revenue growth while delivering a pre-tax margin of 5.2%, somewhat lower than a year ago and similar to Q3.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the key figures of the fourth quarter. As previously indicated, orders in Q4 grew by 2% due to fewer large orders mainly in Fossil and Industry Solutions and tougher comps year-over-year. Revenue growth reached 9% year-over-year, fueled by a double-digit growth in short-cycle businesses and accelerated backlog conversion in the long-cycle businesses. Book-to-bill was again above 1 and reached a healthy 1.04.</p>
          <p>Our backlog increased further to more than &#x20AC;96 billion, of which around &#x20AC;40 billion will convert to sales in 2012. We saw a strong year in quarter for total sectors profit compared to the Q4 last year which was impacted by &#x20AC;1.2 billion Diagnostics impairment charges. On the downside, total sectors profit was this quarter affected by the abovementioned impairment charges for the Solar business, and these charges follow our assessment of the growth prospects and market development what we forecast for the concentrated Solar Power business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we recorded negative effects of &#x20AC;88 million from volatile commodity markets. Since profitability below sectors improved, we can boast healthy EPS numbers of &#x20AC;1.33. A clear focus on the entire team brought stringent execution to achieve a record high free cash flow of almost &#x20AC;3.5 billion and Joe will talk about this in more detail.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the regional perspectives for orders and sales in the fourth quarter. We saw a concentration of large order wins in Europe and particularly in Germany. The base businesses in the Americas and Asia/Australia was very solid but fewer major orders compared to the strong prior year led to a modest decline in this region.</p>
          <p>Major contributor to the order book was the Renewable Energy business. Among others, we won again large contracts for two offshore wind parks in Germany and Denmark. For example, we signed a 288 megawatt project Meerwind S&#xFC;d and Ost from the customer, WindMW, and this is already our sixth large offshore wind park order in German waters and the first one with a private equity investment; Blackstone is a major shareholder of WindMW.</p>
          <p>And in transmission, we extended our leading position in offshore grid connections through the HelWin2 order worth more than &#x20AC;0.5 billion from TenneT. Mobility strengthened its successful development in Russia, where the joint venture Train International (sic) [Train Technologies] with our partner Sinara closed the contract for the delivery of 1,200 regional trains with Russian Railways. On top of that, we were able to secure a 40 years maintenance contract for 54 Sotchi Desiro trains.</p>
          <p>In Healthcare, we were able to close a major &#x20AC;106 million contract for our clinical software package Soarian with a major U.S. healthcare network. The picture of growth distribution is different when we look at revenue. Growth was very broad-based with particular strength in emerging markets, where China for example grew 18%. India and Brazil even topped this performance with both achieving remarkable 30% growth year-on-year. Emerging markets in total already account for 36% of revenue.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the divisional picture for the quarter and major items that drove the profitability. In a very strong Q4, industry achieved a profit margin of 11.3%, delivered 11% organic revenue growth. We were very pleased with the performance of our short-cycle business, Industry Automation and Drive Technologies that continued to show strong double digit growth rates. Margins in industry automations were helped by top line growth, high capacity utilization and a favorable mix with a large portion of high margin Systems business.</p>
          <p>Drive Technologies benefited from higher capacity utilization but saw also continued higher spending in research and development and was impacted by the already-mentioned negative commodity effect. Mobility took its margin up to 7.3% on solid project execution. And looking ahead into 2012, we are confident about the current sales funnel. Energy delivered a solid quarter with healthy revenue growth of 11% with contributions from all divisions and the stable order development.</p>
          <p>As previously indicated, we saw a market driven slowdown of order activity in Fossil Power Generation while we already mentioned large orders in Renewables compensated for this. The book-to-bill ratio for the sector was 1.13 and the backlog stands at &#x20AC;58 billion. Energy showed solid execution and achieved an underlying profit margin of 11.1% despite a negative effect of 300 basis points from the impairment charges for the Solar business mentioned above.</p>
          <p>Fossil Power Generation led all divisions with a profit of &#x20AC;407 million based on excellent project execution in its Solution business. Compared to previous quarters, Fossil recorded a less favorable business mix with lower contributions from the Service business. In addition, energy margins were held back by continued pricing pressure in the Wind business and in parts of power transmission where the transformer and high voltage substations businesses were effective most.</p>
          <p>Power Distribution returned to double-digit profitability despite higher research and development spend and investments in Smart Grid solutions. Healthcare showed a strong earnings performance based on a solid 5% increase in order intake and 4% revenue growth with particular strength in emerging markets. They delivered 20% order growth on the back of a very strong business, for example, in China. And this compensated for ongoing uncertainty in Europe and the U.S. where we still see a softer market environment.</p>
          <p>The main profit driver was an excellent performance of the Imaging and Therapy Systems business. Diagnostics stagnated as expected in bookings and revenues at prior year levels with softening profitability.</p>
          <p>And as you could read in today's announcement, Healthcare has launched a comprehensive program to improve its competitiveness and innovation. The overall goal is to stay ahead of the curve of the expected changes in the Healthcare markets such as increasing cost pressures in developed healthcare systems and growth opportunities in many emerging countries.</p>
          <p>The program contains a combination of growth investments in product development and footprint expansion as well as productivity program to improve the cost position in Diagnostics and repositioning of the Radiation Therapy business. One year ago, we set ourselves ambitious targets with the One Siemens framework to continuously build on our strong and highly competitive, strategic and operational platform and improve performance further.</p>
          <p>When you look at the charts, they were very encouraging. Our organic growth rate of 6.6%, so this is revenue growth versus competition on the upper-left hand side, is 6.6% of Siemens, 3.3% below the 9.9% reported by our peers. But we have to consider that some of our competitors significantly added to our top line through acquisitions while we look for the right target prices at the right time. Despite some headwinds like particle therapy charges in Healthcare and Solar impairment charges, all sectors are well within the targeted margin ranges derived from our industry benchmarks.</p>
          <p>We delivered on our ambition of capital efficiency by achieving a ROCE number of 20.7% and outperformed the target range of 15% to 20%. Strong profitability and focus on working capital management led to this excellent result and including the net benefit from the Areva transaction, the ROCE was even at 24%. So, I would say this is an outstanding achievement when you consider that even taking the extraordinary number of Areva out, we are basically earning three times our capital cost. And you probably do remember, it was not a long time ago, where a big portion of the discussion was, is Siemens able to actually cover its capital cost?</p>
          <p>Our capital structure ratio is below our target of 0.5 to 1 for adjusted net debt over EBITDA. But we believe this is not bad to have a healthy balance sheet. In difficult times, cash is king and the current turbulences in the financial markets due to the public debt crisis and consecutive economic uncertainties call for strong financial flexibilities which we certainly have.</p>
          <p>After the major step-up of the dividend in fiscal 2010, we continue our commitment of offering attractive returns to our shareholders based on the actual business performance. We will propose a further 11% increase to &#x20AC;3.00 and which reflects a payout ratio of 41% right in the middle of our targeted range between 30% and 50%.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me now turn over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. Very warm welcome also from my side. Let's see how that works here. Here we go. And what I would like to continue with is the free cash flow generation. As you can see, the trend itself on our free cash flow generation has been quite similar as to what we have seen in the recent past. I have to admit though that the &#x20AC;5.150 billion came in at a very late stage in September. We would have actually been planning for about &#x20AC;4.2 billion. There were late orders coming in, especially on Wind and Mobility, which had some associated prepayments and we also were not yet in a position to completely settle on our particle therapy topics, so that also about &#x20AC;300 million were actually supposed to be cash out in September, which now are going into October. So, that basically means that we would expect a somewhat more moderate free cash flow going in to 2012.</p>
          <p>We've been still able to manage our working capital turns above nine, which we believe is a quite decent number in comparison in the industry, even though we have not achieved a record of 9.6 which we had a year ago.</p>
          <p>So, if we look into the sources of free cash flow over the past two years, and we obviously now are focused on 2011, you can see that we've been down from a record of &#x20AC;7 billion in 2010 to &#x20AC;5.1 billion. That's total sectors here. And the sources basically came from EBITDA with &#x20AC;800 million higher EBITDA, &#x20AC;800 million, CapEx was about at an outflow of &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>And you can see that the net working capital has been gone up by &#x20AC;2.1 billion, obviously, also as a fall-out of the growth which we had in revenues and also the significant growth in order intake, which actually called for reserving the factors for the business going forward. This was obviously different a year ago, where you could see that the net working capital had actually been contributing &#x20AC;2.3 billion to the cash flow and this time net working capital was going up, eating up some cash into production and inventories, and as you can see, tax has been favorable with &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>If we look into the total bridge of net debt, you can see our &#x2013; and we're talking about Q4 now, not the full year Q4. You can see that from reported net debt of &#x20AC;5.7 billion, the operating activities actually have been contributing quite a significant part to what we believe is a strong free cash flow in Q4. Profitability was up &#x20AC;2.1 billion, inventories actually were reduced by &#x20AC;1.3 billion which also shows that we've been somewhat cautious about the quarter's to come, so we are not going too much into inventories, even though revenues have been high. The receivables on strong revenues have been increasing by &#x20AC;300 million, and as you can see, the change of payables and current liabilities actually helped contributing &#x20AC;1.6 billion to the free cash flow in Q4.</p>
          <p>Now, this one &#x2013; this item actually, usually has a, sometimes at least a tendency to be a source of tax swing in the following fiscal quarter 2012. So, don't be too surprised if fiscal Q1, we'll see some changes here also in the payable matter. And as you can also see, the trend of somewhat smaller prepayments as compared to bookings continues in Q4 and this has been contributing with about &#x20AC;400 million to a reduction in the free cash flow funds.</p>
          <p>So, that leaves us with the financing activities, and you obviously have seen from the financial statements, SFS invested an additional &#x20AC;1.3 billion, mostly in equipment and project financing. CapEx were up &#x20AC;900 million, and as we have reported, there was about &#x20AC;500 million equity, preferred equity contribution to NSN, which then eventually results in a reported net debt of &#x20AC;5 billion. Then if we do the adjustments as we have been describing them in the attachments, you can see that there is net positive adjusted on an industrial base of &#x20AC;1.5 billion plus.</p>
          <p>As you know, we also do consider the pension funding deficit as a liability in our adjusted net debt over EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Now, if we leave away from the cash and asset positions and go to the P&amp;L, you obviously can see that there has been some dynamics, as usual, in the so-called below the sector items. Total sectors in Q4 came in at &#x20AC;2.2 billion. Equity investments was a negative of &#x20AC;49 million. SFS had actually been contributing &#x20AC;123 million, basically covering all the operational items below the line.</p>
          <p>There has been a seasonal high of the so-called corporate items, that usually is &#x2013; Q4 is usually somewhat higher than the average of the quarters; that also has to do with some true-ups in the operational shared service charges out to the sectors. So, if they have been overcharged, they get some credit at year-end. It is not material to the story. It is just an explanation why Q4 usually is somewhat higher than the average over the year.</p>
          <p>There have been some one-off matters in those items. One was the &#x20AC;53 million reimbursement of Atos Services. About &#x20AC;54 million where we took a cautious stand on some government debt in the Southern European Hemisphere and there was another &#x20AC;26 million on volatility on the asset retirement obligation. As you know, this goes up and down depending on the development of the interest discount rate, so that will also remain volatile over time.</p>
          <p>Same matter, you see how that worked out for the full year on the right hand side. It's basically self-explanatory. Due to a one-time positive base effect of &#x20AC;267 million on the employee bonus as of 2010, we have an optical positive of that amount. That opposite does not reoccur going forward, which always needs to be taken into consideration. The whole sovereign debt cautiousness resulted in about &#x20AC;100 million charge overall for the year, as I said, &#x20AC;54 million of that being in Q4.</p>
          <p>And then we had a positive on pensions, which also again, you know is depending on the interest rate development, and therefore, obviously, can be volatile in both directions. We would actually expect that one to be going into negative territory in 2012 as we move along, but I will be coming to that later on. And taxes, obviously, is always something to consider before we end at net income for continued operations at &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, if we go from yesterday to what we should expect, what the community should expect in 2012. On the below the line or below the sector environment, this is what I would like to give you as some heads up here. As far as equity investments are concerned, we expect 2012 another somewhat volatile year. There's expected to be some stability on the Bosch-Siemens JV as we move along. Obviously, also, there is a lot of weakness in the Southern European consumer markets, but the emerging markets and also the East European markets remain strong, so we would expect that to be just about flattish going forward.</p>
          <p>The main driver of volatility is and has been our joint venture on Nokia Siemens Networks. We do expect a material impact in 2012 in a mid-three-digit gross amount of euro that has not yet been the concept fully finalized, but obviously, it goes without saying that we have a fiduciary duty to inform the market that we expect some material impact from the transformation program which NSN will announce anytime soon. But as soon enough as that we have been able to consider it in more detail, so as a household number, mid-three-digit million euro number which we put into our guidance, if you want, what we expect in 2012. The moment we have more substance, the moment the details are out, we obviously will inform the markets on how they will be looking like and what that also gives us in terms of subsequent savings and improvement of positions as we move along.</p>
          <p>On SFS and the centrally managed pension assets, that should actually be just about what you have seen in 2011. SFS has been benefiting quite from a very, very robust and low credit default rate. In 2011, we obviously look forward to seeing that in 2012 but this has never been a guarantee. And also, SFS moves into a more project financing, Siemens industrial support area and that always means that the turn of assets becomes less &#x2013; while it is more dedicated to our Industrial business and that could also result in a somewhat lower return on equity, but in terms of profitability, you should not expect significantly less as to what we've been used to in that particular business.</p>
          <p>SRE, obviously, is the real estate service company. So, if there is any profit, that usually comes from the disposal of real estate; this has been and will be a continued focus. We have about 2 million square meters of empty space in the global scale and you can be rest assured that we share a desire to reduce that to a much less number going forward. Corporate items, if you expect a run rate of about &#x20AC;200 million per quarter on average.</p>
          <p>Our Q4, a bit higher, the rest of the year, a bit less then it will be okay for the greater scheme of things. There is also a &#x20AC;200 million item which is still open with regards to the Siemens IT arrangement with Atos, that will be about &#x20AC;200 million over two years. That has to do with the incremental services which Siemens requests from our IT provider; it's an operational base which we, however, keep at corporate. So, if someone wants to do &#x20AC;100 million each year, it should be okay.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, ladies and gentlemen, corporate treasury and other items that naturally is a volatile matter because of the interest and the currency hedges which in part do not qualify for hedge accounting and will be transferred through the P&amp;L. So, therefore, it depends of course on how interest rates go and what the currencies will do and so we'll keep you updated every quarter.</p>
          <p>Not that much to the below the sector framework on how we have been seeing those items when we looked into 2012. We're coming back to the more operational topic in 2011 and then we'll be going on to '12. In terms of income from continued operations, that one you know already. If we take out the &#x20AC;1 billion Areva, which we considered to be non-operational in our language as to 2011, the income margin would actually be 8.2% which is still up from 2010.</p>
          <p>There is some earnings and growth conversion here obviously despite what we have always said that we continue to invest into organic growth. And that investment into organic growth obviously has been in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A, mostly and predominantly in engineering activities especially in the emerging countries where we have been building up application centers to adapt our products and services and solutions to local demand which has been actually already proven good results in terms of market penetration. That actually was about &#x20AC;400 million year-over-year in R&amp;D, it's &#x20AC;367 million to be accurate. You can see it in the financial P&amp;L statements which are attached to the earnings release, so that here is a more rounding matter, the &#x20AC;300 million. So, it's almost &#x20AC;400 million, &#x20AC;367 million to be accurate.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A expenses, we've kept the G&amp;A mostly flat. So, therefore the most &#x2013; the major part of the investment has been going into sales and marketing and that again is to build up application center to penetrate the markets and make sure that we have a good, decent and robust regional footprint as we move along.</p>
          <p>On the operations side, which is basically the cost of goods sold, gross profit environment, which is on the upper right. Here you can see that our gross profit went up from &#x20AC;20 billion to &#x20AC;22.1 billion, and that &#x20AC;2.1 billion actually resulted on two major factors. First of all, the so-called &#x2013; how we call it, economic equation, which is price decline on one hand on the marketplace and cost savings on the procurement side. You can see that we have been experiencing some headwind here in 2011. Customer price change was &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Having in that, there was, obviously, adverse impact on profit and the procurement activities including design, new design of parts, helped us save &#x20AC;1.3 billion. So, it's been about a billion shy on that marker. So, all in all, the productivity and the product mix has been contributing with &#x20AC;3.1 billion to the bottom line in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now that &#x20AC;3.1 billion was in some part at least, a favorable mix resulting from the fact that our short-cycle high profit business on Industrial Automation and the parts also of Drive Technology has been powering full steam ahead and gave us some incremental product mix margin in 2011. Whether or not that will stay in 2012 obviously will depend on how robust Germany will be on its toolmaker, high tech, high innovation technology end, so that, obviously, the jury is still out on how that will be going. So far, we do not see decisive signs that there should be any significantly weaker any time, but you also, of course, have been seeing some slowdown and some cautiousness especially on the midsize company environment, which is not that connected in the world to see where the opportunities and the risks are. So, in doubt, people stay put and look what the debt crisis is be doing going forward.</p>
          <p>In 2010, just for the record, we had about a tailwind between price change and purchasing savings of about &#x20AC;200 million. So, that actually means that we compensated &#x20AC;1.2 billion on incremental headwinds between customer price savings &#x2013; customer price change and purchasing savings. You can see that something also happens in the company in terms of productivity and innovation in the design of products in the company.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, that has been yesterday. Now, what in a way has been our thought process when we came out with the guiding range of what the market ought to expect in 2012. On the customer price change, we see or expect some ease of pricing pressure on average from about 3 percentage points in 2011 to between 2.5% and 2.8%. The biggest ease is expected to be in the Industrial. Environment, Energy and Healthcare remain to be a very, very competitive market; there's not much change in the price decline as compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>The purchasing area is not going to be exactly helpful. There will be some &#x20AC;600 million, &#x20AC;700 million on adverse impact which we expect to hit the bottom line in 2012; that actually comes from the fact that all our suppliers are fully booked. As we are in major parts, and so therefore, we've been successful, but also at some point in time, you obviously see a flattening on what is achievable and that's why we also have been shifting our emphasis in the procurement area from the more negotiation and pooling point of view into a joint development of parts to make sure everyone has a sustainable benefit going forward, supplier as well as we as a company.</p>
          <p>Now, on OpEx and CapEx; we do continue to invest into organic growth. And obviously, 2012 will not be the year that this will all be pushing growth upwards because the market and global environment is not as such. But the year and the business does not end in 2012; we also have our midterm targets in mind. As you all know, this investment needs to come earlier before the results hurt you. So, that's why we have in our view of 2012 and what we have been telling the market on how that should look like, we expect OpEx to grow between &#x20AC;1.1 billion and &#x20AC;1.3 billion. And OpEx obviously being R&amp;D, selling and G&amp;A, and for the most part, this will be R&amp;D and in some part also the selling part of SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Another area where we also continue to invest is CapEx where we expect CapEx to grow between &#x20AC;0.3 billion to &#x20AC;0.5 billion going forward. So, that will actually be expected to be in the range of &#x20AC;1.9 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. We will be investing those OpEx and the CapEx into field application, into engineering, into further boosting our SMART initiative to address the local demand in emerging countries, which still our belief to have north of 5% to 6% growth. And obviously, the CapEx investment goes into manufacturing sites, such as Russia, where we have been reasonably successful in building new relationships, which also will provide geographic footprint and local investment and will also be in Wind and it will predominantly be in the area of the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>So, that much to the framework of what we have been using for our 2012 outlook. Obviously, the future is uncertain but at least we believe that the market ought to understand our thought process. We may be right; we can be wrong but if you've been wrong then you know where the changes are and what that would mean to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll give it and hand it back to Peter for the 2012 and outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you much, Joe. On this chart, you can see that we have, in the meantime, which we are real aware of basically fully aligned our organizational responsibility with our megatrend strategy, the new core industry sectors really now focused on its core industrial base. We have now also leveraged the excellent expertise and experience, what we have gotten in the service area, so we have a dedicated service division also now for our industry. And the focus is really now a much more focus on the key industrial verticals.</p>
          <p>The new IC sector on the right hand side has &#x2013; obviously is a key focus basically. Of course, continues to improve the operational excellence in its businesses, step into new growth fields such as emerging markets through footprint expansions, what Joe has just mentioned, also the SMART initiative then through portfolio expansion and innovative markets like building automation, or vertical software solutions. So, this will be a key focus and third, of course, is establishing also an integrated and effective go-to-market approach for the overall sectors.</p>
          <p>So, we want to really have a very focused customer approach not just for cities but also for logistic hubs, for airports and so on and so forth. The market potential, what this new sector is stepping into is a &#x20AC;300 billion market and we will report actually early December. The new reporting structure and the comparable fiscal 2011 numbers based on the new organization will be published on December 2. And Roland Busch will then give you an update on the IC activities and a more detailed information on the strategic priorities doing an IC Analyst Call on December 5, and you will get all the additional information shortly through Mariel and her team.</p>
          <p>&#x20AC;100 billion, and which are the key growth drivers in terms of contributors to this &#x20AC;100 billion market. Obviously, as you can see, a big driver will be the energy sector and then, of course, all sectors will have a role to play in terms of how they will contribute to the incremental &#x2013; I give you just a number in terms of &#x2013; if we go back &#x2013; if you take today's portfolio, the &#x20AC;74 billion in 2011 and you map it back into 2003, this portfolio has actually grown 8 percentage points, roughly half/half between organic growth and M&amp;A activities.</p>
          <p>So, going forward, we will continue to drive with the core focus and organic growth strategy but, of course, we will also look into M&amp;A activities. Very briefly, some illustrations on the key levers. So, as I said, one of the key priorities and benefits and the advantages, what we have is the resilience of our product portfolio and the two main drivers for our revenue growth will be, first &#x2013; and here, you can see just the operational performance if you go back once more.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, the operational performance, full-year 2008, 3.5%, now 12.6%. I think we have also proven that even during a significant global downturn, the last recession, to be resilient in terms of growth portfolio and this year, again, we are back to more than growing double the speed of the global economy.</p>
          <p>Key growth driver will, of course, one of them be, on the left-hand side, the environmental portfolio. We are growing. We have grown it to, in the meantime, &#x20AC;29.9 billion, growing 9%. You know that we have the target out for &#x20AC;40 billion in 2014, and the environmental portfolio today is already 41% of our total revenue.</p>
          <p>The second key growth driver will be the emerging markets. Again, between 2010 and 2011, we were able to pick up another percentage point in the meantime from an order intake as well as revenue. 33% of our sales is coming already from the emerging markets. If you look into the employee base, we were also, as Joe was highlighting, through a significant build up of our employee base in terms of adding on engineering capacity for the field applications and for the SMART initiatives. And now, we already have 27% of our total employee base already in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>When &#x2013; in terms of the indicators for the forecast, as we look into 2012, obviously, the environment is and the economy is clearly showing weakness. We see it on a daily and hourly basis. After, one has to say a much stronger recovery, so a couple &#x2013; if you go back 18 months, I think nobody would have expected the rather rapid recovery in what we have seen over the last 18 months. And in many industry, we are now back in terms of capacity utilization at a pre-crisis level.</p>
          <p>But without any doubt did we see a slowdown of the cycle. We see still a very differentiated picture in terms of growth dynamics, emerging markets significantly higher than the industrial world, being it Europe or the United States, and of course, the combination of public debt, of structural deficits and of high unemployment in a number of European countries and also the U.S. is weighting on the global economy.</p>
          <p>When we look into our businesses, we have to assume realistically we are taking into account some impact from the highly volatile financial markets on the real economy, and we expect continued flattening revenue growth in the short-cycle businesses. At present, we see some signals for slowing on the still high capacity utilization levels. And bearing this in mind and building on the comments from Joe, I want to summarize it in terms of outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>We expect a moderate organic revenue growth. Moderate meaning 3% to 5% compared to fiscal 2011 and orders again exceeding revenues for a book-to-bill well above one. We anticipate continued strong earnings performance in our businesses despite ongoing pricing pressure and higher operating expenses as was outlined by Joe. We set our goal for fiscal 2012 income from continued operations based on the high level we achieved in 2011 excluding the net positive effect of &#x20AC;1 billion related to Areva, that lifted the income to &#x20AC;7 billion in fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>In the year ahead, we anticipate profit impacts related to repositioning activities, as was already mentioned by Joe, at the NSN and the Healthcare sector and higher pension expenses. And please also note, this outlook excludes significant portfolio effects and impacts related to legal and regulatory matters. It is also conditional on continued revenue growth, particularly for businesses that are sensitive to short-term changes in the economic environment.</p>
          <p>And if I summarize, Siemens is in a position of real strength as a company overall. We are operating at high efficiency with a strong portfolio, standing for stability and confidence even in the challenging times of today. We will continue to invest selectively for midterm growth initiatives to drive innovation and the expansion of our footprint. And we also have the financial flexibility to act. And with this, Joe and myself are ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Before we start the Q&amp;A, I'd like to briefly draw your attention to the financial calendar. Peter already mentioned in his speech two dates that are I think important for you, December 2 where we will release the fiscal year 2011 financials in the new sector structure. That is on Friday the 2nd. Then on Monday the 5th, we will organize a conference call to walk you through the financials that Roland released before the weekend. Joe will be present at that call as well as Roland Busch who is the CEO of the new sector, Infrastructure &amp; Cities, and you'll have the opportunity to ask questions around that sector.</p>
          <p>For those two dates, before we go then to our Christmas holiday and then afterwards in the New Year, I'd like to draw your attention to February 14 where we will organize a Capital Market Day for the sector Healthcare. This will be taking partly in London, and of course, you will be informed in due times about all the details of both the calls and the Capital Market Day.</p>
          <p>So, with this, we can start the Q&amp;A. I'll ask you to please shortly mention your name and company name so that also the people that are online watching this on the webcast can follow you. We will start with the last row. We'll start with Mark Troman.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Mark Troman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just two questions please. The first one is on productivity. You showed the interesting slide on page 14, productivity mix and others and explained, obviously, the mix factors. But how much productivity could we get out of 2012 fiscal year? I guess you've got initiatives in Healthcare, for example. But how much could we get in terms of a positive driver on that bridge compared to the pricing and higher selling and R&amp;D expenses, et cetera, that you highlighted on the next slide? That's question one.</p>
          <p>And question two, on the balance sheet, you're clearly well below the gearing target net debt to EBITDA of 0.5 to one times. What's your attitude to M&amp;A here? Is it, let's keep the balance sheet as strong as possible given the problems in European sovereign credit markets, et cetera, or are you happy to go spend on the right M&amp;A to that gearing target. I am just wondering if that gearing target has effectively been adjusted in the short term because of what's going on in Southern Europe. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. On productivity, I mean, obviously, when you look at the page 13, which goes into 2012, I mentioned the customer price change, right? I said that there could be some ease of the headwind between purchase price change and what we are able to do short term on the procurement side. So, the headwind was &#x20AC;800 million in 2011 and slight ease could be &#x20AC;700 million or maybe &#x20AC;650 million, pick a number, and then you know that moderate growth of between 3% and 5% on revenues, I guess that's pretty easy to do the math.</p>
          <p>The big unknown, now on a very serious note, because this is a serious matter, very big uncertain matter we have in the whole model, which we believe is extremely transparent, may not be liked but it's transparent. Is that the short-cycle businesses, Industrial Automation, major parts of DTE, for example, Drive Technology, are obviously volatile in terms of how &#x2013; what the customer's impact mean on our revenues, top and bottom line.</p>
          <p>Just to give an example, the backlog of Industrial Automation is less than a month. And as flexible as you can be as a company, there is no way, if there was an incident here driven by markets and customers and the like, that this could actually be compensated in some way. And that's the big uncertainty moving into 2012 and that obviously is the big volatility &#x2013; potential volatility on what we expect is doable in terms of top and bottom line going forward.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, obviously, this is an important matter to us too because we've laid out the capital structure and we're also committed to make good on it over time. We always look here about that this is not going to be an annual matter where we do some final adjustments in the fourth quarter but this is more a message to shareholders, to bondholders and especially also our customers, and we continue to be committed to it. There is two factors; one, obviously, is the fact that there has been a fundamental multiple compression in the capital goods environment. That's been true for everyone.</p>
          <p>And the second topic is indeed that we've been somewhat concerned about the effectiveness of the political leadership of those economies, which have been causing the debt crisis, to fix it. And that is something which obviously is an important matter, so we'll remain cautious on our liquidity. We'll be sure that at any given point in time, we'll be operationally and strategically flexible. By the same token, we have our shareholders in mind and this is what will guide us as we move into 2012.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Three questions please. On the new sector, Infrastructure &amp; Cities, do I understand it correctly that you're ruling out any major restructuring of that business, given your guidance, there is no mention of it restructuring?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Diagnostics, the margins have been sliding for the last two years now. They reached a new low in Q4; is there anything you can say to give us any confidence that the margins are going to start going in the opposite direction?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, you said this morning, you were going to invest a large amount of money in Russia, I think it was &#x20AC;1 billion. According to Transparency International, Russia is one of the most corrupt countries on earth. So, can you give us some indication on how you're going to keep Siemens clean in an environment like that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I mean this is &#x2013; I make it very simple. We only do clean business. And I said this already &#x2013; I mean since I joined the company. So, this is our commitment overall. This is nothing and we can do the same thing in Russia. We have a very long history in Russia. We know this country extremely well. We know perfectly the infrastructure needs and the modernization agenda and we are a respected company, which is just a demonstration of, for example, the success what we have with the state rail organization where we have major, major order wins and they'll &#x2013; we will certainly not be the last one.</p>
          <p>So, the success speaks for itself and when you look into the energy agenda and the energy need of the country and the infrastructure build out, Siemens is a prime address. We are totally committed and the &#x20AC;1 billion is just in terms of its &#x2013; it's the biggest investment program what we have ever done in Russia, but it's also a commitment in terms of to do it in partnership and to focus on that we localize part of it. That we have integrated value chains and that we participate in this modernization agenda. So, I think this is &#x2013; we have outstanding opportunities, but for sure, the only thing what we do are clean business without any doubt.</p>
          <p>DX, Peter, I can only say I am as disappointed as you are. I mean, there is unfortunately no silver bullet. I mean we know that medium term, this needs an extra basically equipment generation, and therefore, the business has now decided to clearly look into the cost base, drive productivity programs and we will readjust to this new environment, and therefore, obviously the margin will turn and the productivity and cost setting measures what this business is now taking is in this regard very, very important.</p>
          <p>The new IC sector, of course, this a growth initiative. I mean there's nothing to do with restructuring. You should not anticipate a &#x2013; this is not a restructuring story. This is really making sure that we have organizationally aligned the strategy. What we have is just somewhere within different divisions or different businesses, so we have now a totally integrated management team and with Roland sitting on our table in terms of &#x2013; as a board member was a clear commitment of the organization to make sure that we have an integrated, comprehensive execution plan behind this initiative and that we go beyond just declaring it as a megatrend and as a strategy. So, no charges what you should anticipate in this area.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. Two quick questions on the businesses and then a broader picture question. On Fossil, you called for a weaker second half this year; how do you see that into next year in terms of is it, in terms of order intake? Are we at stable levels or is that going to pick up again?</p>
          <p>On Healthcare, if you just look at the larger imaging modalities, are there any issues there in terms of what you need to do as well on emerging market growth and cost in terms of maybe you could describe a bit what you see there on cost pressure from the customers? On the bigger picture question, your earnings have grown faster than most of your competitors the last few years. Your multiple has fallen faster than most of your competitors in the last few years in terms of an earnings multiple, what's your analysis on what you need to do to reverse that trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, I start with the last one and I will take your heading and it was picked up very well in the meantime in the press as well. You called it a "lost year" for Siemens. So, the good thing is we have to continue to execute. I mean it is up to our shareholder to make their choices and to decide how they view us. For us, it's a continuous execution and to demonstrate that we are &#x2013; have a consistent capital efficient growth story which is clearly focused and dedicated not just to customers but also on the execution plans and the growth story what we are laying out.</p>
          <p>So, we will continue to execute. And we are also living in an environment where many times, share price has nothing to do with actually performance of the company. If you remember our third quarter call, end of July, the share price was somewhere around &#x20AC;90; all of us went on holidays, came back after the holidays and the share price was below &#x20AC;70 without any change in terms of company guidance, without any additional company information. So, we will drive the company, continue to execute well and do it on a consistent basis over the long term and then I'm convinced that the shareholders will eventually see it in a similar light.</p>
          <p>So, Fossil, you was mentioning in terms of the order intake, what we have flagged. Indeed, we have flagged it right in this context, first half versus second half. We probably see a similar level going for 2012. Obviously, regionally, it will be most likely quite different. We see basically energy expansion projects, so incremental capacity still in emerging economies and then basically more efficient gas turbines, for example, in the developed world. It will be probably a more flattish environment in the U.S. I'm talking about always market, okay? But overall, we would anticipate a similar type of market environment compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>Your question on the modalities; indeed, the large modality business is market leader. We have an extremely good portfolio. In the meantime, the Chinese market is actually our second biggest market. So, we have very, very strong growth in China. And in this modality, Siemens has already for a number of years executed the plan, what we are now trying to drive for other businesses, the SMART initiatives, being it CT scanners, being it the very efficient MRI scans. So, this business is basically continuing to drive their innovation agenda towards gearing of a broader product range with different price points but this is nothing new because they have already done it very successfully. So, I would say, continue to execute what you have already demonstrated and continue to do it well. So, I'm quite confident about this part of the business because as you are pointing out in terms of the market environment in the public healthcare systems will not change. There is less money available in the public healthcare system.</p>
          <p>The pricing pressure will continue and you need to have product ranges which are attractive at different price points and different type of ability to address different market needs for different hospitals, for example. This will not change. The U.S. will continue to be &#x2013; to stay like this and Europe will also do so and we are gearing more and more the organization also to make sure that we have this product ranges and the same type of philosophy, not just for the peak imaging modalities but also for the rest of the business.</p>
          <p>And, for example, the DX business has done very little historically. And now, we are driving this business also more and more towards &#x2013; in this direction. This is pretty much &#x2013; DX used to have a very, very focused footprint in terms of the industrialized world, U.S. and Europe, and now we are also looking into, how can we leverage what the big modalities have already done for &#x2013; as part of this cost repositioning and productivity measures, what we do. So, it's also an aspect of cross-sharing of best practices within Healthcare.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben Uglow, Morgan Stanley. I have a couple of questions. I guess they may be slightly unfair but about the margin ranges and the guidance. We sat here for a long time talking about Industrial Automation and drives as a sort of co-division where the margins were typically in the 10% to 14% waveband and that was actually an ambitious target for some time. We've gone through, as Mr. L&#xF6;scher described, an unusual demand environment where you've got 50% year-over-year growth in German machining orders, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Currently, those margins are close to 20%. If we get into a slower environment, what I'm curious to know from Joe is, are we coming back now down toward a more normal 10% to 14% range or has the change at Industrial Automation made it such that structurally you're going to be much closer to 20%? Basically, I guess what I'm asking is, if demand comes down, are we going back to the old days or can we stay are at a reasonably high level, not necessarily where we are today? So, that was the question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two was just on your guidance. When I managed to decipher the underlying situation this morning, what you're actually saying is on a continuing net income basis, you actually expect a reasonable uplift year-over-year in your profit. That was my interpretation after we take out Healthcare and NSN charges. Listening to the description of the headwinds between price, et cetera, it seems to me like you've got some pressures.</p>
          <p>So, what is it in your portfolio that makes you confident about growing the underlying profit? Is it simply that you've got such a big backlog right now, &#x20AC;40 billion plus, that as that comes through, it's inevitable that your net income will go up?</p>
          <p>And the third question, unfortunately, is obviously on NSN. I listened to the discussion this morning about future-oriented technology, et cetera. The further restructuring in NSN, is it aimed basically at taking employees out, i.e., a cost reduction or is there something more fundamental in terms of portfolio that you need to address? Basically, are we simply trying to get down from 60,000 employees or do you need to do more deals like Motorola or whatever? What additional needs to be done to NSN to fix it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you, Ben. I would not say that the questions are unfair. They are hard to answer because they kind of involve the future and that's always, as you know, more difficult than to analyze the past. On the environment, and obviously, the significant impact of the short-cycle businesses in the company, to obviously the well being of the top and the bottom line.</p>
          <p>From what I can see is that actually, the structure has been going in two opposite direction. So, the sensitivity to strengths or weakness on the cycle has actually become higher and that's got to do with two matter. First, in general, about the fact that we have been driving and pushing automation forward on both end to save cost on the one hand and also to make sure that we are not lacking qualified resources, and cannot fulfill customer orders. So, the fixed cost content has become relative less flexible, which is also good in the upturn and as you remember in 2010 and '11, we have delivered on what we said, if the cycle goes up, we'll deliver &#x20AC;0.70 plus on the euro to the bottom line, that if you look at it, has been achieved.</p>
          <p>Then secondly, the sensitivity to volatility also has been going up due to the fact that the software content of the business. Think about PLM and the likes has been growing relative to the mechanics and that, obviously, as you know, software is always something which is considered icing on the cake and the lack thereof, obviously, it's the lack of that structural benefit. And it is why we are obviously highly alert and very sensitive as to what we hear in the market from both the automotive industry, which is one of the major customers in that respect, and then secondly, the mid-size high tech tool makers industry which is really known for top-of-the-line innovation products from Siemens.</p>
          <p>The second, on the guidance, I mean what is going on? As long as we assume that the short-cycle environment is slowing growth but still is robust in terms of downside protection, the numbers are not overly conservative but achievable. And, obviously, we are not planning for any project charges of this and that. We have been &#x2013; and this is important and if you read the guidance, we have been defining the non-ops, if you want, to be &#x20AC;1 billion. You may come up with different numbers in your analysis, which in a way is agreeable, but since there is differences of opinion of what is operational and what not, we defined it, to give the market a clear sign on what we mean by non-operational. One could also make an argument that particle therapy charges are non-reoccurring and, for example, that take into this consideration or others then you will as well see that the bottom line in 2012, what we consider to be operational, could be different. That's what it is, we have a clear transparent in our thinking.</p>
          <p>On NSN, I mean, obviously, if you heard this morning's comments, which we have been making in the press conference, first of all, contrary to Industrial Automation or imaging or DX or Fossil, this is a joint venture and we have one share less than the second shareholder. So, there is, by nature, a limited amount of direct access into the operation and it shouldn't be. By the same token, though, the shareholders have made it reasonably clear that matters need to change to the better. They've been supporting the asset with a preferred equity injection. We also agree that we have a full time &#x2013; before we did that, a full time and operational Chairman in place who oversees the development of actions in the company.</p>
          <p>I mean, obviously, when I said this morning that this could be a mid-three-digit million amount which we have been considering, it has been a peer amount as a marker. The company is currently working on a strategic concept and that will involve both on how to take it to the level the company deserves to be, and secondly, what that would mean to the current set of operation.</p>
          <p>And the moment that it's ready, NSN will go out and announce the details and the equity story as well as the cost savings part. This is important, we obviously need to respect the agreements and the agreements say that Nokia has the full consolidating entity of NSN will also do the reporting to the market.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a guideline, what to expect in 2012 and what the assumption has been on our part, would that could mean. This is by no means any guidance in terms of this will be the number and this will be write-downs, this will be results, this or that. It is just a marker that you know what we have considered because, obviously, the fact of the matter is we need to go out today and give the market a view of how we expect the world to develop in 2012.</p>
          <p>And the assets which we own 50% as one share of will be likely going out later. So, that's got to be some sense of what we have been expecting and, obviously, that mid-to-three-digit million number does not include any paybacks already since if we haven't &#x2013; as a concept, yet you should not really plan with a lot of benefits to come over time. So, that's all what it is. There's nothing more and nothing less to it.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We will continue with James Stettler, first row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, James Stettler from UniCredit. In an environment where growth is slowing, what makes you think that the pricing pressure is going to be less than this year and can you talk a bit about the problem areas that we know of Wind and T&amp;D, is that getting any better? And then in terms of your growth, you're talking about 45% contribution from Energy to the &#x20AC;100 billion, what's really driving that? Is it Fossil? Is it Renewables? Is it acquisitions and if so, where are the biggest gaps that you need to fill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe I'll start with the pressure &#x2013; pricing matters. Obviously, we've got four sectors. And we had about 3% on average last year and expect that to be slightly less, I mean, obviously, it's not that big of a difference to be between 2.5% and 2.8%. I also said earlier that we do not expect an improvement or benefit in Energy and Healthcare. Those markets remain to be extremely competitive. So, that should not be a sign here that Energy like, for example, Transmission or Wind would be any easier to sell and to win as it was in 2011.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, markets go tougher in terms of winning orders. There's enough demand but obviously, there is also consolidation, and there are also competitors in the market who do not really have a big interest about EBITDA of 10% to 15% but how to survive the next quarter. That always makes the market somewhat volatile because you never know. But where we expect actually the price decline to ease, that's the industry sector; new industry sector. So, why do we believe that? First of all, it is still our view that Industrial Automation and Drive Technologies are not declining even though growth eases</p>
          <p>And secondly, that's important, those two assets, Siemens assets as well as the market, operates at capacity &#x2013; operates at capacity. And there have been little CapEx investments in the years of 2010 and '11 because in all essence, what we have been doing in that particular business was nothing, as to come back to the levels where we were at 2011.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at the &#x2013; in the order intake of Siemens in that particular business, we are just about at the order intake level as we were in 2008 when we jumped off, or some jumped off the cliffs. So, it's been a recovery. And that huge recovery actually in 2011, starting in 2010, on the order side has nothing been &#x2013; has nothing else been as to catch up again to what we lost at the year before which was minus 16% and we added plus 14% less than. So, if you deduct minus 16% from the top &#x2013; minus 14% from the top and add 16% from the bottom, we are at the same level as we used to be.</p>
          <p>And that actually means that we are at full capacity. So, if you operate at full capacity and even only grow nominal, for example, just making it up now, okay? Just making it up, if you don't even grow at nominal basis at all, you still need to have more output in order to preserve the same nominal level because there is at least some price decline and if you added capacity, that actually gives you some leeway of being more firm on pricing. So, that's the assumption.</p>
          <p>If for example, Industrial went down, Motion Control went down, Drives went down, capacities would be easing, utilization would be easing and that usually causes some disturbance in the market in terms of pricing.</p>
          <p>The same token, though, we have to say that our experience has been &#x2013; last time it was going down, we'd actually been expecting huge price decline and in Industrial Automation for the most part, it didn't happen that badly because there seems to be a significant stickiness on the installed base. This is in particular true for process industries but in parts also in the discrete part of the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And James, on the Fossil, the 45% of the incremental growth, I mean it's clear that we are benefiting from the breadth of our Energy portfolio and I would say across the board, there will be growth. But obviously, in terms of &#x2013; if you start, for example, with what Joe was just highlighting, the importance of building installed base for the Fossil business, so continue to build market share and be successful in the Fossil area is a very important one. This then as a consequence will then drive service growth going forward.</p>
          <p>The Renewable business is a very important one with, at this point in time, quite different dynamics between Wind and Solar. Wind, the opportunity right now is to industrialize and to globalize or to regionalize the business extremely well and the Solar business is currently impacted by the overall environment, what we see in terms of cuts or subsidies and the uncertainty what we see. But medium term, it will be an interesting business opportunity, when we talk about the transmission, HVDC, so the oil and gas. I mean they are nascent fields in there, which we will continue to drive subsea electrification, for example, is a very interesting area for us.</p>
          <p>So, there is current strong businesses and then there are very specific technology areas, which we will continue to drive and to build. But overall, across the spectrum of Energy, I mean the energy demand will double. Is &#x2013; the question is, will it be in 2030, or it will be in 2040? And there is no other company who has the comprehensive portfolio what we have and this is what we leverage in terms of footprint, also global footprint and take advantage of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we still have a number of people wanting to ask questions. We'll go to him in the middle, with Daniela Costa. Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, one regarding the change in the prepayments profile, the slight negative headwind that is on page 11. Does this in any sense comes as a reflex of actually the regional mix changing and customers in emerging regions being less willing to give large prepayments? And the second question on Transmission, the German electricity regulator has been stressing that the upgrade of the grid is quite urgent. What is the timeline you see in terms of that upgrade actually coming through in terms of orders and could that be beneficiary to pricing in any sense? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, upsides are always welcome, but by the same token, we only can take it very seriously once they have arrived as orders. So, I would not jump too quickly to positive conclusions. This is opportunity and those opportunities are needed in Transmission. There is &#x2013; it has been for quite some time, some oversupply, some weakness in transformers and also some very competitive pricing environments in substations, so that segment definitely would need some incremental demand which ease the minds of the suppliers.</p>
          <p>So, we welcome any insight and any way of the regulator understanding that energy generation is something, but it also needs to be put to where it is needed, and that means the industry. So, of course, we support it. We have the solutions and we definitely like to hear that. But then again, it has not arrived in any pre-order discussions at this time. But the sentiment is positive.</p>
          <p>That also, by the way, is true due to the fact that if you want to have renewable energy like Wind, that just happens to be the north of Europe but most of the energy is needed in the south of Europe. So, there's a natural follow-through to that question on how we generate energy for Germany in the future. And that's relevant to Transmission.</p>
          <p>On the reduction of the prepayment, the ones who've been following us for a long period of time, know that we've been flagging that for quite some time. There have been some pockets of ease on the matter for some times again, but the general trend on prepayments is that it's &#x2013; relative to the order intake, it's been going down over time and it seems that people are holding on to liquidity and people are holding on to a lesser leverage as they used to consider normal in the past.</p>
          <p>And that's been also one of the reasons why we ourselves make sure that Siemens can also do asset and vendor financing if need be, because other sources of financing have not been that available anymore as they used to.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Will Mackie from Berenberg Bank. Firstly, just to follow on from what you mentioned there, Joe, against a background were some financial institutions are withdrawing capital, you've made a big step up in the assets within SFS. Perhaps you could talk a little bit to how you see that portfolio evolving? I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SFS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And to what extent that could really be used as a competitive tool or just a business enabler. Then with regard to Healthcare, it may be preemptive but against the backdrop of the Agenda 2013 you've put out, what sort of returns maybe even at the EBITDA or EBIT margin level would you expect that Diagnostics could return to under some of the scenarios that you're contemplating at the moment?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on the cash flow, I think you've flagged already that there's some timing issues and some flow-back into next year. Perhaps you could highlight what sort of total cash outflow, particularly with regard to SIS, I think you flagged in the statement...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...we could expect into next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, why don't I maybe start with the cash flow? As you know, it's been &#x20AC;5.2 billion in 2011. I kind of taxed the amount, which we actually have been planning for in 2012 in the neighborhood of &#x20AC;1 billion plus. There is another &#x20AC;800 million to &#x20AC;900 million around about of cash outflow of charges which we have been booking related mostly to SIS but in parts also particle therapy in 2011, that all materializes in 2012 and following in parts even 2013. So, if someone expects those two &#x2013; that the total of those two matters to be an adverse impact on 2012, you might be just right on.</p>
          <p>On SFS, obviously, SFS has been and even continues to be more a business enabler to the Industrial side of the business. We're always clear that SFS is not a business core in itself. It's got to have some, obviously, some external matters too, because you always need to make sure that you have the same tools in place as others have who are in that business for a living. But first and foremost, SFS serves the Industrial businesses of Siemens and make sure that through combining the industrial &#x2013; the financial logic by project financing with the industrial logic that we have a competitive benefit going forward.</p>
          <p>So, what do I mean with that? For example, if we participate in equity for wind parks or likes, that will help finance the project. That will help basically that we get incremental orders, so what we do is we look into the risk assessment of the financial logic as any financial or decently run and controlled financial institution does and then we combine what the incremental gross margin on the order looks like and look at what the risk and opportunity profile is.</p>
          <p>So, clearly, SFS in the &#x2013; for the most part, for the material part will support Industrial businesses of the four sectors and that is also the &#x2013; has been also been the increase on the balance sheet which has been going into that. It will continue to be the case in 2012, where we would expect SFS to grow its balance sheet between, depending on, of course, the business opportunities between &#x20AC;1 billion and &#x20AC;1.5 billion, okay? That's just about what, in our liquidity assessment, the marker is for 2012 and that's mostly related to helping the project business grow going forward and support it.</p>
          <p>The flipside of that, of course, is that the turns, the capital turns go down a bit because those are usually long-term items rather than the small-ticket type of lease which is usually highly profitable. So, you could expect actually the return on equity to be down a little a bit but it's been north of 25%. So, if we continue to be north of 20%, it's still a decent way to spend our money and get something in return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll continue with James Moore over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions, three if I could; two financial and one subjective question on the guidance. On the pricing, you talked about 3%; could you give us some sense as to how that looked in 2011 by the three sectors?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on Fossil, your first nine-month margin of 22.5% dropped 700 basis points to 15.5% in the fourth quarter and you signaled that there would be some impact there, but I wondered if you could help us a little understand what proportion service was of sales in the quarter versus the first nine months? And how much of that first nine-month margin was provision release? Because I suspect there's an element of that in there.</p>
          <p>And just subjectively on the guidance, in the last couple of years, you've set two profit guidances, both of which you beat comprehensively. And should we think about you as being as conservative in your makeup of this guidance this time or have you learned a little?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may on the third question, on the guidance. Look, time will tell. Time will tell. We've been on &#x2013; guidance is always something to look into the future. We want to be transparent. The market understands our thought process and if their thought process changes, then they know exactly where the changes are and can reflect that in the difference. And if I look back on the last three years, there have been more points that we were right rather than wrong. So, I guess the score at this point in time is even, with a share of the miss, sometimes on those matters. So, as I said, time will tell. The market knows what our thought process is. We are very transparent on what we expect and how we've been looking at the year ahead.</p>
          <p>There is enough time to correct matters if the environment changes or think about the incremental OpEx, which actually has been slightly accelerating as compared to the OpEx spend in 2011. The beauty of that is, it's still a plan. So, if we, for example, see some incremental front end here, we still can say, well, we are not just growing like that. Maybe we get a little slower. It's much better than you have to correct your cost structure because that usually costs you twice at the time when you decided, it means restructuring. So, that's something we, of course, we always keep in mind as we move along because all the times are uncertain.</p>
          <p>And they are not so much uncertain because the industrial world doesn't know how to run its business. The times are uncertain because in some part, we do have a political crisis that people don't know any more on how to fix the matters they have been actually causing over time. And this is something which is an area of concern, but too an area of influence. And that's how we get the focus on what we can influence and we want to make transparent on how we operate in that matter. So, that much for the guidance.</p>
          <p>On Fossil, obviously, we have been continuously saying that those margins which we really liked a lot because they were different a few years ago have included kind of an over-performance as we call it of about 300 plus base points. That came in part from the release of some reserves that we didn't dare to be that optimistic on our execution, and it also was like a real good <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:29:28) beyond our contingencies, which we have been planning in the order intake calculation. So, that will be the 350 base points. We really look forward to see that again, but obviously, this is something we do not calculate with and, at some point in time, this will normalize on that area.</p>
          <p>And the Q4 impact, which was somewhat light, was predominantly due to the fact that we do see now that much in coming back to normal on one hand and it should stay in that level into 2012. But it was also a quite a material seasonal impact for the Service business which happens at times, especially during the summer season, when the utilities need every kilowatt in order to cool down the houses. They don't let your service guy into the turbines and that, obviously, took its toll on the combined margins.</p>
          <p>So, I guess the times of the 20%s plus are not really sustainable but if someone is in the 17%, 18% range, maybe sometime a bit below, a bit above depending on the structure, that we believe is quite an industrially feasible and good performance. On the pricing, I appreciate the effort but I respectfully decline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we're running a little bit out of time but I'll still try to get to take all the questions. So, we have here in the front in the second row, we have Jay Cooper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay Cooper is my name with Wellington Shields in New York. I have a question about your Renewables business, what I see is sort of a competition arising between PV Solar and what you've concentrated most of your efforts on, it seems to me, the Concentrating Solar, CSP. So, I find in talking with your people recently at industry conferences that you have formed a new vertically integrated sales organization to contact &#x2013; to drive specifically PV Solar business. And I'm wondering where this is going? How important it is? Does it mean that you're trying to balance CSP versus PV Solar in your portfolio? And that's about it, if you can answer that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay, if I give you &#x2013; I mean obviously we looked a couple of years back also in terms of how do we see the different technologies. We at that point thought that actually CSP has an advantage because we have the storage facility and actually we did not anticipate the price level what we currently see with PV. So, if you just looked in the last two years in terms of the glut which exist in terms of PV, the PV capacity, which is installed and the demand which is currently happening, there's obviously a massive price decline on PV. So, the &#x2013; we believe both technologies are viable going forward. It will be in different applications.</p>
          <p>In some instances, obviously, when you go for big, big megawatt plants, the CSB has clearly its advantage but it has to be developed, and most recently, we have seen that even CSB projects are converted back into PV, for example, in the United States. And the overall environment is such that both technologies are currently seeing a slowdown because we see the subsidy picture around the world being more constrained and the tax incentives are coming down. So, it will be very important to reach wholesale grid parity in terms of &#x2013; and I think at this point in time, this is not a mature technology field. So, as a company, you have to basically make a couple of technology bets and then at the end of the day, we will see which applications with which technology will actually increase further.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, overall, it's a very attractive field. It is important but I think it's too early to tell because the industry is not as mature that you say this will be the winning technology even within PV. I mean as we know we have cadmium telluride, we have &#x2013; I mean we have thin film and others. So, it is a very thorough analysis and then probably betting yourself in different technology areas, and at the end of the day, we have to see how they will eventually compete on a cost basis on &#x2013; and on its roadmap to wholesale grid parity.</p>

          <p>We'll continue on that side with Olivier Esnou. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier Esnou, Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions. I'd like to have a feel for the flexibility you have in AIDT, can you give us an idea of the use of temporary worker you have right now, please? And secondly, on the Renewable business, Wind and Solar, it's difficult to see why the performance should improve next year from where I stand. Can you give us some comfort of &#x2013; I mean, basically what you're looking for, and what we should wait for, is it an improvement from here? I mean on an underlying basis, of course, if we exclude the write-down, should it get better or is it more likely to get worse next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the flexibility, I mean, of course, we've been looking into the so-called contract worker environment. But our experience of the last crisis, and we do not expect this type of crisis to happen again in that way as it was in 2009, by the way. If you really analyze that situation again, it was not so much about how many contract workers we had to let go. It was much more about how could we structure an environment where we have the existing workforce come down in cost all together and make sure that the workforce and the qualified people is available once it goes up again. That has been the decisive factor on why we have also been able to take advantage from the recovery and also take advantage from collective cost saving on labor.</p>
          <p>So, it's not so much the impact, it is important, but the impact is not very material as compared to the short-time model, which helped us to keep the force, but lower the cost on the level which was utilized and have it back that at any given point in time, when the demand has been coming back in a quite impressive manner. And this is something &#x2013; if it happened in a similar way, what industrial Germany would need again to reiterate, to push and to implement in order to make some flexible impact on the cost structure. Other than that, I think it is still true what I said earlier. I think when Ben asked me about the spread on flexibility, on those two businesses, we have actually been going into the opposite direction due to the fact that software grows relative to mechanics and the automation part also grows as relative to labor.</p>
          <p>Then on the Renewable, I mean, obviously, the Solar matter has been discussed now back and forth and over backwards, so let me focus on Wind. The Wind Energy is in the middle of becoming a global Industrial business, that's been moving from a handcraftsmanship with a few limited areas into a broadly accepted means of renewable sources. There's been a lot &#x2013; a lot of new market entrants. There have been a lot of incumbents which have been struggling along when capacities were shooting up and when prices were coming down and we see that continuing.</p>
          <p>And that's why I would not expect the material profit impact underlying on that business rather than seeing significant growth on the top line, which will help preserve and maybe gradually move the bottom line through scale impact. So, we've said that this 14% &#x2013; 13%, 14%, 15% margin matters in former years are going to be gone for a while and that we'd rather calculate with mid-single, maybe comfortable mid-single digit profit environments for a while. In the mid and long term, we expect that business also add to a significant components of service. So, that the model like we have been seeing it in the traditional environment with building power plants and then service them later and the combination makes good sense could also be evolving and developing in the Wind industry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, it's Colin Campbell at SocGen. Just given that you've highlighted your very under-leveraged balance sheet and sort of require to be maybe more shareholder friendly given the D rating, when might you consider special dividends or share buybacks in this climate, please?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, thanks I guess for reiterating the question. Again, it has been there before. I take that as a feedback that it has been answered insufficiently answered, and I guess I take that one for the time being. There's nothing to add. We said that there is a massive uncertainty. We acknowledge that we are behind on our commitment. It's absolutely clear, don't need to debate that, absolutely clear.</p>
          <p>But we also said this is not going to be something which we do every year in the last quarter to see that we are in the range. Secondly, we believe we are in a dismantled financial, political environment which is hard to predict in the next 6 to 12 months, and thirdly, we are going to make sure that there is enough flexibility at any given point in time if the margin compression and the multiple compression of the capital goods industry continues to evolve.</p>
          <p>I guess that's all I guess we feel comfortable saying at this time. But then I also said that should not be missed. We also said that we have our shareholders in mind. It's not that we wasting their money just because we don't dare to discuss that at all.</p>
