          <p>Good morning. This is the conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group First Quarter 2012 results conference call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is recorded. You will have the opportunity to ask questions directly after the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Dougan, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead, Mr. Dougan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining the first quarter results call. I'm joined by our CFO, David Mathers. I'm going to make a short introduction and then David's going to take you through the detailed results, and then we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>We did have a good start to 2012. We posted solid operating results and made good progress towards establishing a business model, which is sustainable in the new environment. The steps we took during the second half of last year to transition Credit Suisse to the new market and regulatory environment have already begun to deliver positive results. On a normalized basis, we made CHF1.4 billion of net income and a return on equity of 16% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We exceeded our annualized cost reduction target. We exceeded our end of first quarter risk reduction target. We transformed our Investment Bank. Compared to last year's first quarter we cut costs, cut capital usage and significantly increased the return on capital. We're making good progress on measures to improve profitability in our Private Bank. And in all of our businesses, we continue to have strong client momentum with increasing market shares. We acted early and proactively to improve profitability and capital efficiency across the group. And we're now recognizing the early benefits of these strategic measures.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm just going to spend a few minutes providing some detail on the measures I just outlined.</p>
          <p>First, we did reduce our annualized cost run-rate by CHF1.5 billion, compared to the annualized run-rate during the first half of 2011, exceeding our previously announced cost reduction target of CHF1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Second, we further reduced Basel 3 risk-weighted assets to CHF294 billion during the first quarter. This represents a reduction of over CHF100 billion or one-third of our risk-weighted assets over the past year. We're now close to our previously announced end of 2012 risk-weighted asset target of CHF280 billion.</p>
          <p>Third, our Investment Bank made significant progress in executing the strategy we outlined in November to increase capital efficiency and reduce costs, while at the same time maintaining market share momentum. The Investment Bank has substantially changed since last year with a more balanced risk and revenue mix and higher returns on capital. Our normalized after-tax return on Basel 3 allocated capital improved to 19%, up from a 15% return in a better market environment in last year's first quarter. This was achieved through a reduction in capital allocated at the business, as well as a reduction in the cost space.</p>
          <p>Most of our risk-weighted asset reductions occurred in the Investment Bank where we reduced risk-weighted assets by $102 billion or 33% compared to the first quarter last year. And we reduced our expense run rate in the Investment Bank by CHF1.3 billion from the first half of last year. We believe these measures will lead to more sustainable returns and lower revenue volatility going forward.</p>
          <p>Fourth, in Private Banking, we continue to make good progress on the strategic realignment we announced in November to optimize the business portfolio and enhance profitability. The merger of Clariden Leu into Credit Suisse took place on April 2, and the integration is progressing well.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we attracted net new assets of CHF8.4 billion. We saw higher transaction-based revenues compared to the previous quarter and reduced operating expenses, reflecting the efficiency measures we've taken. We remain confident that we will substantially improve profitability in the Private Bank.</p>
          <p>And finally, in our Asset Management position, we recorded higher net revenues compared with the previous quarter, including a gain from the partial sale of our stake in Aberdeen Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Overall, profitability was good, although we saw significant asset outflows resulting primarily from a single low-margin mandate. In line with our Asset Management strategy, we continue to focus on achieving growth in fee-based revenues and on investing in multi-asset class solutions, alternative investments and our Swiss platform.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we also further strengthened key financial ratios and continued to maintain a strong capital and funding position. We took further steps to align our capital structure to the Swiss and proposed Basel 3 regulations. In March we issued CHF750 million of Tier 2 buffer capital notes, completing our high Swiss, high-trigger contingent capital requirement.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter we repurchased CHF4.7 billion of capital instruments, which under the proposed Basel 3 framework will no longer qualify for regulatory capital treatment. Both measures contributed further strength to our regulatory capital. As a result to the actions we've taken, our core Tier 1 capital ratio improved to 11.8%, up from 10.7% in the fourth quarter under Basel 2.5.</p>
          <p>On a Basel 3 basis, we expect our year-end 2012 CET1 ratio to be at 13%, well in excess of the 6% FINMA requirement and on look-through basis, we expect our CET1 ratio to be 7% by the end of 2012 and then increase to 10% by the end of 2013. The balance sheet remained highly liquid and Credit Suisse continues to have an industry-leading Basel 3 net stable funding ratio that is well ahead of requirements. We further improved our ratio to 100% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>All told, our first quarter performance, underscores the strength of our client focused, capital efficient franchise and it indicates what our business model is capable of and the steps we have taken to adapt our business model are already demonstrating their potential to deliver improved profitability and sustainable returns in the new environment. Despite continued challenging global macroeconomic conditions, our businesses delivered a solid performance.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now let David walk us through the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady and good morning. I'll start my presentation on slide six, with an overview of the financial results. In the first quarter, we achieved underlying revenues of CHF7.3 billion, pre-tax income of CHF1.5 billion and net income of CHF1.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share were CHF0.79, a pre-tax income margin of 20% and a post-tax return on equity was 12%.</p>
          <p>This quarter, in order to present a better like-for-like comparison of our year-on-year performance, we have normalized our first quarter 2012 results, adjusting for the PAF2 award. And we show these numbers alongside the underlying results in the gray box you see on the slide, and I'll explain these changes in more detail on slide seven in a minute.</p>
          <p>On a normalized basis, pre-tax income was CHF1.9 billion, net income CHF1.4 billion, and the post-tax return on equity 16%. Finally, at the bottom of the slide, as is our usual practice, we've included our reported results.</p>
          <p>So let's turn now to slide seven, where we highlight the significant items that affect our reported numbers.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on pre-tax income, which is highlighted on the blue column on the left-hand side of the slide. Now we start at the top, we reported pre-tax income of CHF40 million. This includes CHF1.6 billion of fair value and net losses and CHF68 million of severance costs, both of which are booked in the Corporate Center and CHF178 million gain on the partial sale of that stake in Aberdeen, which it shown to be in Asset management's results. These items were excluded from our underlying pre-tax income of CHF1.484 billion. You may recall that part of 2011's variable compensation was awarded as PAF2, which was fully invested in the first quarter of 2012, which means that the entire P&amp;L charge in relation to that compensation award was recognized in our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>However, it, as is normally the case and was the case last year, we had made this award in shares rather than in PAF, then investing would take place over the usual three years, resulting in a corresponding amortization of the P&amp;L expense. The normalized first quarter 2012 results adjust for the difference between the full CHF534 million PAF2 charge and CHF100 million of amortization, which is the charge we would have taken had we awarded shares instead of PAF2 for this component of our compensation.</p>
          <p>For completeness, we've also included the tax and the non-controlling interest impact <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:15) these adjustments to reconcile to the equivalent net income and return on equity calculations.</p>
          <p>Slide eight. With the change in our divisional reporting from this quarter onwards, such that all funding-related DVA gains and losses are reported in the Corporate Center. Previously, the DVA adjustments on our own <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:40) liabilities were reported in the Investment Banking division. Also, you may recall that a small portion of DVA on our long-term  vanilla debt was being amortized to all three divisions, but mainly to the Investment Bank. We think this new approach is more meaningful, given that these revenue impacts are driven by the funding and perceived credit worthiness of the entire Group and not individual divisions. We have reconciled the previously reported division revenues to this new approach for 2010 and for the full quarters of 2011 on slide 37 in the appendix to these slides.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to give you a heads up, following the full integration of Clariden Leu, which happened on April the 2. This business will report its results across all three divisions, with effect from the second quarter onwards, and we will also restate the comparative results for this stage.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the expenses on slide nine. With the annualized expense reductions of CHF1.5 billion going into 2012, exceeding the target we set of CHF1.2 billion by 25%. This was partly driven by a CHF2.1 billion of lower unamortized deferred compensation coming into 2012 compared to last year. Our actual head count is down by 2,000 from the second quarter of 2011, in line with our targeted reduction. Not quite CHF0.3 billion of the reduction was in non-compensation expense and that's not withstanding increased regulatory costs included in the U.K. bank levy.</p>
          <p>We're also making good progress towards our end 2013 target of CHF2 billion in total cost savings. And measures for this include the streamlining of our operations and our support infrastructure, a focused vendor management initiative, as well as the benefits from the integration of Clariden Leu, which we'll discuss in more detail later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Slide 10. You may recall that last year, we set an expense reduction target for our expenses in this quarter to be CHF1.2 billion lower than the annualized expense base in the first half of 2011. If you look at the left-hand side of the slide, we have adjusted the first quarter of 2012 reported costs of CHF5.804 billion to exclude PAF2 net to amortization as per the previous description, realignment costs as well as neutralizing for FX moves.</p>
          <p>If you follow the annual arrow across the right-hand side of the chart, an annualized corporate adjusted expense figure, this shows that coming in 2012, our expense run-rate was just over  CHF21 billion, compared to annualized first half 2011 costs, excluding restructuring, of just over CHF22.5 billion, resulted in annualized savings of CHF1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>But perhaps more simply, if you just compare the first quarter 2012 total reported expenses, to reported expenses in first quarter of last year, the total cost reduction was 6% or CHF391 million. So, on a more direct comparison on annualized basis, this cost reduction also shows a CHF1.6 billion cut in our expenses.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows a substantial reduction in our overall Basel 3 risk-weighted assets since the third quarter of last year, resulting from a strategic realignment of the Investment Bank. Risk-weighted assets are now at CHF294 billion, that's further CHF45 billion or 13% lower within the fourth quarter of 2011, exceeding the 1Q 2012 goal of CHF312 billion. We are making strong progress in achieving our end-state, risk-weighted asset target of CHF280 billion by the end of year.</p>
          <p>Slide 12. Private Banking's quarterly pre-tax income was CHF625 million, with increased revenues reflecting a moderate increase in transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>Applying the same approach to cost savings as we showed before, the expense run rate is down CHF230 million from the first half of 2011. And I point out that these results don't yet fully reflect savings from the different head count reduction measures. We continue to achieve good net new asset inflows in the first quarter of 2012. The headline number of CHF8.4 billion includes some attrition resulting from the integration of Clariden Leu.</p>
          <p>If we look at Wealth Management revenues in more detail on slide 13 and starting with net interest income, the lower segment in the column from the slide. Net interest income was, again, stable this quarter at CHF868 million, but with a year-on-year decline that reflects continued low interest rates.</p>
          <p>Recurring fees and commissions decreased slightly from the fourth quarter, despite a 4% growth in average assets under management. This AUM growth was primarily from ultra high net worth clients, who do tend to be more transactional-based. In addition, we did see clients move towards a more conservative risk profile within their asset allocation, resulting in lower investment product and discretionary mandate fees. As a result, the gross recurring margin fell from 43 to 40 basis points. Although I'd point out, as we said before, the overall pre-tax margin from the ultra high net worth is significantly higher than that from Wealth Management overall.</p>
          <p>Transaction-based revenues recovered somewhat from the fourth quarter to CHF518 million, resulting from higher brokerage and product issuance fees, and a higher contribution for ultra high net worth clients. This reduction does reflect continued low client activity, compared to the first quarter of 2011, albeit above the fourth quarter levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 14. Private Banking achieved net new asset inflows of CHF8.4 billion in the first quarter. Wealth Management continued to achieve solid contributions from ultra high net worth clients and most emerging markets. Turn to net new assets were CHF5.8 billion. Solid inflows in Switzerland were offset by asset attrition resulting from a Clariden Leu integration of CHF4.1 billion or 4% of the Clariden Leu AUMs.</p>
          <p>In EMEA, net outflows of CHF0.9 billion continued to reflect modest outflows in Western Europe, but we've also seen limited inflows in Eastern European markets so far in 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 15. The initiatives that we announced last November, rebalancing the Private Bank towards growth areas and enhancing profitability, are on track. Already, our ultra high net worth initiative is showing strong momentum, as we shift resources towards emerging markets. We've hired 13 new ultra high net worth dedicated relationship managers this quarter as part of our operating initiative, and we also strengthened the leadership team.</p>
          <p>More than two-thirds of Wealth Management's net new asset inflows are now currently coming from ultra high net worth clients.</p>
          <p>Second, we're creating a much more cost-efficient infrastructure in our onshore business. We will adopt a much more focused structure in Italy, based around eight hubs and resulting in the closure of 16 branches. We'll also improve the efficiency in Western Europe more generally with the first market start implementation from the middle of this year.</p>
          <p>The integration of the Japanese business that we acquired is also on track. This would double our AUMs to around CHF5 billion in helping us to achieve the next scale in this region and positioning us as one of the largest foreign-owned private banks.</p>
          <p>So, we're restructuring our cross-border business through segmentation to better serve our international affluent clients. In July, we'll implement a much more focused service model and product offering.</p>
          <p>Finally, the integration of Clariden Leu is well on track to deliver the financial and operational benefits that we've planned. The legal merger was completed on the 2 of April. The large majority of the key relationship managers have been retained, and we've already sold the insurance-linked securities business.</p>
          <p>The expected net synergies from this integration will deliver a steady pre-tax profit improvement of CHF110 million per annum. And just to put that in context, that would lead to a total contribution from Clariden Leu that almost doubles their pre-merger, pre-tax income contribution for 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to Corporate &amp; Institutional Clients on slide 16. Pre-tax income was CHF219 million in the first quarter, with a continued strong pre-tax margin of 47%. Net new asset inflows were particularly strong again this quarter. Credit provisions decreased quarter-on-quarter with the loan quality remaining high.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 17. The Investment Bank recorded a pre-tax income of CHF993 million and net revenues of CHF4.1 billion. During the quarter, we made significant progress in executing our strategy to increase capital efficiency and operating leverage. Our results reflect a much more diversified and balanced risk and revenue contribution across our major businesses, and we have maintained market share momentum.</p>
          <p>We've reduced Basel 3 RWAs by $38 billion in the quarter and thereby more than $100 billion from the level of the year ago. The 1Q 2012 annualized expense reduction was CHF1.3 billion lower, compared to the run rate in the first half of last year. And as a result, we delivered a 19% normalized after-tax return on Basel 3 allocated capital in the quarter, up from 15% in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the numbers in more detail on slide 18. Fixed income revenues were significantly higher than in the fourth quarter of 2011, driven by the momentum in our client franchise, execution of our strategy and higher client trading volumes. Our Rates and FX businesses continue to perform well, reflecting higher client activity. Emerging markets also benefited from improved client flow and a better operating environment.</p>
          <p>Credit recovered from the weak fourth quarter performance, driven by higher new issue activity and renewed risk appetite. If we look at the overall decline in fixed income revenues year-on-year, this is primarily attributable to, first, lower revenues from securitized products compared to the record result we had in the first quarter of 2011, which benefited from significantly higher levels of inventory and consequently RWA usage, and second, revenue losses of CHF261 million from the businesses that were in the process of exiting and compared to a positive contribution from these businesses of 10 million in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, you can see how, by further reallocating capital and resources to support our clients, we've improved the quality of our fixed income performance, compared to the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the left-hand chart, although revenues in dollar terms fell by 19% year-on-year, this revenue contribution is more diversified across the major product areas. On the right-hand chart, you can see that the fixed income revenue performance was achieved while operating with 45% lower Basel 3 RWAs. So if we look at this in terms of capital efficiency, defined as revenue per average Basel 3 RWA, this improved by 33% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 20. Equity trading revenues were solid year-on-year and recovered from a weak fourth quarter in 2011. Prime Services performance was solid with increased client balances, underscoring our established top 3 global rating. Derivative revenues were down slightly on the first quarter of last year, but improved significantly compared to the fourth quarter, due to improved market conditions and higher volumes. Cash Equities market share remained stable, despite continued weak market volumes.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 21. Underwriting and advisory results increased from a weak fourth quarter level, driven by strong results in debt underwriting and by market share momentum. The strong debt underwriting revenues you see here, reflect an increased in new issue activity, in high yield and investment grade issuance, as well as an improved market share level compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Improved advisory results also benefited from higher market share compared to the fourth quarter, while equity underwriting results remained subdued due to weak market volumes.</p>
          <p>Slide 22. This updates our progress in reducing Basel 3 risk-weighted assets in the Investment Bank. B3 RWAs fell by $38 billion or 15% in the quarter at a minimal cost. As we progress towards the $190 billion, we would expect to see some further RWA reduction costs in the balance of the year, although clearly the amount of that cost will remain dependent on the market conditions in the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 23. In our fourth quarter 2011 results presentation, we showed a detailed breakdown of the progress in reducing our fixed income risk-weighted assets, and slide 23 shows this quarter's progress on the same basis. You can see that in the first quarter of this year, we mitigated $34 billion of the remaining $55 billion targets. We reduced RWAs for the ongoing business by $10 billion in the quarter, but we also made very good progress in the wind-down business with $24 billion part of RWA reduction in these areas. And we have firm plans in place to achieve the remaining reductions necessary to meet our $125 billion target for the fixed income division.</p>
          <p>Slide 24. So in summary, we've made substantial progress executing the strategy we outlined last November. And we have achieved a more balanced and diversified business mix. We still have market share momentum. We've exceeded our first quarter 2012 Basel 3 risk reduction targets and we've also exceeded our goal for operating efficiency by rationalizing our expense base.</p>
          <p>The chart here shows the incremental year-on-year impact on the normalized return from Investment Banking's revenue decline, cost improvement, and RWA reduction. On balance, the impact of the lower costs and the reduced RWA usage offset the effect of lower revenues with the result of the after-tax return improved from 15% in the first quarter of last year to 19% in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So, let's now turn to Asset Management on slide 25. Pre-tax income was CHF250 million in the first quarter, which benefited from the partial sale of our stake in Aberdeen Asset Management. Fee-based revenues declined quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower placement of performance fees, which are seasonally biased towards the second and the fourth quarters. Investment gains of CHF101 million were also lower compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to lower private equity returns.</p>
          <p>So, let's turn now to net new asset performance on slide 26. In the first quarter of 2012, Asset Management experienced inflows at CHF3.7 billion in its targeted growth areas, primarily client margin alternative investments. This was offset by outflows from low margin mandates. A CHF2.7 billion outflow from our pension fund advisory business, where you may recall there was an outflow in the fourth quarter of last year, and a CHF14.7 billion outflow from a single client mandate, where the client has decided to move the mandates, which are predominantly our fixed income portfolio, in-house.</p>
          <p>Just to put these relative moves in context, it's worth noted that the anticipated annual management fees from the CHF3.7 billion of higher margin inflows this quarter will exceed the fees that we will lose on these other two low margin outflows.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to capital liquidity on slide 27. We continue to maintain a strong position with our Basel 2.5 core Tier I ratio, increasing from 10.7% to 11.8% in the first quarter. The bottom graph shows the major factors contributing to this increase in core Tier 1 capital in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Clearly, underlying net income represents the bulk of the B2.5 capital generation, but the debt repurchase also benefited capital by about CHF500 million. This was offset by FX and a pro rata dividend accrual of CHF0.75 per share in respect to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 28. Slide 28 shows the usual update of how the Basel 3 CET1 ratio could develop, based on our capital progression expectations through to the end of 2013. On the left-hand chart, the first column shows our current shareholders' equity. We have adjusted for regulatory deductions and analysts' expectations for future retained earnings. I'd remind you this does not therefore represent forward-looking statements being made by Credit Suisse management.</p>
          <p>And we assume a benefit of CHF1.9 billion from shares issued out of conditional capital for share-based compensation awards, as well as other movements in capital and deductions. So by the end of 2012, our CET1 capital grows to CHF36.5 billion to give a Basel 3 CET1 ratio of 13.1%, based on the transitional definition in the proposed FINMA capital ordinances, which is in excess of the 6% requirement they've set for the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, in addition to our CET1 position, we've also issued and forward exchanged loss-absorbing contingent capital, which is worth another 2.9% to this ratio. And that clearly includes the CHF750 million of Swiss franc-denominated BCNs that we issued in the first quarter of this year, which completed our high strike requirement.</p>
          <p>We've also included in the appendix the CET1 look-through ratio calculation. On this basis, which is shown on slide 42, we show ratios of 7% and 10% at the end of 2012 and the end of 2013, respectively.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide 29. Our funding and liquidity positions remained strong at the end of the first quarter, with our Basel 3 net stable funding ratio at 100%. Our Swiss regulatory leverage ratio at 4.7% on the B2.5, which is towards the top of the required range. Whilst that funding in CDS spreads remain amongst the lowers compared to our peers, narrowing substantially in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to have a highly unencumbered balance sheet, we've limited use of covered bonds. Only about 15% of our Swiss mortgage book is so utilized. So, we remain very well prepared for the Basel 3 liquidity and funding requirements. So, on that note, I'd like to conclude my presentation and pass back to Brady.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three questions. The first was on fixed income sales and trading revenues. The improved disclosure on way you've generated the revenues from is very helpful, and I think it makes it clear that you didn't have the inventory gains in securitization that distorted the Q1 2011 figures. I just wondered if you wanted to take the opportunity to make any comment about other lumpy items in Q1, like basis risk reversals or Maiden Lane or whether you think that Q1 and fixed income was a pretty clean client flow-driven result?</p>
          <p>The second question was on the Private Banking margin of 109 basis points. Obviously, the shift to ultra high net worth might have cost you a basis point, like charging might have cost you a basis point, but even at 111, it was still a relatively weak number. Have you changed your view over the last couple of quarters on how much of the lower margins you've been experiencing recently is cyclical and how much is structural?</p>
          <p>And then the third question I had, a little bit more technical, on the 2% of shares you'll be placing in June to buy out the minority stake in Hedging-Griffo. Obviously, on the face of that, that's 2% EPS diluted, but I was wondering if the reduced minority payments that you'll be having would roughly offset that and that should be, overall, in your view about EPS neutral? And I'm also wondering if reversing the liability accrued for the put option of about CHF0.6 billion, would mean that your common equity Tier 1 would go up by CHF0.6 billion? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Matt. Maybe I can try to deal with the first two parts of that question, and David could maybe address the third. I think on the fixed income numbers in the first quarter &#x2013; I think actually we're happy with them that they're actually quite a clean result. I think as you can see, and as we mentioned, we think the balance is actually quite good.</p>
          <p>We had a much better performance out of Rates and FX. That's an area that we've invested a lot in, and we're actually seeing &#x2013; obviously, you saw in the first quarter a good result there. Structured products is down as you say, and that's partly a result of just the restructuring of the business through the Basel 3 changes, et cetera. I mean just a much better balance. Emerging markets is a better contributor.</p>
          <p>So overall, it's actually a pretty clean result. No real lumpy items. You mentioned basis unwind, nothing really there. And the Maiden Lane transactions were obviously good transactions. We think they're actually a very good example of the kind of new model for us, which is we basically won the first and third tranches there and executed them quite well, but it was done on a very capital efficient way with a lot of customer participation and relatively low risk. But they were not a particularly material item in the overall results in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So yeah, I would say generally, we are pleased with the result, and that it's a fairly clean result and consistent with our model overall. And I think as you can see from the numbers, I mean we think it's particularly notable that we actually generated those revenues on a significant reduction in RWA and risk in the business in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And also, obviously related, but not necessarily quite the same thing, quite substantial reductions in inventory as well, so in structured products and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:25), we were down about 30% in inventories and actually in investment grade, more like 60%.</p>
          <p>So that obviously also leads us to believe that these results should be more sustainable over time. So, good clean results we think, and overall, I think a nice indication of what the model should be able to do.</p>
          <p>On the Private Banking question, as you say I mean obviously 109 basis points of gross margin that was stable to last quarter, still, we think still at the lower end of sort of the cycle. Obviously we've given up on predicting when we might get some increase in interest rates or increased in sort of transactional volume that would obviously benefit that overall gross margin.</p>
          <p>But we think it's probably that it can be maintained even in the current environment. So, that's sort of our working assumption is that we need to make the business work in the current environment. Eventually maybe we'll get some tailwinds, but we don't know when. And so I think our belief is that we should be able to sustain that kind of a number, and obviously when we get to more normalized environments we will see higher gross margin numbers. So, that's our hope.</p>
          <p>We're also obviously working hard as well on our &#x2013; on the controllable factors to try to increase gross margin as well in terms of trying to get, trying to improve our selling to some of the more managed products and some of the higher margin aspects of it. But again, in the current environment that's not an easy thing to do, given the sort of conservative, the continuing sort of conservative outlook of a lot of our clients on the Private Banking side.</p>
          <p>So, I guess the short answer to your question is we do still think this should be a cyclical low and we should see gross margins go higher. When that'll happen, depends on, I think, somewhat on the environment, both in terms of just pure tailwinds, but also in terms of when we see benefits from some of the initiatives that we have on that side.</p>
          <p>In the meantime as you know, we are making, I think, good progress on improving the pre-tax margin side of things, the net margin side of things, by reducing costs and making things more efficient overall.</p>
          <p>You guys, can you address the Hedging-Griffo question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Just on the third point. I think we'll have to revert to you Matt, just in terms of the profitability of Hedging-Griffo last year and the first quarter this year, and therefore the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:54) contribution because it's actually &#x2013; could be spread predominantly between Asset Management and Private Banking, as opposed to being in a single division.</p>
          <p>But clearly, that will offset, at least in part, the dilution resulting from the 2% increase in the number of shares to actually fund the buy-out. I mean I think it's fair to say that the Hedging-Griffo acquisition has been in &#x2013; a considerable success for Credit Suisse and has really built upon an attitude, in what is already a very strong resilient business for us.</p>
          <p>And results have generally exceeded our expectations, but we'll come back to you in terms of the detailed contribution and how that relates to the 2% dilution.</p>
          <p>I think your other question, query was on the capital impact. We've accrued CHF0.6 billion in respect of the buy-out, which was based on the terms of the acquisition when we did it five years ago. Clearly, with a share issuance, that will then convert to equity at that point and become &#x2013; and it will add to our capital position.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Matt. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Derek De Vries of Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a few questions if I might. First in the Investment Bank on the cost side, I mean, a good revenue figure and a good cost figure as well. If I sort of take your guidance for adding CHF100 million and stripping out PAF2, that gets me to like a 40% comp to income ratio.</p>
          <p>And I'm wondering if we have the normal seasonal slowdown in revenues, if that 40% is kind of the sustainable level, or do we need to maintain revenues at this level to kind of have a 40% comp to income. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Then on the &#x2013; just sort of in light to what you said to Matt on the fixed side, in light of your comments on sort of reducing your capital associated, I was wondering if you wanted to update the guidance you gave in Q2, where you were talking about $1.5 billion to $2 billion, I believe, of flow revenues. And if you think that's still a sustainable run rate.</p>
          <p>And then on the Private Banking side, you saw EMEA outflows, which, if I'm not mistaken, is the first time we've seen that since you've restated the division. And you talk about the difficult situation in the EMEA region, which is obvious, but also existed in the second half of last year when we actually saw decent inflows. So I was wondering if you could sort of give us some color, if there's anything else going on there, if this relates to Germany or what?</p>
          <p>And then a final fourth question if I might. On your annual report, you sort of quantified litigation risk as up to CHF2.3 billion, over and above what you've accrued for from a provisioning perspective. I was wondering if you could give us just a broad breakdown of how much of that's Investment Bank and how much of that's in the Private Banking side of the business?</p>
          <p>And then on the Investment Banking side, if you could give us a little bit of an update on the RMBS repurchase demands and the $2 billion that you transferred to litigation. It's a lot of questions. Appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks, Derek. Yeah. I think on the IB cost question, which is, I guess, primarily rated sort of the comp to revenue calculation, which I think your numbers &#x2013; I think our number's a little bit higher than 40%, but basically similar kinds of numbers for...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, just to be fair, they're actually included in the appendix on page 41.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you may have added back all of PAF2. But just to recollect, the PAF2 was an instrument that was actually applied across the Private Bank and Asset Management. So, of the CHF534.1 million, which is the total number and the CHF100 million offset, CHF418 million would be in respect to the Investment Bank and the share ad back then it would be CHF74 million. So, that would give you a comp-to-revenue ratio of 41.5% just to complete the math. Sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, and I guess the answer to your question though, yeah. I mean I think &#x2013; as you, I think you put it accurately, which is, if we saw our revenues every quarter at these kinds of levels, then we think that the comp-to-revenue ratio would probably &#x2013; could be similar to this. Obviously, as you say, if we see revenues that are lower than that over the next quarters, then probably the comp-to-revenue would be a bit higher. And if we saw revenues that were even higher than what we've seen, obviously you could see that even potentially come down a little bit from there. So, it's a typical kind of relationship. So, I assume that's the answer you would've expected. So, yeah, I mean this would be sustainable if the performance was sustained at these levels.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance on fixed income, as you say &#x2013; as you said, that was, I guess that was almost a year ago. But you can see from the performance in the first quarter about $2 billion of revenues. I mean, we're obviously still &#x2013; we are still evolving some of the businesses. We're still completing the exit of some the businesses and there is some impact on that as well. But I think that kind of a number across the cycle is probably a reasonable number to assume for a sort of sustainable new model business in fixed income for us. I mean, obviously the first quarter was a bit better than that. So, maybe we'll see numbers that are little more towards the high end, but we still think that's probably a reasonable expectation over the cycle.</p>
          <p>On the EMEA outflows, as you say in general, we have seen inflows across all of our regions, including EMEA, for most of the time period. A lot of that, I think, as we've highlighted for you before was actually a lot of more of the ultra high net worth inflows sometimes offsetting some of the high net worth and below outflows in the business, particularly in offshore Europe, Western Europe, as we've talked about before.</p>
          <p>I would say actually that this quarter, I would say, was relatively unchanged in terms of the outflow characteristics of the business, in terms of the offshore Western European business. But we did not have the same level of inflows from the ultra-high and particularly from the emerging Europe that we'd seen in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>And I'd say &#x2013; I don't think we see anything particularly systematic about that. Those are obviously some of the larger flows and they're a little more lumpy. We did see a &#x2013; we did see some deleveraging in the first quarter in some of those areas, which contributed to that. But overall, I'd say that's the factual description. I don't think that we necessarily see that as a trend that's going to sustain, but that is what we saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; you mentioned the litigation footnote, which is the zero to CHF2.3 billion, I'm not sure that is accurately characterized as on top of what we've already accrued. I think that's &#x2013; I thought that was actually at the &#x2013; that is on top? Okay. So that is on top. I don't think we do a breakdown actually between the different divisions, so I'm not sure that we're going to get to that level of detail at this point.</p>
          <p>And then your last question was &#x2013; Derek, was on the RMBS repurchase. What was that again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is related to RMBS repurchase claims, and I think you transferred out $2 billion into litigation as &#x2013; in your terminology. And I was just wondering if there's any update on that, as you had some progress in terms of sort of settling these things. And then, also what were the new claims in Q1? I mean, they obviously accelerated in 2011, have you seen a bit of a slowdown in 2012 or is it continuing at 2011 pace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Derek, on the &#x2013; overall, I would say again, our general view on the mortgage matters is that we believe that we took a fairly responsible approach to the business. As you know, we actually cut back our originations in 2006. We think we actually had a very high quality process around that. So, we feel like we're actually in pretty good shape on those. But obviously, as you say, there certainly are a lot &#x2013; obviously generally for the industry, and we have some portion of that as well, there clearly are these litigations claims out there.</p>
          <p>I would say, in general, I don't think there were any particular notable developments in the first quarter, so I don't think there's actually anything really to comment on. We still feel, as I've said, that we &#x2013; we obviously look at the originations, the underwritings that we've done. We obviously try to resolve issues where we see things that we think should be resolved, and we're obviously going to continue to do that. But I don't think there's any particular update in the first quarter on that issue.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Derek. Next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Few questions. First of all, if I look at the risk-weighted asset reduction, RWA, that's been done really well year-on-year, if I look at the position risk in the larger release that you have today, it seems to be up year-on-year. Just wanted to understand why position risk would be up with RWA and risk-weighted assets down.</p>
          <p>The second question is if you could talk a little bit about April. We clearly know that there's a seasonal slowdown in April. But you're more credit geared in fixed income. Just trying to understand whether material movement that we have in spreads, if there has been any material impact besides seasonality, and maybe because you're more credit geared than some of your peers in that context on a relative basis.</p>
          <p>And the third question is what's next for CS? I mean you've delivered more or less on the restructuring. I would assume that going forward one has to question, how is it possible to do this restructuring so quickly, without really losing any revenues or material revenue parts? And what I'm trying to understand is what other opportunities are there to further shrink or improve efficiencies around the Group?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...risk-weighted assets versus the risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, firstly, Kian, I mean, obviously the two are not always that correlated. And particularly &#x2013; obviously most of our efforts are really focused on Basel 3 risk-weighted assets, not even Basel 2.5 at that point. So, you always have to take that into consideration. I mean the position risk overall is actually slightly down. I think it was down on page 48 from CHF14.395 billion to CHF13.833 billion. So, perhaps I was missing the point of the question. But say, what was the detailed question, Kian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I looked at it on a year-on-year basis and it's actually up &#x2013; on fixed income I mean, sorry. I should've been more specific, fixed income and trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yeah, yeah. Fixed income is actually down, fourth quarter and up on the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that when I looked at this, the fourth quarter, I think there was some specific position moves in the fourth quarter, which actually related to some of the <mark type="ph" /> NGA (49:40) currency risk, which may be going up for the fourth quarter, and has since dropped down from that. But I think in reality, Basel 3 calculations, particularly as they're around issues such as long-dated unstructured exposure, they're not very correlated to the position risk as we see it in ELC. Now that probably does say that our position risk measures, we would say probably the Basel 3 calibration is more aggressive by several orders than our position risk calculations would be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't think there's anything out of normal in that. And the &#x2013; you look at the RWA numbers you see it's really coming down by half, it's actually coming from a fifth wind down, as opposed to the ongoing trading positions, which will also contribute to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Kian, on your question on April &#x2013; I guess you're just sort of looking for more flavor. I mean as you say it's not a surprise to people that conditions have been less favorable so far, it's obviously just a few weeks. But I wouldn't say that we see anything particularly characteristic. I guess, you're trying to get at sort of what &#x2013; in terms of the different business lines and how they're being differentially impacted.</p>
          <p>To be honest, it's kind of &#x2013; obviously, customer flow has just been down, but it's been kind of down across the businesses. So I would say, I don't think we see anything particularly characteristic, as you say, where one particular area has continued to do extremely well but others are suffering. It's actually just been a &#x2013; I think it's just been a bit slower across the piece. So nothing &#x2013; there may not be a satisfying answer for you but that's &#x2013; we don't really see anything particularly characteristic in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the fact that you're more credit geared rather than macro geared, and clearly one could argue credit might be a bit tougher. We shouldn't read much into your mix relative to your peers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; as I say, we haven't really seen different &#x2013; we haven't seen much differential between the different areas. So you talk about as you say Rates and FX versus credit versus structured products. I mean, it's kind of interesting. I guess, I think slightly if anything &#x2013; yeah, but he's talking about April &#x2013; so, I mean if anything, I'd say slightly we're probably &#x2013; we think we're probably seeing slightly better conditions in securitized products and credit than in the macro area. So &#x2013; but that may be a little...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>...a bit different from what you were saying. But frankly, it's not that big a &#x2013; it's not that marked a difference to be honest.</p>
          <p>I think your last question, what's next for us? I guess, I think what's next for us is continuing to deliver on this strategy and consistency in performance. I mean, I think the first quarter shows what the business model is capable of doing. And frankly, I think what's next for us is ideally continuing to deliver this for a number of quarters. I mean, that's I think the most critical thing.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, one could argue, and I'm sure in the Board you discuss this, you have restructured more or less over two quarters. One could argue maybe there is &#x2013; there's more possibilities to be done, I mean, just to put a cheeky question out there, you make CHF4.5 billion revenues clean roughly in the IB with 20,700 people, and some players this quarter reported roughly that just in fixed income, CHF4.5 billion to CHF5 billion of fixed income with similar amount of people. Why can't you operate with 18,000 people making less revenues?</p>

          <p>Well, I think our &#x2013; we're trying to get to the optimal &#x2013; we're trying to get the optimal setup to drive one of the highest returning businesses in the industry. And so we think a &#x2013; what was in the first quarter, a Basel 2.5 16% return on capital is a pretty good return, and obviously exceeds the targets that we'd set. And I think that obviously, we &#x2013; on &#x2013; for the rest of this year and into the Basel 3 next year, if we think that we can return those kinds of returns, that's going to be presumably a pretty good return on equity, probably among best-in-class, and that's also going to lead to book value accretion and all the other good things that come from that.</p>
          <p>And that's what we've tried to get to. We obviously still have work to do in a number of business. We still have RWA reduction to do. We still think we can actually produce more efficiency. As you know, we originally set a target of CHF2 billion of reduction in costs, and we're still working on achieving that. I think our hope is that we not only achieve that, but exceed that as we did CHF1.2 billion, so we're going to continue to work towards that. So there's clearly more efficiency to be gotten there.</p>
          <p>And I think we still are. We think there still is a lot of optimization that we can get out of our businesses. And again, first quarter wasn't &#x2013; I mean, from our point of view wasn't even a particularly favorable &#x2013; I mean, it was a decent environment, but particularly in things like equities and the Investment Banking business, in Private Banking, we still have a lot of headwinds with the low-interest rate environment, et cetera. So, we think actually the potential for the business model is still quite good. But we still have a lot of work to do as well.</p>
          <p>So again, our focus is on creating &#x2013; basically driving a consistent 15% plus return on equity under a Basel 2.5 and Basel 3 environment, which we think is going to be a &#x2013; if we can do that, that's going to be a pretty good result.</p>

          <p>Kian, let me just come back on the first point, by the way. Just in detail, if you read 49, there's reference there to a reduction of the RMBS and real estate in the first quarter, compared to the first quarter a year ago. But it's been slightly offset by increase in FX and Rates exposure.</p>
          <p>And actually if you look at the detail of Basel 3 RWA slide, you'll see that our Basel 3 RWA, the ongoing Rates business was actually higher at the end of the first quarter than the end of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And that's what you're seeing coming through on the <mark type="ph" /> ELC (55:40) line. And I think that's fair. I mean, I think we've clearly set an end year target for our B3 RWA. Clearly our priority is to get that out of FIB wind-down. So I think we're pleased to see the bulk of it coming from FIB wind-down. But obviously, as we see client and market opportunities, if we have to expand our position slightly to accommodate that, then we will do so. And that clearly contributed to, obviously, the macro businesses being 42% of the fixed income revenues in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions. I think &#x2013; firstly, congratulations on your sort of acceleration of the deleveraging in the first quarter. I was just wondering as a management team, how focused are you that your quarter one at the end of the year will still be below the sort of 8% to 10% mark for a number of your global peers and is that something that is a focus for you, that your key to close that gap if possible?</p>
          <p>And then second, on page 23, I thought the disclosure about the wind-down was incredibly helpful. I also noticed that your macro RWAs are up. And I just wonder if that's just &#x2013; there's just some good opportunity in the quarter that you took advantage of, or is there a slightly broader re-think of where is the opportunity set for Credit Suisse going forward in fixed income and you're slightly evolving the plan? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Huw. I think, obviously, the &#x2013; our &#x2013; the core Tier 1 &#x2013; we obviously have a lot of focus on the capital side. I think the core Tier 1 improvement on a Basel 2.5 basis that we showed in the first quarter was encouraging. Obviously we're happy to see that kind of improvement. And we obviously also, I think we're going to take &#x2013; we're going to continue to take measures to make sure that we're increasing the capital across the board.</p>
          <p>I think the issue for us is that we do believe that we have a very capital-accretive model. And we're going to be as we've said even on a crash basis, the 7% at the end of this year and then 10% at the end of 2013 and very quickly obviously in excess of that, after that. And so, we'll obviously continue to manage the business in a way that continues to build capital, and we'll do that in every way that we can.</p>
          <p>But I think in general we are &#x2013; we're, in the longer run, we are very focused on &#x2013; we're focused on the fact that we're going to have a business that's very capital generative and is very quickly going to be in, we think, a surplus capital position.</p>
          <p>In addition as you know, we have 3% of contingent capital through our CoCo issuance behind this. And so I think that obviously just from a substantive point of view, puts us in a very good place. And one of the things &#x2013; I think there's obviously from an equity point of view there is rightly a lot of focus on the CET1 and the core Tier 1. But I think also &#x2013; I think there is an element of the total capital number that is relevant to senior debt holders, depositors, counter parties, et cetera. And as you know we have an extremely &#x2013; we probably have around 20% capital when you include all these different instruments, the hybrids that we have, the CoCos, et cetera, which is obviously a very significant level of capitalization, which is one of the reasons that our CDS trade as tightly as they do, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, I think you also have to &#x2013; it's a little bit of a &#x2013; it's &#x2013; I think you have to look at the different perspectives of the different stakeholders as well. And so from that point of view, we do think we're in a very strong position. And again, I think liquidity is also, when you look at the overall &#x2013; you look at the overall equation. Being at 100% NSFR means that we're in an extremely conservative position on the funding side as well.</p>
          <p>So again, I think when you look at all those together, we think we actually have a very strong position that we're going to build into this capital. And obviously, we'll &#x2013; in terms of the business, we'll continue to drive that. But we think we're actually in a good place.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the RWA in the macro side, it basically, as David answered, I mean, we did go up in that area. I don't think it's necessarily a strategic or a fundamental change in view about where &#x2013; what the distribution of our capital or activities are going to be in fixed income, but we did see good conditions. We saw a lot of client opportunities in the first quarter, and we took advantage of those by taking &#x2013; by obviously putting more capital in that direction and accommodating those flows. So, I think it's more &#x2013; I think it's less of a strategic, sort of rethink of where we're going to be putting our capital in the IB or in fixed income, and more just an indication of the flexibility that we'll have to be able to reallocate among the different areas as we see opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, as Brady says, I mean, our Rates positions were actually slightly bigger at the end of the quarter than at the start of the quarter, which just reflect, I think, the pattern of the client involvement we saw. If you look at the FX VaR disclosure, you see that was actually up from 12 to 26 at the end of the first quarter. Not only was the best guide. But it is a measure that we obviously did have slightly bigger inventory in the macro books at the end of the first quarter, which I think just reflect to the pattern of the client involvement we have.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, just a couple of quick follow up questions. The first one is on net new money in the Private Bank. I just wondered if there's any further color you could give to us on potential outflows and the timing of outflows from the Clariden Leu integration.</p>
          <p>And the second one is on the Basel 3 look-through forecasts. Despite the improvement in the Basel 2.5 ratio this quarter, which was very strong, your look-through forecasts for the end of 2012 and 2013 haven't changed very much. And looking at some of the moving items, I can see a slightly higher regulatory deduction as being one of the reasons. I just wondered if you could walk us through why that hasn't changed so much. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. Yeah, on the first question, on the net new money, as you said, I mean, I guess the overall picture, we think was a &#x2013; quite a strong one in the quarter. So, ex the Clariden issues we had, CHF12.5 billion of inflows in the Private Bank, which was actually a very strong first quarter performance. So, we actually felt pretty good about that.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the integration of the business, the Clariden business with the overall business was one where &#x2013; normally when you do an integration like that, you obviously do have some fallout in terms of customers and RMs. I think frankly, the CHF4 billion outflow, which is about 4% of the assets of Clariden was something that we thought was means. Obviously, we'd rather lose no assets and rather have &#x2013; rather not lose a single customer.</p>
          <p>But I think in an integration like that, there has to be some expectation that there'll be some fallout. And frankly we thought that was actually a pretty good performance on an integration like that, if you look historically at other integrations. And it is, as we said, it is proceeding well, but it continues to be a big focus, and we're going to do everything we can to try to minimize any further outflows or any further fallout, but I would expect &#x2013; I think that you'd have to expect that there may be some further outflows in the next quarter or so, but hopefully we will, A, minimize those, and B, get through that point fairly quickly. So, I'm not sure how helpful that is, but we're obviously going to do everything we can to try to minimize those. And David, do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two factors, really. Firstly, there's actually a slight FX effect because we actually closed the year &#x2013; sorry, closed the year at 0.94% and we closed the quarter at 0.9% so you get a small FX variance. The second thing is I think we've assumed slightly higher deferred tax on timing &#x2013; not deferred tax on all but on timing. And you may recall you're allowed up to 10% of your CG1 to be accounted for by deferred tax on timing. So any excess beyond that, and we are in excess, comes through as a deduction on the so-called look-through basis.</p>
          <p>So, it's really small technical rounding changes rather than anything else. You may notice, we haven't readjusted the RWA targets for FX either, because as we closed at 0.94%, 0.9%, trending to the target should be a few billion lower which is worth about 20 basis points on this. I think the calculation is much a guide as anything else. You're going to see the small changes coming through from FX every quarter. But the &#x2013; I think the main thing you were looking for is probably just a slight change in terms of a slightly more &#x2013; a slightly higher deferred tax on timing assumption.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Kinner Lakhani at Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Three questions. Firstly, just coming back to the recurring margin on the Wealth Management. The 40 basis points, really feels like a step change from the 43 to 45 that we had in the previous four quarters. So, I'm really trying to understand, what has driven the step change? Did the asset mix change materially or meaningfully in Q4?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the expense control and the CHF2 billion target, of which, I understand, the Investment Bank is about CHF1.4 billion. When I try and do some deferred comp analysis, it suggests to me that that CHF1.4 billion is achieved purely by the lower kind of deferred comp expense going forward. So, it does feel like the CHF2 billion target is either very conservative or you're looking to make some investments elsewhere. I'm just trying to get a better feel for the CHF2 billion.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on the Investment Bank. I just wanted to go through some of the products. Prime Services, I just wanted to get a feel for whether you see a re-pricing trend. And then if you could give us a bit more color on what you see as the client momentum in FX and Rates. I know you invested here second half of 2010, I believe. And perhaps we didn't get quite the payback last year, but what you see going forward on that?</p>
          <p>And also maybe if you could say a few words on the agency finance bid of the Securitized Products business. That's something that I haven't really heard about before. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kinner. I guess on the recurring margin, on the recurring fee portion of the Private Banking margin as you say, it was a reduction as we've said, maybe just to give a little bit more color on it. I think that &#x2013; I think there may be some elements which are more structural in nature and some which are more cyclical in nature. So, I think there's probably a combination of things there.</p>
          <p>On the one hand as we've said, a lot of the net new assets that are coming in and we have an increasing ultra high net worth composition of the assets that are coming in. That's actually good from a net margin point of view. It's not as good from a gross margin point of view. But that also then flows through, I think, to some of the managed product as well, which is, they would tend to be probably in some of the lower margin managed product. And so that's &#x2013; I think that has an impact there.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I do think there was a bit of an environmental issue, which was that, I do think that our clients probably did have a more conservative approach in the first quarter, and I think that does to some extent, map through the people investing in maybe some of the less opportunistic products, which may have a lower margin on them. So, I think there may be some element of that.</p>
          <p>And so that maybe a little bit of a cyclical element. But I think there is also a potential structural element, which is we are seeing a move into some of the lower fee type instruments. So, ETFs, et cetera, which are obviously lower margin producing type instruments, and that obviously may be somewhat of a structural issue.</p>
          <p>So, I wouldn't say the entire three point reduction is a &#x2013; is all a structural issue that we won't see come back. I think some of that probably is environmental. But some of it may be, there may be some structural elements to it as well, and I &#x2013; we'll just have to see how it plays out over time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think you're referring back to the presentation we gave for the fourth quarter when we talked about total expense savings of CHF1.4 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CHF1 billion basically in the first quarter and then a further CHF0.4 billion to be achieved by the end of 2013. I think it's certainly true. So I think that was the &#x2013; that's the actual sort of end 2013 target. And I think if you look at what we've achieved so far, at CHF1.5 billion of cost savings, we're clearly well ahead towards that CHF2 billion target.</p>
          <p>Now, I mean quite clearly, we will be looking to certainly meet and exceed that CHF2 billion target by the amount of overage, we'll see where we get to, because the measures which we've put in place to go from CHF1.2 billion to CHF2 billion are actually separate and beyond what we've achieved in the first quarter. So obviously, we need to achieve the other CHF800 million anyway.</p>
          <p>In terms of how much deferred comp has actually contributed to this, it's no &#x2013; that that's &#x2013; it's certainly true that if you look at the CHF1.3 billion reduction in the Investment Bank, around about half of that was in the first &#x2013; that's in the first quarter, was achieved by lower deferred comp. And then the best &#x2013; the rest comes through as lower MCE, and then obviously lower salaries and benefits, et cetera, et cetera. And that's absorbing, of course, the U.K. bank levy within that, as an offset. So the gross, non-comp is actually in excess of that.</p>
          <p>As to how much of the CHF2 billion will come from deferred comp, I couldn't give you a number off the top of my head. You're certain &#x2013; I'm pushing, you can't take the balance sheet numbers and map straight through, because the balance sheet simply refers the unauthorized deferred comp balances. There are certain components of deferred compensation, such as you may recall that the <mark type="ph" /> APA (1:10:26) clause has an ROE clause around it, which adds on to that in excess of that, depending on what the ROE of the bank actually is.</p>
          <p>So I would say, I guess, bottom line, we clearly have achieved CHF1.5 billion rather than CHF1.2 billion. We are on target for CHF2 billion, there's clearly CHF800 million extra measures we're looking to. I guess, that does mean we're looking to exceed the CHF2 billion target within the Investment Bank, about half of it so far has come from deferred comp.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on your last question, it's a good question, I mean. I'd say in Prime Services, I'd say we continue to see what we view as sort of a stable environment in terms of the overall industry environment. And our belief is we continue to take share and we continue to take quality share in that business,  so we feel like we've got good momentum. We take &#x2013; we're taking good share.</p>
          <p>But I would say, leverage among our client base is still relatively unchanged from before, so there hasn't been a big expansion in leverage. I wouldn't say there's a lot of margin pressure in the business. But there also hasn't been a great expansion in leverage and activity in that business. But I think we continue to take market share and we still have &#x2013; we have a very good market share, and we have an increasing market share. So, I think we're well positioned there.  But I'd say in general, I'd say, pricing and margin trends are largely stable.</p>
          <p>Your question on the Rates and FX side is a really good one. We've actually made a lot of progress in that area. As you say, we made a lot of investments. We &#x2013; obviously, the first quarter, demonstrated some good performance from that, so we're happy to see that. We had &#x2013; we think significant market share increases in U.S. swaps, treasuries and really across the board. The e-trading platforms, as you know, we've been working hard to apply our equity electronic platforms to the fixed income side, and we've seen some good progress on that, particularly in the first quarter, both in general, on the securities in swap side in the U.S. But also just generally on the foreign exchange side, we see pretty strong momentum on the electronic side, so we think that's good.</p>
          <p>We've also made some progress in areas like inflation, some of the option areas, European options, global inflation, some of the cross rates areas, which have actually incrementally done quite well over the past couple of quarters. So, we're seeing actually good progress all around the world in a lot of different areas in Rates.</p>
          <p>You mentioned agency finance, I mean we &#x2013; the asset finance business, which I don't know if that's what you were referring to, but that's like...</p>

We've been co on a lot of things. We've been doing a lot of business there. And it's been an active area. So, that's been a big &#x2013; that's actually been a big positive for us, and we've got, we actually put in place a team last year that has performed really well. So, that's been a real bright spot as well from both a market share and from a revenue point of view. So, a number of good things in that overall complex.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just to clarify on slide 28, on the CET1. I know you mentioned deferred tax assets when you were talking about the 7% look through. But it does seem quite a lot moving parts in some of the add-backs. I just wondered if you could explain why the other impacts are now on slide 28 at CHF1.9 billion where they were previously CHF2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>And then just to come back to this ultra high net worth gross margin, but not pre-tax margin. I mean, I can't quite &#x2013; I mean I see what you're saying, but in numbers terms, is there anything else you can give us to help us a bit, to show that? Because obviously I think the costs are down 5% if I've seen past, around 57, but the revenues are down 10. I don't know how we can see that.</p>
          <p>And then just the last one is on the risk aversion of the Private Banking clients. Again, is there anything, any color you can give us on whether &#x2013; the extent to how much they are in cash or low-risk investments and has that got even more so in the last quarter? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I can take the last two questions first, and then David can address the question on the CET1, or you want to do that first or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, mostly it's that we've got one quarter less of compensation accrual. So, the lot &#x2013; the one at the end of last year had four quarters and this one has three quarters. So, this drops from CHF2.6 billion to CHF1.9 billion as a consequence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I'll try net worths. I mean I'm not sure we can actually &#x2013; we know that basically the business does tend to be a somewhat lower gross margin business but a higher net margin business. And that's obviously because you have obviously less people, it's less RMs, less resources per average assets. But they tend to be a bit more competitive in terms of the assets that they do deploy. So, I mean that's &#x2013; obviously that intuitively make sense.</p>
          <p>You're asking, can we see that anywhere in the numbers. I mean, it's probably &#x2013; it probably has meant that, as you know in the past when we've been more like &#x2013; at the high point we're more like 130 basis points to gross margin. I think that some of these elements will mean that we may not see those levels again. But again, and we do believe we're at a cyclical low. But I think that will have some, in terms of the in-state, if we get &#x2013; if and when we get back to markets which are much more favorable, I think this &#x2013; the increased concentration on the ultra high probably does mean the gross margin's a little bit lower. But again, we think that that will filter through to a better pre-tax, as you say, it's not very satisfying because you can't really demonstrate that in any of the numbers right now, because of probably the more macro events. But we do think that that will be the case.</p>
          <p>I guess, more concretely on the risk aversion of the client base, I mean, they're about a third in cash right now, that's, I think, at basically close to the all-time highs. So we think that's probably a good demonstration, as you know, a lot of investors missed the rally in the equity markets and are now sort of waiting for the pullback to presumably re-engage on that. So, we'll see what happens.</p>
          <p>And we've also seen some shift &#x2013; we've seen some shift into gold over the past quarters, which probably is somewhat of a hedge against tail event in the market. So in general, we do continue to see a fair degree of conservatism among the client base.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I'll just keep it to two quick questions, please. One is, could you talk a bit more about the Italian branch closures? To what extent this represents a change in your onshore European strategy? And how much further outflows you expect around that?</p>
          <p>And then second question, I was going to try and push you for a more explicit answer and I think you gave on where you see Investment Banking head count going from here. It fell 3% in 4Q, and I think 1% in the 1Q, and I just wondered how much more IB head count decline we should expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeremy. No, on the Italian closures, that's really more of, I think, an example of where we believe that we're going to be able to achieve more efficiencies, but also even be more effective. So, we've got actually a very strong franchise in Italy. But we're really looking at really concentrating our operations in a few sort of mega centers within Italy. I mean, we're still going to have, I think, eight major branches throughout Italy. So, we think we can actually serve the clients quite well. But in fact, we think it'll make us not only more efficient but actually more effective. So, I don't think we view that as reductions in capability that lead to reductions in clients or assets. We actually view that as a way to, in fact, concentrate our business more, probably allows us to focus more on the ultra high and the high net worth segment, et cetera. So, we think it actually probably ends up with us having more assets and better margins on it. So, that would be the outcome.</p>
          <p>I think on the I &#x2013; sorry, you want to take it, Dave? Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean on the head count projections, I mean, I think to be clear, when we spoke about the decline back in November, we said that there'll be eventual cuts of around about 7% of the workforce, so 3,500 people. The Investment Bank reorganization was actually first, as you may recall, we actually started talking about that last June actually. And it's been the most advanced. I wouldn't say we're necessarily completely at the end of it, but we've clearly made the majority of the steps there. And the total RIFs we've done so far are about the 2,000 you see in the numbers.</p>
          <p>Clearly between 7%, which is 3,500 and 2,000 is an implied, another 1,500. I would say that the bulk of that now relates to the measures we've talked about in the presentation around streamlining our support and infrastructure side, some of the other initiatives we're actually making going forward. So, they will affect the Group as a whole. It's certainly true that a component of that, because remember that the numbers you see in the report is the IB direct head count plus their allocated support costs, will come through in that. But it won't be disproportionate to the rest of the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I would like to come back to the outflow in the Private Banking on slide 14, the CHF0.9 billion. Is it from Europe? Is that in relation &#x2013; do we have to under-protect that in relation to the tax agreement that Switzerland did with Germany and Great Britain? Is there a context you see? And secondly when you see the cost income ratio in Wealth Management is rising, so maybe the next focus for cost reduction and staff reduction, it might be that, the Wealth Management business? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well on the flows in PB and their relation to &#x2013; and as you say the cross-border issues, particularly with Germany, I guess we'd just make a couple points. I mean, one is we do not &#x2013; as policy we do not transfer accounts from, say Switzerland, to other branches. So, I know one of the things that's been &#x2013; and I'm not sure that's exactly what you're asking. But in general we do not allow an account to transfer from Switzerland to another branch, because obviously that's &#x2013; in our view, that's not compliant with the spirit of what we're trying to do. So, that's number one.</p>
          <p>Second of all though, I would say in general, we haven't really seen any particularly uncharacteristic flows in our business. In general, we have over the past years, and I think we've talked about this before, but it's probably been the last few years, we have had outflows in our cross-border Western European business. And that's been very consistent, and I'd say the first quarter was really no different in that respect. We have generally though, seen significant inflows from some of the ultra high net worth, and from some of the emerging parts of Europe. And that was the piece that we actually saw less of in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I think that was mainly just more market conditions in the Eurozone or maybe a little bit of some lumpy flows, with some of the ultra high net worths. Nothing that's particularly characteristic from our point of view, but again, I would say that those flows that you're seeing are &#x2013; pretty much have been the standard flows that we've seen actually for the past &#x2013; no, number of quarters, actually.</p>
          <p>So, with Wealth Management and we actually have a plan in place, which is to improve our pre-tax income in Private Banking by CHF300 million by the end of this year and ultimately to CHF800 million. So obviously, some of that comes from revenue-based initiatives like our ultra high net worth, but some of that does come from efficiency-based initiatives as well. So, and that's something we've actually started and been engaged in for a while.</p>
          <p>So, actually one of the things that you'll see is that actually the Private Banking division head count reduced by about 800 from the end of the fourth quarter to the end of the first quarter. So, it's not a question of us getting focused on that, we've been focused on that. We're working to try to get as efficient as we can in the Private Banking business. And in fact, we've actually shown that I think, in the first quarter of this year, we actually did achieve over CHF100 million of cost reductions in the Private Bank against our run rate a year ago. And ultimately we're &#x2013; we think we're going to achieve more than that on the cost side.</p>
          <p>So, all of those profitability improvement measures have actually been underway for many months now and are &#x2013; we're actually starting to see some of the benefits, but we should see more of those over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, just the rise in the cost to income ratio in the first quarter, is for you the necessity to do more on that, on cost reduction. You say that the program implemented will reduce it in the run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know exactly what you're referring to because, I mean, our pre-tax income margin was 24% in the first quarter, versus 18% in the fourth quarter. So, I don't know exactly how you're looking at it, but we think particularly if you adjust for the PAF2, which we've talked about a bit, actually our expense base was actually substantially lower in the first quarter of this year. So I don't know exactly what numbers you're referring to. But we clearly, longer term, are going to become more efficient. We've already begun to see some of those efficiencies carry through. So, we think we're already seeing that actually in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think obviously the pre-tax income margin in the first quarter a year ago was 30%, dropped to 18% in the fourth quarter, and it's 24% headline. If you exclude PAF2, obviously you get 26.1%. You take off the amortization, you're going to come out somewhere around the sort of 25.5% margin. So, the margin is lower than it was in the first quarter a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Higher than the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But higher than the fourth quarter. As Brady says though, I think when we talked in the fourth quarter results, we talked about CHF400 million of cost savings out of the CHF800 million savings. We're clearly on track of that, because we actually have about CHF230 million coming through in these numbers.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we pointed out in the slide the length of service noticed around some of the RIFs, means that the reductions in head count, which we're actually booking through the Private Bank, you're not really seeing the full benefit of that yet in our costs. And in fact, you won't really begin to see that until late in the second quarter and into the third quarter, just in terms of the time it takes to roll off those compensation expenses.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. One question if I may. Just on the volatility of your fixed income sales and trading numbers, which have been pretty pronounced, and which is probably the biggest swing factor for somebody modeling your earnings forecast. Do you feel now with the steps you've taken that this should come down from the Q1 level for the next couple of quarters to a normal seasonal pattern, or do you still think probably 2012 is kind of a transition year, given that David also flagged some additional costs on RWA reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess generally, Philipp, I mean the &#x2013; we're &#x2013; obviously are happier about the balance that we have in the business. We think that should help to reduce volatility. We're happy &#x2013; we're happier about a lower cost base in the business, which should help to give us more cushion on the pre-tax side. And obviously less capital means that that should also allow us to, again, give us more flexibility in the business.</p>
          <p>So, I think in general, we do feel like we've made some progress towards a &#x2013; not only a more profitable, but hopefully more consistently profitable and a high returning business in fixed income. But we are still &#x2013; there still is going to be an element of the markets and as you know well and &#x2013; so we'll obviously have to take that as it comes.</p>
          <p>But I certainly think that our hope is that we'll have less volatile returns in that area than we did last year, but obviously how consistent it can be remains to be seen. But we do feel like we've made progress on a number of those elements, which should mean it's a more consistent result.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, one single question. Did I understand you right, that your Q1 figures comprise a CHF500 million gain on the repurchase of Tier 1 and 2 capital? And if so, where did you book this CHF500 million, in the Investment Bank or Corporate Center? And if in the Investment Bank, in the fixed income segment or &#x2013; yeah, or if this is a misunderstanding, and you booked it against the equity of something else? I'm referring actually to page 27 of the presentation where you mentioned the CHF500 million. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Now as you say, we repurchased CHF4.7 billion of Tier 2 and some Tier 1 instruments, which will no longer be effective for Basel 3 capital purchase. It's from the beginning of next year, simultaneously as we actually issued the CHF750 million of new CoCos to complete the high strat requirement.</p>
          <p>That led to a capital benefit, a CET1 benefit of about CHF500 million, CHF540 million to be exact. But the actual profit gain on that was only CHF89 million and that's actually taken within the overall treasurer results in the Corporate Center. The rest of it, essentially, is really the realization of the DBA moves we've had before so they would come straight through to the balance sheet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, just one quick question. Can you give us a forecast on the &#x2013; for your &#x2013; for the General Assembly on Friday? You will vote about your compensation schedule &#x2013; the shareholders will vote on your compensation schedule.</p>
          <p>And as far as I remember last year, ISS votes against that schedule, which resulted in a important number of opposition of 27%, if I remember well. I presume you are in position of the opinion, I &#x2013; as this will express on your General Assembly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for that question, Daniel. I mean obviously, I mean, in general before I get to answer your specific question, I mean, on the compensation front as you know, we've tried to be &#x2013; we've tried to take a responsible approach. We've tried to work hard to align our employees with our shareholders. And we've done a number of things toward that end.</p>
          <p>So, for instance this year, and I know it's somewhat complex and probably not everyone understands it completely. But the PAF2 structure that we put in place, we think, was an excellent alignment of employees with shareholders, helped to achieve some of our strategic risk reduction goals and really showed that the employees taking that in lieu of compensation were really well aligned in advancing that strategy. So, that's just one example, but we've tried, obviously, to we think take a responsible approach, and I also think across our management group, if you look at the pay reductions this year, in line with performance and in line with returns to shareholders, we think actually it's been &#x2013; certainly within the industry, it's a fairly responsible approach.</p>
          <p>So, obviously, our hope is that we're supported in that by our shareholders. I don't think we can &#x2013; we can't really make any projection as to what might happen on Friday in the AGM. We, obviously, hope that our shareholders support all the measures that we put out. But we, obviously, that's part of the dialogue we have with our shareholders and we'll, obviously, see what they think and reflect on that over time.</p>
          <p>I think as you mentioned, there have been &#x2013; some of the different proxy agents have, obviously, their opinions on the different structures of compensation. Again, we feel like we've taken a pretty constructive approach. And, obviously, this is an environment where shareholders are more &#x2013; seem to be more active in these debates. And so it'll be interesting &#x2013; as you say, we'll certainly take on board whatever direction that we get from our shareholders on Friday. But I don't think we can really anticipate where that vote will come out.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. I'll be brief. First of all, the PAF impacts on risk-weighted asset reduction, you've given us a clue on page 23, I think. But could David perhaps give us how much of the CHF38 billion reduction in the Investment Bank came from PAF.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we've had a couple of questions on the EMEA business within Wealth Management. And I'd just be interested, your competitor told us at the Investor Day, there thought there were latent outflows between 12 billion and 13 billion as a result of the German settlement in particular. And you seem very relaxed about that. I just wondered why you felt a little bit more relaxed, or why you felt perhaps more upbeat than your competitor? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think you'll see for the Investment Bank, we had about CHF38 billion of RWA reductions and about half of that was actually achieved through external hedges and certain other mitigation measures. I think we are not going to disclose the actual component for PAF2. I would say that PAF2 was within that half of the CHF38 billion, because it does count as one of the hedges, we actually put in place. But it's by no means the only hedge or even &#x2013; it's a component of that, basically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And by the way, David, do you say the PAF impacts on Wealth Management net looks about CHF40 million? Is that correct, net of the hundred?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, on your second question, I think, in general as you know we've actually &#x2013; we feel like we've done a lot of preparation for a more compliant cross-border business environment. So, we have for many years now been pursuing that as our strategy. And so we're actually &#x2013; we're supportive of these measures to get clear agreements in place with these countries and to have sort of a very transparent and sort of clean playing field in terms of the business. So, we're very supportive of that.</p>
          <p>Having said, and the reason we supportive because we think in the medium to longer-term it will actually benefit our business. We think we can actually do quite well on that environment, and we're quite comfortable with that.</p>
          <p>In the medium &#x2013; in the short term though, obviously, the impact on our business, we've talked before, you probably &#x2013; I'm sure you probably remember, we've talked before about the fact that sort of Western Europe cross-border in total, the numbers that we have quoted is something like CHF25 billion to CHF35 billion of assets under management that might be impacted by the different potential approaches. So that's not just Germany, but generally across those countries.</p>
          <p>And so &#x2013; and obviously, you can then use those numbers and depending upon what the outcome is, whether you think those are going to be outflows versus some tax paid off the top, et cetera, then that will have an impact on it.</p>
          <p>But, so if you map that out and said, boy, there was a &#x2013; I don't know, 25% tax payment off the top of all those amounts, then obviously you get to a, whatever, CHF8 billion number or something that would come out of that. Just notionally.</p>
          <p>But anyway, so I would say, are we happy about that? We would be happy to get to a compliant environment. We do think in the medium term that will be actually a positive thing for us. But there certainly could be some impact in the near term in terms of as and when these agreements go in place on the assets under management.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just a very quick question. I was just focusing on the slide 43. Basically, the risk-weighted asset reduction achieved this quarter, you targeted a look-through common to equity ratio for &#x2013; in 2012, actually slightly decreased compared to your previous targets of Q4 2011. It seems to be partially driven by higher regulatory deductions that came from minus CHF7.6 billion to minus CHF8.2 billion. Just wanted to know if you could elaborate on that, please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah, so on slide 43, then. Well, there's two effects. First of all, it's a recalculation of the deferred tax on timing. You may recall that under the look-through rules, all DTNL has to be deducted, and our calculations there haven't really changed materially.</p>
          <p>But DTN timing is the loudest part of the Basel 3 CET1, to the extent it doesn't exceed 10% of your total CET1. We have a slightly higher assumption for deferred tax on timing of these numbers. And therefore as that is in excess of the 10% requirement, that results in an increase in the reductions. That's the first impact.</p>
          <p>The second impact is that we haven't adjusted our full year target, for FX moves. It's a pretty small effect. But essentially, if we'd done that and done it at 0.9%, rather than the 0.94% rate we actually closed the end of the year, then the ratio probably would've been about 20 basis points higher, which reflects really the capital buyback we talked about before.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; I mean, I think, those are the real factors in this.</p>
          <p>But as I said before, I think, the calculation is more a guide than anything else, because, clearly, it does also includes people's forecasts, and those tend to vary as well as one would expect. But it does give a general guide as to where we are.</p>

          <p>Good, thanks. So, maybe I'll just sum up quickly and appreciate everybody's good questions and hanging on through the call. But again, we had a good start to 2012, posted solid operating results and maybe most importantly, we feel we've made good progress towards establishing a business model that's sustainable in the new environment. So normalized basis, CHF1.4 billion in net income; return on equity of 16% in the first quarter; exceeded our annualized cost reduction target of CHF1.2 billion by reducing the cost base by CHF1.5 billion on an annualized basis; exceeded our end of quarter risk reduction target with a risk-weighted asset level of CHF294 billion, which again, is not far from our original end of 2014 target of CHF280 billion. And importantly, transform the Investment Bank, cut costs, cut capital usage by a third, increase the normalized return on Basel 3, allocated capital from 15% a year ago to 19% this past quarter, continue to make good progress on measures to improve profitability in the Private Bank, and really in all the businesses continue to have strong client momentum and increasing market shares.</p>
          <p>So, again, we feel we acted early, proactively to improve our costs and capital efficiency. We're seeing the benefits of that. And we think by executing on this strategy consistently, we are confident that we'll position Credit Suisse to achieve improved profitability and generate superior returns.</p>
          <p>So I think the results in the first quarter are indicative of what the business model can deliver and our ability to implement these initiatives to evolve the strategy, while delivering good financial performance and maintaining an industry-leading capital position really underscores the strength of the client-focused, capital efficient business model. Obviously, we're aware that market and economic environment remains uncertain, but we're encouraged that the business is off to a good start with this first quarter result in 2012.</p>
          <p>So thanks very much, everybody for your time and attention.</p>
