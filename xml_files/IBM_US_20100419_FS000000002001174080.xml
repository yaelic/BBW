          <p>Thank you for joining us today.</p>
          <p>This quarter we delivered $1.97 in earnings per share which was up 16% year-to-year. Our improving business mix and focus on rising productivity again delivered solid margin and profit performance. We increased pre-tax margin by a point, and both pre-tax and net income were up 13%. We had great cash performance, increasing free cash flow by 400 million to $1.4 billion. We returned another 4.7 billion to shareholders with 700 million in dividends, and 4 billion of share repurchases. The balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our full year objective. Our liquidity position remains strong, as we finished the quarter with $14 billion of cash on hand. This was a very good start to the year.</p>
          <p>Our key investments are unique to the IBM strategy and are paying off. This quarter our growth markets were up 8% year-to-year at constant currency, led by the BRIC countries which were up 14% as these countries build out and integrate their public and private infrastructure. Business analytics is one of the fundamental drivers of our software performance. Software revenue was up 11%, or 5% at constant currency with share gains in each of the five middleware brands.</p>
          <p>Across Software and Services, our Business Analytics revenue was up double digits. In Services, an increasing portion of our Consulting business is driven by our Smarter Planet engagements and Business Analytics. This quarter, Consulting signings were up 18%, or 12% at constant currency, with the strongest consulting performance in over 3 years.</p>
          <p>So our growth initiatives helped drive our first quarter revenue performance. You may recall that in January we expected to improve our revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter to the first, resulting in mid single digit revenue growth at actual rates. Let me tell you how we did and give you a few highlights.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter revenue was up 5% year-to-year though it was driven more by our business operations and less by currency. With the strengthening dollar, currency was less of a help, only contributing 5 points of growth versus the 6 to 7 points based on mid-January spot rates. This impacted revenue by about $250 million. So our underlying business performance was better than expected.</p>
          <p>The improvement in revenue growth from our fourth quarter was broad based with improvements across each of our major segments and geographies. In our segment performance: Systems &amp; Technology improved 11 points; Software 9 points; Global Business Services 4 points; and Global Technology Services 3 points, all at constant currency.</p>
          <p>By geography: Americas' revenue growth improved 6 points; EMEA, 5 points; and Asia 4 points. The major markets rate improved 5 points and the growth markets 6 points, led by the BRICs. Keep in be mind our solid annuity base, so our transactional growth rate drove these gains. Now, after a very good first quarter, we're increasing our earnings per share expectation for the year to at least $11.20, which is $0.20 from our previous view of at least $11.</p>
          <p>Now we'll turn to the detailed financial results for the first quarter. As I just mentioned, our revenue was up 5% year-to-year to $22.9 billion. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points, due to better margins in services and software and more favorable business mix. Our expense up 2% year-to-year, within this our operational performance was better 5 points, but was more than offset by a 7 point impact from currency, and a point of acquisition expense. Pre-tax margin was up a point year-to-year to 15.4%, and net income margin expanded nearly a point to 11.4%. With continued margin expansion, we increased both pre-tax and net income by 13% year-to-year and finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a 2% reduction in our share count. So bottom line, we delivered $1.97 of earnings per share, up 16% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now we'll turn to the revenue details starting with the geographic view. In discussing the geographic results, as always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. As I just mentioned, the improvement in revenue growth was fairly consistent across our geographies with Americas better by 6 points, Europe better by 5 points, and Asia by 4 points.</p>
          <p>Driving the 5 point improvement in the major markets growth rate, we had better performance in each of the G-7 countries. The best growth again came from the U.K. which was up 8% year-to-year. In the growth markets, growth accelerated as market conditions improved in most countries. With 8% growth this quarter, growth markets outpaced the majors by 10 points. The growth was led by the BRIC countries which represent about a third of the growth markets.</p>
          <p>The BRIC year-to-year increase of 14% included strong double-digit growth in Brazil, India and Russia. Government spending and programs remained a tailwind in most countries and our strongest performance again came from the public sector.</p>
          <p>Within the growth markets, our biggest improvement from fourth quarter was in sales to our small and medium business clients, driven by growth in Services, POWER, Storage, and System x. We're having great success expanding our footprints in the growth markets, which provides a base on which to build a software and services stack.</p>
          <p>Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, our Services revenue growth improved from the fourth quarter in total, and in SO, BTO, ITS, maintenance and GBS. This was driven by growth in outsourcing signings on a trailing 12-month basis, and growth in core consulting signings this quarter.</p>
          <p>Our software performance was excellent, up 11%. Targeted investments over the last several years have positioned us to capture growth in key areas like Business Analytics, Storage Management, and Business Integration.</p>
          <p>This quarter our Systems &amp; Technology business returned growth and we gained or held share in every brand.</p>
          <p>Turning to gross profits, our improving business mix and productivity initiatives has yielded consistent improvements in our gross margin over time. This quarter, better margins in Services and Software, and the relative strength of our Software business resulted in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total expense and other income was up 2% and together with 5% increase in revenue, our expense to revenue ratio improved 0.8 point year-to-year. The operational expense improved 5 points year-to-year but it was more than offset by currency, which impacted expense growth by 7 points, and acquisitions accounted for 1 point.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to execute initiatives to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale on our global footprint. This strategy has worked well over the last five years, and will continue to produce over the next five. As always, I'll lay out the road map of costs and expense items that had significant year-to-year impact to our profits.</p>
          <p>First, in March we completed our sale of our PLM operations to Dassault and we booked a gain of about $590 million. In our call in January, I mentioned that the gain from this sale would be relatively offset by a charge for productivity actions. This quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were about 560 million. The majority of the spending was in Europe and Asia, and we expect payback by the end of the year, with most of the benefit in the second half.</p>
          <p>If you recall in the first quarter of last year, we had a gain of almost 300 million associated with outsourcing our logistics business to Geodis and this was effectively offset by our workforce rebalancing charges of 265 million, so very similar dynamics, with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalancing charges. In fact, when you look at the combined impact of the two unique items last year and two this year there is no impact on IBM's year-to-year performance in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our bad debt expense less than 10 million in the current period, an improvement of 90 million from last year, reflecting the improving credit environment. Our AR reserve coverage of 2.1% is down 30 basis points from last year, though it is up slightly from year end.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'll comment on the impact from currency. As you know, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. With the year-to-year change in currencies, this hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in the first quarter of this year, as compared to a gain last year. The year-to-year impact in the first quarter was over $350 million which is roughly 60% in expense, and 40% in cost of goods sold. Keep in mind that these hedging losses mitigate the translation gains elsewhere in the P&amp;L. Though it's difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions, we do not believe that currency, net of hedging activity, contributed to our profit growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to our segment pre-tax margins. This is a snapshot of our margins by segment. The combination of the four unique items I just mentioned have no year-to-year impact on IBM's total results, but they do impact the year-to-year performance of the segments.</p>
          <p>For example, the workforce rebalancing activity this year was incurred in every segment, but the PLM gain was booked in Software. We provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the unique gains and charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Services. The two Services segments delivered 13.7 billion in revenue, up 4% year-to-year and down 2% at constant currency. This is a 3-point improvement in growth rate at constant currency versus the fourth quarter. Total signings were $12.3 billion, down 2% at actual rates, and 7% at constant currency. If you exclude Application Management Services signings, signings would have been up 4%. I'll talk about our AMS performance in a moment.</p>
          <p>Total outsourcing signings were down 3% at actual rates, and 8% at constant currency though Strategic Outsourcing signings were up 6%. As you know, outsourcing signings can be very uneven by quarter and it's important to look at the longer term trends. Total outsourcing signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 5% at actual rates, and up 4% at constant currency. Total transactional signings, which include Integrated Technology Services, Consulting, and AMS Systems Integration were down 1% at actual rate and 6% at constant currency. In the quarter we did see a shift in demand towards our Consulting offerings 12 with Consulting signings up 18%.</p>
          <p>Overall we signed 13 deals greater than $100 million. And backlog at the end of the quarter was 134 billion, up 8 billion year-to-year, or up 1 billion adjusting for currency. Within the backlog, we saw improved stability within our base accounts, with backlog erosion at the lowest level in two years.</p>
          <p>Now I'll go to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue in the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% year-to-year as recorded and flat at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue improved in the quarter and returned to growth at constant currency reflecting demand for BTO, and Strategic Outsourcing over the last 12 months. In Integrated Technology Services, the revenue growth rate also improved from the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Total GTS signings were up 1% at actual rate, down 5% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing signings were up 1% at actual rates, down 4% at constant currency. Strategic Outsourcing signings were up 6% at actual rates, with strong growth in North America. Integrated Technology Services signings were flat at actual rates, down 5% at constant currency. The strongest performance was in the growth markets, up 29% year-to-year, and we had improvement in labor-based services in North America.</p>
          <p>Global technology services gross profit was up 8% year-to-year, with margin up a half a point. Total pre-tax income was down 13% year-to-year as we absorbed a significant increase in workforce rebalancing charges. Looking at a normalized view of GTS margins, excluding the items I discussed earlier, PTI would be up 9% year-to-year with pre-tax margin expansion. This rebalancing activity will provide PTI benefits mainly in the second half of the year. And with this activity behind us we expect that GTS will return to PTI growth and margin expansion over the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was flat as reported, down 5% at constant currency. This improved revenue performance from fourth quarter was driven by strong growth in consulting signings which yield quickly in the quarter and revenue from Application Management Services signings over the last 12 months. Total GBS signings were down 6% at actual rates, down 12% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>This quarter, I'm going to describe our signings performance for GBS the way we manage it, as two distinct businesses, Consulting and Application Management Services which includes both application outsourcing and systems integration.</p>
          <p>In Consulting, signings were up 18% at actual rates, and 12% at constant currency. This is the first quarter we've had constant currency growth in Consulting since the fourth quarter of 2008. We're starting to see a shift in customer buying patterns toward more transformational offerings which are reflected primarily in our Consulting business. We have reengineered this business to align with the strategy around Smarter Planet and Business Analytics, making investments and adding significant talent.</p>
          <p>We're getting good traction from our growth initiatives, Consulting signings in growth markets were up 35% at constant currency and our Smarter Planet and Business Analytics offerings were 25%, of total Consulting signings.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Application Management Services, signings were down 23% at actual rate, and 27% at constant currency versus a strong first quarter of last year, where we had a handful of large deals. This is where we came up short versus our expectations in the quarter. AMS signings were down 700 million compared to last year. Now, AMS has grown on a trailing 12-month basis, but obviously it had an impact on our signing performance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Services signings excluding AMS would have been up 4%.</p>
          <p>Global Business Services gross profit margin expanded 0.7 point this quarter to 27.3%. Pre-tax margin was down 1.6 points year-to-year. Adjusting for the unique items, PTI margin was 12.4%, down 0.5 point year-to-year.</p>
          <p>Now, to wrap up Services, we had good improvement in revenue performance driven by outsourcing signings growth in both GTS and GBS over the past 12 months, and a return to signings growth in Consulting. This is important because Consulting has been a good leading indicator and has the greatest impact on near term revenue performance. Both of these give us momentum going forward and we expect our Services business to return to modest growth in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Software had a terrific quarter with revenue of $5 billion, up 11% year-to-year, or 5% at constant currency. These results are a direct result of our sustained investment in this space. Organic investments, complemented by strategic acquisitions have enabled us to deliver unique capabilities and tremendous value for our customers. This quarter, key branded middleware grew 13%, or 8% at constant currency and gained share for the 10th straight quarter as we continued to extend our lead in the middleware market. Every one of the key brands gained share.</p>
          <p>We had very strong performance especially in our business integration, analytics and storage management software. This contributed to great brand performance, with WebSphere up 13%, information management up 11%, and Tivoli up 23%. The software segment pre-tax income grew 54%, or 25% after normalizing for the unique items. Pre-tax margin was up 9.6 points year-to-year to 36%. Normalized, we improved pre-tax margin 2.8 points, to 27%.</p>
          <p>Now let me take you through some additional details on the brands. WebSphere had another strong quarter. Business integration offerings, which deliver value to customers by enabling them to make process more predictive, agile and collaborative, grew over 20%. ILOG, which plays a key role in IBM's Smarter Planet initiative by providing business rules management, did very well again this quarter, growing over 30%. Information management software had a great quarter. Business analytics continues to be a key growth area for us. Cognos, which was our largest acquisition ever, posted strong double-digit growth and gained share, providing a proof point on analytic demand and market.</p>
          <p>Tivoli had an excellent quarter, and gained share across all three market segments. Within systems management, Enterprise Asset Management, which includes Maximo products, grew double digits. This is a key component of our Smarter Planet strategy. Growth was broad-based across geographies, most notably in the growth markets.</p>
          <p>Storage Management software also grew double digits, which complements the strong growth in storage hardware. We've had over 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Tivoli storage software.</p>
          <p>Finally, security had solid growth, driven by strong sales across the portfolio. Lotus revenue growth improved significantly from the fourth quarter, driven by 31% year-to-year increase in advanced collaboration. This software improves our customers' productivity by enabling the efficient sharing of information.</p>
          <p>Rational software had a solid quarter with revenue growing 7% year-to-year. Rational provides an integrated suite of products to manage the business process of software and systems delivery.</p>
          <p>This quarter we completed the sale of our PLM operations where we have acted as a sales channel. Our participation in this business has been declining for some time and this transaction is in line with our strategy to divest of low value businesses. The sale will have a positive effect on Software margins immediately and improve our Software revenue profile over time. Over the next year, the loss of PLM revenue will impact our Software revenue growth by 2 to 3 points. We will provide a view of our Software revenue growth without PLM for the next 4 quarters to better reflect our ongoing business performance.</p>
          <p>Software had a great quarter reflecting the strength of the portfolio and the value it delivers to our customers. We expect to continue the same level of revenue performance in the second quarter, of course adjusting for the PLM transaction.</p>
          <p>Systems &amp; Technology revenue was $3.4 billion, up 5% year-to-year, 2% at constant currency. This is an 11-point sequential improvement in year-to-year growth rates at constant currency. We gained share in Storage, both disk and tape; System x, which includes 55% growth in blades; Retail Store Solutions and the mid-range of POWER, which was driven by the introduction of POWER7. We held share in high end servers.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margins improved in Storage, System x, Retail Stores and Microelectronics OEM. In Systems and Technology we expect mid single digit constant currency revenue growth in second quarter and our new high end product to help accelerate revenue growth throughout the second half to double digits by the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me take you through more details on the brands. POWER systems revenue declined 17% year-to-year and we held market share. We've been taking share in unit for years. In first quarter, our success with competitive units displacements continued with over 170 competitive wins, totaling over $125 million for the quarter. This quarter we took share in both low end and mid range systems. In the mid range, where we introduced POWER7 in February, we gained better than 2 points of share year-to-year. POWER7 systems further extend our price performance advantage versus others competing in the Unix space. We expect our share gains to continue in the high end, when we announce our new POWER7 products later this year.</p>
          <p>Storage revenue grew 11% year-to-year. Disk grew 18% and gained share with double-digit growth in enterprise, mid range, and low end products. In a high end, growth was driven by XIV where we added 75 new customers to our XIV platform in the first quarter. Tape declined 5%, but we again gained share. Our hardware storage results complement the strong performance in storage software. Our storage hardware and software together grew 14%.</p>
          <p>System x server revenue grew 36% year-to-year. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of share gains in x86. Our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance. System x blades grew 55% year-to-year and gained 2 points of share. Gross profit margin expanded year-to-year driven by improvements in end-to-end operational efficiencies, and the strong performance in blades.</p>
          <p>System z revenues declined 17% year-to-year. MIPS declined 19% in the first quarter after growing 18% a year ago. This performance is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle. Later this year we are releasing the next generation System z.</p>
          <p>Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 16% year-to-year. Our 300-millimeter fab is at near full utilization and our 45-nanometer output was sold out again this quarter.</p>
          <p>Systems and Technology returned to revenue growth this quarter with strong performance in System x, Storage, Microelectronics and Retail Storage Solutions. I expect this growth rate to accelerate through 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow, we generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow, up 400 million year-to-year. The growth was achieved off of a strong first quarter of 2009. The increase in free cash flow was driven by higher net income and improved cash from sales cycle working capital as collections remain strong and we delivered this 400 million increase in free cash flow even taking into account significantly higher tax payments, so this is quite an achievement.</p>
          <p>Below the free cash flow line we received about $450 million from the PLM sale which is reflected in the investing section of our cash flow, and on the line labeled, Other, in this chart.</p>
          <p>Looking at our uses, we completed 5 acquisitions for $800 million, which is a good start to the year, and returned 4.7 billion to shareholders: 700 million was in dividends, and 4 billion was in share repurchases which helped drive a year-to-year reduction in average diluted shares of just over 2%. We have 2 billion remaining from our board authorization. Overall, this was a great quarter for cash flow, especially for a first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the balance sheet where we see the benefit of our strong cash performance. Even after funding investments and returning cash to investors we maintained a healthy cash balance of $14 billion, which was flat from year end, and an increase of 1.7 billion from the first quarter of 2009. Total debt $26.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Over 22 billion of debt is in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at an appropriate 7 to 1 ratio. 4.1 billion is non-financing debt which is up 400 million from year end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility in our model. Non-financing debt to capital is 18%, up 2 points from year end and down 25 points from a year ago. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long-term.</p>
          <p>I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Starting with revenue, which contributed $0.09 of benefits or about a third of the total growth, this was the largest contribution we've had from revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008. Our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity which together contributed $0.13. We also had a modest benefit from tax, and share repurchase contributed another $0.02. So our growth was delivered in very balanced way, through revenue growth, profit expansion, and effective use of cash.</p>
          <p>Our performance in the first quarter was driven by the investments we've made to capture growth opportunities and our ability to deliver value to our clients. We had broad-based improvement in revenue growth across our segments and across our geographies. This improvement, together with a shift to higher value businesses and focus on driving productivity, again delivered solid margin and profit performance.</p>
          <p>We took actions in the first quarter to continue to transform the company, shifting to higher value areas, and improving our structure. We've completed 5 acquisitions in the first quarter, investing in key capabilities that support our growth initiatives. We divested our of PLM operations and after we get through the comparison in the next few quarters, this will improve the revenue growth and margin of our Software business. We introduced new mid range POWER offerings, and will deliver high end POWER and mainframe systems later in the year to drive share gains in the second half. And we continued to increase the productivity of the business. These actions will improve our strategic position and our business model going forward.</p>
          <p>Given what we see in the short-term and our work with the business units we expect a return to revenue growth at constant currency in the second quarter with Services delivering modest revenue growth, Hardware improving to mid single digits and Software continuing its strong performance.</p>
          <p>We're confident in our ability to continue to improve our revenue performance, leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash, and return value to our shareholders, so consequently, we are increasing our expectations for the year to at least $11.20 of earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Now Patricia and I will take your questions.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could comment a little bit on the IT spending environment and just go over again what you said about revenue growth at the end of the call. On the IT spending side, do you think we're back to a fairly normal IT spending environment, and by that I mean you know, normal sequential patterns in terms of market revenue growth?</p>
          <p>And then for IBM specifically on the revenue growth side, perhaps you could just go through one more time your expectations for revenue growth? That's something new, you typically don't comment on revenue growth for IBM, but if we are in a more normal spending environment, given that IBM historically has grown 3 or 4% a year at constant currency or maybe call it 2 to 5% in that range, should investors be expecting that IBM can grow in that range at constant currency for the remainder of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Toni. Let me start with your first question about the IT spending environment and revenue growth, characterizing that compared to more normal IT spending levels. First of all, as we went through it, we made it the second chart in the pack, but you could see how our growth rate improved across our brands and across our geographies. So to me, you know, STG's growth rate, up 11%, Software up 9, GBS up 4, GTS up 3 &#x2013; very good, uniform performance on that content, highly driven by the strength of our transactional performance and our STG and Software business.</p>
          <p>I think even more interesting to me, if you look across the geographies, look at how uniform that improvement in growth rate is, going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter: Americas up 6 points, EMEA up 5, Asia up 4, the major markets improving 5 points of growth, growth markets up 6 and within that, the BRIC up 7, with IBM's total revenue up 5. Now, that is very consistent with the direction that we gave when we closed the fourth quarter. Remember, we talked about we ought to be seeing improved performance in our revenue growth rates both at actual and constant currency going from the fourth to the first.</p>
          <p>Actually, within that, at the time we had assumed that currency would be an assist of 6 to 7 points and actually it came out more like 5 points. So given that we actually exceeded our own objectives here, we did much better on the operational performance to compensate for that currency impact.</p>
          <p>The second thing that I'll say across the spend environment, we're seeing a transition in the kinds of deals and the IT spend mix that our customers are looking for. Specifically, in this quarter you could see that transformational offerings, especially within Consulting, were much more highly driven with Consulting signings now up 18%, or 12% at constant currency. That's a very strong performance. We haven't had that growth rate in Consulting business in over three years. So I thought that was very encouraging, and it's in an area of the business that yields more quickly.</p>
          <p>Now, whether we're back to normal IT spend, that's a longer term view of the world. Obviously, I would like to see this momentum continue, but what I see within the IBM equation, is that we have a very strong play to improve our revenue performance now going into the second quarter, with the Services businesses now returning to modest growth, Software continuing this very powerful performance, up 11% in the first quarter. I thought that was very encouraging to see that kind of growth in our most profitable business continuing to fuel the remix in our business equation and hardware now taking advantage of improved transactional content within our transaction base, and now moving into a second half where we have substantial announcements coming up. So I think it's all good and positive performance on that transactional side the way I see it.</p>
          <p>Now, there will be the offset with PLM, and that's about a 2 to 3 point impact in Software growth, so we'll normalize for that going forward. But generally if you look across those characteristics, I feel like we've got a good hand going into the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Mark, can you talk a little bit more about your raising of guidance? Just a few things that I hope you can highlight. If I use the lower than expected share count, I can actually get pretty close to 11.20. So I assume that's not what you want us to be changing. Can you talk about maybe the benefits of the cost cutting and other reasons why you raised the guidance and maybe even highlight currency, the puts and takes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me go through that. First of all, when you look that guidance, to be 90 days into the new year and take that guidance up 20 cents, I think that's a pretty significant improvement in our view of the year. And that improvement was really driven by the strength that we see in the quarter, the strength in the operational performance. I covered a number of these points in the last question with Toni, but: much better signing performance in our Consulting business; Software transactional performance in the first quarter, up 28% at constant currency, or 24% at actual; Hardware returning to growth with good announcements in the quarter, but very exciting announcements as we move into the second half.</p>
          <p>So if you look at what accounts for the improvement going from 11 to 11.20, that improvement is based on our confidence as we now have closed, I would say, a very good first quarter. Now, within that, there are a number of different mechanics under the hood that we could talk about. First of all, one that you had mentioned, Ben, if you look at the workforce rebalancing work that we did, that was predominantly in Europe and Asia. So it has a slightly longer payback. We said it pays back within the year, so if you look at that, that's about $550 million of benefit, predominantly in the second half of the year and I would say that would yield about, I don't know, two-thirds, because the balance of the third now that we're in a more of a growth mode, the balance of that third, we can use now for investment to drive our revenue growth. Let's say about a third of that 550. That would be about $0.20.</p>
          <p>Now, as I pointed out earlier, that's partially offset by the 7-cent impact from PLM. The PLM impact starts in the second quarter, the benefit of the workforce rebalancing is really in the second half of the year. And I think that gives you kind of a framework.</p>
          <p>But I also want to comment that if you look at improving the guidance from 11 to 11.20, remember that when we were in the second quarter of 2007, we established a roadmap that we said just having completed a year of $6.05, we thought we had a very good hand to improve that to at least $9 by the time we got into 2010, with a potential range in '10-11 depending on the performance of our pension fund, and here we are talking about $11.20, well beyond that roadmap objective. So I think we've done pretty well, especially having gone through a recession and within that recession, recording earnings per share growth every quarter at a fairly substantial rate.</p>
          <p>So I feel good about the guidance. I feel good about the business as we exit the first quarter. And you know, the workforce rebalancing will have benefit, but that will be predominantly in the back half of the year. And frankly, when you look at your to go increase based on our increase in our EPS guidance, I would reserve most of that to go increase for the back half of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the margin question. Any reason we wouldn't see a nice uplift and perhaps better than seasonal uplift in gross margins in the back half of this year in light of the high end server cycle that kicks in, in the second half and in the back end loaded cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly have, I think, as you point out, Katie, we have a strong base as we go into the second half of the year. First of all, savings out of the workforce rebalancing that will be substantial and in addition, as you pointed out, new and exciting announcements on the high end of our server line which drives substantial margin and should drive substantial margin in the business. So I think we've got a very good base going into the second half of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You know, Mark, could you better help us understand your divesture strategy and particularly the thought process around balancing mature free cash flow yielding businesses and growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, absolutely. Let's link the discussion on divestures with acquisitions, because they are part and parcel partners in this strategy of ours. Now, first of all, if you look at the ongoing strategy we have, we want to move into intellectual property-based businesses that are highly scalable and related to the driving the solutions offerings that we have. Solution offerings like business analytics, as an example. What we're doing on the flip side, on the divestment 'side, is moving out of businesses that have lower growth prospects and lower margin prospects.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the divestures and the acquisitions in the quarter, I think they are perfect examples of that strategy. The PLM business was &#x2013; we re-marketed their product. We didn't own the intellectual property. They owned the intellectual property and as we worked through this with Dassault, it made more sense for them to actually run that sales and marketing themselves rather than for us. But at the same time, we invested in 5 very strong candidates that do have a lot of intellectual property and that intellectual property is aligned with the strategic objectives that we have set for ourselves.</p>
          <p>So I think this is actually a perfect example, divesting of lower growth, lower margin commoditizing content and moving that investment base into higher growth, higher margin intellectual property that we think is highly scalable and aligned with our strategic trajectory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a sense of how much may still be out there in terms of things that would fall in the same category as PLM in terms of scale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a very fair question. We've had that question a number of times, I would say, over the last decade. Oftentimes we've had investors or analysts look at us and say, well, that must be about it. We're looking at next year, IBM's centennial. We're investing in driving for another centennial. So this is going to go on all the time. This is all &#x2013; this is going to be a constant process of regeneration and renewal and transforming our business base into new opportunities that we think have better margin and better growth prospects, and I think there's no better example than looking at the profit mix of the software business from 2000 to 2008, and you can see how much that expanded. That was a strategic choice.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. Mark, you made reference to the weakness in App Management bookings and I just was hoping you might be willing to give us a little bit more detail on the reasons for that. Maybe also a word on what you saw in the systems integration portion of that and then generally, your view of the pipeline, Services pipeline, going into Q2 long-term versus short-term, and you know, what type of bookings growth expectation you have for the Services business for the full year this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, first of all, if you look at the AMS business, it was down about 700 million year-to-year. Now, it faced a prior year where they grew those signings 23%, and they had a handful of very large deals. So it was a challenging quarter or that business. Now that business did quite well last year. We grew signings 14% for the year, so a good double-digit performance in '09 at a particularly strong first quarter to compare to.</p>
          <p>If you look at across the Services base of business, on a signings base, you know, we do think that when we go into the second quarter, we have a very good deal list, and we have a &#x2013; with a good odds, so there's no reason we shouldn't be growing signings at a reasonable level as we go into the second quarter. If you look at booking expectations, I mean, I think that's going to be characterized, you know, quarter by quarter. Right now we see a pretty good pipeline; going into the second quarter, as I said, we'll be returning to signings growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, I want to come back to the transformational activity in it terms of Consulting Services. Is this a shift that you're seeing? Do you see this as multi-quarter or multi-year shift, and how should we think about the gross margin, operating margin profile? Should we see incremental leverage from this over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's look at, first of all, your discussion and your question on transformation, especially related to Consulting Services. Now, if you look at the Consulting performance as we pointed out, you know, signings were up 18%. Underneath that, underneath that performance, it's interesting to note that North America was up 26% and GMU was up 35%. In fact, we had growth in four of our five major IOTs in Consulting. So a pretty broad-based phenomena with real strength not only in our major markets like North America but also in our growth markets, up 35%. And if you look at the content underneath Consulting in that base of business, it was about 25%, that base of business was, in Business Analytics and Smarter Planet.</p>
          <p>So you can see the linkage that Consulting momentum threw to other parts of our business. I mean Business Analytics, where is the biggest component? Well, it's obviously in Software. We reviewed with you the acquisitions and organic investments that we've made in Business Analytics and Software, as well as the organic investments in mathematical expertise in research, given that we are now the largest private sector math department in the world. All of those work together to help drive that equation and move that transformation through a number of our business units. And given the investment that we've made in this, obviously we're looking for a multi-quarter, multi-year growth in that Business Analytics opportunity.</p>
          <p>So with that, Business Analytics is a great example, moving into solution offerings, with a big Software base in the framework of the deliverable, and that Software base comes at very high margins. It is part of the mix shift that you've seen starting in 2000, driving much more of our profitability through that high margin business.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. I wanted to go back to revenue growth if I could and how you're thinking about IBM in 2010. A different way is if you look at the EPS bridge for the first quarter of '10 versus '09, about a third of your EPS growth was related to revenue at actual. If you think about what you provided of at least 11.20 for the year, how do you think the revenue growth will contribute to that? Is it more than 50%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to give specific percentages to break that down. I mean, we do think that we're clearly, based on the improvement in revenue growth rate from fourth to first, and then the comments that we made, you know, working with our general management going first to second, we believe we're in a better framework for revenue as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>But when you look at the components underneath the 11.20, we run multiple scenarios. We run scenarios with higher revenue growth rates in different geographies; higher revenue growth rates in GMU versus major markets; higher revenue growth rates with higher margin content along Business Analytics. We do alternatives, if the growth rate comes in the more transactional content as opposed to the annuity content and what's the impact in currency? Just in currency alone, if you just look at the 90-day change in spot rates, in a quarter, that alone has impacted the actual revenue growth by about a billion and a half to $2 billion.</p>
          <p>So there's not just one scenario that we look at to drive our view of the year. We look at multiple scenarios. We look at our flexibility to drive that and what we're delivering, I think, is a view of the world that's in that least number. So to us, to me, that that's a high probability base looking forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. In the past, guys, mainframe cycles have been a key driver, at least a key stimulus for IBM's non hardware segments. Is that something we should anticipate in this coming cycle or has the direct link between mainframes and the Services and Software portfolios been diluted somewhat over the years?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well we &#x2013; you know, the thing that I'm always most impressed with is how dynamic the different plays and different solutions are in the corporation. They cut across different product lines and avenues. So we are certainly not dependent on any one set of announcements or strategy within the company.</p>
          <p>Now, that said, this mainframe cycle looks typical to me and we have a very powerful announcement set up for the back half of the year, so I'm very optimistic in the upcoming announcements for both Z-series and our high end POWER7 series.</p>

          <p>Yeah, great question. You know, we did track those deals as they rolled from fourth to first. And as you look at them, we did close a number of them, but really the closure rate was very similar to '09. So on a year-to-year basis, they really didn't have much contribution to our overall growth. Our growth in the quarter was really driven by the operational performance in the quarter by our Software business driving that 11% growth rate.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. You bought back about $2 billion more of stock than I expected during the quarter. Can you maybe update us as to what you expect to use your liquidity for going forward? Where do acquisitions fit versus buyback? How are you thinking about that equation going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. You know, when you look at the acquisition base that we had in the first quarter, I thought we had a pretty darn good start. That's $1 billion of acquisitions spread across five very strong opportunities for us and demonstrate our commitment to acquisitions as an ongoing play. At the same time, we repurchased $4 billion in the quarter. Now, if you compare that to the prior years, that does look like a large first quarter but I'd caution you that really the prior year was impacted by the equity impact that we had in the business leaving 2008.</p>
          <p>So in other words, when we had the big pension impact due to lower return, that in turn impacted our equity and our debt to cap went to about 48%. So last year we had to be fairly careful about equity-based transactions and the impact on that. We are not in that situation this year. We're not in that situation. So if you look at our debt to cap now, it's 18%. That's very conservative. We've got $14 billion of cash. We just finished the quarter with $1 billion of gross acquisitions, 4 billion in share repurchase, 700 million in dividends.</p>
          <p>So now I would tell you, as you all know, this is a power reserved to the board and we have about $2 billion left in our authorization. But I would think that it would be more practical to compare this year's acquisition opportunities and this year's share repurchase opportunities especially in a latter base to what we saw in 2008 as opposed to '09. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much for your questions. Let me just wrap up here. We had a very good start to the year, including real progress on the top line. Our best growth came from Software, which is our most profitable and highest value area. We had great growth in Consulting signings, which as you know tends to be a leading indicator. And we started the introduction of our high-end servers, which will continue to roll out later in the year, and drive Hardware growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>So overall, we're encouraged by our performance in the first quarter and the position we're in for the rest of the year and that's why just 90 days into the year, we're taking up our EPS expectation for 2010. Now, with at least $11.20 EPS for the year, we're well ahead of our 2010 roadmap objective, and we'll talk to you again at your investor briefing on May 12 but for now as always, it's back to work.</p>
