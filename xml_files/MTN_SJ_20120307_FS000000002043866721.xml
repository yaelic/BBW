          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much for the video. The video reminds me of a program I was watching yesterday about what demographers are studying these days. You know that, for many years, we were &#x2013; there were studies about Baby Boomers and Generation X, Generation Y. Now, there's something call the Millennials. And one of the people who has been interviewed yesterday is a South African from Cape Town, and she was talking about how she sleeps with her phone, how she can't do without her iPhone. The other one from Washington was talking about how she feels naked without her phone. I think it tells you the kind of world we are in today, and that's the reason why we are here at MTN to tell you that we are very proud to connect all those generations, all those demographics that the demographers have been studying.</p>
          <p>On behalf of our Chairman, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, and our Group CEO, Mr. Sifiso Dabengwa, I wish to welcome you so we can actually tell you how we've performed to connect all those generations from the Baby Boomers to today's Millennials. Without any waste of time, you know the process. We'll start with our CEO, who will actually give us the summary and the lowdown of the financials. And then, of course, he will be followed by our Group Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Nazir Patel, who will actually present the result. And this will last about one and half hours. And after that, we'll allow you to ask questions. When you do ask questions, please make sure that you say which organization you belong to, so that our CEO and CFO can put your answers into perspective.</p>
          <p>Now before we go on, tweets and BBMs are allowed, but please make sure that you put your cell phones to silent so that our CEO and CFO can be able to seamlessly talk to you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Dabengwa, the floor is yours.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Rich. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and good morning to my colleagues from MTN wherever you are. Thank you for being with us this morning, where we will share our results of the year 2011 through the end of December. I will start off by going through the strategic and operational review, as Rich has said. And then I will be followed by Nazir, the CFO, who will focus on the financials.</p>
          <p>Just to remind ourselves that our vision is still to be the leader in telecommunications and emerging markets, and our focus on revenue, expenditure and M&amp;A driven by convergence and looking beyond voice revenue generation from an expenditure point of view focusing on making sure that we take advantage of scale. And then on M&amp;A, we are looking at consolidation and diversification, and also for opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>Some of the key strategic considerations. I will start off just with a comment on shareholder return strategy. It is our intention to continue to use both ordinary dividends and buybacks in order to be able to return cash to shareholders as part of our sustained return strategy. The board has decided to increase the dividend payout ratio to 70% from 75% &#x2013; sorry, from 65%. And during 2011, MTN &#x2013; we did buybacks as part of the return strategies to the value of ZAR927 million, and we will continue to &#x2013; with buybacks as and when appropriate.</p>
          <p>The cornerstone of our strategy is really going to be around customer experience. And as we indicated at the last presentation that we will be and we are working much more aggressively in terms of defining much more comprehensively our customer experience strategy, and also making sure that all that we do primarily focuses on our customers and our customer experience.</p>
          <p>Looking at revenue growth and service delivery, we have seen that airtime subscriptions is still 66% of total revenue. We have seen reductions in termination rates that have been impacting our revenue. It's key for us that we continue to maintain market share as tariffs decline and continue to improve our voice offerings, but in an extremely segmented manner. Distribution of low-cost handsets has become an important priority, but at the same time distributing handsets in order to drive data is also just as important.</p>
          <p>Looking at the data and related services, data and SMS is now 12.8% of our total revenue. Mobile money, which we launched a few years back, is now launched in 12 countries and we have about 6 million registered subscribers. We still continue and we will continue with our partnership model, and we are looking at many ways to try and improve on that service.</p>
          <p>Data related services remain a priority. And again, the issue of segmented device strategies to drive data remains very important. We are in the process and we will continue looking at developing platforms to support different applications. Once we have moved some distance in terms of that, we intend to make sure that during the course of this year we are able to make sure that the service delivery platforms we started working on are implemented in at least the larger operations.</p>
          <p>The ICT evolution, we have continued to invest in infrastructure in order to support our ICT strategy. We intend to leverage and integrate with our Business Solutions footprint, which already exists in a number of countries. And in terms of our key products and services, we'll continue to focus on access, managed network services, managed hosted services in the cloud, and machine-to-machine services.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost optimization, we did indicate at the last presentation that we had initiated the procurement transformation project, good progress has been made. But specifically on equipment pricing, we are migrating towards a more centralized operating model, and we intend to have that implemented during the course of this year. We initiated the IT shared services initiative. The SEA IT hub is now fully operational. Uganda and Zambia have been migrated to the hub. And there will be further integration during the course of this year as we bring in more operations into that hub.</p>
          <p>From an infrastructure sharing strategy, as you're all aware, the Ghana tower sale was completed during the course of last year. And the agreement to establish a tower company in Uganda is in place, and we are proceeding with the implementation of a Uganda tower company.</p>
          <p>We are looking quite aggressively at back office centralization. That is still at the planning stage. We are working across the organization to see how we can optimize costs by centralizing a lot of the back office activities in finance, in human resources, and in our procurement.</p>
          <p>And then one of the key areas that we're looking at is trying to manage the cost of energy. And we are accelerating the program in which we initiated over two, three years ago by implementing hybrid systems in order to reduce dependency on diesel.</p>
          <p>From an M&amp;A perspective and from an in-country perspective, we continue to see changes in local ownership, driven primarily by localization, and also in some cases where we desire to increase our ownership. We are actively looking at increasing our spectrum capacity in most of the countries in order to be able to address increasing requirements for operations and also be prepared for a much higher data demand.</p>
          <p>In terms of expanding our footprint, our priority is still Africa and the Middle East. We're still focusing on bolt-on stand-alone assets with scale and size &#x2013; of the size that fits within our strategy, and also focusing either a number one or a number two operator. In terms of transformational deals, as we have indicated in the past that those are not a key priority, but we would look at them where there are opportunities. And the reality is that, at this stage there are rather limited opportunities.</p>
          <p>Going on to the details of highlights for performance in 2011. Some of the key features are, our subscribers are up by 16.2%, up to 164.5 million; revenue up 9.7% to ZAR121 billion; our EBITDA margin up 3.4 points to 44.9%; adjusted headline earnings, up 43% to ZAR10.70; a final dividend of ZAR4.76. And as I've indicated earlier, the dividend payout ratio increased by 5% to 70%.</p>
          <p>Some of the key issues underlying or that we've experienced during the course of this period. The competitive landscape in terms of tariff competition impacting traffic on the network and the overall revenue growth has been quite significant. The effect of tariff reduced in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda, and in Iran the tariff remained reasonably stable.</p>
          <p>During the course of the year, it was also quite clear that in most of our operations the elasticity is actually below one, and therefore the increase in traffic as a direct result of pricing going down did not give us the revenue increases that we would have expected with elasticity levels of one or above.</p>
          <p>In terms of some of the countries where we have some important aspects that took place during the course of the year, we saw a great improvement in performance in Sudan, where we saw the net subscribers increase by 2.5 million. C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, which had a difficult start during the early parts of the year, showed strong operational recovery in the second half and was able to achieve most of the targets. South Sudan, we're still progressing with the establishment of a new operation. We still have not confirmed a license as yet, but we are continuing to negotiate with the authorities.</p>
          <p>Ongoing unrest in the Middle East has had an impact specifically in Yemen and Syria. But we hope that in Yemen, with the resolution of some of the problems and the political issues, that will settle. But I guess, in the case of Syria that probably will still continue until they do find a solution.</p>
          <p>Ongoing sanctions in Iran are requiring additional attention from management in the organization, and we are, as we've indicated, working very closely with our legal support to make sure that we remain on the right side of all the issues pertaining to sanctions in Iran and also in Syria.</p>
          <p>Looking at specific country details in terms of performance for 2011, starting with South Africa. We've seen good growth in subscribers of 16.9% to a total subscriber number just over 22 million subscribers, driven primarily by very strong growth in the prepaid segment. The postpaid hybrid also performed very well, going up by 32%. We see our market share remaining quite stable and the total revenue generating minutes up by 6.4%.</p>
          <p>The reduction in interconnect rates to ZAR0.73 for peak in March was in line with the glide path that was agreed upon with the regulator to just over two years ago. In terms of revenue, we see that data has increased by &#x2013; that's excluding SMS, has increased by just over 27%. Smartphones have increased to 3.6 million. We now have just over 10 million users of data on the network. Airtimes and subscription up 4.2%, like I said, driven primarily by prepaid. We saw a reduction in interconnect revenue of about 9% as a direct result of the decrease in the interconnect rates. And also, we have seen that the effective tariff went down by about 8%.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've seen a revenue growth of about 7.7%, which we're relatively satisfied with. And the impact of handsets went up by about 45%, driven primarily by volumes and also an increase in the number of smartphones that we have been able to sell.</p>
          <p>Looking at the expenses, there's clearly been very good cost control overall in the South African operation. On the network operating costs, we see that there's been very good control. There's been reduction &#x2013; cost &#x2013; reduction of the cost in professional and consulting fees. We have taken back a significant part of the information systems which was outsourced to IBM a few years ago. And the interconnect costs are down by 6.8%. The overall margin for South Africa, as you can see, has gone up to 35.2%, which is a reasonably good achievement.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, we've continued to modernize the network, as indicated during the last presentation. The fiber national long distance projects are progressing and progressing reasonably well. We did have some difficulties in relation to permits from Water Affairs, but most of those problems have been overcome. We have continued with LTE trials. We continue to focus on self-provisioning. And as indicated before, this is really to facilitate and support our data strategy, but also at the same time to reduce our dependence on other operators for transmission.</p>
          <p>At this stage, there has been a delay by ICASA in terms of spectrum allocation, and the process for spectrum allocation, we expect, will be reviewed between ICASA in collaboration with the minister. So overall, from a CapEx perspective, we're able to achieve an expenditure of about just about ZAR4 billion, which is in line with our expectation despite a slow start at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Nigeria, Nigeria did experience a much slower growth as a direct result of SIM registration requirements. Overall, growth was 7.7% on subscribers and we're now at a stable market share of about 50%.</p>
          <p>As far as the SIM registration is concerned, it is not clear as to when the deadline will be, but we expect &#x2013; we had expected that it would be sometime in the early parts of this year. But the process continues until the authorities do give us a finalization on that date. The total revenue generation minutes increased by 31%, which is quite significant. And obviously, this has had an impact on our network capacity requirements, and at some stage during the course of the year did have a negative impact on the network quality, which has been and is being addressed.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, we saw a 9.6% growth with interconnect up 54%, and also seeing stabilization of our tariffs in the second half. The overall market was very competitive during the course of last year, and we did give indications on &#x2013; that there was an effective reduction in tariff of about 21%.</p>
          <p>Although there was this effective reduction in tariff from an MTN point of view, we have continued to effectively remain at a premium, but not as significant as it was in the earlier parts of last year. We've seen strong data growth, going up by 1.5%, acceptably from a low base. We now have about 1.7 million active data users on smartphones and over 300,000 dongles. As you can see, data is now at &#x2013; at the end of the last financial year at 6% of the total revenue, having gone up from 4% the previous year.</p>
          <p>In terms of expenses, we saw that there was an increase in diesel prices of about 25%. And I've said earlier on, we continue to deploy hybrid power systems in order to minimize the impact of diesel and diesel cost increases. Rent and utilities also went up by just below 18%, and transmission cost went down by about 5% following the commencement of the Main One undersea cable.</p>
          <p>Interconnect costs went up by 28%, and that was a direct result of increases in traffic going off our network. EBITDA margin at the end of the year was at 61.7%, which was slightly lower than where we ended in the previous year at December 2010.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, in Nigeria, again, we started off with quite a lot of challenges. But as can be seen, during the second half there was significant improvement on our rollout of CapEx. There was increased attention to network quality, and our busy hour congestion has come down to the levels of about 1%, which is the target that we aim for. We've continued with our fiber rollout to support our data strategy. And although the overall expenditure for the year was less than our guidance, the commitment &#x2013; we committed about 95% of our guidance, and the projects will be completed during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Ghana, we had a very good performance in a very competitive market, with an increase in subscribers of just over 16%. We've had very good promotions and offerings in the market. Although there was a slight loss of market share, we believe that we were able to perform very well, like I said, in a very competitive market. The total revenue generating minutes went up a healthy 16%. And, yes, like I indicated that although our market share slightly went down, we believe that we were able to hold our position quite well. Ghana is probably one of the most competitive markets with very strong international operators operating in that market.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, there's a 15% growth in local currency. And airtime and subscription went up by 13.9%. Interconnect went up by 35% as a direct result of competitive off-net tariffs. We've also seen good data growth of about just below 80%. SMSs were down as a direct result of regulatory requirements, which prevented us from running certain types of promotions which we had been doing previously that were very effective in terms of driving SMS revenue. The effective tariff reduced by 2.4%. Overall data revenue was at a region of about 5.5%.</p>
          <p>In terms of expenses, overall expenses went up by 11%, transmission costs going up 52% as a direct result of data traffic, the increase in data traffic. Rent and utilities went up by 46%, and distribution and commissions went up by about 8%. That's a direct result of the competitive environment with the other operators competing for distribution capacity.</p>
          <p>Interconnect costs went up 64% as a direct result of tariff trends in the market. We reduced our off-net tariffs in order to be able to be competitive. And that led to an increase in our interconnect costs. Expenses went down by 37%. That's including the sale &#x2013; the profit from the sale of the towers that took place during the course of last year. And the full impact of the towers will be reflected in the 2012 financial year.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, the completion of the sale of towers obviously had an impact in terms of our CapEx rollout. And hence, the overall CapEx, if you look at it from a year-on-year basis, it was significantly reduced. We did have challenges in terms of the busy hour congestion, which was a little bit higher than we expected to be at 3.4%, but hopefully that will be addressed &#x2013; or that has already been addressed as we move into this year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Iran; Iran has continued to perform extremely well. We have improved our market share. And in terms of subscriber growth, we had a 16% growth driven by good promotions and also good plans in relation to the different seasonal promotions. We have improved our distribution quite significantly and we also introduced ATM distribution for airtime. Total revenue generating minutes went up by 27%.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, we saw growth of 26% airtime and subscription being up 22% and interconnect being up 11%. We also saw a robust SMS growth of 47%. Data and WiMAX continued to gain momentum, going up 66% from quite a low base. At the end of the year, the data revenues &#x2013; the data as a percentage of total has gone up to about 23%.</p>
          <p>Expenses in Iran have continued to be well-managed. And the lower distribution costs and commissions have continued, and the continued push for logical distribution has also helped manage the overall distribution costs. However, we have seen higher rent in utilities due to high price hikes in electricity and fuel costs, as subsidies were removed during the course of last year.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, we did see slower project delivery as a direct result of equipment delivery difficulties. However, this did not impact on our overall business performance quite significantly. We have increased our population and geographic coverage, and generally improved the quality of our network. We have continued to roll out WiMAX coverage in the areas where we have acquired the WiMAX license.</p>
          <p>Looking at Syria, as indicated earlier on, the political unrest has continued to impact the business environment negatively. Overall, revenue generating minutes only went up by 1%. We have continued to operate the business despite the difficulties that are associated with the political unrest.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenue, the revenue, as you can see, for Syria has been rather flat in terms of airtime and subscription, although we have seen an increase in data up by 17% and SMS is up by 11%. Effective tariff has reduced by about 1.3%</p>
          <p>On the expense side, we have seen a reduction in terms of distribution and commission costs due to reduction in sales. And we continue to manage the costs quite tightly. And then you can see that the EBITDA margin at 26% is an improvement from the previous year.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, our delivery on CapEx was lower than what we had initially planned, primarily because of the delay in the license conversion. That process is still taking place, and hopefully during the course of this year we will get some conclusion on it. There also was an issue in relation to availability of equipment, and then also security delays &#x2013; security concerns did delay rollout in some parts of the country.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Nazir, who will now continue with the financial overview. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Sifiso. We have a few people that are sitting, I think, right up here. You might be a bit more comfortable. I think we have like six seats available at the frontend of the auditorium, if you feel the inclination &#x2013; inclined to come down.</p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you, Sifiso. Good morning to members of the audience. A special welcome to Mr. Alan van Biljon, member of the MTN Group Board, as well as to members of the MTN Executive Committee, and also all the MTNers who are listening to this presentation.</p>
          <p>Sifiso has taken us through the operational highlights and has unpacked those to some &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> in quite bit of detail (32:45). I'll focus largely on the consolidated results and try and make a little sense of them. On this particular slide, we've tried to make the operational results more comparable. So if you try and compare it to the external reported results, you will see some differences. And these are largely on the EBITDA line. So if you look at the 2010 number, the EBITDA includes &#x2013; excludes the ZAR2.9 billion charge, which is related to the MTN Zakhele scheme in 2010. And the 2011 number by comparison excludes the profit from the sale of the Ghana towers. So results basically on a revenue and EBITDA and cash flow line look much more comparable.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, Group revenues increased by 6%. We saw OpEx increasing at the same rate. So adjusted EBITDA margins excluding the one-time items remain roughly flat year-on-year at 44% and 43.9%. If we added back the profit on the Ghana TowerCo sale, we will report an EBITDA margin for reporting purposes of about a full percentage point higher of 44.9%.</p>
          <p>Now for those of you who are familiar with MTN results, you're aware that currencies play a huge role or here have a huge impact on our reported numbers. In the first half of the year, we had the impact of a very strong rand with the average rates of about ZAR6.80. We've seen about a 10% move to about ZAR7.50 in the second half of the year, bringing the average rates to ZAR7.17. And I'll take you through a more detailed slide on the exchange rate movements in a short while.</p>
          <p>CapEx overall was lower at ZAR17.7 million against ZAR19.5 million last year, bringing the CapEx to revenue ratio to 14.5%, clearly below where we expect it to be. But given the run rate that we've set up in the second half, we expect to continue that momentum as we get into 2012. And Sifiso has touched on a number of those points.</p>
          <p>Overall, the continued strong free cash flow growth, performance of the Group has encouraged the board, as Sifiso said, to lift the dividend payout ratio from 65% to 70%. And the final dividend of ZAR4.76 will be paid to shareholders on April 2. Again, in line with the strategy of the Group board to return cash to shareholders more effectively, we also went into the market and bought back shares, a total of 6.7 million shares at a cost of just under ZAR1 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on, just some key accounting considerations that impact the consolidation year-on-year. We increased our shareholding in Nigeria to just under 79% at a net cost of just over $350 million as a result of settling the IFC put option. One of the benefits of that is, as we go forward, after we get rid of the historical comparatives, we just make the reporting both on EPS as well as on the accounting side on the income statement a little bit simpler.</p>
          <p>We accounted for the profit from the sale of the Ghana towers in the first half, as you recall. We booked a profit of ZAR445 million. That represented a 100% profit on the sale. The entire TowerCo transaction was completed over three phases. The second phase in August 2011 and the final phase in December 2011, by which time we'd actually set out the JV, in which we became an associate from an accounting perspective. And we've now eliminated in the second two tranches 49% of the profit from the Ghana towers. So this is difference between H1 and H2. There were other smaller transactions in terms of increasing shareholding or changing shareholding, which related to Rwanda, Zambia and the full investment in Supercell was disposed, which are self-explanatory on this particular slide.</p>
          <p>On the put option side, without going into any detail, the finance costs and the fair value adjustment look pretty much the same for the Nigeria put option as we showed you at half year, slight movement. The ForEx loss, however, widened from ZAR51 million to ZAR205 million, and is largely represented the weakening of the South African rand in the period between June to the date at which the transaction was completed, and that move was about a 6% weakening.</p>
          <p>On the tax side, we saw an increase compared to last year in the effective tax rate from 36.3% to 36.8%, which is largely a function of the fact that we had higher STC costs, as well as withholding taxes as we continue to aggressively push cash up to the Group. Disallowed expenses also ticked up about 1.6%. So what we expect to see is a stand &#x2013; or a number closer to the statutory effective tax rate of the Group becomes much higher when we account for these particular items.</p>
          <p>On this particular slide what we've done is we've shown you in the yellow bars on the left-hand side the average rates for the Group. On the top section is basically the USD-to-local currency impact of the key currencies. And more relevant, at the bottom of the slide what you see is the cross-rate impact. And this is what has an impact on our reported results.</p>
          <p>The first set of yellow bars offer obviously the average rates for 2010. And the ones on the right, the yellow bars on the right, look at the average rates for 2011. Looking at the top section of the graph, you will see at the bottom end the ZAR has actually strengthened, believe it or not, despite the weakening in the second half year-on-year from ZAR7.34 to ZAR7.17. The remaining currencies, however, when viewed against the U.S. dollar, all have declined in the range of 3% to 8%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the local &#x2013; or the cross-rate impact, however, we find that each one of those, despite the weakening in the second half, all the major underlying currencies have declined in the range of 5% to 10%. Again, this has a fairly major impact on the way we report our Group results.</p>
          <p>Revenue overall, again on a reported basis, has increased 6%, as we noted earlier. If we had restated these at constant currency, in other words, looking at the same exchange rate which I showed you on the previous slide, we would have reported revenues at 10% higher at about ZAR125 billion. So the movement in exchange rates has had a 4% negative impact overall. Again, as Sifiso touched on some of these points, Nigeria, we saw high incoming interconnect traffic, which pushed our revenues quite high, good growth in data as well as in airtime.</p>
          <p>South Africa was pretty strong despite the 10% year-on-year &#x2013; approximately 10% year-on-year adjustment in interconnect. Iran, again, continues to be strong, surprising on the upside, with strong subscriber growth, good growth in data and through WiMAX and SMS. Ghana, which was also commented on quite in a lot of detail.</p>
          <p>Looking at the relative contribution to the different segments of revenue, however, we see a slightly different picture. Not surprisingly, we see airtime contribution &#x2013; and keep in mind, these are on a reported basis. We have not adjusted these for constant currency. On a reported basis, we see marginal growth in airtime revenue of about 2%. The overall contribution of airtime revenue to total Group revenue remains roughly flat at about 66%.</p>
          <p>Interconnect, however, moves up quite sharply by about 9% year-on-year, now contributing 15%, and that's to a large extent based on the higher incoming interconnect that we see, particularly in Nigeria and in Ghana. And there, tariff changes in the market, particularly off-net strategies, followed by some of the competitive base have had a major impact. Pleasingly, we see strong growth on data from ZAR6.2 billion to ZAR8 billion, which supports the overall Group strategy to develop this side of the business quite significantly, so a 30% year-on-year improvement.</p>
          <p>South Africa contributes on the wireless side 57% of that, business solution, which is more <mark type="ph" /> servicing the corporate (40:04) base at 15%. And now, encouragingly, we see good numbers coming out of Nigeria, which now contributes 13% of the overall Group data revenue. Cell phones moved up sharply, mostly in South Africa. We saw about 28% year-on-year increase in handset volumes, very much on the prepaid side. And also, we saw a demand for higher-end smartphones coming through, which pushed the overall revenue and cost up as well.</p>
          <p>OpEx, as I noted earlier, moved up by about 6% year-on-year, in line with the revenue growth, so struggling despite a lot of the stuff to increase margins, the margin rate anyway. But at least a lot of the cost efficiency or optimization programs that Sifiso talked about do have an impact. Looking at it on a line by line item basis; direct network and operating costs have moved up by about 12%, which is quite a bit higher than the rate of revenue growth of 6%. And this is not a surprise in terms of the fact that we continue to invest in the network. We have a higher number of sites that are coming through. We saw a spike in electricity costs in South Africa, which you're familiar with, Ghana and Iran. Higher transmission costs in South Africa to support the demand for increased bandwidth. And diesel price is up in Nigeria, 25% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>At half year we noted that, in fact, diesel costs in Nigeria relative to revenue at about 3.5%. Despite the full year impact of the price increase, we've managed to keep it roughly the same level. But compared to 2010, just at the Nigeria P&amp;L level, it is about half-a-point margin dilution.</p>
          <p>Handset cost, I've have talked about in the previous slides, so we'll not dwell on that. Interconnect and roaming, again, we saw strong flow of interconnect costs as we saw higher volumes of interconnect traffic going out to in Nigeria, Ghana and Iran.</p>
          <p>Marketing costs year-on-year declined, as we would have expected. 2010 included substantial investment in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:53) costs. When you strip those out in 2011, they have half-a-point positive impact on the overall Group margins.</p>
          <p>Commission costs in RSA and Nigeria are nominally much, much higher than last year, but these were in line with revenue growth and supported the revenue growth in both countries. Other expenses, the point relates to South Africa and really relates to &#x2013; again, as expected, a reduction in IT outsourced costs as we in-sourced some of the issues that we've been dealing with before.</p>
          <p>So, overall, pretty solid EBITDA growth from ZAR50.5 billion to ZAR53.5 billion on a reported basis. Again, slightly lower on a constant currency basis, where on the previous slide I showed you constant currency revenues moved by 10%, EBITDA would have moved by about 9% from the reported ZAR53.5 billion to about ZAR55.3 billion. So currency had something of an impact.</p>
          <p>What's important here though is Nigeria grew EBITDA margins at the lower rate of growth than they would have expanded their local currency revenue growth. So the way you saw 10% on the revenue slide, we see 7% here. South Africa, very positive, 12% here, with local currency revenue growth was about 8%. Iran 31%, where revenue was 26%. And Ghana just relatively flat despite the 15% increase in rate of revenue growth. So overall, good margin story despite the very significant pressure on tariffs overall, across all the key markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at it slightly differently, we &#x2013; as Sifiso noted, the EBITDA margin for Ghana on a rate basis moved down to 61.5% despite the absorption of the pressure on effective tariffs coming down, as well as the costs &#x2013; diesel costs going down, as well as the &#x2013; and in addition to that, the cost of interconnect as well.</p>
          <p>South Africa and Iran, as I noted, moved both up, and relatively, the South Africa margin expansion offset. at a Group level at least. by four-tenths of a point, any margin dilution that was coming through from Nigeria. So overall, the message, without going into too much detail, because I think we've dealt with most of those points, is roughly flat operational margins despite all the pressures that we have.</p>
          <p>CapEx, without going into too much of detail again, on a percentage of revenue basis 14.5%, coming down. The point to make here is in the second half, about ZAR12 billion after a very slow start to the year of ZAR5.7 billion. And hopefully, we can continue that rate of CapEx deployment as we go through the first half of the year and the rest of the year. Again, as Sifiso said, most of the CapEx that we kind of missed relative to the earlier guidance has been committed. So we'd expect to see that flow through the financials in the first half of next year and certainly for the full half.</p>
          <p>Actual free cash flow, again, the percentages in the bars on the left relate to actual free cash flow as a percentage of revenues, moved up from 27% to about 29.4%; again, based largely the fact that we were able to keep solid EBITDA margins coming through. And CapEx spend was lower by just over ZAR2 billion year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Net debt, key points to make here. Gross cash balance has moved up 27%. They include about ZAR9 billion of treasury bills and bonds, which we invested in Nigeria to take advantage of short-term interest rates. We spent about ZAR1 billion buying back shares, as was noted previously. Very positive, we had a Moody's upgrade, and we moved up from Baa3 to Baa2 with a positive outlook. We continue to focus in terms of leveraging the local OpCos and aggressively moving up cash. It does count against us, the tax line, as I've talked to you about. We repaid about ZAR3 billion of HoldCo debt. So overall, good developments.</p>
          <p>On the interest and tax line, 2010 to 2011, the key point here to make is where we saw a charge of ZAR4 billion for the full finance cost line, in 2010 (sic) [2011] (45:38) that came down to ZAR1.6 billion. The biggest move, however, came on functional currency. And as we look at the financial position slide, you will see that the closing rate that &#x2013; at December 2010 of ZAR6.61 moved out to ZAR8.07, which had a fairly significant impact on the FCTR number. So overall, function currency losses swung from a negative ZAR1.2 billion to positive ZAR778 million.</p>
          <p>On the tax side, we've dealt with most of the issues. What's probably clear to &#x2013; important to point out is, the Ghana tower sale actually had a tax impact of about ZAR521 million, and we've described the different types of taxes that apply to that particular transaction.</p>
          <p>On the adjusted HEPS slide, so pleasingly, basic earnings per share moved up by about 19% year-on-year. Adjusted basic headline earnings per share moved to 17.7%. The point to make here, the ZAR9.09 excludes the HEPS impact of the ZAR2.9 billion Zakhele charge in the prior year. If you looked at that number specifically, it was actually ZAR7.47 that was reported.</p>
          <p>The items that we've adjusted, net profit on disposal of non-current assets, the 48.6%, relate to two items. That's the net after-tax cost of the Ghana TowerCo sale, as well as the profit on the BICS transaction, which are both reversed for the EPS <mark type="ph" /> count (46:51). And at the bottom, the reversal of the put option relates, obviously, to Nigeria and to Afghanistan.</p>
          <p>This is the adjusted income statement. We've covered most of the items. The only item to actually take note of is share of results in associates, the ZAR38 million negative, that reflects the cost of the Ghana JV that has been set up. Really, there is not much income in the short period that the JV has been in existence. We'll start seeing income flow through next year. That's about ZAR107 million, offset by the profit in the BICS transaction of about ZAR38 million. The last year ZAR52 million income relates purely to the gain on the BICS transaction.</p>
          <p>This is what you will see externally reported. The only point to comment here is the other income line of ZAR1,458 million. That's made up of two numbers: ZAR1,158 million, which is basically the profit on the Ghana TowerCo sale, and ZAR273 million, which reflects the profit on the BICS transaction.</p>
          <p>On the statement of financial position, or the balance sheet, this is really the way the accountants like to look at it. The balance sheet, however, if you look right at the bottom of the page, the closing rate of ZAR6.61 in 2010 moving to ZAR8.07 at December 2011. Again, that accounts for most of the variances when you're looking at the balance sheet at both period-ends. Again, the FCTR component is really what drives some of the major variances. If you take property, plant and equipment, almost entirely due to FCTR, that ZAR7 billion change, intangible assets pretty much goodwill, almost entirely driven by that.</p>
          <p>Other non-current assets, that's the investment in the Ghana TowerCo that's coming through. Current assets, you've got some movements in inventory, some movements in receivables, where South Africa actually moved out some dealer days from 45 to 60. And you've also got the investments of about ZAR8.5 billion &#x2013; ZAR10 billion coming &#x2013; ZAR9 billion coming through from Nigeria and treasury bills and bonds, which are held as current investments.</p>
          <p>Moving further down, the only other item to talk about is the other liabilities line, which has moved close to ZAR10 billion. Included in there is a move in tax liabilities of about ZAR4 billion, some FCTR on trade payables of about ZAR2.3 billion, and smaller items in the move of FCT, at least of &#x2013; on an income of about ZAR1 billion, which accounts for most of that.</p>
          <p>I should go back. One point to make here is net cash-to-EBITDA has improved from 0.02 in 2010 to 0.22, not surprisingly given the strong financial position.</p>
          <p>On the statement of cash flows, you'll see cash generated from operations of ZAR50.3 billion. We would expect that number to approximate EBITDA, but you'll see there's a difference of about ZAR4 billion in that number. About ZAR2.4 billion of that relates to the fact it is sitting in the receivables &#x2013; in working capital in South Africa as we extended credit terms from 45 to 60. Some is sitting in handset inventory as we moved up &#x2013; where we've actually moved up the volume of handsets that are sitting in stock as demands and volumes have increased. That's pretty much most of that ZAR50 billion. There's also some interconnect receivables that have built up in the working capital line as well.</p>
          <p>Dividends paid, as you know, have gone up as a result of the increase in the payout ratio. Moving further down, the cash line &#x2013; or the cash &#x2013; statement of cash flows, other investing activities have moved quite sharply ahead of last year. What you see there is about ZAR8.5 billion, which relates to the outflow in terms of investments in treasury bills and bonds in Nigeria, the investment in the Ghana TowerCo that is in the associate, offset by the income that comes through from the sale of the Ghana TowerCo assets over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>The cash used in financing activities also moved up by about ZAR10 billion, about ZAR5 billion of that has been used to pay down HoldCo loans, ZAR0.9 billion on the purchase of the shares which we've talked about previously, about ZAR2.6 billion relates to dividends payable to minorities. And those are really the big &#x2013; or the key items in there.</p>
          <p>Clearly now over the next few days as we meet with you, we'll talk to you in more detail about these, but Sifiso will take you through the prospect section. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nazir. Looking forward, clearly from an operational point of view, key aspects of our business will be how we get our customer experience to be enhanced in terms of new services, and also in terms of how we service our customers overall. We have decided to be quite aggressive as far as the ICT strategy is concerned, especially in the larger operations. As I said earlier on, we do hope to see some delivery of new services in the large operations during the course of the year. We'll continue with our strong focus on cost optimization and on the initiatives to optimize costs and to make sure that we can protect our margins. And leadership and market share remain our priority in all our markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of rollout, we will be increasing our short-term pace of network investments and rollout. We have overcome most of the challenges that we faced last year, so I'm confident that we will be able to meet our requirements.</p>
          <p>From an M&amp;A point of view, we'll continue to look for opportunistic bolt-on assets. That remains a priority for us. And once we accept the fact that it is becoming more and more difficult, but we believe that it's still something we will continue to look at. In terms of shareholder returns, the comment about the 70% payout ratio and the fact that we'll continue implementing buybacks as and when appropriate.</p>
          <p>We have also reviewed our organizational structure and we have had a new organizational structure approved, which basically eliminates the Regional Vice President role and basically creates a new role for an Operations Executive, who will be responsible for all the operations other than South Africa and Nigeria. So basically, if one looks at it from a value point of view and from a contribution point of view, we have three business lines, South Africa, Nigeria and other. And that, I believe, in terms of how we focus on the different types of operations that will enhance our ability. And also, this will also help us to focus on optimizing at G group level, and not necessarily on a geographic level. The structure is to be implemented by April 1 this year.</p>
          <p>Looking at CapEx guidance for the year, the total authorized for the year is just about ZAR24 billion. If you look at the Nigeria number, what we have done for Nigeria in order to make sure that we don't have the challenges that we faced during the course of last year, is we looked at the CapEx requirements over an 18-month period and that works out to just over ZAR13 billion. But for the 12 months of this year, we expect to put in the ground about ZAR10 billion of CapEx. And the indication on the different &#x2013; other operations; South Africa, ZAR4.5 billion; Ghana, ZAR1.1 billion; Iran, just ZAR1.3 billion, and the other operations at ZAR5 billion. So we are very much in line with what we indicated during our discussions last year that we expect to be in that region of ZAR22 billion to ZAR25 billion.</p>
          <p>And in relation to subscriber guidance, at this stage we're looking at growing our subscriber base by just about 20 million subscribers, South Africa being about 2.9 million, Nigeria 4 million, Ghana just below &#x2013; sorry, at 950,000, Iran at 4 million, Syria at 450,000, and then the rest of the operations at 8 million subscribers.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is the end of the presentations. And then we will now move into a question-and-answer session. I have my colleagues from ExCo here, so &#x2013; who will be able to help us or take up any questions that we may not be able to answer. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Jonathan Kennedy-Good from SBG Securities. Just a quick question on Nigeria. Obviously, you've had tariff declines last year and elasticity didn't quite offset that. I was just wondering, in the new year, we've obviously had fuel price hikes, et cetera, imposed on the Nigerian population. Has that kind of trend weakened your revenue prospects in the new year, or have you not really noticed any impact on consumer spend or ARPU &#x2013; marginal ARPU in Nigeria?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, just on Iran and Syria. Are you able to manage those businesses using the cash resources or cash generation within those operations, or does head office have to, in certain cases, pay suppliers, vendors of equipment &#x2013; in other words, investing rands, say, back into those operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, in relation to Nigeria, I think we have to give it a little bit more time to be able to tell the impact of the removal of subsidies. I think, by the time we get to the half-year results, we'll be in a much better position than we are at the moment. In terms of Syria and Iran, the question is whether we are funding those or with the &#x2013; no, not at all. They are all &#x2013; they are self-sufficient. They're self-funding.</p>
          <p>Sorry, the lights are a bit bright.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:54) I'm at Bloomberg News. You say you will continue to buy back shares, and you have spent over ZAR900 million. What is the point of buying back shares? Is that because you perhaps have run out of things to buy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Nazir to answer that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I think we should just separate the M&amp;A opportunity, or lack of opportunity, from the decision to buy back shares. One of the important things that we look at, or any investor will look at in terms of just having confidence in where your share price is, is to look at the underlying value in that share. Historically, we believe that we should be trading at a much higher multiple than we currently are. However, we understand the sentiment that the shareholder base has in that, or the investor base has in that.</p>
          <p>At levels of 4.5 to 5, at multiples of 4.5 to 5, we believe that it's a good investment for MTN. And over a period of time, we believe it creates shareholder value, both in terms of, from a dividend perspective there, as well as in terms of improving the capital structure of the balance sheet. But we'll continue looking for opportunities to expand the company as well, at the same time.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Chris Grundberg from UBS. Sorry, I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just try and shout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Chris Grundberg from UBS. I've got a couple of questions. On the net cash <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:32). And then on second, just a smaller detail question. You touched on the organizational restructure. I wonder if you can just give any color on whether there's any cost benefits attached to that at all? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the second question, which I think I heard clearer. In due course, yes, there definitely will be some cost benefits. I think the overall objective was really not driven primarily by the cost benefit. I think it was driven primarily by being able to manage the organization much more effectively. And looking at how we execute on our strategies and making sure that we now have, let's say, a shorter distance between the center and the operations, specifically to ensure that we have a much more effective organization in terms of executing on our strategies.</p>
          <p>In terms of your first question, the way I understood it was, how do we decide between buybacks and M&amp;A opportunities? Look, I think the issue is really, at the end of the day, the question of where we're going to get a better return. And because, with M&amp;A opportunities, it's a question of what is available and what it is that we target. And it's a continuous process, and we work on it all the time. So I don't think it's a question of either/or. It's just a question of, what is the better option, in terms of what is available at that moment in time.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:56) 10% of shares, yeah. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:06) exercising is thinking, in terms of executing the buyback like we did in the fourth quarter. Views this largely as opportunistic, and as Sifiso pointed out, we have enough firepower based on the current, let's just say, potential target that we have out there to do both, if we chose to. I mean, as you know, we have pretty decent headroom on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Peter from RMB Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to know, Nigeria, if your market share goes below 50%, what is likely to be your reaction? And if you could just comment on the sort of competitive landscape, six months ago versus now, what's happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, from a market share point of view, we've always indicated that we will do everything we can in order to protect our market share, obviously without necessarily destroying value. So it's a question of, what is the cause of that market share decline. But we have indicated that we will do everything we can to make sure that our market share remains in that region of about 50%. I mean, the competitive landscape has continued. I think we have also continued to be, let's say, more competitive.</p>
          <p>I think the reality right now is that we still do have some offerings that are at a premium, not as significant as it was early last year. And also, we have to be conscious of the network quality, in terms of how much traffic we bring on to our network. So, combining those elements, we will make sure that we manage our business such that we do try to maintain that 50% market share. It's not easy, but that's the target that we are looking at.</p>

          <p>Right. Yeah. No, look, I think the issue is, they've been very competitive. They've continued to be competitive. We have invested quite significantly and continued to invest. We did make the decision, early during the course of last year, that we have to be competitive in the data space, both from a capacity coverage, and also from a services and pricing point of view. So the idea is that, yes, we will continue to be competitive.</p>

          <p>Let's just go through the issues. In terms of last year's experience was that, there was, let's say, quite a significant drop in pricing because of the competitive pressure. So therefore, the network was challenged. The speed of drop in terms of pricing was much faster than what we'd anticipated, and therefore the traffic on the network reached levels during the course of last year that we had not anticipated to reach during last year, which we &#x2013; for our planning purposes, expected to reach sometime this year. So we have had to accelerate our rollout. And we believe that, with the accelerated rollout, our network quality will improve.</p>
          <p>But again, if there's significant price reductions and increases in demand, our network will come under pressure. But from the regulator's point of view, the regulator is now satisfied with the plans that we've put in place and what we've indicated, in terms of how we are addressing the problems, and there has been improvement of overall network quality. The problems that we also face is issues such as cuts in fiber, and that happens quite significantly in a number of different parts of the network, which are very difficult for us to control.</p>

          <p>Sorry, Sifiso. I've just got some questions that came through through the Internet and webcast. So we've got one question here regarding, revenue growth in the 2H period in Nigeria was impacted by tariff declines. With the more stable tariffs now, would you expect better local currency growth than that achieved in the 2H period going into 2012? That's the first question. I think I'll just take them one at a time. It's easier.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just ask Brett, the CEO of Nigeria, to comment on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; I mean, 2012 is a very difficult year, because we also &#x2013; besides the tariff decreases, we also had subscriber registration, which was particularly odious. Not only do you have to give your ID, but you have to give &#x2013; have your fingerprints taken and a photo.</p>
          <p>We gained market share in the second half, but we're really only competitive with our tariffs as from August and September. And in fact, during the last quarter, we showed a slight improvement in our ARPU. So I would say more the last quarter, or the second half, is probably a fair reflection going forward. But really, the year was constrained by subscriber registration. I think the &#x2013; probably the performance diluted in the second half until we reduced our tariffs in August-September, so it's definitely improved our position from a revenue perspective and a market share perspective. So not quite a fair reflection as to the whole of the second half; more the last quarter would be a better reflection.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Wipro (1:10:22). That first question was from Nik Kershaw from Deutsche Bank. This question is from <mark type="ph" /> Samir from Wipro (1:10:27). Could you please share IT shared services plan for WECA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The whole issue of shared services, we've started with IT in the South and Eastern region. We will not necessarily have, let's say, a separate hub for WECA. What we are now actually looking at is, how much can we use the existing hub to take more than what we had initially looked at, which was just the Southern Africa country. So whilst, yes, we are looking at <mark type="ph" /> hub (71:13) from an IT point of view, we will centralize the IT. We will first look at, how much more can we put onto the existing hub before we look at a second hub.</p>
          <p>But also, at the same time, this has to be looked in the context of that, we are looking at a centralization of back office activities across the Group. And that might impact what we do in the immediate short term, from an IT shared services perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>More questions. One from <mark type="ph" /> Floren (01:11:51), just asking if we're going to move more aggressively with the ICT services plan into fixed line connection? And I've got one more after that, and then you -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That was easy. The last question is from Richard Barker at Credit Suisse, and it goes back to the buyback discussion. Given your comments on how good the value in the MTN share price is at the moment, why not use some of your excess capital, of which there is probably more than $5 billion, to do a really big buyback?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nazir, you want to comment on that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to put a &#x2013; without giving you any details, I think as far as the board is concerned, it has a framework which is based largely on an opportunistic objective, in terms of buyback. So, as I commented earlier, we will look at the share price levels in the market. Clearly, the markets are relatively unstable right now. There's a lot happening in the broader market, as well as the impacts in MTN. To the extent that the board feels comfortable exercising a program or an opportunistic buyback within the framework, or within the levels of comfort it has, it will do so. The mechanism is in place. Without suggesting we're going to do $1 billion or $5 billion, I think it will be viewed opportunistically, in terms of providing incremental shareholder returns.</p>
