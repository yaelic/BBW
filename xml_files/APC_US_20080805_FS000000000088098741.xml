        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks Annie, and good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today for Anadarko's Second Quarter 2008 Conference Call.  Joining me on the call today are Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO and other executives who will be available to answer questions later in the call.  Also, I would like to take this time to introduce Danny Hart, an engineer who is joining us in our Investor Relations Group.</p>
          <p>Danny has been with the company for more than 10 years and will be available along with Chris Campbell and myself to continue to work with you and meet all your needs.  As a reminder, we have posted additional information in our second quarter operations report that is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>And before I turn the call over to Jim, I do need to remind you this presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information.  There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss and you should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.  In addition, we'll reference non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release on page 5.  We encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.  Good morning, everyone.  During the second quarter, our portfolio demonstrated a capital efficiency we expected from the new asset footprint we built over the last two years.  It also illustrated depth and flexibility as we overcame a major production shut-in.  We're delivering on the commitments we set forward in our Investor Conference in New York earlier this year.  During that meeting, if you recall, we laid out our expectations for production, free cash flow, capital spending, reserve adds and cost structure, and we're on target to meet or exceed each of these objectives by year end.  Starting with sales volumes for the quarter, Independence Hub was shut-in a month longer than we initially expected when we last updated you.  And we're still able to meet our overall volume guidance for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>If the issues with the export pipeline at Independence Hub had been resolved in May, as assumed in the guidance we provided at that time, we would been at the high side of our guidance for the quarter.  Three areas in particular enabled us to overcome the challenges associated with the Independence Hub; the Rockies and the Southern divisions and our oil-producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico.  These areas generated a million barrels equivalent above their forecasted volumes.  Our commitment to realize double-digit annual production growth in the Rockies remains on track.  Our tight gas play in Greater Natural Buttes area of the Uinta Basin and our coalbed methane operations in the Powder River Basin each generated more than 10% sequential growth over the prior quarter.  We continue to set daily production records in both areas.  Greater Natural Buttes achieved 300 million cubic feet per day and the Powder River Basin surpassed 400 million cubic feet per day of gross operated production.</p>
          <p>Our midstream build-out in the Powder River Basin continues with the startup of the Big George line, which freed up 75 million cubic feet per day.  The final phase of the Fort Union Gas Gathering System also was completed.  The system now has total capacity of 1.3 billion cubic feet per day.  Additionally, we enhanced our capital efficiencies through improvements in our cycle times.  During the quarter, we reduced the number of days it takes to drill a well and mobilized a rig to another location in nearly all of our onshore areas.  For example, in the Carthage area, our vertical rig program realized an average decrease of two drilling days per well.</p>
          <p>In Wattenberg, we improved cycle times by one full day and expect further improvements this year.  The momentum achieved with onshore production in the first half of 2008 allows us to reaffirm our full-year production guidance of 207 million to 212 million barrels of oil equivalent.  As I stated in the earnings release, I am very pleased with the amount of free cash flow our operations generated in the second quarter.  For the first six months of 2008, our free cash flow generation has been nearly $2 billion.  We've further improved our financial flexibility as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.  For the quarter, we reduced total debt by approximately $700 million from cash on hand, proceeds from property divestitures, and the IPO at our midstream MLP, Western Gas Partners.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were within guidance at approximately $1.2 billion, and our reserve adds are on target for the year.  We expect our total capital spending, including expensed exploration, to be in the range of 4.9 to $5.1 billion, which is anticipated to add more than 250 barrels of proved reserves.  Our full year guidance on an improving cost structure also remains on course.  LOE was below the low end of our guidance, and G&amp;A was in line with our expectations for the quarter.  We are maintaining our guidance going forward for these areas in spite of mounting inflationary pressures.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to highlight some of our operations beginning with our international activities.  Offshore Ghana, we anticipate sanctioning the Jubilee field later this year.  During the second quarter, we increased the field's estimated recoverable resources to a range of 500 million to 1.8 billion barrels of high-quality crude oil.  This estimate is more than double the prior low side and almost double the high side projection as well.  We've increased the resource estimates following drill stem tests in the upper and lower zones of the successful Mahogany Number 2 appraisal well.  Each zone flowed at a rate of about 5,000 barrels per day, despite equipment and facility constraints.</p>
          <p>The partnership also is preparing to award contracts for some of the long lead items, such as the FPSO and subsea equipment, as we work toward initial production in 2010.  We expect to have two rigs active in the area later this year with another two rigs contracted in 2009 and beyond to continue with our exploration, appraisal, and development programs.  We have now expanded our opportunity set along this emerging Ghana-like deepwater Cretaceous trend offshore West Africa by recently acquiring positions in five new blocks, offshore Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p>
          <p>Moving across the Atlantic, we relocated the Deepwater Millennium drillship from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil during the quarter, and are currently drawing our first operated pre-salt prospect called Wahoo on Block 30 in the Campos Basin.  Once we complete drilling operations of the Wahoo prospect, we plan to move the Millennium drillship to the Esp&#xED;rito Santo Basin and re-enter the Serpa prospect.  As we previously reported, the initial Serpa test was suspended before reaching its primary objective due to insufficient rig capacity.  We encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands prior to suspension and are encouraged by the potential of our targeted deeper primary objective.</p>
          <p>Once we complete the Serpa well, we plan to continue to our pre-salt program Offshore Brazil by drilling two additional exploration commitment wells.  In moving the Millennium to Brazil, we've built enough flexibility in the rig schedule to position us to potentially farm into other Brazilian opportunities as we've done previously in the Gulf of Mexico and Ghana.</p>
          <p>First crossing the Atlantic again and coming around South Africa, in Mozambique, we completed the largest 3D seismic acquisition in the company's history.  It covered more than 3,000 square kilometers in the Offshore Rovuma Basin.  We expect to drill our first offshore well in 2009 and are currently acquiring seismic for our Onshore Mozambique acreage as well.</p>
          <p>Turning to our activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to drill the Sturgis North prospect in Atwater Valley Block 138 and the Anadarko-operated Shenandoah Lower Tertiary prospect in the Walker Ridge area.  Both are detailed in our operations report.  In the third quarter, we expect to spud the Anadarko-operated Heidelberg prospect in the Green Canyon area, which is on trend with the Tonga West discovery.  We hold a 44% working interest in Heidelberg.</p>
          <p>We also anticipate drilling the Vito prospect in Mississippi Canyon during the third quarter.  Vito will target a Miocene objective.  We also operate this well with a 20% working interest.  We're currently drilling three appraisal wells in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico.  The first is in our K2 field.  The GC562 #4 is an up dip sidetrack to the successful GC561, which was discussed in the first quarter conference call.</p>
          <p>We've made significant progress in this well in the last few days and are encouraged by the results to-date.  The sidetrack well has enhanced our understanding of the area and has extended the pay sections of four new sands.  We anticipate booking reserves this year from this activity.  Additional well operations are being finished along with plans to complete this well for initial production in mid-2009.  We also anticipate making a recommendation to the partners for the optimal enhanced oil recovery program in this large field by yearend. The second appraisal well that currently is drilling is within the Caesar-Tonga complex and the third is an appraisal to our Mission Deep discovery.</p>
          <p>Onshore in the US, Anadarko's exploration program is being executed within our 1 million acres in emerging shales and other exploration plays.  As an example, we've reached total depth objectives in our first two wells in the Marcellus Shale in Central Pennsylvania.  The core data is being analyzed with encouraging results to-date.  We expect to frac and complete these wells during the third quarter.  We hold a 50% interest in approximately 625,000 gross acres in this play, one of the largest acreage positions in the area.  We also have approximately 70,000 net acres held by production in the Haynesville Shale underlying our East Texas acreage.  We expect to conduct up to four tests in the play this year, while testing other plays in our onshore exploration program, including the Maverick, Floyd and Deep Mako shales and in the Wilcox tight sand area.</p>
          <p>Turning to our financial results for the quarter, the capital efficiency of our program is reflected in our substantial discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion compared to capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion.  While we benefited from the rise in commodity prices, we also managed to hold the line on our controllable cash costs for the quarter.  As a result, our free cash flow was sequentially higher than last period and once again provides us with the financial flexibility to comfortably execute upon our business model.  At the end of the second quarter, our total net debt to capitalization was approximately 42%.  As I mentioned, we reduced total debt by a little more than $700 million during the quarter and we believe we will be below 35% net debt to capitalization by year-end.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter net income from continuing operations was $831 million, or $1.76 per diluted share excluding items affecting comparability, which are also disclosed in detail on page 5 of our second quarter earnings release.  We've already talked about volumes for the quarter and are focused on controllable costs.  However, we also want to address DD&amp;A, which was above our guidance.  This was due to the primary well at Red Hawk watering out.  As a result, our DD&amp;A will be higher through the end of this year as remaining volumes are produced.  We see significant potential at Red Hawk and plan further drilling in 2008.  Success in this program should bring DD&amp;A down in 2009.  The supplemental information attached to the earnings release includes additional detail regarding our guidance for the third quarter and full year.  For the third quarter, we expect production to be in the range of 51 to 54 million barrels of oil equivalent, the midpoint of which represents a 13% increase from the third quarter of last year from retained properties.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter production guidance also includes an assumption for weather downtime for potential hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and warm weather effects on production in the Rockies.  We've also included our aggregate derivative positions in the supplemental materials and I want to remind you that we have actively managed our risk in the Rockies with both firm transportation commitments and attractive basis hedges covering approximately 95% of our production in both 2008 and 2009, and about two-thirds of our production in 2010.  This means that we've locked in differentials in a majority of our Rockies production with pricing of Henry Hub less $1.50 per million BTUs this year, Henry Hub less $1.25 in 2009, and Henry Hub less $1.13 in 2010.  Substantial additional take away capacity is expected to be online in the 2010 to 2011 time period.  As announced in the second quarter, we have signed a letter agreement with Northern Border Pipeline Company outlining terms to establish Anadarko as an anchor shipper on their proposed Bison Pipeline Project.  Our commitment to the proposed project is 250 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.  We've also made a commitment for up to an additional 200 million cubic feet per day on the proposed Ruby Pipeline.  Together, these lines would help to ensure our continued production growth from our Rocky Mountain assets.</p>
          <p>With some of the softening we are currently seeing in commodity prices especially in the national gas side, this is a good opportunity to emphasize the robust economics of Anadarko's major US onshore programs, each of which generates at least a 10% rate of return at a $5 NYMEX flat price deck.</p>
          <p>In summary, our portfolio is performing well.  Its capital efficiency is demonstrated by our significant free cash flow generation and its depth was illustrated as the number of areas exceeded expectations, offsetting the Independence Hub challenges and enabling us to deliver production results within guidance.  To repeat, we have reaffirmed the full-year production guidance range of 207 million to 212 million barrels of oil equivalent.  Total capital expenditure guidance range of 4.9 to $5.1 billion including expensed exploration and anticipated reserve adds of more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent, all while continuing to improve our cost structure.</p>
          <p>With that, Annie, we'll open up the lines and field questions from the audience.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Given Anadarko equity is currently priced well below its underlying value of the assets, what do you think it will take to get the market to recognize this and what are some of the steps management might be considering to unlock value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a number of alternatives we'll look at.  I think one is continuing to just perform.  This is obviously a very strange period in the markets.  And I think that continued quarterly performance is the best way to ensure that people pay attention to you and covet the stock.  I think there are some things we can do around a weak market that we'll be considering in light of our generation of free cash flow and our sale &#x2013; pending sale of the, and closing of the Peregrino asset.  And I think that gives us a lot of financial flexibility to look down the road at all the alternatives that that can provide for the shareholder.  And so I think we're actively trying to take a hard look at all of that and believe that performance and a strong balance sheet investment grade rating, but also any alternatives that we can to try to unlock the value are going to be looked at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.  That's helpful.  And you mentioned mounting inflation pressures.  Can you give us an update on what the industry service cost trends are headed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, this is Karl Kurz.  As you know, we continue to see service costs with pressure on them from higher rig counts and the strong commodity price market we've seen in the first half of the year.  This is being led by a lot of the pumping services, rig rates, but also by steel.  Tubular market is extremely tight.  Last year, our supply group entered in some long-term five-year preferred pricing and supply arrangements with a couple of manufacturing mills, which has enabled us to ensure that we can get all the pipe and tubulars and steels that we need at preferred pricing.  So we're seeing a lot of pressure in industry.  Currently, we're seeing some differential value from that, similar to like we've seen in our rig strategy in the deepwater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Karl.  I'll let someone else hop on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Company.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.  You have committed a lot of capital and planning to exploration. Wanted to try to get some additional granularity as you start thinking about the five new blocks offshore West Africa and then some thoughts about resource potential that you're accessing in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, this is Bob Daniels.  The five new blocks that we got, two in Sierra Leone, three in Liberia, we're very excited about them.  We took the information that we learned, the knowledge we got from the Jubilee discovery in Ghana and started looking at that trend and trying to identify other similar play types, similar traps. And there is a 3D that was shot on the Sierra Leone blocks that identified a very high quality prospect, and it's drill-ready.  So we plan on, actually in 2009, drilling the well in Sierra Leone.  Meanwhile, we'll be shooting 3D down in the Liberian blocks to see whether or not the play extends down into those.  2D data indicates that it does, so we're very pleased to have that.  The prospect size, the target sizes there would be very similar to what we're looking at at the Jubilee area.  We think that this is a prolific area with two different basins that have the same source rock, same depositional system, same structural style, and we think that we've just unlocked the key to identifying these different plays.  So we will continue to try to capture more opportunities along this margin that have the same quality that Ghana does.</p>
          <p>Don't forget, also, that the two blocks that we have in Ghana, we see tremendous additional exploration opportunities there.  We've drilled four wells to-date.  We've had success at all of them, three in the Jubilee complex, one was a step-out at Odum, which was a different target, a younger age sand, but the same depositional style.  And we think we've got about between six and nine more wells, exploratory wells, to drill on those two blocks for targets that could be as small as the satellite like at Odum to standalone prospects as big as the Jubilee complex.  So we're very excited about the opportunities we see on those two blocks and the whole margin there of West Africa.</p>
          <p>As we move into Brazil, we're looking and focusing on the pre-salt.  We're drilling the Wahoo prospect presently, and then we'll go back to the Serpa, both pre-salt objectives.  And we think in both the Campos and Esp&#xED;rito Santos Basin that we have very good pre-salt prospectivity on our blocks, and the target sizes there are in the multi-hundred million barrel range and could be far more significant than that.  We'll have to get down and see what it looks like.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In response to one of the earlier questions when you were speaking of things you can do in a weak market with free cash flow, I just wanted to clarify whether you were referring to share repurchase, acquisitions, or both and when you think about your net debt to capital ratio, what do you think is a good target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's definitely one of the options we're looking at given the, how attractive the NAV is.  I think the thing that is a focus for us at the same time is how to make sure that we don't lose investment grade rating.  So we've got to get all that worked through the system, but at today's values for all these large cap E&amp;P companies, it's just &#x2013; it's stunning what they are trading at relative to their NAV.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then I guess on, going to back to Ghana, what are your latest thoughts in terms of production rates from Jubilee, and how the rate and timing could change if you end up at the upper end of your guidance range versus the lower end of your guidance range in terms of resource potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Brian, this is Chuck.  We sized the initial FPSO for 120,000 barrels of oil a day.  We anticipate ramping up to that rate during the Phase I development activities which will begin in 2010.  And depending on how large it turns out to be, we could actually add additional equipment out there to double that rate if it became necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How &#x2013; and lastly, how I guess, did the 2010 period, when in 2010 should we expect the facility to startup and how confident are you in the timing of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are gunning for the second half of 2010.  Of course, we are just starting this project.  We still have a lot of approvals to go from the Ghana government.  And so, there is some uncertainty on it, but as we sit here today, we're gunning for the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I might add that there is a lot of alignment between the partners and the government to accelerate this project.  So, while we have issues with the government, we expect those to be get done very quickly.  This is their first major discovery, and they'd like to see it online very fast.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning everyone.  Jim, can you give us some more clarification around the timing on Wahoo versus Serpa.  When you expect that Wahoo down and then move over to Serpa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David if I can answer that, at Wahoo, we've still got significant amount of drilling to go.  We are drilling right now, but we're at the top salt casing point.  So we've got to get through the salt and then through our pre-salt section.  So, I would anticipate we're 45 to 60 days away from the end of that well.  And then we'll move on to Serpa, so that would make it late third quarter maybe even into the fourth quarter before we'd see results from Serpa.  Of course, Serpa, we're re-entering the well bore that we abandoned earlier and just deepening that well because we were unable to get to our primary objective with the equipment we had the first time</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning, everybody.  I think you folks lowered your CapEx budget midpoint by $350 million for the full year.  Could you talk about that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe.  When we talk -- this is Colglazier.  When we talk about our capital budget, we also throw in the cash portion of the exploration that gets expensed, which is predominantly seismic.  So, when you look at the capital range that we have and add in the cash portion of the exploration expense, you get to the 4.9 to 5.1 billion, which we established back in our investor call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, gotcha, okay.  Appreciate that.  And then on Independence Hub, I know after that shut-in for more than 50 days, last week, it was down for some maintenance.  Could you talk about the reason why folks had to do maintenance out there?  And then are there any design issues that you're concerned about with Independence Hub?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Chuck again, Joe.  The flex joint was what we was shut-in originally for.  We have a scheduled maintenance, or planned maintenance, that we're undergoing now which was inclusive of reevaluating and expecting that flex joint.  And what we decided to do was go ahead and do a retorquing of the bolts to ensure that their integrity was there, and that is underway right now.  Unfortunately, while we were doing that, we have this, or when Enterprise was doing that we had the tropical storm emerge and it has set us back a couple of days, but there is no design issues with the system.  We're just verifying its integrity and moving on down the road.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And Chuck, when would you expect it, assuming storm is blowing through when would you expect Independence Hub to be back on line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're on the backside of the storm at the Hub now.  So, we're going back to work, and we probably have one or two days of additional work remaining and then it should come back on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good.  And then Deep Haley, I noticed that Deep Haley was down sequentially production wise.  I think you've got &#x2013; you focused with Chesapeake to have eight rigs running.  Can you talk about your expectations for Deep Haley going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The field is performing well.  We've built some great wells there recently.  We've downscaled the rigs between us and Chesapeake a bit just to accommodate our land position and the play, but it's performing well quarter-on-quarter.  We go up and down, but it's been strong performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, this is Karl, you will see an increase probably in the third quarter versus second quarter because like Chuck mentioned, it's a statistical play.  We get streaks out there, and it's our baseball field.  We get hot hitters and the Mendoza line hits us every now and then, but lately, we've been hitting over .500.  We've got three or four wells that have come on the last two months, they are just barnburner wells.  So you'll see that volume increase over the second quarter once we report third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, got you.  And then in looking at what different areas of your portfolio made up for the shortfall from Independence Hub, it looks like your CBM did particularly well, looks like Gulf of Mexico was flat outside of Independence Hub.  Can you kind of just talk, going forward, what are the particular areas that you expect to shine or really kind of, to grow more than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're really excited about the CBM activity that we've had.  We've set daily production records out there regularly.  As Jim mentioned, we just expanded the Fort Union Gas Gathering System, which gives us a lot of additional space, and we'll be ramping up to fill that space just shortly.  We've seen great performance out of the Big George coals, and they give us a lot of encouragement that we could continue to set production records for a long time.  The other is Greater Natural Buttes.  We've seen a production record in the Buttes as well recently of over 300 million cubic feet gross operated.  Our net production is moving up over 10% quarter-on-quarter.  We've really drilled some fantastic wells, and we just now are completing the sort of the final legs of the infrastructure that allows us to evacuate that area.  So, those two areas alone will do a good job of boosting our production quarter-on-quarter for a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me tag team with Chuck on that one too because we're seeing great performance down in the East Tyler County area of the Chalk.  We're seeing performance in the Carthage and Bossier and some of the areas that Jim mentioned in his opening comments.  We've &#x2013; as you mentioned, we've cored a couple of wells in the Marcellus.  We'll be drilling four more wells up there, and we're very encouraged with what we've seen to-dat.  And then I'd also note Chuck has four wells planned in the Haynesville for the rest of this year.  I think three are probably vertical wells, maybe one horizontal well.  So, all those areas get us pretty excited about what we have to look forward to in the second half of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in the Rockies, are there any limiting factors there, like just, are you limited in your ability to grow until the region gets some more takeaway capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel pretty good about our takeaway capacity position from both a firm transport and also from a, handling the basis differential through some financial hedges.  One of the benefits we've picked up from the Western acquisition was their marketing group which is, I mean they are crack on top of the Rockies market, and they provided a lot of value for us on making sure we get our gas moved.  They also have a great little presence there on a local market.  So, when you look at our volumes versus what has to go out, we are able to sell a lot of our gas locally there in the Basin which gives us a little bit of advantage.  When you look at the constraint possibilities going forward, and as Jim mentioned, that's why we've signed up for capacity in both Ruby and Bison.  And we're working very diligent with those pipeline companies to ensure those projects stay on time to get them in as early as possible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.  And then lastly, with Ghana, when would you expect some additional delineation results to really kind of delineate how wide the field is, and then when would you expect results from some of these other fields in, either in &#x2013; in those two blocks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob again.  Excuse me. We are expecting to have some more rigs coming.  Two rigs come in the end of the year and then two more in 2009, and that's really going to kick off all of the activity in the blocks.  The continued appraisal, development drilling, and some of those will be drilling the exploration wells.  So I would start looking for kind of a pretty consistent flow of information coming out of there starting in the first quarter of next year based on the two rigs that come late this year.</p>

          <p>And your next question is a follow-up from the line of David Heikkinen.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.  Just thinking a little bigger picture, the industry is clearly in natural gas growth mode.  You talked about efficiency of drilling more wells per rig.  You've got increase in capital budgets.  You're drilling emerging resource plays.  But investors are reacting pretty negatively to growth and kind of voting with their wallets right now.  How do you think about the amount of gas growth that's going on in the Lower 48 versus demand and kind of the industry just continuing to ramp forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that we obviously feel good about now is the hedges we have placed that extend through the rest of 2008 and 2009.  We thought that the run up to $12 plus was potentially a temporary phenomenon.  We like where onshore production is going because, David, other than having a very mild winter, I think we're going to need the production personally.  I don't view this market as being a bearish long-term market.  I think that obviously a lot &#x2013; there are several players out there who think this thing could really get weak through the course of the early part of next year.  But I think with where LNG imports are at, with where other sources of production are, absent kind of one-time events we've had this year, with Independence Hub when it's up and running strong and with REX, are ones that won't continue to be strong adders.</p>
          <p>So, I &#x2013; my personal belief is the onshore production is an important element when we've got export industries growing and we've got power generation growing.  And our view is that if you're somewhere in the 7.50 to $9 range for the next year, I think it starts going up from there.  There are a lot of reasons for that, whether it's global climate change, whether it's the demand that is occurring from natural sources right now from current uses of natural gas.  And I think it's going to get tougher as you go to continue to have these kind of growth rates personally with kind of decline rates you've seen on commercial resources.</p>
          <p>And I think people are tending to overestimate how much gas you can actually, and infrastructure you can put in place and how quickly in some of these resource plays, so that when we talk about Haynesville and how great it's going to be, it's obviously looking like a fabulous reservoir.  Same with Marcellus, it looks like a fabulous reservoir so far.  But these things take time to put in place and the service industry isn't equipped yet to be there in a big way.  The pipeline infrastructure, while it's there in parts and in some ways has to be enhanced significantly, and I just don't think it happens as quickly as everybody is fearing it might from the standpoint of being bearish about gas prices.  That's just our view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And kind of thinking about then, where do you think from an Anadarko portfolio standpoint, where is your marginal basin and what's the marginal cost of gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the things that is an advantage is that we basically stepped out two years ago and created the growth that we wanted from the onshore unconventional resource area augmented by what we do in the meantime because we not only spent a bunch of money starting in 2005 on onshore shale plays, some of which I mentioned, in terms of the Floyd Shale and down in the Maverick Basin area, but also with the acquisitions we did in both the tight gas sands area and then Powder River Coal Basin back in 2006 is that we, I think anticipated a bit of where this market was going.  And as a result, we bought in resources that what, at that time, people I think criticized us a bit for.</p>
          <p>I think today, we'd look very favorably upon, especially as we're rolling some of those probables, but even on the proved reserve costs, we bought those in at $20 a barrel.  And we're tickled to death we went and did that several years ago.  So that our economics, as I mentioned in the conference call, stand a really low test in terms of NYMEX pricing down to the $5 level.  You don't need 8 or $9 gas to make returns on the assets we built.  I don't think the industry necessary sits in that position, and that's why I think it will be fairly self-correcting.  We tested this before one time and never got down to what people feared we would.  I think we'll, if it gets to that point, I think we'll have a very quick response back up again as some of these incremental plays go off for the industry.  But I think Anadarko is in a very preferred position based on some bold moves I think we took back in 2006.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you wouldn't care to comment on any of the assets that you sold that did have higher costs and maybe not as good of economics of where those prices would be.  I'm just trying to think about where rigs would go first.  I mean, you had a pretty good look at the market over the last two years of buying and selling assets that you could help us out a little bit with?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Jim, you mentioned a couple of times that you would add with your capital budget, you'd add 250 million barrels of new reserves.  Could you comment on, of that 250 million, how much is from drilling up the low-risk resource stuff versus from the new discoveries that you've made over the last couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gil, this is Al.  I would say the 250, we'd refer to at least being 250, so don't think of it as a hard stop at 250.  The other thing, as we look at where we believe it's going to come from, as we've told you before, most of our production reserve replacements from very low risk sources, primarily from our probable inventory.  So, it's not with a lot of exploration success that production's being replaced or that reserves are being grown.  As the bookings that will come from Ghana and from others, successes like Caesar-Tonga, but those will work through this year and into future years, but largely that 250 plus number is coming from very low risk sources of inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, right.  So the, those, the true exploration wells, or projects are really upside to that, largely upside to that 250?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, and that was always the view we had about the strategy.  And as you recall, we sold off some of our nearer-term reserve adds as part of the restructuring.  You've got kind of these tweeners like a K2 well that had a little bit of reserve this year which is a great answer because it was originally designed as an appraisal well or a delineation well and we get some, if you will, exploration adds in the &#x2013; at the end of the day which is a high class answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that transitions into my second question which is just that you have sold some of these early-stage prospects, pre-bookings.  And given that your balance sheet is in a better place today than it was a year ago, what is your propensity to sell additional early-stage discoveries versus keeping them in-house and developing it to fruition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view on that is that we may periodically do that for a variety of reasons, but I don't think it'll be something that we do on a consistent basis.  We -- most of what we sold was directly related to the restructuring effort.  But you may occasionally see us sell early-stage asset.  I think that Peregrino is a good example is that we just saw a very compelling price relative to the fact that we had good production growth when that was coming on line.  And we felt relative to the, the technical and marketing issues around that, that that value was a good value.  We think that the party who bought it from us is going to do very well in it.  But we also like the that fact it accelerated our balance sheet restoration and gave us more capital flexibility to put things in nearer-term, higher margin prospects and development opportunities.  And we had -- we had things like Jubilee and West Tonga coming on.  And so, we had the luxury of doing that, but I don't think you'll see that being anything but a periodic type event as opposed to a consistent part of the strategy.  And it just happens to validate the inventory which is kind of handy too every once a while.</p>

        <plist>

And so, we are keeping close contact with them.  But I would say that they're trying to get the, the main activity for them has been in the Santos here recently.  They've been pulling the rigs down into that which leaves the Campos and Esp&#xED;rito Santos short of rigs and we've got the Millennium.

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of quick follow-ups.  My understanding is that portions of the Campos Basin which have more of a fragmented salt which lowers some of the exploratory risk a little bit versus a basin like the Santos.  Can you comment on that all?  And the targets you're chasing after, how would you characterize those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Bob again.  The difference between the Campos and the Santos is that the Santos does seem to have pervasive continuous salt whereas in the Campos, it's been more mobilized and you have what they call salt windows or breaks in the salt.  Now the reason that you have such a prolific production in the Campos is because those breaks in the salt is what allowed the hydrocarbons to migrate from the pre-salt source through the ultimate seal, which was the salt, through those windows and into the post-salt section.  And that what's the historic production in the Campos has been.</p>

And when you start exploring for the pre-salt in the Campos, you have to pay attention to what your seal is and what the migration routes are.  And the prospects that we're drilling presently in the Campos have good salt cover over them.  We think that would have maintained the integrity of the trap below it, and therefore trap the hydrocarbons.  And of course Petrobras has drilled numerous sub-salt wells up in the Campos, improved the hydrocarbon system there.  They tested 10,000 barrels a day in an adjacent block to our Wahoo prospect.  So, we know the pre-salt works up there.  It's just making sure that you've got the adequate trap and the seal from the salt that will maintain the integrity of the pre-salt objective.</p>

          <p>All right, that's good.  Thanks for the color.  And then one more detailed follow-up question.  Just looking at the balance sheet, can you guys comment a little bit on the swing in the working cap, the accrued derivative liability and some of the changes there on the quarter?</p>

          <p>David, this is Al.  That's really more related to the cash that's being used for the derivatives where we've got cash collateral requirements.  As those cash requirements are reduced by the forward drop in commodity curves, a lot of that cash will come back to us, and a substantial amount will come back through the course of the third quarter on those unrealized losses that were incurred during the second quarter.  Where we had cash collateral issues, we reshaped and restructured a lot of those with our counterparties during the quarter.  And as a result, you're going to see through year-end a lot of the cash that was sequestered into those collateral accounts coming back to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Yeah.  So, in a nutshell, that should be reversed assuming commodity prices stay let's say where they're at, that should be reversed over the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks Al.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Dennis Coleman with Banc of America Securities.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, thank you.  If we can just stick with the balance sheet here, I just want to clarify couple of details of what we're talking about.  My understanding is you said that you're targeting 35% debt-to-cap from I think 42% right now.  And I just want to understand exactly what you're including in that, and particularly the note to the, on the midstream, if that's included. And to get to 35%, I guess you're talking about roughly a couple of billion dollars of net debt reduction.  And is that net debt reduction or is it debt repayment.  How are we getting to 35%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a good question and it's not that complicated an answer.  The largest and primary driver of that debt reduction will be the proceeds from the Peregrino sale, and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question or clarifying question around what is in the 42%, that is a total debt which will include the midstream monetization note.  And when we talk about getting to 35% or below by yearend, again that's a total number largely driven by the proceeds from not only Peregrino, but the fact that we probably will have substantial free cash flow over the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So it's, those proceeds will be used for debt reduction or it's cash and so we are talking about a net number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will be cash that will come into us at closing that will then in turn be used for debt reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Got it, got it.  Okay, thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Thanks everybody for joining us.  Again, we're proud of what we delivered through the first half of 2008.  We think the quality and depth of our portfolio is definitely being demonstrated and we expect to continue building on the momentum we've established through the first six months of this year and deliver on the growth and commitments we've made to our stakeholders.  So thanks and have a great day.  Bye.</p>
