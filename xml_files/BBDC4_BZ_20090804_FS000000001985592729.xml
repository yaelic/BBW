          <p>Thank you. Welcome to Bradesco's second quarter 2009 conference call. Before transferring the call to Mr. Trabuco, I would like to add that Mr. Marco Rossi, CEO of our Insurance Group and Marcos Galengi, Accounting Superintendent, are also participating in this event. Let me now transfer the floor to Mr. Trabuco.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It is a pleasure for me to meet you. And I will focus on the first eight slides and after that my colleague, Abreu, is going to continue to explanation about our performance.</p>
          <p>First of all, it's worth to mention that we are very optimistic about the Brazilian economy and about the measures implemented by the government. Brazil improved its economy, but more than that it improved the quality of the life of the million of Brazilians as one can see by the looking at the evolution of our human development index.</p>
          <p>In this context, our net income surpassed R$4 billion in the first half of 2009, a 2.8% increase compared to the same period of 2008. In the second quarter, we almost reported a R$2.3 billion of net income, 14.7% higher than in the second quarter of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Banking represented 65% of our net income; insurance fee and pension, 35%. Despite the fact that Brazil has been experiencing very strong declines in the base rate, our net interest income grew by almost 27%. Total assets surpassed the 480 billion mark, a solid 20% jump over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>In this slide, one can we see the expansion of loan of 18% over the last 12 months. The delinquency ratio deteriorated to 4.6%, in line to our expectation. Our coverage ratio increased in the quarter and stands now higher than before the beginning of the crisis.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, we increased our addition provisions by R$1.3 billion. Our Basel ratio give us a plenty potential to process loan growth for the coming year. Our cost-to-income ratio improved even more and it stands now at 42%. Our aim is to reach 37 to 38% over the coming five years. In terms of efficiency for the insurance group, we reached a combined ratio of 85.5%. It's a very sound ratio.</p>
          <p>In the other slide, I would like to emphasize Bradesco's strategy. We are a strong believer that Brazil has a fantastic potential for banking and insurance clients. And Bradesco is present all over the country, which is very comprehensively branched and the ATM networks. One, on the top of that is Bradesco's position is enhanced by additional networks from the postal services, retailers, stores, dealers and others.</p>
          <p>To give you an idea, by Bradesco covering 93% of the Brazilian territory, we have a customer base of more than 42 million individual and company. We follow the bank insurance business model that focus all the social categories, although our main focus are the lower income classes.</p>
          <p>We seek to provide quality services, a wide array of products and correct pricing. Improve the operational efficiency in our mantra, but we know that we have still a lot of homework to do, even more when we see the stronger and stronger competition in the marketplace. We believe that improvement in efficiency will mean maximization of profitability and we'll be rewarded by shareholders, investors and the analysts.</p>
          <p>In the other slide, we are showing two events which occurred, but we already had informed the market through press releases. The acquisition of Banco ibi is still pending on the approval of authorities, but focus on increasing our client bases, through serving customers of the C&amp;A retail chain. This view was our active strategy. We see success as we already partnered with the retail chain at Caja Madrid, Lojas Esplanada, Colombo, Luigi Bertolli, Grupo G. Barbosa, Drogalview, Hipotecario and others.</p>
          <p>The VisaNet deal is considered as Brazil's largest IPO. We sold part of our participation in second quarter and part in third quarter in the green shoots.</p>
          <p>In the other slide, we are including some reasons we highlighted to explain our belief in Brazil. Brazil decoupled from emerging markets and is a winner in terms of growth potential over the coming decades. Our economy is self-sufficient, with solid corporate governance and a young population. The Brazilian central bank has been ahead of the curve, controlled by an independent management and a strong and tight monitor policy. For these reasons, inflation is under control.</p>
          <p>Loans. Loans are growing, but they are still low as percentage of GDP. Mortgage is in its beginning and the interest rate are at their lowest rate ever.</p>
          <p>Finalizing, it is always worth to highlight that our top priority is Brazil. And we believe that Bradesco's position is unique and should capture very solid growth potential over the coming years. The road might be bumpy, but we have plenty capital, a fantastic distribution, millions of clients and incomparable staff solely dedicated to meet our targets.</p>
          <p>The second half of 2009 will be much better than the first half. Our expectation is for Brazil to grow its GDP by almost 5% in 2010, and for the coming years up 4 to 5% GDP growth in our <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>I would like to ask Mr. Abreu, our Executive Vice President, to explain the Bradesco numbers. Thank you. Abreu, Please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. First of all, I'd like to say that we had reduced the number of slides in this quarter presentation in order to focus more time to Q&amp;A session, although other slides that we normally show have been updated and are available as an attachment at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Starting from the slide nine, our net income in the second quarter reached almost R$2.3 billion, totaling a net income of more than R$4 billion in the first half of the year. It's worth pointing out that this result includes some extraordinary items, in particular the gains derived from the partial sale of our stake in VisaNet, totaling R$2 billion gross of tax and a constitution of additional provisions for loan losses totaling R$1.3 billion also gross of tax.</p>
          <p>Considering tax effects, these two factors impact positively our results by around R$560 million on both the second quarter and first half results. It's also worth mentioning that provisions for economic plans were booked in the second quarter in the amount of R$241 million, R$66 million higher than 175 million of the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The cost to income ratio accumulated over the 12-month period stood at 42% in the quarter, 70 basis points better than in the previous period, essentially due to increase in fees and net interest income.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share also recorded an improvement as we report an EPS of R$2.52. I would like to emphasize that all information present in this material considers the reclassification disclosed to the market in the beginning of July.</p>
          <p>The slide ten shows that the total assets would surpass R$482 billion, presenting a one year-on-year increase of 20% <mark type="inaudible" /> variation over the first two quarters. Return on average asset stood at 1.7% and return on average equity reached 27.7%, higher than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first half level return on asset came to 23.7%. The capital adequacy ratio moved up by 1 percentage points in the quarter, reaching 70%, due to this quarter net income and the additional provision for our loan loss. This sound level of capitalization gives us a very comfortable position to support expected loan book growth in the coming years without depending on additional capital increase.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 give us a breakdown of Bradesco's net income, not considering additional provision and the effect of the VisaNet investment. In the quarterly comparison, the highlight is the recovery of the relative share of fees and loan, while in the six month comparison one can see the reduction in the relative share of loans due to increased delinquency and provision, and increased relative share of securities due to the good performance of our treasury.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, we would like to call your attention to the growth of our unrealized gains that moved up to R$8.6 billion in this quarter, thanks to the good performance of the market conditions, especially equities and real interest rates, and inclusion of our remaining stake in VisaNet which contributes with around R$6.4 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we show our income from interest earnings in grey and non-interest earnings in red in both the quarter and six month comparison. You can see expansion in non-interest result, essentially due to higher gains from our position, thanks to our treasurer's correct position.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows our net interest income from interest earning operations. We have recorded constant loan growth over the last ten quarters, although the NIM contracted by more than 100 basis points since the beginning of 2007. We believe this trend will continue in the middle and long terms &#x2013; will continue in the mid to long term. In other words, the net interest income will continue to move up thanks to the growing business volume, but strong reduce is likely in terms of NIM. The upturn in the quarter from 7 to 7.3% can be attributed to lower growth in weighted assets and the change in the mix of portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 gives a breakdown of the net interest income. The highlight here is the consistent growth of spreads in both the year-over-year and the quarter-over-quarter comparison.</p>
          <p>Next to the high average volume of operation and the improved mix of the portfolio. Income from funding recorded an important gain over the last 12 months due to the higher volume and the quarterly reduction was due to the decline in the Selic rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 gives a summary of our loan operations. Just to remind you, the grey line represents net interest income on loans before provisions. The red line represents the total loans allocated to provisions for loan losses. And the blue line, the difference between the first two ones, represents the effective gain from the loan operation in the respective quarters.</p>
          <p>Please note that we have not in this graph additional provisions. Although the margin after provisions moved up slightly in the second quarter of 2009, it has maintained the first quarter's trend of a strong reduction over the previous quarters, showing that they grow in the gross interest income, but not sufficient to observe the upturn in delinquencies. We expect the economic scenario in this environment to improve in the second half of the year. So we expect a trend of gradual improvement in interest income net of provision.</p>
          <p>We'd now like to go over our total loan portfolio shown on slide 17 with around R$213 billion in June '09, increasing by 18% or by R$32.6 billion vis-&#xE0;-vis the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>In this field, new borrowers, individuals and companies who did not have loans with Bradesco in June '08 account around R$21 billion. The total portfolio balance remained flat over the previous quarter, which has a slight increase in loans to individuals and SMEs and a 1.5% reduction in loans to large corporates, mainly due to the impact of the improved valuation of the real vis-&#xE0;-vis the US dollar on dollar denominated or dollar indexed loans.</p>
          <p>We believe that the expected strong economies will recover in the second half. We will generate stronger demand for loan and then a positive impact in our books resulting in an annual growth in a range of 8 to 12%.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the level of coverage of our provisions regarding expected losses. Firstly, I would like to say that as of May of 2009, we made certain general reclassifications and began considering some portfolios relating to credit card operations and loan operation in order to prevent distortion in this product &#x2013; the analysis of these curves.</p>
          <p>We adjusted all our previous figures as according to the reclassification, which will be concluded shortly. Until now, we haven't made the necessary adjustments from the first quarter of 2007, which is why on this slide and in the next, you see a separation occurs consequently the figures between March '07 and June '09 are comparable, but are not comparable with those prior to March '07.</p>
          <p>The first line in red represents total provisions devised by the loan portfolio. It should be noted the increase in this quarter was mainly due to the constitution of the additional provision that we already mentioned.</p>
          <p>The second line, the grey one corresponds to the mandatory provisions required by the Central Bank of Brazil. The difference between the first two lines indicates the next set of provisions of R$3 billion in this quarter. The fourth line represents the percentage of effective loss, which even though moved up slightly in the quarter, have been recording a strong correlation with the green line, which represents non-performing loan.</p>
          <p>Based on these historic trends, we can assume that our write-offs will represent around 5.1% in one year for now, indicating a real excess of provision equivalent to 2.6% of the portfolio or R$4.7 billion, allowing us to comfortably overcome any eventual difficulties in our next quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we show our delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days. As expected, the total delinquency ratio in this quarter rose to 4.6%. As you can see, individuals and SME segments were responsible for this asset quality deterioration. Bradesco constantly monitored its provision and expected loss by loan segment, always seeking to keep its provision at high levels. We believe the ratio might be still increased likely in the next quarter, then stabilize or even have a small reduction by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows the behavior of short-term delinquencies between 61 and 90 days. As you can see, the ratios begin to move up as of December '08, then is lowered and even stabilize from February 2009.</p>
          <p>Thanks to <mark type="inaudible" /> until now plus signs of improvement of the Brazilian economy, we are confident that the worst is over. However, as we previously mentioned, delinquencies of more than 90 days will continue to deteriorate into the third quarter, probably reaching 4.9%.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 21, fees increased by 6.9% in the quarter, mainly due to the higher gains from capital market operations, such as brokerage and underwriting fees, highlighting the VisaNet IPO. Additionally, consortium, asset management and credit cards also performed well this quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding personnel expenses shown on slide 22, the increase compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to the high concentration of vacations in the first quarter. When personnel expense are usually lower, the year-over-year raise is explained by the organic growth process plus the wage increase established in the agreement with the Union of Bank Employees.</p>
          <p>Anyway, it's worth noting that the operational expenses to total assets ratio continued to record a decline in the six-month comparison, even with the inauguration of 213 conventional branches and 676 advanced service brands over the last 12 months, showing the management's effort to improve efficiency.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, the breakdown of administrative expenses show that increase of 3.6 in the quarter or of 70, R$80 million is mainly due to a constitution of R$61 million in provision for credit card millage recorded in the other expense line.</p>
          <p>On the six-month comparison, the increase in the first half was due to the expansion of the service network and the higher volume of our operations as well as investments in the IT improvement projects designed to optimize the technological platform, including the replacement of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Happy news for insurance premiums, product plans and the saving bonds moved up by 10% in the quarter, totaling R$6 billion. We're talking about slide 24. Life insurance, pension plans and saving bonds were chiefly responsible for the upturn.</p>
          <p>These revenues represent a 24 share of the Brazilian market and that enabled us to keep the leadership position in the private pension plan and the property and life insurance segment.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows the stark evolution of the combined ratio, which reflects the operational efficiency of Bradesco's insurance group. You may see an improvement in the quarter, mainly due to the claims reduction in autos.</p>
          <p>Bradesco's macroeconomic outlook for 2009 and 2010 regarding GDP, interest rate, inflation rate and the US dollar exchange rate are shown in the slide 26. We call your attention to the GDP projection for 2010, when we expect a growth of 4.9%.</p>
          <p>We present on slide 27 the revised guidance considering the macroeconomic scenario and due to this environment experience in this first half and the outlook for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the most significant change we expect is the loan book growth, which performed weakly in the first half mainly due to a strong reduction in credit demand. The expected recovery of the economy in the second half of the year, let's be truly confident that <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Well, I would like to emphasize that the challenges facing this first half of 2009 were not few. And even so, we believe that we delivered good performance thanks to our solid balance sheet, the strength of our staff and the confidence of our comprehensive client base.</p>
          <p>A good performance of our treasury in the trading in the last two quarters helped us compensate the impact of increased credit provision expense caused by the upturn in delinquencies. We have noticed strong and consistent signs that show that the worst from the crisis has already passed, not only globally, but also the effect in the domestic market.</p>
          <p>Brazil's economy is particularly in privileged position, as for the first time we have the opportunity to live with the lowest ever interest rate, both in real and nominal terms without any inflationary pressure. All these factors together will certainly impact positively on the domestic economy. <mark type="inaudible" /> perform its important role in fostering production and consumption.</p>
          <p>Insurance and pension plan activities, where we are extremely well positioned, will surely also be benefit in this new economic phase. We have a significant client base to whom we combine and offer <mark type="inaudible" /> product mix, a solid cost base, and an excellent distribution network for all segments we work with.</p>
          <p>It lets us face the future with much confidence and optimism. Thank you very much. And I will now ask you to open the floor for your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on &#x2013; for 2010, you're forecasting 4.9% GDP growth. What &#x2013; I know you just changed your guidance for 2009, but if I may, for 2010, what do you think the business growth in that scenario? In 2008, for example, the economy grew 5% roughly and you were able to grow loans around 35%. Can we see such a ramp up for 2010? Is that a possibility? What is your current thinking for 2010 volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jorge. It's Jean talking. I would say, if we have an expectation of a GDP growth of some 4.9% in 2010, probably operations loans, for example, should be growing around 20%. I believe it's a little bit difficult to compare with another year where we grew by 5% and we grew 30% because the basis was quite different. The basis of growth in this year is very small. And because of that, I believe that the trend will be more at 20% growth for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. And my second question is, your BIS ratio of 17%, I think it's at the highest level it's ever been. Obviously you know that it's a bad thing to have a big capital ratio in these days, but with a view that you're potentially going to continue to generate around 20% return on equity, I think you need a lot of capital to continue to grow at these levels. Is there anything that you want to do with the excess capital? Is there a possibility for dividend payments or what is your view on what should be kind of like on a normalized basis that BIS ratio, which obviously potentially, eventually becomes a drag on your return on equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, it's Abreu speaking. What we have said is, we are very comfortable, and we understand that we have the generation of new profits, which will be enough to support the growth that we expect. We have some exercise where you consider some potential growth and that for three and five years that we think it's enough to &#x2013; so we don't need &#x2013; we need to increase new capital. That's why we said that. Really we don't think to use this excess capital because you need to understand that we are in the middle &#x2013; the process of Basel II change. We are now working with -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The simplified model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a simplified model, but we are going to go to advanced model. So we need to understand better how if you'll require or not the new platform. So it's a special moment that we need to pay attention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remembering that the loans grew almost nothing and the bank generated profit. And on the top of that, for the calculation of the Basel ratio, you also incorporate the additional provision of 1.3 billion. They helped to increase even more the BIS ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things first. A follow-up on the loan growth question that you answered before. In the past, when the economy grew closer to 5% and you were expanding the loan portfolio significantly in the 30% plus range, a key driver of that loan growth was the consumer loans, and individuals in general. What we've been seeing this year, as your loan growth have been more muted, is that most of the loan growth has been driven by the corporate sector. As you get into next year, if the economy grows 4.9% and your loan growth is more 20% of your guidance, then should we expect individuals to go back to be the key driver, consumer loans in general, because that has important implications for the loan mix and therefore for overall margins and spreads? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>And then question number two, I think Mr. Abreu suggested that we could see some additional increase in the NPL rates of probably no more than 30 basis points in the third quarter and then to stabilize after that. I was surprised, though, by the significant sharp increase in the SME segment in particular. Should we expect SME to stabilize also in the third quarter or may take longer for the SME NPL rates, which is now 4.5% measured in the 90-day plus form. What has driven that sharp increase and will it stabilize in the third quarter and is it too early for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When we are expecting this loan book growth for next year &#x2013; and I believe when we made the revision of the guidance, you probably noticed that corporates were expected to grow more than individuals. And after revising our guidance, we began actually to have the perception that individuals who had already begin to grow a little bit more in this year than in 2000 &#x2013; than in the previous guidance we gave in the beginning of the year. For next year, definitively we're strong believers about the loan book growth for individuals.</p>
          <p>We have plenty space to increase. And definitively, the acquisitions we did like Banco ibi and others, they will help Bradesco to grow even more into this direction. And for the corporates, we have actually improvement of market conditions making capital markets to be opened. We have IPOs, we have fixed income deals and this actually impacts the loan book growth for corporates.</p>

          <p>Daniel, about the growth in delinquency, we expect this growth in SME &#x2013; it's important to say, when you consider SME here, it's not only small companies, you consider some large middle-size companies, let's say. So when you consider the segment as a whole, there is no, no worse more than that we had normally in the other segments. What happened here, maybe you have some other specific case that had big impact here. Do not expect this to continue to grow. That's why we &#x2013; the numbers that we gave, the 4.9% that we gave in the last &#x2013; the first quarter, we continue to believe that it's possible not to pass this number. We really, from what we are seeing now that we think that it's possible not to reach even this 4.9 million.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Daniel, always looking at the question about middle market, you have always to ask to the bank, what is the range of revenues we have. For Bradesco, it's 30 to R$350 million. It varies from bank to others.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions as well. The first is, you maintained your net interest income growth guidance at 18 to 22% for this year, even though I think your net interest income is growing closer to 30%. So does this mean you expect to see maybe lower treasury gains in the second half of the year or do you expect some margin compression second half of the year or do you think your guidance is just on the conservative side?</p>
          <p>The second question is, you have made it clear that it seems like the worst is over, that our asset quality should start normalizing by the end of the third quarter. So why was there the need to boost your excess reserves above the minimum required by the Central Bank? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we didn't change the net interest income. But if we look in the bottom, you should note that we are not consider the non-interest income. We changed this moment. Why? Because the trade gains was higher than the two previous quarter, but we cannot count on these kind of gains to give the guidance. That's why we keep the same net interest income, but we were not consider non-interest income. Right. About the -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Abreu, sorry, before you go &#x2013; just let me then clarify, given the way you have seen such a sharp drop in the Selic in the first half of the year and I think the expectations are for the Selic to remain stable.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we assume then that the trading gains should normalize or should decline from this R$1 billion we've seen in the first and second quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, let's say, the gains have not to do with the reduction in Selic, right? It's the gains that we have in property position like CDS, other special positions that we &#x2013; our treasurer who was positioned. There is nothing to do with the reduction in Selic, right? The reduction in Selic, we would serve in the margin &#x2013; interest margin and we will see the gain that we have in the fixed portfolio that will mitigate this effect in the next year. When we talk about trading gains, of course, the first half of the year was very good for our trading gains that was a very, very good improvement in all the markets, but we don't think it's feasible to expect to have the same in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Sorry, my &#x2013; the other question was about &#x2013; okay, the provisions. The excess provisions. If you consider that the total provision that we have, we just recover the margin that &#x2013; the coverage -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We didn't do anything different to see that it would serve in the same way where it used to have 165.6% of the total ratio when you consider 90 days. And now, we have numbers a little bit higher, only a little bit higher, 169%. I think it's important to have, given that we expect to have a good &#x2013; a better performance from delinquency from now, but it's better to have very good &#x2013; it gave us some comfort to do this.</p>

          <p>I don't think we need to do so.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. My question is related to the outlook for the operating environment for Bradesco, but specifically focusing on regulatory issues and government involvement or intervention in the industry. Is Bradesco expecting changes from government measures to bring down banking spreads? And in addition, what is Bradesco's view on potential changes in the credit card acquiring business? And how will these impact Bradesco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specific about spreads, we understand that spreads, there is many things to do in order to reduce the spread. I think the spreads is a function of the environment, the risk that is involved in the operation and everything. When the standard spread we reduce in the next quarter, not because the government wants to reduce, but because the economic environment will give us all the comfort that we need to operate in a better situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when the risk is going down. But of course, in this field, when the sender is managing the government should do in order to improve the environment, like to reduce tax and other things. We don't expect some regulatory measure in this field. I think for a single reason that doesn't work. About credit cards, we have seen some discussions, something that we don't expect to &#x2013; of course, we observe some change, but don't expect to change too much. The things that really is involved in the business, they are not possible to change dramatically. We don't expect any change that will change dramatically the situation that we're observing now.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's very important that when they are giving some direction in order to improve the competition, but not something very drastic that you can change in the way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up there, we saw in the Central Bank study released earlier this year a recommendation that they reduce the payment period to merchants from the acquirers from 30 days to 2 days. Is that something that you see as a possibility and how would that impact such a large franchise as Bradesco?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Jason, I don't think it's possible to reduce this because they are just looking for one side of the operation. And we pay the merchants?</p>

          <p>Merchants for 30 days, but we receive the money from the consumers the same 30 days.

I think they are at &#x2013; they know this, but they don't -</p>
          <p>Yeah. They're aware of that and don't need <mark type="inaudible" /> this side. I think then we understand that we have observed some change in the regulation, but in order to give more &#x2013; to put more competition they might &#x2013; may not something very drastic in this way.</p>

          <p>I believe, Jason, in the US the payment of the merchant is shorter, but on the other way around, you, as a consumer, you have the interest rate or should I say &#x2013; well, actually it's &#x2013; cannot compare on an apple-to-apple basis.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everybody. I guess just a couple of follow-ups on some of the other questions. First, can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the SME segment? Obviously, that's been an area that has faced a lot of stress really since the latter part of last year. Obviously, your NPLs went up there. But are you seeing improvement lately in terms of origination activity? Are you feeling more comfortable with the risk profile of borrowers? Are you reducing rates? Do you see some incremental improvement there in terms of the outlook?</p>
          <p>And secondly on &#x2013; just a follow-up on spreads, I guess your spreads have benefited because of the fact that you don't hedge out your fixed-rate portfolio. In an environment where rates may stay stable into 2010 and lending spreads are coming down, how do you see your net interest margin excluding trading gains evolving in 2010, if rates remain stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Saul. This is Jean. In the SME segment, actually definitively we saw a major change between the middle of last year and middle of this year. I would say, don't forget that part of that is also statistical because middle market was the loan book which has been growing the most, I would say, over the last maybe 12 months before the crisis.</p>
          <p>And when the book didn't grow any more, actually you have a statistical effect and a negative effect on your delinquency ratio. But we are actually quite comfortable to see that the new inflow of operations that we are seeing with SMEs are getting better. It seems that the situation, the crisis, is already passed and the adjustments are just happening in the different segments. So we are okay with these segments. Even though maybe the delinquency could grow a little bit more, I would say the pace that you can see on page 19 of deterioration is moving down. So this is definitively a positive outlook. Talking together with the slide number 20, when you see that the loans to corporations, they are roughly stable in terms of delinquency between 61 and 90 days.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin, excluding the trading gains for next year, we believe that we're going to see a decline in the NIM, also nothing very strong, but you saw over the last years decline in the NIM. You should probably see a decline in the NIM, although probably the loan book could be grown more in individuals and where the spreads are little bit better, which could also help the NIM not to go down so much. But this &#x2013; the direction is to move down the NIM minus trading gains next year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay, great. Just a follow-up question &#x2013; and then just one quick question, detail question. And I apologize if you disclosed it in your release somewhere, I didn't see it. But did you disclose how much you gained in the second quarter, how much you had in trading gains from your CDS &#x2013; from the mark-to-market on your CDS of Brazilian sovereign debt?</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone. Also I had two questions. The first one regarding the outlook for 2010. Given your expectation of nearly 5% GDP growth, do you think you will be able to eventually accelerate further your branch expansion next year and is there room for extra growth there? And the second question is related to your service fees. Do you think that in an environment of 5% GDP growth, do you think it will be possible for service fees to grow double digits next year given the issues we have with the lower fees &#x2013; management fees on investment funds and so on?
