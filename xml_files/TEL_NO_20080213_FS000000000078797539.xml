          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Fourth Quarter Results, whether you are being present here, at Fornebu, or watching this on the Internet or listening in on the telephone. And also, a special welcome this time to the ones participating in our press conferences in Moscow and Kiev.</p>
          <p>My name is Scott Engebrigtsen, and it's my pleasure to guide you through this morning's presentation. We hope that everyone has the materials that we have made available for you. That is the quarterly report, the press release, and a copy of the presentation to be used here any minute, and all of this is also available from our website.</p>
          <p>In addition, to attend the presentation here at our headquarters, we have a few options available for you, as usual. You may also watch this transmission live or in recording on either the Internet or on mobile phones capable of showing live video. And if you are using the Internet, you may also send in your written questions during this transmission. And you'll find instructions on our website on these alternatives.</p>
          <p>Also, as usual, there will be questions-and-answers session directly after this presentation, first here from the audience present, and then from the ones participating on the phone, and finally, of course, the opportunity to do individual interviews.</p>
          <p>To present the quarterly figures, we have our CEO, Jon Fredrik Baksaas, and our CFO, Trond Westlie. But before I leave the floor to Mr. Baksaas, we have a short -- and if I may say so -- uplifting video for you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to see, in a way, our satellite moving up quite as it should be on this occasion. This was our THOR 5 satellite that was successfully launched two days ago in Baikonur in Kazakhstan. THOR 5 will have 24 transponders with -- and will replace the THOR II satellite, which has now expired its life. And this takes place 15 years basically after we started on broadcasting satellite activities, when we were to go with THOR 1 in 1993.</p>
          <p>With the launch of THOR 5, we have, in Telenor, now a total number of transponders being increased from 41 to 49. And as you know, there is another replacement satellite to come on screen, so to speak, in the summer 2009. And the increased demand here for transponder capacity is primarily driven by high-definition TV, which is supposed to sort of make an impact in the years to come.</p>
          <p>There is a stronger demand for add-on services, where the number of channels are increasing. And there are new TV markets in Europe that we are supplying with satellite capacities. And this is then part of the entity that we call the Telenor Satellite Broadcasting services, which we include in Telenor Satellites, which we include in Telenor Broadcast as a business area in Telenor.</p>
          <p>And in 2007, Telenor Broadcast revenue growth was 13%. So Satellite Broadcasting forms an important part of that business area. So we congratulate the guys that have done this both on technical side and I know there are some other guys returning from Kazakhstan these days having -- with the knowledge that the satellite is safe and sound in orbit.</p>
          <p>Then, let me move to the highlights of Telenor for fourth quarter 2007. We have been able to add quite a number of new subscribers also in the fourth quarter of 2007, 6.8 million new subscribers, to be exact. And that is almost 30 million new subscribers in one year for 2007 alone.</p>
          <p>This takes Telenor on the GSMA ranking, so to speak, of -- in the mobile operators of the world to the seventh place. And in that statistic, they include all customers in all companies that are being hold by more than 20%. So then you know the definition on how that statistics are being put together.</p>
          <p>There is also a higher investment level in Telenor in fourth quarter, reaching as high as 26% of CapEx to sales. In this figure, there is some fourth-quarter specialties of approximately NOK 1 billion, including the extension of a 2G license in Hungary of NOK 320 million, which is licensed for seven years.</p>
          <p>Then, we also include the license fee paid for frequencies for the 2.6 GHz band in Norway with 93 million. And there is an extended rollout activities in Denmark for 3G amounting to approximately NOK 100 million, on top of the very, very hectic rollout period that Telenor Pakistan is in the midst of around 500 million in this quarter alone.</p>
          <p>So the activity has been very high, and it takes the group's activity for 2007 in fourth quarter off to an underlying revenue growth of 12%, which is slightly below yearly average for 2007, but still a significant growth figure.</p>
          <p>In my presentation today, I shall concentrate on some few comments on Norway, Ukraine, Pakistan and Bangladesh, whereas the rest of the operations will be covered by the material as such. So I'll start with Norway.</p>
          <p>We have to say that our people in the fixed activities in Norway has done brilliantly through 2007. 2006 was the sort of closing with some challenges for these services in Norway, and we're very pleased that we now can sort of finally state that the cost activities program that we have been focusing at towards the end of 2007 have reached its targets and even a bit more so by saying that gross savings have reached 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>It's no surprise to you that we managed that figure, I would say, but it's still contributed to those that has been working with it. We are very pleased that that is the result. This doesn't say that cost efficiency measures and looking forward to new and smarter things will stop in the fixed-line operation in Norway right as now. On the contrary, this has become sort of a regular part of regular work for the people here knowing that there is a downward pressure on revenues -- a bit lower though in the end of 2007 compared to the beginning. We started the year with really a minus of 4 to 5% is downward revenue pressure, and we exited the year with a downward pressure of, say, 2 to 3%.</p>
          <p>And we anticipate that that is more likely the level to come in the periods ahead of us rather than what we had when we started 2007. I am also happy to say that from a service level point of view, we are having much better statistics for the -- I'm sorry -- surrendered in 2007 than we had in 2006.</p>
          <p>On the mobile side, in Mobile Norway, as Mobile Norway was the very best performer in Q4 2006, we are disappointed of our performance in 2007. The negative effect of the migration of the wholesale volumes related to the Tele2 contract has now been seen with a higher impact than we had in third quarter.</p>
          <p>The annual effect of this being around NOK 1 billion in reduced revenues, with high EBITDA margin attached, explaining alone two percentage points of the reduced EBITDA margin in the quarter alone.</p>
          <p>On the other side, our own retail constitutes a 4% underlying growth, which in then -- the reported figures in a way disappears in the negative effects of the migration of the wholesale activities. The on net service offerings are popular for -- from Telenor in this stage, thus enabling us to reduce churn on the postpaid base in particular. However, we do experience a growth in the OpEx side along with this, which is not in alignment with the reduced revenues that we now experience and this has to be addressed very directly in 2008.</p>
          <p>We now prepare ourselves for a single digit revenue decline on a reported basis in 2008, because of the wholesale volumes that has been transferred migrating to the other network holder and this is taking place in a very highly competitive market, with an EBITDA under pressure compared to the full year of 2007.</p>
          <p>We are now setting a clear focus on cost efficiency measures to be implemented in the range of NOK500 million on an annual basis compared to the run rate that we have in fourth quarter of 2007. This leaves Mobile Norway in a similar situation as fixed line operation with a continuous focus on cost efficiency and close monitoring of OpEx cost with the aim of stabilizing the EBITDA margin at mid 30s.</p>
          <p>At the Capital Market's Day in 2006 we raised our -- sorry, in 2007 we raised our cash flow ambitions for the Nordic operations to NOK 10 billion. We maintained this target in a mid term perspective. We expect fixed line Norway to continue to deliver an operating cash flow at minimum 3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>The cost cutting initiatives in mobile Norway we will have to anticipate positive effects roll out moving into 2009 and measures to improve the same kind of situation in Sweden and Denmark are also underway. So on a cumulative basis for the Nordics we do maintain a 10 billion cash flow target on mid term.</p>
          <p>Moving then over to Kyivstar, we have a very good operating position to report for this company. First of all, I want to highlight the fact that we Telenor filed on 23rd of January 2008 a contempt motion with the federal court in New York against Alfa and affiliates with the aim of getting our partners in Kyivstar to comply with the share holding agreement around Kyivstar. As you know this has been challenged over quite some time.</p>
          <p>We now do include Kyivstar after the last injunction that was lifted in Ukraine. So we now include Kyivstar as an associated company in our reporting for Q4 2007.</p>
          <p>On the operating side, I have to congratulate to Igor Mykhailenko and the Kyivstar team with the performance of 2007 and Q4 2007 was a quarter with moderate subscriber growth compared to what we are used to in Kyivstar and this comes as a result of the fact that penetration has come fairly higher also in the Ukrainian market. The subscriber base has reached now 23.6 million at the end of 2006 -- 2007 and the net adds in Q4 was 545,000 compared to 3.8 million in 2006.</p>
          <p>We do see that Kyivstar is able to maintain the market leader position with approximately 42% subscriber market share. We have also seen that the subscriber growth has continued to a certain extent into 2008 first quarter this year. But what is mostly important here is that our average revenue per user is increased in 2007 by around 2% in local currency.</p>
          <p>The lower subscriber intake in Q4 compared to what we have been used to in previously years is largely as a result in a more stable average revenue per user in the coming quarters and then the return factor than what we were used to in previous years and for those that have followed Kyivstar over the years will know that this particular phenomenon in Ukraine has created some questions in connection with year end closings.</p>
          <p>I also have to congratulate Tore Johnsen and his team in Pakistan for the activities through 2007. Subscriber market share has increased from 18 to 19% in an extremely active marketplace. In Q4 alone, the subscriber growth was 2 million and there is a great respect for those figures, the way we look at it.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth has been from 13% in Norwegian kroners from Q3 to Q4 and 18% in local currency. So we see here a market place, which raised probably penetration the fastest that we've ever seen in any of our operations altogether.</p>
          <p>The increased CapEx in the fourth quarter was related to higher network rollout and the roller pace is, of course, to accommodate the subscription growth, as well as increased traffic, as well as having coverage in new areas. We believe that 2007 was the peak year regarding CapEx; however, with the quarterly -- with the quarters peaking around the level that we've seen in Q4 '07 and to be expected in Q1 '08.</p>
          <p>Moving then to Bangladesh, we see a much more challenging marketplace than we had for Pakistan. Total number of subscribers was 16.5 million at the end of 2007 versus 10.8 at the end of 2006 and the subscriber market share is now according to BTRC statistics recorded at 48% and here we are now using the national statistics coming from BTRC rather than the Telenor estimates that we had before.</p>
          <p>On the revenue market share though, as we reckoned that we maintain a solid market leadership at the same levels as we've seen for previous quarters. As at the end of the quarter, we anticipate that around three million subscribers remain to be re-registered. As you may have picked out from last year, there was a mandatory registration program to be executed and this has to be completed with the 1st of May, I believe.</p>
          <p>There has recently been a follow-up investigation from Bangladeshi regulated BTRC on Grameenphone's involvement in international call termination via Voice over IP business prior to February 2007. As a consequence of this investigation, BTRC has filed a case against Grameenphone and some of the present and previous management.</p>
          <p>Grameenphone has further been requested to show cause under the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act as to the findings of BTRC before it considers appropriate measures. We are in the midst of investigating this. We have in Grameenphone audit and independent investigation to be executed by Price Waterhouse. And when this work is concluded, we anticipate that there will be a period of discussions with BTRC to resolve this issue. We're also looking forward to the IPO process. That is most likely to come later this year.</p>
          <p>Closing in here before leaving the floor to Trond Westlie, for our other Nordic operations, we do see that in Denmark, we are busy with integrating the Tele2 volumes that we acquired. And that takes the margin and ARPU slightly down in the fourth quarter 2007. But we believe also that Henrik Clausen will -- and his team will be able to also move on the expected synergies to be shown in our figures later on in 2008.</p>
          <p>In Pannon, we see a very solid marketplace but also very flat in the sense that the increased tax rate that came forward entering 2007 has had an impact on the growth factors. The one most interestingly new service taking a lift off in Hungary is that of high-speed mobile Internet. So Pannon has done quite good into that new service feature, which is the one paramount topic as we see in Barcelona GSM convention, which is going on right now.</p>
          <p>In Serbia and Montenegro, we have had keen competition situations because of the number three player coming into play. We believe that our two companies have done reasonably well in this. And that 2008 will be a more regular business environment than what we've seen for 2007.</p>
          <p>And with these words, I leave the floor to Trond, who will take us through the financials and then give guidance for 2008. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would say that its yet another good growth quarter for the Telenor Group and looking at the elements of the revenue growth profile, you see that the -- it's a big difference here from the underlying revenue growth elements to the reported elements. And that is due to the fact that probably, everyone is aware right now that Kyivstar is not consolidated into the 2007 numbers, but compared to the 2006 numbers they were in.</p>
          <p>So you see that including Kyivstar in the underlying growth, you'll see that we have a slight declining trend forward through 2007 from 14% in first quarter to 12% in the fourth quarter. Comparing 2007 then to 2006, we see an average trend of underlying growth of approximate -- between 12 and 13%, which we're spot on -- was relative to our guiding from last year.</p>
          <p>On the reported numbers, we see that the revenue in fourth quarter 2007 is NOK 26.9 billion and that leaves a growth from last quarter or year-over-year 2006 compared to 2007 at the top-line revenue growth reported, or not reported but pro forma including Kyivstar of a bit more than 15% on top-line growth.</p>
          <p>In this number, we have to consider that the effect of including interconnect effect in Thailand has an effect of the underlying growth number of approximately 3% throughout the year of 2007, and then will be taken out comparing the underlying growth in 2008. I'll come back to that in the outlook.</p>
          <p>Going then to the EBITDA number, we see an increase of 10% from fourth quarter of 2006 from NOK 8.2 billion to NOK 9 billion, including Kyivstar as well. And we ended up with a margin of 33.4%, exactly the same margin percent as we had in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>There is, if you compare 2006 to 2007, we have margin increase of 1.6%, but we ended up on the year of 2007 on 34.6% pro forma including Kyivstar, which also is inline with around 35% giving an estimate on last year.</p>
          <p>So as you see, the trend of the cycle throughout the year, of the nominal EBITDA number is following the same pattern as previously, and we have a slight decline then from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at the reported profit and loss statement for the fourth quarter, I have to then be specific that the Q4 2006 numbers include Kyivstar consolidated numbers, but the Q4 '07 only have Kyivstar as an associated entity, so that the Kyivstar numbers is not included in the revenue EBITDA and EBIT numbers here for 2007.</p>
          <p>The revenue is at 23.700 billion and the EBITDA reported is 7.247 billion of which our non-operative income is about 185 million, so before other income and expenses on the EBITDA level, the number is NOK 7.62 billion.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the fourth quarter 2007 line, we have an associate companies revenue or income of 4.3 billion. That number includes Kyivstar for all four quarters with approximately NOK 2.3 billion. Together with Kyivstar, we have, of course, the sale of 1 or 1.4 billion. And then we have other associates like VimpelCom and Golden in there for approximately 0.6 billion adding up to the 4.3.</p>
          <p>Then we have profit before taxes on 7.239 billion, and then we have a tax income. The reason for that tax income is basically a reversal of valuation allowance on two items both on tax loss carry-forward as well as other non-taxable income. But the actual tax rate in Q4 is low due to the fact that associates is included after tax numbers and also the gain on bond is a non-taxable gain.</p>
          <p>If you then look at the number for 2000 -- total number for 2007, you see that the taxes are 2.168 billion, that's an effective tax rate of approximately 11%. If we take out all the non-taxable gain, the associates and the valuation -- the reversal of valuation allowance, the underlying tax rate is approximately 32% as we have stated previously.</p>
          <p>The earnings per share this quarter is NOK 4.54, also affected by the on the fourth quarter of Kyivstar coming this quarter. But also, I would say that if you take the yearly figure on the earnings per share its NOK 10.72, which is then -- which have all the quarters then evened out for the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the net debt developments. We have -- starting the quarter with net debt of 40 billion. We have outflows of CapEx of 5.8. Interest and tax on 2.3. That is much higher than last year, because last year we have the payback of the Sonofon tax case. And then we were actually positive on the tax cash flow position. Then we have dividend buybacks acquisitions and accruals ForEx and others. Over that amount the ForEx amounts over translation of that is negative this quarter of approximately 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we have sale of assets of 2.2 billion, sale of DiGi shares of 2.7, and then the earnings before interest and tax and depreciation of 2712, ending out at the net debt of approximately 40 million, also well as we started.</p>
          <p>The board has decided to propose dividend to the general assembly of NOK 3.40. We are sticking to our divided policy that have a payout ratio between 40 and 60% of normalized net profit. We are in as before in the lower area of that 40 to 60%. And we have a stable nominal increase as this graph shows.</p>
          <p>We also reinitiated the share buyback and also having that alliance in December of 2007. We acquired short of NOK 400 million and together with the agreement with our main shareholder the Government of Norway of the even buyback agreement, so that they are going to -- given some of their shares, the total buyback comprised is approximately 860 million.</p>
          <p>Going to the outlook for 2008, we have now this year as well as last year we have around regarding on the reported figures. And for this year we actually look for revenue growth of around 5% level. We see that the EBITDA margin is going to be above the 31% level, the same level as we had reported last year and CapEx to sales the same as last year on the guidance on around 20% level.</p>
          <p>The currency effect did influence the numbers -- for reporting numbers for Telenor during 2007. So I will at least mention the element of currency giving the necessary effect. If we take the underlying revenue guidance, we see that including Kyivstar, we see that the underlying revenue growth is going to be just one percentage point higher around 6% level.</p>
          <p>And that concludes my part of the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Martin Hoff from Arctic Securities. I have a question to the Norwegian mobile. You say that EBITDA margin is still under pressure. Do you mean still under pressure from 31% in the fourth quarter? And does that mean we are going to be seeing EBITDA margins below 30% in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It means that it's going to be -- we only guide on the yearly figures. So it's from the sort of 36%. We see a pressure from the sort of 36% level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow-up on the 500 million <mark type="inaudible" /> Is that going to trigger large one-off costs in terms of restructuring provisions [inaudible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you are -- sort of, approaching cost structure there is also always some restructuring cost associated with that. But if you look at sort of the way we handled it over the years in the fixed-line business, so I don't sort of expect excesses on that score. But of course, there are always some costs involved with taking OpEx down. But I cannot sort of move into details of that at this stage.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. You seem to talk a lot about mobile and fixed is -- fixed telephony. But fixed is something else too. Don't you see any opportunity in transporting the digital content on the fixed lines in a quality-oriented fashion in the future, and the need to build out the capacity of fixed line network in these high-definition television times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is a business opportunity, which is being developed in many countries across Europe, also here in Norway. I mean the backbone qualities of Telenor is constantly being developed in Norway, in Denmark and in Sweden. So, of course, yes, also digital content free the fixed line networks will be part of the future business opportunities that comes on top of that infrastructure. There is no doubt about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Espen Torgersen from Carnegie. Just a very quick clarification question on the guiding. Does that include service revenue, i.e., excluding interconnect from DTAC, or does it include total revenues in DiGi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes total revenues from DTAC. So it's from the high level including the interconnect revenue level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 5% includes interconnect in finance, 6% includes underlying with Kyivstar.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But the underlying meaning that we eliminate the effects of currency, but we take the topline level including interconnect in from DTAC and fix on that level as well.</p>

          <p>CapEx in Telenor is always related to what we feel is the necessary to follow on customer and usage growth in every operation. And it still shows that in many of the operations out in Scandinavia. This feature is a very prominent feature. Number of customers are increasing. New areas are being covered in particular in Pakistan and new capacities are needed to handle greater volumes because of higher cost in the stock and raising usage pattern from these markets. So the balance here is of course that new capacities has to be balanced up against sort of prevailing price plans in every marketplace and that is sort of local management's responsibility to find that balance. But in Telenor, we are always sort of been at the opportunity that when there is growth in the market either from usage perspective or from a customer perspective, we are there to participate to compete for those growth elements. And that takes the CapEx in Telenor a bit higher than sort of here you could say originating from other marketplaces.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Rivett from Citigroup. I have got three questions, if I can. The first one is on the buyback. Do we assume now that you start buying back stock immediately? Do you have any targets of how much you want to do, anything that you'd elaborate on that? My second two questions are on Norwegian Mobile as well as Bangladeshi Mobile. Is there anything that you are seeing currently within those markets that suggests that things are maybe getting a little bit easier either in terms of market structure or in terms of just a little operator dynamics? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the buyback side, we had the buyback on hold until we announced the third quarter in October, November last year. We started then buying back. There are no change in our plans. We don't have any targets or announcements. We have never done that, but that means that the buyback is normalized. So whether we start or whether we're not going to start, we have never announced that, but the program is effective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I now move along to the more operating-type question you had. Each year I think, we have to put that into hyphen basically. Significant restructurings in those two markets are taking place in 2007. There is a big change in Norway, because of the migration of the Tele2, and the appearance of the third network is coming up. After such restructurings, we can anticipate that we move into a period where sort of the players are more visible and sort of work and concentrate on their basic business model. So we could well envisage that the restructuring element they will not be as visible in 2008 as in 2007.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, this industry is a very competitive industry and the way the players are also sort of using up against each other with new initiatives in the marketplace we probably will be as normal in 2008 as it has been in 2007.</p>
          <p>As for Bangladesh, it's bit of the same. We have the market entry and new players as last year. We also had a regulator who push the interconnect rate quite significantly down with the ultimate effect from the 1st of October last year. So I anticipate that that kind of drivers will not be as visible as they were for 2007 because of the fact that price levels were taken significantly down in Bangladesh during 2007.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. One on the cost cutting. And you talked about 500 million growth. Is there any sense what the net amount could be? And also with regards to the cost cutting, will that include -- when you talk about cost, does that include deprecation or you're talking simply about the costs in terms of revenues minus EBITDA? The second question regards Pakistan. Have you seen an actual impact in the market from China Mobile, some recent sort of activities there in terms of subscriber net adds or marketing intensity or anything of that sort that we should be aware of into 2008 in terms of a change versus '07 trends? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost cutting side depreciation is not included. That much I can say. And Trond is nodding here. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And yes, we labeled this gross cost saving. And in awareness of the fact that the OpEx base has grown during 2006 &#x2013; sorry, 2007 -- I have to get used to the years here -- 2007, meaning that we have reached sort of a run rate which is higher at the end of 2007 compared to the beginning of 2007. And we have to invest that growth and work on the cost structure that actually is there, now entering 2008. So we haven't been specific on the net effect, but we have indirectly by saying that we are targeting the mid-30s EBITDA margin for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>Then for Pakistan, to say that China Mobile do not have a net impact in Pakistan will probably be a too strong statement. But on the other hand, we have not sort of seen CM PAK, as they are trading under, sort of making a huge impact into the local marketplace in Pakistan. And in this -- under these kind of parameters, I am extremely happy that Telenor Pakistan has achieved to pick up their fair share of market growth and more so consistently over all periods in &#x2013; all months in 2007. And of course that is our target going forward as well. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Cheuvreux. Two questions related to the outlook, especially, Trond, your comments on preparing for mid-single-digit revenue decline in Norwegian Mobile in 2008. Just to summarize to be clear. Is this before the eventual losses to Ventelo contract? And second question. Where on your outlook for revenues and margins in 2008 do you feel the most uncertain, in other words, scope for deviation from the guidance? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>And as for your second quarter &#x2013; question, that's a more difficult one. I mean, where we would the weak points and where do we have the strong points? I think it have to be general in my response to you. We have grown to significant company with exposure to many markets and what we have seen here is, of course, that in some instances some markets are over-performing and others are underperforming. And it seems to be a certain balance in sort of the overall competition of what we're engaged in. As opposed to 2006 where everything in a way over-performed, I think, we had a more balanced picture in 2007. Seeing also a number of other markets reaching high penetrations and entering the more industrial phase you could say, as opposed to this rush for penetration growth. I would say that it's certainly Pakistan and Bangladesh, which is still in this customer acquisition racing for higher penetration kind of market compared to the other markets. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I've three questions please. First question on underlying revenue growth, can you just clarify that you're expecting underlying the local currency growth of  6%, 1% more than the formal guidance and if that is the case, you're obviously seeing or expecting a big slowdown in top line growth. So, when should we expect a reduction in cash intensity? Actually, we expect material improvements beyond &#x2013; material reduction and from the 20% level beyond 2008? Second question on poor cost and can you just help us a bit with a financial outlook in that division. Are you expecting an ongoing double-digit growth, where margins come down as you're marking new capacity and what's the CapEx for just at the moment? And then thirdly, just on the economic slowdown, what impact do you expect in the emerging markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the underlying revenue growth, yes, we do see the effect of around 6% in 2008. I must address, though, if you look at the chart that we've shown relative to the underlying revenue growth we see -- we show an underlying revenue growth of approximately 12% at the end of the year of 2007, of that 3% has to be taken out. So basically, you are even though -- you see a decline effectively from approximately around 9% to around 6%. When it comes to the cash intensity, again that is back to the answer that Fredrik just answered relative to the deployment of the growth aspects in the emerging markets. We do see that the peak funding in Pakistan was in 2007 even though we expect the level in the first quarter to be at the same levels as in fourth quarter. So, it will depending on the volume growth and the compensation of different technologies being deployed in different countries. So, -- but we do see a slowdown on the cash intensity. That being said we also see that CapEx to sales levels is the higher percentage in the emerging markets than in the churn market. So, you will also see that the level of hiring CapEx to sales in a combine entity as turn rate we actually do see that the level of CapEx to sale is going to be higher than just the mature market player.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can give some comments on the few other aspects of -- that you mentioned. As per broadcast, we have seen a double-digit growth line in 2007. And in 2007, we've seen sort of a more challenging marketplace for the DTH platform, where in particularly is driven by DTT in conjunction in Sweden. And this introduction will now come in more of this year. And the other areas of our broadcast is serving nice growth in particular satellite broadcasting as well as Conax and so the company delivering conditional access systems to all platforms. So, we think there is mixture also within broadcast when it comes to the growth potential. We don't guide though specifically on each business area in that respect. On the CapEx side, you should bear in mind that we just recently done as you saw undocumented the fact that the satellite is on -- in orbit meaning that the CapEx from that satellite will be sort of a one-off significant coming on top of sort more regular type of CapEx within broadcast. Then to your third topic, economic slowdown in emerging markets. If we take Thailand for example -- as an example, Thailand has been steady through 2007 with some insure -- risks factor associated to investment level et cetera. And we've seen certain more -- a bit of a not so strongly growing market in 2007 as we could expect it. What's also seen now in the Government coming in place with the focus at or so getting some speed into the economy again I think, Thailand has in a way proved itself as a very responsive country when it comes to how people are using their telecommunications facilities. So, yes it goes hand-in-hand with economic problems in these countries. However, it's my inclination to believe that in place where we have deflections, this sector is not necessarily -- this sector being hit the most compared to other sectors, because communication is part of the needs in some way or another. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. Three very brief questions please. First of all, just on the CapEx guidance, could you remind us of any other one-off items that are in that? And secondly, just in terms of the domestic mobile cost cutting, can you talk a little bit about what the sources of cost cutting will be, is it staffing, is it marketing related or is it just the fact that the -- that your termination cost will come down. And then, finally, could you just give a little bit of guidance on the tax rates. Should we be thinking about the sort of 32% level mentioned earlier? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take the first and third question, in the CapEx guidance, as we tried to show you earlier this morning, we had a satellite that that actually went up, so that's the part of it. Other than that there is no specific guidance. And that's basically the only special items that's in there. And the value of that is probably around NOK 1.2 billion. Coming to the tax cost, it's going to be around the 30% level, probably a bit higher. If it's going to be up to the 32, I am uncertain. But round about the 30% level underlying, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as to your cost efficiency comment, it wouldn't be my thought to sort of resolve the cost efficiency question by reducing the connection rates. I have to state that, I mean, we were thinking more on the operating expense side of the value chain when we were thinking of 500 million cost focus exercise in Telenor in Norway before 2008. So, yes, we will address all elements of the operating cost including also the fact that the staff and money situation is part of that equation. But at this point of time, we are not here to address that in numbers. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. This is Raj Sinha calling from JPMorgan. I actually want a bit more clarification, I am sorry to jump up on this -- going on this question, on CapEx. First of all, an indication of where you think medium term CapEx sales ratio may go to? And secondly, just a question about your mature markets as to whether you're actually seeing any pick up whatsoever in those mature markets driving up your CapEx guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as always we only guide on year ahead. So relative to the ongoing effects and the effects of going into more penetrated markets, we're not going to give you much more guidance than just a general comment I just gave. So we're not going to be number specifics on the mid-term except for the general development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I maybe sort of -- sorry I'll just follow-up on that and just saying, you said that the CapEx sales in emerging markets will be higher than in mature markets. Could you maybe elaborate little bit on that, is this because of the subscriber growth, minutes growth or is it just the nature of the geographic coverage that means that its always going to be slightly higher than in mature markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will say probably it's not always so that the conclusion is always like that. I mean take a look at Kyivstar, for example, which have been through very tremendous CapEx intensive period two to three years back. Now, seeing that over figures in -- under the present market situation, which is extremely much better as you can see. And DiGi in the same way hasn't moved in that direction. Meaning that in Thailand, Bangladesh and Pakistan we will see that situation also coming into the future. However, there are some things that we have to add into the equation and that is the need for higher bandwidth also we want in mobile systems and lack of fixed line deployments in the geography as such. And we are now truly edge deployed in Bangladesh with the ambition of raising data usage from the mobile handsets, knowing that is the EDGE protocol isn't having a sufficient bandwidth longer term. But also knowing that the system-wide and the direction the market will develop and with those kinds of quality in hand, you should sort of take those into consideration when you look at those sort of the longer term picture on capital sales. But, of course, under the present circumstances the drivers are, coverage, capacity, number of customers.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, you had one sort of element with reference to the more mature markets. So, if you then look into the poles in the Nordic countries and here HSDPA is now underway and the mobile Internet access platform is becoming a real one. We have taken steps of that both in Norway, Sweden and Denmark and that will be part of the picture. It doesn't ruin the CapEx figures. But it's why the CapEx figure is around 8 to 10% of CapEx sales under these circumstances.</p>

          <p>I think all my questions have been answered. I've got one actually just on Denmark. I'm sorry. This is Saroop Purewal from Morgan Stanley. And can you just talk about the operational kind of performance of Denmark considering the market has being consolidated, and when you think that there is going to be any likely improvements? Just that question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In the mobile side, I think we have shown over the last couple of years quite good improvements on how Sonofon has been driving their operation. In fourth quarter, though, after the acquisition of Tele2, we're now in the midst of combining those two customer bases and Tele2 customer base had on average lower ARPU and volumes compared to the average of the Sonofon customer base. And with the potential of realizing the synergies of moving that customer base onto the Sonofon network, later on in 2008, we do expect to see results of those synergies in the margin comparatively what we have in fourth quarter 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or if I just want to add, there is a couple things that are coming into the fourth quarter and that is the migration of Debitel. It has come quicker than we anticipated. So the margin decline now approximately 5%, if you compare fourth quarter 2006 to 2007, approximately, 2% of that decline is the migration of Debitel. In addition to that, their roaming charges has -- the new roaming charges being placed by the European commission, has approximately in effect, year-over-year compared to approximately 1.5%, in addition to the effects of Tele2 that Fredrik is mentioning. The last part in that market is the initiative on the distribution within the [inaudible stores that also that has a cost element that has driven partly down the margins in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>So what is your view on the outlook of VimpelCom for 2008 and are you comfortable with your financial shareholding position?</p>

          <p>We -- on this occasion we would not, in a way comment on VimpelCom's performance because they have their own reporting structures, of course. No doubt as of what we've seen. We have already sensed that with the operating expenses over VimpelCom in the Russian marketplace. We have seen ARPUs growing in Russia over the two last years, amortization has become high and income distribution is actually taking place in such a way that telecoms are -- and even if were that to happen as well as beneficiary of that growth when it happens the way it does in Russia. So we are long-term around acquisition of VimpelCom as we've been before. We are also supporting VimpelCom in its sort of expansion initiatives with one exception, because as we know the Ukrainian initiative, we were of the opinion that the business rate around that was too weak at the point of investment when that was executed. Now, we have also supported VimpelCom in its bid into the broadband area by declaring our acceptance of the bids around Golden Telecom. So, VimpelCom is doing extremely well and we are very supportive to both exchange of service concept for the distribution ideas and new service development with VimpelCom going forward from here. And you're right, in fact, that under the GSM statistics, to which we referred, the VimpelCom figures are improving because of the threshold of 20% dilution.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That question has been raised over many, many years. In this sense, we are a long-term investor and we have been focused at sort of establishing a platform spelled out in the shareholding agreement around VimpelCom and kept our code within that framework. And that is our platform for presenting VimpelCom. And from there, we will continue to work with <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as the telephone market in Russia, in general.</p>
