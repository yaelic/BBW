          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Express Scripts Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. With that being said, we will turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor Statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filing with the SEC.</p>
          <p>For clarity purposes all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. The release is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will turn the call over to Jeff to discuss third quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter results continue the trend of strong operating and financial performance. In keeping with model of alignment, the increase in generic fill rate resulted in significant savings to our clients and our gross profit margin was up 30 basis points sequentially. Integration including the migration of lives to our destination platform continued successfully. Synergies continue to be accelerated into 2012, which contributed to strong earnings for the quarter and the increase in our guidance range. Cash flows were strong, and we made good progress toward realizing our cash flow synergy and delevering our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We reported third quarter earnings per share of $1.02, up 29% from the same quarter last year. Home Delivery and Specialty Claims were $39.8 million, up 199% from the same quarter last year. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition, organic or same-store equivalent home delivery claims would have grown approximately 3% over last year.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses declined $94 million sequentially from the second quarter as a result of the accelerated realization of synergies. We expect SG&amp;A to increase in the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonal expenses in preparation for 1/1 implementations.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 136% from last year, while EBITDA per adjusted script was up 9%. During the quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt, which included Medco's $600 million accounts receivable financing facility, which we have terminated, continuing our plan to quickly delever.</p>
          <p>We now expect EPS for the year, including deal related costs and amortization and other non-recurring items, to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 representing growth of 25% over 2011 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.19 from our original midpoint as a result of the acceleration of synergy. This range now assumes a 39% tax rate, which is an increase from our previous guidance, which assumed a 39% rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be 39%.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>We remain confident that we are well positioned for growth and remain bullish on the PBM business. Although we are not prepared to provide 2013 guidance this morning, I will provide more clarity into our future outlook.</p>
          <p>There are a number of positives that will provide tailwinds for our business. The integration of Medco remains on track, and we are meeting or exceeding our key targets. Last week we successfully migrated our fourth tier of clients to our destination platform and have made considerable progress in rationalizing our operational footprint. As a result, certain synergies originally expected in 2013 were realized in 2012. This is contributing to a strong 2012 result. This acceleration of synergies reduces the incremental synergies in 2013.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline of products is resonating in the marketplace. Clients have a thirst to better manage costs, and they appreciate the science behind our evidence-based approach to managing the pharmacy benefit. We will help clients and members navigate the complexity of healthcare reform, and we will enhance our leading position in management of the cost and quality of care for specialty medications. Our cash flows remained strong, and our timing for expected realization of cash flow synergies is accelerating.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these recent successes, the economic environmental outlook is presenting some near-term challenges. Over the last few weeks, as part of our forecasting process, we spoke to many of our health plan clients and large employer clients. What we learned is that our clients have unprecedented concerns about our country's economic outlook. This lackluster economy is taking its toll in several areas.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, our health plan clients are expecting membership reductions in 2013. Large employers have pulled back on hiring plans, using contractors and part-time employees when necessary. Mid to small employers are cutting back or postponing healthcare coverage decisions while waiting for more clarity on healthcare reform. And we continue to see low rates of drug utilization as individuals deal with uncertainty at the household level. As a result, the current weak business climate and the unemployment outlook will likely result in significant in-group member attrition in 2013, continued low utilization rates and increased client demands and expectations.</p>
          <p>We had a successful sales season, adding approximately 215 new accounts, which exceeded our sales targets. We operate in a very competitive environment, but we remain disciplined in our approach to pricing and profitability. We project that our retention rate will be approximately 94%.</p>
          <p>In addition, the transition of the UnitedHealth book of business to OptumRx throughout 2013 will reduce claim comparisons in 2013 versus 2012 and 2014 versus 2013. The adjusted Rx reduction will result in dis-economies of scale until the book is fully transitioned.</p>
          <p>In spite of these near-term headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we expect to grow earnings per share and EBITDA in 2013. In fact, we expect to grow gross profit per adjusted Rx in the high single-digit range and EBITDA per adjusted Rx in the mid-teens next year. However, with the acceleration of synergies in 2012, which translates into lower incremental synergies in 2013 along with the lower volume expectations, we view current consensus estimates for 2013 as overly aggressive.</p>
          <p>In early January, we'll receive actual enrollment data from all of our clients and see initial Rx volume. This will provide more clarity to our expected financial performance. Therefore, on a go-forward basis we will provide annual guidance when we release year-end financial results. As such, we will give our 2013 guidance in February.</p>
          <p>Express Scripts will continue to develop and offer innovative solutions that will protect American families from the rising costs of healthcare. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable for tens of millions of Americans. That will translate into strong value for our clients and patients and continued growth for our stockholders.</p>
          <p>At this point, operator, we will be happy to answer any questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First we'll go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks. George, I just wanted to follow up on your comments there relative to having spoken to some your clients in recent weeks and their concerns about the economy. Can you compare and contrast where they stand right now looking at 2013 compared to where they stood a year ago as we were looking at 2012? I'm just trying to understand this persistently weak economy that we've had, the extent to which maybe your perception that it's getting worse versus it continues to be lackluster, I think in your words? And are you seeing a concentration of membership or lack thereof in certain clients or certain types of clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So no one-size-fits-all, of course. What we are seeing, and you see it every day in the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday there was a headline article about how employers are looking at the impact of healthcare reform and what actions they may take. There are articles in today's papers. This is a constant theme. I believe employers are concerned about the economic outlook, and it was tough going through 2009 and 2010. Employers had to make very difficult decisions about workforce levels. Nobody enjoys doing layoffs. It's something that has to be done to protect the shareholder base, it's something to be done to protect the rest of the employees and to stay profitable.</p>
          <p>But having gone through that, people don't like &#x2013; CEOs don't really like doing that. Companies have been very slow to bring back employment. We saw that throughout last year's numbers as well. The difference is we had significant Medco synergies that accelerated in the year that helped offset a lot of the attrition that we saw throughout the course of the year. Employers, when you see the unemployment numbers that are coming out &#x2013; the federal numbers when they're released, people are hiring, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily hiring people and giving them benefit coverage. A lot of employers are hiring part-time workers, people that <mark type="ph" /> give 20 hours (11:31) to below 30%. Other employers are hiring contractors and using contractors to do the work. Some of the jobs, unfortunately, are going offshore. And so we're seeing those trends existing in our marketplace.</p>
          <p>I would tell you it is worse today. At least the outlook is. Now, the reason we're not going to give you a hard number is nobody really knows, right? There's still a month to go, two months to go before the end of the year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. I don't want to throw a number out there based on some numbers that are coming in to us and not be accurate when in two short months we're going to have a very strong number.</p>
          <p>On January 1, actually it's before then, we'll get the enrollment files from all of our clients. Every one of them sends in a new enrollment file. They do it constantly, but of course we'll get the January 1 numbers, which will be the starting point for next year. Those stay pretty consistent through the course of the year, and we'll know where we stand. We'll know what the success of our health plan selling seasons are. We'll know the success of the retention endeavors, where the numbers are at, and we'll be prepared in February to give accurate guidance, which is much better than we could do today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and maybe just as a follow-up, to make sure we understand, absolute or specific numbers aside, when you're alluding to 2013 being overly aggressive, is it sort of based on new things that you're finding recently? Or is it that maybe the Street has meandered further afar from where you've been thinking? And maybe the volume issues you're talking about or the synergy acceleration making for a little harder comp next year are some of the places that we're off? So have your thoughts actually changed? Or is it that you're sort of reining in the Street versus where they've gone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's go back to last quarter. We had a strong second quarter earnings. Through the course of the last couple months, consensus estimates on earnings have continued to go up, without really a catalyst from us. We gave earnings guidance. We didn't have a forum from which to discuss, as you know, because of FD if somebody takes up their guidance we just can't call them up and say, what you doing? That's against the law. So we have to have a forum by which to address this issue.</p>
          <p>We're not prepared to actually say what next year's earnings are going to be. But what we are prepared to say is that this continued tick up as we look at an uncertain economy and the numbers, what we see confronting us, doesn't feel warranted, and therefore we felt this was the right forum to address that issue. And that's what we're doing on this call is addressing the issue we believe that the numbers have gotten ahead of themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question's from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. George, could you help us to quantify anything that you talked about? For example, the synergy pull-through from 2013 and 2012 would be one? And secondly, when you talk about acceleration in gross profit per script, is that because of the makeup of your scripts as you lose some of the lower profitable United scripts? Or are you saying your underlying book is still going to have a nice high single-digit growth in gross profit per script?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good questions. I'll do my best here. Again, I'm not providing earnings guidance. So I want to make sure we're clear on that. But from a overall perspective addressing the second half first, yeah, we're continuing to pull in our synergies. And we are still working with our clients in order to promote mail, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, that mail year-over-year is up 3% on an equivalent basis. And we're continuing to sell our clinical programs. These things are all driving down the cost of healthcare for our plans and our members and increasing profitability for us. Those trends will continue into next year.</p>
          <p>And our belief is that we will grow gross margin and EBITDA per script. Obviously gross margin grows because of getting more pull-through in our client base, better pull-through in our client base of our programs and generics and mail and all those type things. On the other side of the coin, EBITDA per script will continue to grow because of reductions in our cost structures. And that's including some dis-economies of scale that are occurring with respect to the UnitedHealth business going off. So even with those dis-economies, we believe we can grow EBITDA per script in the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>As far as &#x2013; what was the first part of your question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the synergies, I know you wouldn't talk about specific numbers, but can you help even directionally, George, how to think about maybe in a percentage? Or you expected some component in 2013? And what was pulled through to 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah, as you know, we've taken up guidance quite a bit in 2012. That's the result of &#x2013; mostly of the synergy pull-through that's occurring. The tax rate's gone up, and we are still exceeding our numbers. That takes additional synergies to make that happen as well. So the synergy pull-through has been good.</p>
          <p>Where it gets tough, and I think Jeff made this point after we closed the NextRx acquisition, is there's an Express Scripts run rate number, there's a Medco run rate number, and then we believe we can take each of those and get a synergy out of it. But when you actually start putting the books together, last week on November 1, we moved our largest tier ever of clients, thousands and thousands of daily prescriptions were moved into the new platform. Then when we do that, we link them up with the best rebate programs, the best network opportunities, and we start the pull-through.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our supply chain people are out trying to negotiate better discounts on both the network pharmacy prices as well as the rebates. Those are coming together. How much of that is synergy versus what we would've already got? That becomes very difficult. The ability to say what would have Express Scripts grown on a stand-alone basis versus how much is synergy? Every day we move away from closing becomes more and more clouded.</p>
          <p>We feel very good with where we're at but let me just say it another way. If we would go back to the 3% trends that we would have realized before the economy slowed down that actually now we're in a negative trend this year, utilization trend, and we would have realized &#x2013; so therefore our groups would have grown. They would have been adding more lives. You know, this may be a whole different conversation, but that's not the world we live in.</p>
          <p>The world we live in says people are taking less medications this year than they took last year and our membership and our plans aren't growing and that's what's causing the issue. This is a volume issue, not a earnings per Rx issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow on to that, can you help the market though to understand. What we are consistently hearing from investors that they're concerned about is that this is a price issue. As you went out and renewed business and won business, the concern going into 2014 is that it's a much more competitive PBM market. Can you give us your insights as to what you think on the pricing side? And what customers are looking for, because to this concern when you talk about customers' expectations increasing that that's just a code word for they want more the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We deal with large employers and medium-sized employers and health plans, and I will tell you I remember my first earnings call in 1998 at Express Scripts one of the big issues we faced was pricing pressure and the competitiveness of the PBM industry. I will tell you it is 16, 14, 15 years later that has not changed. This is a very competitive marketplace. We deal with very sophisticated clients, and they want a bigger piece of the pie.</p>
          <p>Our job, as I've said since I was CFO, is our job is to balance that delivery of value to them with the prices we need to stay competitive. I believe we have many tools in order to help drive down their costs, Consumerology to TRC's to the clinical programs we are running that allow us to meet the needs of our clients and maintain our price.</p>
          <p>I will tell you, Lisa, pricing is incredibly competitive, but at the same time we can offset that, otherwise EBITDA per script would not be rising, it would be declining. It's not that this is an easy walk, it's just that we have a lot of tools and opportunities to help control that. I still believe that we have the best offering out there. The consultant's job is to try to get us all within a range, and then we try to sell. Like I've said for years, we never want to be the best price in any deal, and I think we've maintained that stance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you for your comments.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning, George. I just wanted to follow-up on the previous comments you just made regarding a negative utilization trend this year. It seems to suggest that we're seeing were seeing continued deterioration throughout the year, but yet if you look at the industry data per IMS and other sources it would suggest that the script volume is actually going in the other direction, is actually accelerating as the year goes on. And I'm just trying to reconcile maybe what you're seeing within your customer base versus maybe what industry data seems to suggest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had this conversation over the last quite a few years. I've never been able to quite understand IMS's data. It never lines up well with our data. All I can tell you Glen is what I see in our numbers. We see utilization trends declining. We represent a pretty big piece of the puzzle here. It's clearly happening. That's notwithstanding all things we are trying to do to make sure that our diabetic and our hypertensive and our cholesterol clients and patients continue on their disease state regimens. I'm just reporting what we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe if I could just follow up on the revenue issue, because it clearly suggests and that may be that revenue expectations out there are a little bit too high, and you said two things I want to follow-up with. First, UNH, it kind of sounds like UNH is rolling off in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014? Can you help us think about the timing of when we should start to think about those claims coming out of the top-line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They come off throughout 2013, which means that when you compare 2013 to 2012 they're roughly 50%, it's not quite that number, but just assume 50% of the claims are going to be out during 2013, which means when you get to 2014 they are all gone, but then you still had 50% in for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you've got to bridge it down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear. The retention rate I think you said was 94%. So as I think about building that model in 2013, I know you don't want to give guidance, but based on your retention rate comments are we starting fiscal 2013, I think you measure retention rates based on claims volumes. So are we starting fiscal 2013 6% in the hole on claims volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot that goes into that. That is a factor into it. You've got to bring in the new sales wins that are going to add back to it, then you've got to reduce it by negative utilization if that persists. And then you have to figure out what all the other clients' attrition rates are going to be. That's why we are not giving guidance right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then my last question, then I promise I'll jump off, is UNH, as it rolls off you seem to suggest that maybe there's going to be a little bit of dis-economies of scale. And when we traditionally thought about UNH, it had very little mail volume I thought. So as these retail claims run off, I'm just trying to understand that dis-economies of scale comment as I think about where gross margins or the impact it could have on gross margins over the next 12 months.</p>

          <p>We have an obligation to the patients that are served by United and those plans to make sure that they have quality service, and just because they're rolling off the book, we still have to have the clinical support to provide all the step-therapy programs and all the other programs that they are offering, PAs and on and on and on. They do have some mail, not a lot, but they do have mail volumes. And so we've got to &#x2013; we intend to support all that. You can't let people go. There's a lot of account managers that service their accounts. And until they are transitioned away, we can't reduce that account management field force. So there's a lot of costs, a fair amount of costs that are attributed to the account that can't go away. Well, they can step down, but we can't step it down until after we hit certain intervals of business reduction that causes dis-economies of scale to occur.</p>

          <p>George, you have about $1 billion on the balance sheet, probably up to about another $1 billion coming in, in the fourth quarter if not more. How much do you need to run the company?

          <p>Bob, I've always tried to be a good steward of our balance sheet. I would really prefer to answer that when we come out with our 2013 guidance. Obviously, we're going to look at both the proper levels of debt <mark type="ph" /> the right (26:14) &#x2013; I'm a big fan of leverage, so we want to keep the right level of leverage on our balance sheet, but at the same time and enter into the right stock buyback programs. But I'm not really prepared to do that until we see have a year's rolling out and provide all of that at one time. I don't want to piecemeal guidance here.</p>

          <p>I think because we're a quality company that's providing tremendous value to our shareholders, and when you &#x2013; what I'm telling you is that the stock ran up, we felt an obligation to tell people that it was aggressive, and there's a lot of catalysts that still can occur. I don't know what the economy is going to look like over the next two months. Today's a big day. And we'll see how all this plays out, and where it leads, and how does consumer confidence come back. I can't give you a whole lot more than that, Bob. That's where we're headed.</p>

          <p>Thanks for the questions. I just want to circle back on the pricing comments. I understand and appreciate that you operate in an environment where every year pricing is always challenged as clients look for more savings. But I guess, just, George, if you could spend a little more time there because it seems to be a big concern. Are you saying that the pricing environment today or as you look into 2013 is incrementally worse than the trends that you've seen over the last several years? Or is it more really just a continuation of what goes on in the PBM industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a continuation of what goes on in the industry. And what happens is if you can't &#x2013; if as a PBM your account management team and clinicians can't present to the client new ideas to confront their issues, say they &#x2013; all the sudden they hire some people, or somebody comes down with a severe illness, and healthcare costs are jumping on them, going up. Our job is to try to help them navigate that, to come up with the best solutions. If they don't feel we're able to offer that, one of two things happen. Either the price discussion gets tremendously more complex &#x2013; difficult, or they leave because somebody else is offering them something better.</p>
          <p>Our job is to continue to look at new opportunities, new products and new ways to manage those costs. I think we've gotten better at that. And that's why I said and I continue to say that gross margin per adjusted Rx as well as EBITDA per adjusted Rx will go up next year, because I believe we're focused on doing the right things and providing value to our patients and value to our clients. As I said a few minutes ago, this is a volume game, not a price game.</p>

          <p>I guess just trying to piece together some of the comments on the call this morning, around the cash position and obviously the stock, your view of the stock being significantly undervalued. Would you guys consider straying from your two times debt-to-EBITDA benchmark that you'd put out there as far as deploying capital towards share repurchases? Or is that a pretty hard and fast metric that you're going to hold to?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on the comments about United and the dis-economies of scale. And I was wondering if there was any way to quantify what kind of impact that could be. We realize that you do have an obligation to provide clinical support, but United scripts were also relatively low-profitability scripts. Is there any way to get our heads around what kind of impact that could have as that business rolls off? If you are losing low profitability scripts versus the amount of cost to retain and service the customer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's put things in perspective. Profitability or profit, gross margin per script is almost irrelevant when it comes to dis-economies of scale. There is a cost structure that has to support that business. So, we have lots of people that work on that account. Whether you are taking off $0.05 scripts or you're taking off $5 scripts, you still have a cost structure. So what is occurring is you are spending more and more of those costs against less and less of those scripts, no matter what the gross margin is. Therefore you are having dis-economies of scale as those scripts run off.</p>
          <p>Until we are in a position to be able to redeploy all those people into either other jobs or unfortunately take them out, we are not going to realize the cost reductions in lock step with the runoff of the revenues. That's just the way the business works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we think about that for 2013, is a possible offset? Is it your position you will be able to offset it? Or you think it'll be a drag next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll be a drag in 2013 and then in 2014 we have to turn a lot of things off in the first quarter, which will be a bit of a drag and then based on sometime in the second quarter of 2014 &#x2013; again, that's depending that everything stays on target. We don't control this one. We're providing all the help we can to United to move these individuals, these plans over to OptumRx, but if they fall behind or they don't meet their schedules, then if it doesn't finish up by 1/1/14, we have a different answer. But assuming it's all done on one 1/1/14 by the second quarter 2014, we should be right sized and all the expenses out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We are hearing that clients are increasingly looking to move to the lower cost options you've talked about it in the past such as mail and narrow networks. Back in 2011 I think you thought the economy would really open mail penetration. With what you know today, what are your thoughts on mail penetration for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I still think it's a very strong program that helps clients, plans, to meet their needs. The clients are still, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, mail was up 3% in this tough economy. We're going through that process of understanding what the clients are going to accept for plan design, that's still under works, and we will give that guidance when we release 2013 guidance in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a same thing with narrow networks. That's a very good opportunity for clients to reduce costs by limiting the network access, and more and more clients are interested in that program. So, again when we release guidance, we will provide some insight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I noted you don't talk about specific customers, but we have been hearing from some other DOD suppliers that they are now seeing lower demand levels out of the DOD. You talked initially on uncertainty around budgets. Given the risk of sequestration and the potential Defense cuts, are the DOD employment levels reflected in your thinking on covered lives for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. DOD, that's &#x2013; we're not seeing lower demand in that book of business. That is a whole different program than an employer-based program. Sequestration by the way, we want to be partners with the Department of Defense, if they face that issue then I think there's some great things we can do to help them reduce cost. And we are meeting with them regularly, and it's a great client for us. We enjoy our relationship with them, and we are all proud to serve our men and women in uniform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, and again I know that you're not talking about growth, but from what I'm hearing on this call, and your comments on United and some deleveraging in 2013 and then higher profitability starting in 2Q 2014, as we think about the future and adjust our models, should we think about smoother earnings growth for Express over the next couple of years? Rather than kind of like the spike that we've been modeling and then more of a slowdown? Is that the right way for us to think about the trajectory for the next two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ricky, I can't speak &#x2013; we are not even giving 2013 guidance. I certainly can't speak to 2014 or 2015. We will take those on as we get closer to those time frames. Again, what I said was there were dis-economies of scale that we're going to incur with respect to the United book of business. I didn't discuss profitability in 2014, just that there was dis-economies of scale that would come out of the business in the second quarter of 2014. Again, that's all dependent upon the United transition of those lives, so we will have to see how that plays out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, George and Jeff. I mean this in a friendly way, but I guess some of your large competitors today are suggesting that they're not really seeing or expecting any end-group member attrition in their books of business for 2013. I guess I think a lot of people are just trying to figure out maybe is there something unique about your book of business, where maybe your large employer based may witness more employee attrition than what other PBMs might be witnessing? Is there any angle on that? Maybe WellPoint versus non-WellPoint or any comments that might help clarify some of that and why maybe you're seeing that but the other PBMs are not? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got 100 million Americans as our client base. We have 3,600 clients. So I think we've got a pretty good cross-section of America here. We have very large health plans and very small health plans. We are in every state of the union with clients. So I think we are pretty diverse when it comes to the book of business. I'm just telling you what we are seeing. The way the process works is we don't do these things in a vacuum. We have been doing it for a lot of years. So when we go to do our budgets for the following year, we reach out to our clients. We don't know how their sales seasons are going, and we don't know when they sell whether they're selling an integrated life on the health plan side? Are they selling PBM or non-PBM lives?</p>
          <p>So we have to capture all that data in order to roll up our numbers into our annual forecasts and what we are going to do. When you look at the numbers that are coming up to us, that's what we're seeing. We are seeing our plans are saying that they expect attrition. We are not in a position to second guess that. We are running with those numbers. We are going to work with them, but again, all this becomes clear in January and we will be in a position to provide clarity in January when we actually get our enrollment figures.</p>

          <p>That's helpful. One quick follow up, is there anything restricting you on doing share buybacks right now if you wanted to, either debt covenants or some other factor? I know you're not guiding to that, but is there anything restricting you if you wanted to theoretically?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Maybe looking at 2012, if I recall you guys were assuming a big step up in the share count, and it seems like the share count itself as we think about it next year could have a big swing on what earnings is. Jeff or George, can you give an update on what you're expecting here for end of year share count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still expecting 750. We haven't moved it off of that. Obviously that means there's going to have to be a pick up here in the fourth quarter. But that is still our best estimate. Obviously that means that 750 for the year, because the first quarter was low. So obviously there's a big pickup in share count into 2013, because we don't have a first quarter without Medco averaged in again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The assumption is that if I recall correctly in your mind it's what the assumption into why the step up is that we're assuming the Medco grants all get exercised here as we get into the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a lot of legacy Medco employees that have a lot of share-based comp that has the ability to be exercised. And it's hard for us to estimate when they are actually going to exercise those shares and they go into our fully diluted count.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lastly, obviously I understand you are not giving guidance, but the commentary that you gave us more or less told you what the top end of the range won't be. Can you us give a sense, and I know people have asked in a couple different ways, is there any sort of way to talk about what the absolute bottom end might be so that the we can at least think about qualitatively about next year?

          <p>Our next question is from Ross Muken with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess as you think about the unemployment environment in the U.S., I know we've sort of beat this over the head, but I guess when we look at our data it seems like the environment is improving. So I guess what is there in terms of the election tonight that you are also looking for, whether it's reform-based or other, that also can influence that assumption on what utilization could look like for next year and into 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's make sure we're clear here: we're not giving guidance. We are saying is what our clients are telling us their thoughts are. So, if in fact our clients' health plans stay stable on employment, if in fact our employer groups hire more people because they get optimistic about the Christmas season and the holiday season and next year, there could be a significant upside.</p>
          <p>I'm not saying this is all a doom and gloom story. I'm just telling you based on what we've heard from our client base is what we thought that we think that the numbers out there are overly aggressive. When you look at employment data and you see employment trends, you have got to go deeper than just what the employment rate is. As you know, you've got to understand whether or not those jobs that are being added to the economy are actually getting provided healthcare coverage.</p>
          <p>If they're not being provided healthcare coverage, then that &#x2013; the small employer number, as you know, that gets added into the annual employment numbers and the monthly employment numbers is a guestimate and that's why they always true it up a month later, because they take a set number and they add it to the best guess because there's no way to get those numbers from small employers. They true it up a month later and you come out with the number. Well, small employers aren't necessarily adding healthcare coverage right now. They're waiting to see what's happening. So as the economy starts to heat up and as small employer jobs start to be created and the economy starts to grow, the question is, will they add employment?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, in 2014 all those people are going to get covered. So in 2014, we're going to see, all the people that don't have coverage today or that are being put on the sideline without coverage will have access to coverage. All those people will enter the rolls. I don't know if that's 30 million, 40 million or 50 million by then, but it's going to be some number and that's an opportunity for us. That's an opportunity to work with our health plans to go and get salespeople and provide the coverage.</p>
          <p>All we're saying is that the rollup of our client base is more pessimistic and we don't know and what we will do is once we get the employment numbers in, once we get enrollment numbers in January, we'll refine it, we'll work with it, we'll see all of January's results and we'll know what script counts are through the month of January and I think we'll be in pretty good position to give pretty accurate guidance in February of 2013.</p>
          <p>And, you know, I hope like crazy that the economy is really strong. I'm a big patriot and I love this country and there's nothing more than I would like to see than strong employment trends, people adding people to the ranks and our health plans all growing. That would be amazing. And let's keep our fingers crossed that that's what we we're reporting on in February.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my point being, do you think that there's any read-through from the health plans that kind of the uncertainty over the exchanges and sort of reform and obviously without knowing who the president's going to be, it's tough to know the trajectory there, so do you think some of that could explain maybe some of the pessimism of the client base on why they may not be as bullish on sort of enrollment and utilization?</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thank you. I want to go back to, I think it was Lisa's question, talking about synergies, and it's difficult to break out. I guess I really don't understand that. And the reason I'm bringing it up is when I look at consensus EBITDA estimates they're really high and they're really all over the place and I have a feeling that people are putting a same story EBITDA growth on your business and then adding what they think the synergies are and ex-ing out UNH.</p>
          <p>So I guess my question is, I know maybe you don't want to break out what the synergy number is up versus what real same-store EBITDA growth was in the quarter, but directionally, can you give us what you think the PBM business is growing on a same-store basis? Is it growing mid-single digits? Is it growing high single digits? Is it growing low single digits? Because I think that would reduce some of the overestimates out there, especially with EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question isn't, the issue isn't whether we are willing to give EBITDA numbers. What I was trying to say was &#x2013; let's assume &#x2013; let's just make up simple numbers. Let's say Express Scripts had rebates per script of $1 and Medco had rebates per script of $1.10. One very simple synergy is to move all of the Express Scripts members into the Medco formularies provided the plans will allow you to do that. And if they do, then you would end up at $1.10 or $0.10 a script on the Express Scripts numbers. That would &#x2013; in my mind would be considered a synergy.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to that, brand prices go up 10% a year. So it's Chris Houston's job and her team that work in our supply chain to go out and try to capture that 10% growth as an increase in our rebate numbers. When you have a drug that is the exclusive in a class, that's a very difficult thing to do. When you have three or four competing drugs in a class, it's much more easier to do. So it's a question of how much of that price increase can we gain back for our clients and for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The synergy calculation becomes mixed because what ends up happening is as we move the two plans together, we go onto one platform, one rebate, one formulary calculation of what the rebates are. And when we do that, so if we had $1.00, $1.10, next year it's $1.12. How much of that is synergy and how much of that is end group growth? You really can't determine that any longer because all the numbers are getting co-mingled.</p>
          <p>That's the only point we are trying to make is that we go in where we think we should be, we put that out in specific targets to our members. And as long as they're achieving those targets, then we are hitting our end group growth off our base business as well as our synergy targets and we monitor that. We are not in a position to give that information out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. What about &#x2013; did you talk about &#x2013; I know you said you had a 94% retention rate. Can you talk about just renewal pricing for 2013? What does that look like, maybe for the Express Scripts book of business versus the Medco book of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that there was much difference. Our clients are very synonymous so &#x2013; or homogeneous, I should say. We both have clients in the large employer group, and the health-plan group. I think what our teams try to do is that there were certain things that Express Scripts did better than Medco and vice versa. So they are looking for upon renewal is because of the cost of inflation and all the other pieces and the rising cost of healthcare, they're looking at prices to come down.</p>
          <p>And the question is how do you meet those cost reductions that they are looking for? If you don't have any tools, it all comes out of your pocket. If we can offer better formulary decisions, better clinical programs, better options, then it doesn't have to come out of our pocket and we still achieve the desired results that they need. And that's our job. And that's mixed across the entire book. Again, this is a competitive environment. But we feel good about where we sit. And the fact that gross margin per script is going to go up next year should speak to the pricing environment in my mind.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just getting back to the EBITDA question, you do think your base business is growing despite the Medco benefit and despite the synergies you get? I mean just getting back to people's concern about pricing, just this PBM business continues to grow? I think that's what people want to know.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I would say it is growing.</p>
