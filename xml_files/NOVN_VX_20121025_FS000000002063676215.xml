        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay. Starting on Slide #4, as in the first half of the year, our recently launched products supported Novartis sales in the quarter. Our core EPS was $1.34, and importantly, cash flow was $3.5 billion in the quarter. We also achieved a number of regulatory milestones in the quarter, most notably Afinitor in advanced breast cancer and Jakavi in myelofibrosis.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the financials for the quarter, sales of $13.8 billion and core operating income of $3.9 billion. Jon's going to take you through some of the details in a minute. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities of extending our lead in innovation, accelerating growth, and driving productivity. And I want to just touch on each one of those, starting with innovation.</p>
          <p>So in the third quarter &#x2013; on Slide #7 &#x2013; we delivered nine regulatory milestones. Besides the two that I mentioned, Afinitor and Jakavi, we received approval to Seebri Breezhaler in Europe and Japan. This is key to our respiratory pipeline and to QVA, which we also have filed now in the EU.</p>
          <p>On Slide 8, importantly, we received first interpretable results of our Phase III trial on serelaxin in acute heart failure. So we're right now in the process of discussing results with the regulatory agencies and we're going to present our results on November 6 at the American Heart Association Congress in Los Angeles.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth, Pharmaceuticals had a very good quarter, with the launch brands offsetting the Diovan patent expiration. And importantly, we were able to show an increase in core operating margin during this period to 33.4%.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, in emerging markets, China really led the growth with 22% for the group. Our businesses in China continued to perform well behind, not just the new launches, but also very good base execution.</p>
          <p>Alcon's growth rate was below the year-to-date average, with sales growth of 3% in the quarter, and this is primarily driven by two factors. First, they had a very strong year-ago base, specifically a very strong allergy season in Japan a year ago and a shift in some order patterns in the Middle East. But secondly, we did feel some price competition in monofocal intraocular lenses in Europe. We expect this to be a temporary issue as we respond competitively, and we do expect a stronger fourth quarter more in line with the year-to-date results.</p>
          <p>Now despite that quarter, Slide 12 shows that Alcon is really positioned well. In IOLs, we're the market leader with over a 50 share and we're now focusing on execution excellence. In glaucoma, we've gained share this year, driven by global gains in Duotrav and TRAVATAN ex-U.S. And in contact lenses we're gaining share in monthly silicon hydrogel lenses.</p>
          <p>Now while Sandoz results were impacted by the loss of exclusivity on enoxaparin and the slowdown of production due to the quality issues at some plants, there is some very positive news. Sandoz delivered double-digit growth rates in Western Europe, in Asia, and also in Russia and biosimilars were up 35% versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>I think we've made some good progress on our remediation efforts in the few sites across our network that have quality issues. We did have an FDA inspection in Broomfield, Colorado, which was one of the Sandoz warning letter sites, and that audit was &#x2013; or that inspection was satisfactory. So across the divisions we have had many good or satisfactory inspections in the third quarter, and that includes sites in pharma, sites in Alcon, and sites in vaccines.</p>
          <p>I'm still not happy with the progress that we're making in Lincoln, so we are ensuring our return to market through third-party manufacturers, which will reduce our dependence on the remediation efforts at Lincoln. So remediation continues. We're making progress, but it's just not fast enough, and we're returning to market with copackers. Also some of our Sandoz sterile sites are still under intense remediation, but overall we are making good progress and have isolated this issue to a very few number of sites.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to say that we've relaunched three very important over-the-counter drug brands back into the U.S., and this includes Excedrin, which is the lead brand. We have very strong relaunch plans in place, and we're executing now to regain our market share. We're also making good progress in productivity. We delivered over $350 million in procurement savings this quarter. We have divested or exited 15 manufacturing sites since the beginning of the manufacturing footprint project, and our marketing and sales spending continues to decline as a percent of sales, and this is despite the fact that we are executing a number of new product launches.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn it over to Jon to go through the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe, and good morning or good afternoon to you. As you have already concluded, there's a lot to talk about this quarter, both in terms of performance for the year to date, and perhaps more importantly, some of the trends which lay over the next three or four quarters.</p>
          <p>Before getting into the detail, the summary results are shown here. Sales declined 2% in constant currency for the quarter and are 1% behind last year for the nine months. Core operating income declined by 3% while reported operating income grew by 5%. In the interest of time, I won't go through this reconciliation, but a simple explanation is that the net impact of amortization of one-off items was lower this quarter than last year. And there's a full reconciliation as a back-up to these slides.</p>
          <p>Core EPS for the quarter was 6% below last year, while reported EPS was 2% higher. Cash flow remains pretty strong, with $3.5 billion generated in the quarter and almost $8 million for the nine months.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows the disaggregation of sales for both Q3 and the nine months, demonstrating as always that there's a lot of moving parts under the surface. Importantly, however, the underlying growth of volume remains solid at 6%. And the other parts here are reasonably self-explanatory. The significant part of the price erosion comes from Sandoz and the recent acceleration of price competition for enoxaparin. The pharma business as a whole remains pretty resilient, with a net price decline of 1%, even though in Europe it's running at about 5% negative.</p>
          <p>Generic impact is 4% in the quarter, as we begin to face competition to Diovan in the U.S., and this includes a significant reduction in the value of Diovan inventory in the channel. I'll come back to this in more detail later, but in quarter four, the impact of generics is likely to be around 5% of sales.</p>
          <p>Lincoln's obviously disappointing, as we'd hoped to begin resupplying customers in the second half. In fact, we are for some OTC products, but from third parties. Q4 is likely to be tough for consumer health as it has been for the previous three.</p>
          <p>Finally, currency is a negative 5% for the quarter and 3% for the nine months. And this gap should narrow in the fourth quarter for both sales and profits. So that's a quick summary.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows you an area where we continue to perform outstandingly well, in growing our portfolio of recently launched products, which now amounts to 29% of the portfolio at almost $12 billion for the nine months. And this includes a decline in enoxaparin sales. The pharma is particularly impressive and David will take you through this story in a moment.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 shows the summary of the overall performance. Clearly it's mixed, with only Pharma and Alcon contributing operating leverage and improving margin. However, given the challenges facing some of the divisions, the 40-basis point decline for the group shows an overall high degree of resilience. And I'll now look at some of the divisions in more detail.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Sandoz on Slide 22, although the magnitude of the movements for the quarter and year to date are relatively large, the story's actually quite straightforward. The single biggest impact is a decline in enoxaparin from $259 million in quarter three 2011 to $34 million this quarter. Recent price declines have been very severe and the quarter result includes the impact of resulting inventory and revenue adjustments. We now expect enoxaparin run rates to be at relatively low levels from now on.</p>
          <p>This overshadows, however, some really excellent performances around the world where we have double-digit growth in many markets and the regions, as you can see here. Our biosimilars business is performing particularly strongly, with growth of 35% in the quarter and 42% for the year to date.</p>
          <p>In addition, Sandoz has benefited from partnering with Pharma on Diovan HCT. Around $100 million of sales have been made so far and Sandoz has around half the generics market. There will be more benefiting quarter four if and when we face competition to Diovan mono. Of course, these sales will evaporate on day 181, and you need to think about this in your models for next year.</p>
          <p>On the profit side, the impact on sales is exacerbated by two factors. Firstly, continued investment in biosimilars and respiratory portfolios, which contrary to some commentary, is making good progress, and remediation across our sites, some of them one-off in nature, but there will be an ongoing profit impact this year and beyond.</p>
          <p>Turning to Alcon on Slide 23, Joe's already given you some of the factors behind the weaker-than-usual quarter. As you can see from this slide, the biggest impact is in the surgical segment. And there are two broad things to this, firstly, the lapping effect from last year. Although many of these effects themselves are not significant, the impact is worth around two points of growth overall, and Joe's already covered the main items.</p>
          <p>The second factor underlying Q3, surgical performance, however, are weaker procedure patents in the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. is coming off a strong trend line from the last six months, while in Europe, some governments are restricting procedure volumes, adding to which there is more price competition on the IOLs, especially monofocals. In the latter case, we've instituted plans to recover share and increase penetration of our advanced IOL platform.</p>
          <p>I do think, however, that we've responded quickly with resource adjustments, and together with the delivery of synergies, we protected profitability, and indeed, as you can see from here, increased the Alcon margin over quarter three 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to pharma, and obviously David will go into the product and pipeline performance, which I think represents another outstanding quarter. As we head into the next three to four quarters of increased Diovan erosion, there are three points I'd like to make on how the story will evolve over the next few slides.</p>
          <p>On the first point, you can see on Slide 24 how well the business has performed since the beginning of 2010. In fact, the business has had an uninterrupted record of 10 consecutive quarters with quarter-on-quarter margin growth. This is a combination of the rate of growth of profit contribution from new products exceeding the incremental investment, together with the underlying productivity programs.</p>
          <p>The best form of defense to patent erosion is to be as strong as possible when the event comes, and we certainly improve the quality of profitability over this period, and without diminishing our ability to grow new products. Turning to Diovan on Slide 25, fortunately for us the generic picture some five weeks after Diovan patent expiry in the U.S. is still not clear, at least not for the mono form of Diovan, which is about 50% of the business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this means that we have some upside in quarter four, and we now estimate the 2012 generic impact, which includes Diovan, Femara and other smaller brands, to be around $2 billion. And that's down from $2.2 billion as we laid out in quarter two. This slide sets out how we see the situation today.</p>
          <p>And you should note however, that there's no free lunch here, and any upside to this year's numbers is likely to be offset by high erosion next year. In fact, this is an important point. If you compare the next few slides with what I've showed you in previous quarters, the estimated impact of generic erosion in 2012 has lessened. And given that we don't expect to be in a different position at the end of next year, any benefit in 2012 will be reversed in 2013.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 shows the expected profile of generic erosion over 2012 and 2013. Generic erosion will peak in the first half of next year before declining. So as you can see from the next slide why we believe the pharma business can emerge strongly from Diovan in the second half of next year. With all the positive news flow we've had over the last few months, I don't see the contribution from new products diminishing.</p>
          <p>Of course, the sales trajectory is not the only factor, and I know that many of you are focused on profitability. And this is something we're still working on to balance short-term profitability with the needs of the portfolio. As we told you last quarter, we're not afraid to continue to invest behind growth opportunities. A list of opportunities that's longer today than it was even three months ago. Of course productivity is a big piece too. And there's no let-up in the intensity of the &#x2013; in productivity programs, which continue to release resources equating to around 4% of sales each year.</p>
          <p>For the sake of completeness, on Slide 28 I include the usual reconciliation of operating income to earnings per share. There are really no new items to discuss here, although there is some erosion of the score operating performance from 3% of the operating level to 6% to earnings per share.</p>
          <p>On Slide 29, you can see the delivery of free cash flow, down on last year, but still substantial at $3.5 billion for the quarter and $7.9 billion for the nine months.</p>
          <p>And finally on net debt on Slide 30, shows that despite this cash flow, the net debt at 30 of September of $15 billion has really not changed from the beginning of the year. As you can see, this is down to the payment of the dividend and the recent acquisition of Fougera. What you can't see from this slide is the recent refinancings, where we've prefinanced all of our 2013 maturities at very attractive rates, especially for 30-year money, recognizing that debt needs to be a permanent part of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So in closing, I'd prefer that as we enter the next four quarters of Diovan erosion, we had all divisions firing on all cylinders. This, however, is at least true for the pharma business, which I believe is performing as well as any in the industry, not just in terms of current performance, but also in terms of pipeline development.</p>
          <p>And I'll let David update you on that now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. As you mentioned, the Pharmaceutical division delivered solid profit growth in Q3 and that's despite seeing the first generics against Diovan HCT. Top line was flat. Actually it was up a very small amount, but more importantly, the main story is the six-point odd growth in core operating income, driven both by productivity initiatives as well as us beginning to see some of the initial benefits of having a portfolio that's weighed a little bit more toward specialty products.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Slide #33, you see that the recently launched products are growing strongly contributing to 8 points of growth. Unfortunately, that's offset by pricing as well as generics for the overall net change of zero in constant currency.</p>
          <p>On Page 34, we see the group of recently launched products that we've been tracking each quarter for you. They grew strongly at 24% in constant currency, and very importantly, it's good news going forward. It now represent 36% of our total sales. So essentially, our sales basis is being rejuvenated, replacing old legacy brands like Femara and Diovan.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Page 35, you see our track record of finding efficiency. In this particular slide, we can reticulate M&amp;S spend as a percent of sales, which we've been managing, I believe, quite well despite funding a fairly broad set of new launches which will pay benefits well into the future.</p>
          <p>On Page 36, our growth platform continues to deliver, and I would argue it has been exceeding most expectations. You can see strong double-digit growth across each of these key franchises. Particularly, I'm happy with the continued strong growth of Lucentis, which is growing 23% as we continue to expand into DME and RVO, as well as the very strong performance of Tasigna, which is growing 49%.</p>
          <p>I want to take you through a few of these other products in a little more detail, starting with Gilenya on Page 37. What you see is that Gilenya has more than doubled sales since the same period last year, and is, I would say, very likely to become a blockbuster in 2012. Part of the story here that's not well understood, we spoke about it briefly last time, is that our ex-U.S. growth is extremely dynamic. Ex-U.S. we have a market environment where many of the patients have started in hospital or in other centers and as a result of fixed dose observation that was added into the label, have had a much smaller impact.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., first dose observation is a bit more challenging. We do now have a network in place to serve the physicians who would want to have that done outside their office, and we're starting to see in the weeklies now the first beginnings of an uptick in new RXs, even in the U.S. I remain very bullish on Gilenya, and we'll have certainly more to say next year as new competition is expected to enter. I believe the opportunity for oral MS drugs is still largely untapped, and there's a lot of growth ahead.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at Slide 38, you see the first uptick, or uptake, of Afinitor in a newly approved breast cancer indication in the U.S. You can see that the growth is dynamic, and we are very, very optimistic that the incremental sales will be well in excess of $1 billion in this indication. Although I don't have the data for you on the page, I can tell you that the German dynamic is actually quite similar. So, we would anticipate that this product will do very, very, well.</p>
          <p>I want to just now spend a moment on QVA starting on Page 39. We believe that QVA is a very exciting opportunity in COPD. I believe that most have underappreciated the opportunity of this new combination of LABAs and LAMAs to become eventually the standard of care in COPD. And the lead that we have, at least ex-U.S., with the development in this category, we have the most comprehensive development program to date.</p>
          <p>And you can see from this slide, the data that is reported out and the data that will be reporting out in the very near term. And as Joe mentioned in his opening, we have now filed in Europe for QVA149 once per day in chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.</p>
          <p>Page 40 you get a quick snapshot update on the regulatory approvals and expected filings. This is largely what we had promised you with our last update. I would just add that we have recently received approval in addition to what's on this chart for Seebri once-a-day in the Canadian market, as well. So the story is good. The additional clinical trials that are required in the U.S., as we mentioned, are pre-agreed with FDA and they are about to start to enroll imminently, and we feel very good about these timelines.</p>
          <p>On Page 41, you see that our regulatory and development teams have been very, very busy. The pipeline has delivered eight regulatory milestones in Q3 2012, and we could have up to seven more during Q4. I think this repaints us as one of the most attractive companies in the industry in terms of taking our R&amp;D dollars and turning them into true innovation that can be commercialized. These products will continue to help us fuel growth post the patent expirations of Diovan and other brands.</p>
          <p>I'd like to sum it up on Page 42. The short message is the division's on track to realize its plans for 2012 and also our growing ambitions for the future. The growth platform itself is delivering above market expectations. We expect at least nine blockbusters by year-end, up from seven last year. In addition, we believe our pipeline is best in class, delivering both the significant regulatory milestones, including five approvals. Productivity improvements have delivered margin improvement for each quarter this year so far.</p>
          <p>And I am very excited to have the opportunity, along with Tim Wright, to update you on serelaxin at our R&amp;D Day on November 8. That's about two days after the data is shared with the American Heart Association. And with that, I'll turn the presentation back to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. So to close, we've made solid progress on our three strategic priorities in the third quarter. And our full-year performance is on track, so our outlook for 2012 remains unchanged. And that is group sales expected to be in line with 2011 in constant currency. And we expect core group operating income margin to be slightly below 2011 on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>The final slide, I just want to look forward in welcoming everyone to our R&amp;D Investor Day on November 8 in Boston. You'll have the opportunity to hear our key people from Research and Development as well as the Commercial side of the business. So you can see the agenda here. It's going to take you through our approach to innovation, our key programs, how we measure success. And I hope that you'll leave with a better understanding of how this innovation machine is different from some of our peers'.</p>
          <p>So, thank you, and now I'd like to open the session to questions.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:26) the mortality result on serelaxin was driven by cardiovascular causes. And assuming you can't comment on that, can you at least say the process that drives your decisions to include or not include the CV result in your headline press release? And then lastly, I know it's early days and you have an R&amp;D day upcoming, but can you comment on what benefits, if any, come from potentially commercializing serelaxin with LCZ696, your other heart failure drug?</p>

          <p>Regarding serelaxin, I really don't want to try to address any questions that might end up having me say more than I should be saying before the data is presented at AHA or before our discussions are completed with regulatory authorities around the lag. Just say that we are excited about the data. We think this is a great additional opportunity for our portfolio, and we will share as much as possible at the R&amp;D day.</p>
          <p>For LCZ, as you know, that's a product for chronic heart failure, while serelaxin is for acute heart failure. Should both of them end up with good data and approval, the ability to market both together would certainly drive an even better opportunity for our company.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my questions, two please. One for Jon, in terms of the comment that you made about the ongoing work on short-term productivity improvement, can you talk a little bit about cost savings versus phasing? This year clearly some things have gone according to plan, or they haven't, so how do I look at the margins in Alcon and Pharma in terms of efficiency gains and cost phasing? And the second question for David on Galvus, I think in the past you've been thinking that the product could make $1 billion this year. It looks like it's not going to quite make that sort of level, and the Q3 results seem to be off -trend. Is there anything going on in that line, or is it just taking a breather? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first one, I think they're not dependent in productivity to any one initiative. If you think about the total portfolio, which includes maybe hundreds or several hundreds of projects in procurement, which are phased over in some cases two or three years, all the work that we've been doing in manufacturing, or the work that's being done on adjusting sales forces in the Pharma business. These are not programs that really impact any one quarter, which is why we can say with a reasonable degree of confidence that they continue at a 3.5% to 4% rate, and in fact, we've probably done a little bit better than that this quarter. So these are pretty sound and well-established programs.</p>
          <p>In Alcon, however, you've got the added benefit of I guess the shorter cycle synergy programs, some of which come with the integration over the business. And if you notice on Page 6 of the press release that the Alcon &#x2013; sorry. It's on the top of Page 7. You see that Alcon has generated already $200 million of synergy benefit this quarter, some of which from the obvious things, but also joining our procurement programs has really given Alcon quite a considerable boost. So there's no one item that you should be looking out for, thinking about. It's a very broad program.</p>

          <p>Galvus continues to perform very strongly, so it was up about 40% for the quarter. We're particularly pleased with both Europe and Japan, and we have not yet seen sales really out of China yet, but we will after we get reimbursement in the future. You're right. We were hoping that it would be a blockbuster. But things like FX have gotten in the way. For this product, it was going to be a close call, and it looks like with FX it's probably going to have to be &#x2013; wait until next year before it becomes a blockbuster.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly on Diovan, we've now lost a third of U.S. Diovan sales, and the earnings have held up particularly well this quarter. That to me should provide some sort of floor on earnings. Now in the second half of next year, we should have annualized most of Diovan. So, should we expect EPS growth to resume in the second half of next year? And if that's not a given, then can you talk about some of the investment decisions that could lead to costs being higher than expected? I know you've talked about not wanting to be hamstrung and needing to invest in the business, so some of the things that you could be investing in would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Then on the manufacturing issues, obviously there have been issues in pretty much all of the businesses that could be considered non-core. Presumably, there has been some sort of investigation at a group level. Could you tell us what those issues might be down to? Have the cost savings potentially gone too far? Just some help as to whether or not there's some sort of systemic problem there, or it's just been bad luck? And then on Alcon, sales have grown 5% in the <mark type="ph" /> nine months space (33:39) and one of the key drivers is for it being slightly lower than we'd expected were E.U. pressures, which show no real sign of abating. So can you help us understand why you think Alcon will grow at mid- to high single-digits in the coming years? I'm assuming also the guidance still holds. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with Diovan, you're right that Diovan has gone in the U.S. And as we've said, 2013 is really going to be a year of two halves where the first half is impacted significantly by Diovan. In the back half of 2013, we would expect to come out with the growth trajectory that is nice. We're not going to give guidance today in terms of how 2013 will look. We'll do that at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>But one of the things that we're also thinking about is, you look at this launch machine and you look at new medicines like Afinitor, like Jakavi, continued growth on Gilenya, Tasigna and how important that is to the future. I want to make sure that we are funding those launches in a way that will ensure that as Diovan gets in our base in the back half of 2013, we come out with a nice growth trajectory. So those are the things that we're thinking about, and we're going through the budget crosses right now, and we'll be prepared to talk about 2013 at the close of the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of manufacturing issues, we have &#x2013; since January we have had 50 FDA inspections across all of our divisions, and the vast majority of those inspections have gone what I would describe as well or at least satisfactory. There are one or two where we've still got some significant amount of remediation, and while we're not out of the woods on those sites, it really is isolated to a very few number of sites.</p>
          <p>Now regardless of that, though, back in January we started on a group-wide effort to elevate quality on the agenda and to ensure that we have highest quality standards across all of our divisions and we've executed well against that. You just look at those 50 FDA inspections that have occurred, and I can say confidently that we do not have a systemic issue. It's isolated to a very few number of sites.</p>
          <p>I don't believe that cost savings has gone too far. For example when you reduce your costs, you should be able to improve quality, and that is really what we're focused on, because then you have fewer variations. You have fewer deviations. Your costs are reduced and your quality goes up at the same time, and that's what we'll continue to execute against. Kevin, on Alcon?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to remind you of the two factors that Joe highlighted at the beginning of the call regarding the Alcon growth. One is that there were a number of comp issues specific to last year in Q3, as well as one-time events in Q3 of 2012. Obviously we don't expect those to continue to go forward.</p>
          <p>The second issue which you raised is the European market environment for procedures. I think based on the work that we've done, we do see weakness in procedures across a few of the obvious markets like Spain, Italy, Greece. But when you look at procedure volume across the other markets, they seem relatively stable. At the same time, we've seen price sensitivity increase and some impact on market share, so our focus is going to be around how do we capture that market share back, which actually delivers an opportunity for us to grow. So that's the mechanism for how we feel we can grow at an accelerated rate going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. I'm just wondering in Diovan, how much inventory write-down actually was in there in the quarter and how much of that was against the monotherapy for which you haven't actually seen a generic at the time of taking the write-down. Second is on the consumer manufacturing. You said no Lincoln restart this year, just any thoughts on levels of capacity from the plants in 2013. And if not, how fast can you restore full production by third parties, and what is the margin implication of those third parties? And then third, a question on FX impact, you've got 90-basis point benefit on the operating margin in the quarter, but that was offset by hedging losses in financial expenses. And so you're fairly neutral at the net line on FX. But if FX rates stayed the same, how far out are you hedged? So how long would you actually see that hedging loss headwind? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so as the U.S. patent for Diovan expired September 21, we did increase the product retirement provision in line with what you would consider normal practices. I got to tell you though, the increase was relatively small because wholesaler destocking had already become apparent during the quarter. They had to destock in anticipation of the product going generic and, as you know, things didn't work out exactly as anticipated.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The Lincoln plant, as we look at the start-up, it's a sequential process, as we talked, line-by-line, product-by-product. I don't want to speculate on when we will be back, but that continues to be the focus at the plant. As far as third parties, we've announced the launch of Excedrin Migraine, Triaminic, and Lamisil, and Excedrin Extra Strength in January. And we're continuing to focus on bringing up our biggest brands at third parties as we seek to relaunch for next year.</p>
          <p>The margin impact is short-term. Gross margin impact really ranges product-by-product. It ranges from mid single-digits to low double-digits, but again, that's a short-term impact that we will address over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the only thing I'd add to that is that those products that we launched account for about 25% of those brands, 25% of what comes out of Lincoln, so the ones that we just started shipping in October. And by the end of the year, we'll be able to give you a better feel for 2013, what percent of sales that were coming out of Lincoln will be up and running in the co-packers and a little bit of more guidance in terms of costs to expect. But we do say that what's important here is to get back into the market, get our market share back and really separate the Lincoln remediation from getting this market share back. And that's really what we're focused on right now. FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On FX, Graham, your analysis is pretty good, although the piece that occurs after, under-operating profit in net financial income, I mean that is a very difficult piece to predict. And it really is the net item of two very large movements through our balance sheet, because we do hedge the balance sheet, but we don't hedge the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And we don't hedge the P&amp;L because predominantly, we rely on the total business mix that we have, which has a number of natural hedging elements in it. In terms of the 5% on the top line, I would say about two-thirds of that came from the weakness of the dollar. And therefore, a substantial part of that also flowed into the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>But obviously, in the P&amp;L, we have the offsetting benefit from the Swiss Franc cost base. So that's why we saw in the quarter the 5% on sales and 2% on profits, because of the big impact of the Euro and the hedging effect of the Swiss Francs. I think &#x2013; and I hate to make a prediction on this &#x2013; I think it should start to lessen in the fourth quarter, because the third quarter, up until the third quarter of last year is when we saw the really big movements in the early autumn of last year. So I'm hoping that within the fourth quarter, the impact will be a bit less than we've seen in the previous quarters. But the piece below operating income, there's really no pattern of prediction for that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and thank you for taking my question, three, if I could. Firstly with respect to Diovan mono in the U.S., your guidance that you'll see $200 million less generic impact this year suggests about eight weeks of Diovan beyond patent expiry, I think my back of the envelope calculation. Is there any reason why you've gone for eight weeks? You already seem to have four in the bag, or are you just guessing what we may see generic entry? Secondly, with respect to vaccines, it has been a tough division for a number of years, but now Q3, which is traditionally when you make your money, also seems to be extraordinarily disappointing and we have the ongoing problems in Italy. It doesn't look to me like the division will even break even this year. Can you confirm that that is true?</p>
          <p>And can you also give us an update on the interactions with the EMA on MenB? Are we on track for a decision before year-end? And then finally on generic Rituxan, as you suggested in your opening comments, very many players in biosimilars have highlighted that they are rethinking their strategy in light of regulatory commentary recently. What gives Sandoz the confidence that you've interpreted the regulations such that you are confident of moving forward in the near-term timeframe?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, the numbers are rough, right? And it's not just Diovan. There's other moving parts, but it's worth like &#x2013; Diovan mono not being in the market worth's about $25 million a week. About five weeks have elapsed so far. There's not much more to say than that. We simply do not know when a decision could be made for that product to enter the market. It's going to be up to the FDA or maybe even the courts as we understand it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of vaccines, Matt, obviously third quarter was a tough quarter for the vaccines business, but if you step back for a minute, we continue to believe that vaccines is a good business. If you look at the pipeline of our business with Bexero coming and with some of the other vaccines that are in the pipeline, we still believe that this can be a profitable and important part of the company. Now, we also &#x2013; maybe I'll leave to Andrin to talk about Bexero and what we expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So on Bexero, we still expect to get the regulatory action in Europe before year-end. Everything is on track for that. We have submitted all our answers to the outstanding questions, and I think basically that we are quite positive and that we will get a decision quite soon. Of course, once the decision would be made from a decision for launch and fundamental sales, it will take a bit of time. Vaccines are different from pharmaceutical products. Basically, in every country, we have to go through a very specific policy process before a country would adopt a public health policy decision to really start such an immunization program. We probably would see some of that next year, but I think the majority would really ramp up in 2014.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Matthew, on Rituximab, we've seen the emergence of what I would call a potential shakeout in biosimilars looking forward, as we've seen several of our competitors putting their Phase III clinical trials on hold for Rituximab. What I can say is that we've designed our clinical programs &#x2013; and we have several Phase III programs in addition to Rituximab in close consultation with regulatory authorities. And we continue to enroll patients and make progress on both our follicular lymphoma Phase III clinical trial, as well as our Phase II rheumatoid arthritis trial.</p>
          <p>I think two advantages that Sandoz and Novartis have versus competition, one is a learning curve factor. You know, we started our development work on the human growth hormone in 1996 and on EPO in 1997. And that gives us a bit of a first mover advantage. I think secondly, we have a strong cross-divisional team that's working on Rituximab, along with Novartis Oncology, that's really working diligently to drive enrollment in these clinical trials. And we are firmly committed to our biosimilar Rituximab program, as well as our overall portfolio of biosimilars.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Several questions, please. Firstly, at the second quarter result call, you said you would spend up to $300 million in the second half of this year on gross initiative, and yet you have delivered a very, very strong pharma margin. So did you spend any of that money in the third quarter? And if not, is that due to phasing issues and a lot of it will come in the fourth quarter? Or is it more like your hurdles to actually spend this money for the market team is quite high and you will end up spending not very much? Second question, can you just tell us what your European gross would have been if you strip out Diovan? Because I mean European gross is impacted by both generics and the price. So, I'm just wondering, excluding &#x2013; that you're already growing.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, I was quite surprised to see when I looked at your new Phase III studies for NVA/QVA that are required for the U.S. approval that these seem to be predominantly safety studies, safety the key endpoints. There's a particular focus on cardiac safety. Could you actually comment whether there have been any specific ECG observations with NVA237? Or whether this is a general FDA concern related to the class in view of what has been observed with <mark type="ph" /> Zareva Vestamed (49:03) and of course the LABAs. And the fourth question is on vaccines. All of your competitors seem to have either an approved or a filed version of quadrivalent flu vaccine. So I would expect 2013 flu season to pretty much go quadrivalent. What are you going to do to protect your flu sales next year, given that you don't seem to have one of those in the pipeline, unless I have missed it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with the first question on the $300 million spend, yes, at the second quarter, we said we would spend up to $300 million in the back half of the year. I can tell you that we have prioritized and started to spend against some additional incremental marketing on Afinitor, on Jakavi, on Gilenya, to boost those growth rates and to continue to keep them strong. But the majority of what the incremental piece will probably hit the fourth quarter, because again this was &#x2013; third quarter is when we basically made the decision to do it and so spread a little bit third quarter, more fourth, and the margin on Pharma would have been slightly higher because there's some incremental spend there. In terms of European growth ex-Diovan, David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well I think perhaps there's a little bit of a misconception. The end points, the key end points here, really and primary end points, are on efficacy. There are key secondary and key end points for safety throughout our program, and that's not unusual. That's important for determining the benefit risk, and this is really no emphasis, no particular emphasis, other than what is known for the class in terms of making sure that we have established cardiac safety as one of the key elements of this program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know I think, Alexandra, <mark type="ph" /> it is true (51:11) we are having a clear long-term strategy to upgrade a fairly old manufacturing network, and for the U.S. our key priority is to build a new cell culture, modern vaccine. For that reason, we have invested and built a large facility, and we expect that the cell culture vaccine to be licensed later in the year. And then of course, we will develop that vaccine into the right indications, so really it's a strong and very competitive vaccine. So we are having a few QIV program, but of course it's not going to be launched next year, but that's at least in our pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, one for Joe, the second for David. Regarding portfolio management, Novartis has never been one to follow strategic trends, but nonetheless a number of your competitors are looking at the shape of that portfolio. You've previously addressed vaccines and diagnostics, the importance of MenB, to what actually happens to that division. Just focusing on Consumer, to us at least, you look subcritical in mass and underinvested. I appreciate you're fixing the GMP issues, but it would be helpful if you could talk us to what it would take to actually exit from these areas. The group potential for JV, what are the gating factors that we should be thinking about? And is this a possibility with Novartis <mark type="ph" /> issues. Are you wed (52:59) to that division?</p>
          <p>Secondly for David, perhaps you could give us the break-out of pharma sales in China. I couldn't find it in the press release. And also, just some sense of what's driving those revenues. I'm assuming it's older rather than newer drugs. And then the final point was it's terrific that you've got 20% plus growth rates following the restructuring you've put in place there. One trend we've noticed from some of your peers is where there is a sudden acceleration of growth in China, it's often closely followed by scrutiny under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Could you just give us an update to what you're doing to ensure compliance in Novartis in China is held in check so that doesn't become a risk? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with your first question around portfolio management, I've said before that when you look at our five platforms for growth, they all play a role in the portfolio. And that really hasn't changed. So I wouldn't say that we're wed. You know you said are you wed to all of the businesses. I don't think we're wed to any of the businesses, but we believe today that the platforms that we have are very strong in terms of playing a role in the overall portfolio. For example, at Novartis, less than 55% of our total sales are reimbursed by some kind of a public agency, which means we are less impacted by some of the cost containment that's going on in some of the pure play pharma companies.</p>
          <p>Consumer health plays a very important role. While it's not a huge division, it's still a division that, pre-Lincoln, generated over $3 billion in sales, and will be a good grower: 100% self-pay, strong brands, so strong consumer loyalty, as evidenced by all of those consumers in the U.S. who are writing us and asking us to bring back Excedrin because nothing else works in their minds. So these are very, very strong brands, and consumer health plays a very important role.</p>
          <p>In terms of gating factors, obviously we need to see &#x2013; when I step back and I look at the divisions, the divisions have to accomplish a couple of things. The first is that they have to have best-in-class pipelines, because that's what we're all about, which is innovation. The next thing that they have to do is they have to grow ahead of market trend line. Meaning if their market's growing at 3%, they have to grow at 5%. If their market's growing at 5%, they have to grow at 7%.</p>
          <p>And then the third is that they have to demonstrate that they can create leverage. That means the bottom line has to grow faster than the top line. And if we decide that we're in a business that is not going to be able to accomplish that trend line, then that would be a gating factor to rethink. But right now, I feel like we've got a very strong portfolio. As we exit the Diovan patent expiration in 2013, you're going to &#x2013; you will see the kind of growth that I think we're capable of delivering. David?</p>

          <p>Yes. So we're very happy that China is performing well. You'll recall that some time ago, my predecessor, Joe, restructured our Chinese business into a regional set-up, which we now have operating quite well. The growth was about 20% for the quarter. You asked me what the main products are. They're mostly Diovan, Gleevec, Sebivo, Exforge and Aclasta. We have not yet seen any impact of a very good set of recent approvals in China, which will start to come through in the future. In particular, we now have approval for Lucentis, which is off to a good start. We have approval for Onbrez, and we have approval for Galvus, which will provide us, I think, even better-quality sales that are more price-protected in the future.</p>
          <p>You asked about compliance, and just &#x2013; I would just say rest assured our company has done everything that's in the power to be done on a worldwide basis to teach our people to be compliant both in terms of training coming from the top, and everything else. So I'm quite pleased with where our Chinese business is going, and leave it at that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for taking my question, just three small remaining. On Sandoz, you reported a decline of 6% in local currency. Could you just confirm us if your guidance of sales declining slightly versus last year is still holding? Then two quick one, could you also give us the status of Menveo in the babies less than two years old? And finally, I don't know if you have any breakdown of Lucentis sales in DME and RVO?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, our U.S. sales have been a little softer than expected. But with the U.S. co-Diovan launch, where, as John mentioned or David mentioned, we have about 50% of the market, and the integration of Fougera in Q4 of this year, we should still see a slight decline in sales for the full year. And then, as Joe noted on a positive note, we have very strong double-digit growth in Q3 across Western Europe, Asia, Latin America and Russia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I could go back to Relaxin, I think investors have been kind of unclear how to think about this program because your level in enthusiasm in the past has been low. And you've often described this in very cautious terms. So now having the data that you have, are you essentially saying that the program has substantially de-risked? Or is there still meaningful development and regulatory risk going forward? Second question, on the Generic front, can you tell us what you think will be the first biosimilar monoclonal to launch is and when this might occur? Could it be Merck's Remicade as soon as something like 2014? And last question is on Gleevec and the potential to extend the market exclusivity in the U.S. because of the polymorph patent that you have on the product?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So for Relaxin, we were purposely cautious in the past because although the Phase IIb data was very good, there had been no other agent for this disease in the past that had ever shown a mortality benefit. It was there, but we didn't want to get too excited based upon a Phase II trial. Now we see it again in a Phase III trial. And we are extremely excited about the product. So, yes, it is substantially de-risked, and we will tell you a lot more on R&amp;D day.</p>

          <p>Yes. The base patents for Gleevec in the U.S. expired with extensions, near the end of 2015. And you know that similar date is 2016 for Europe. But that of course only is the base patents, and there are a series of other patents, which now may or may not provide additional opportunity, and we'll try to lay it out in maybe one slide for you at the R&amp;D day. I'll ask <mark type="ph" /> Irvay (61:53) to try to do that. You know, it's hard to predict with any certainty exactly how that's going to play out, but I think most people have modeled the worst case scenario. Okay, last question.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my questions. A few quick ones, one's for Jeff, one for Andrin and one for David. Starting with something for Jeff, what could be the magnitude of the impact on the core operating margin of the division of the softer Diovan erosion in the U.S.? Is the 18% guidance &#x2013; the core operating margins for Sandoz being a little bit too cautious now? And just, could you give us a quick update on your respiratory projects in Europe and in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>Second question is for Andrin. Could you give us the total amount of sales generated from the Italian plant? And also where are you on your plans for Bexero in the U.S.? And that last one for David. What is your main objective for the 8 of November meeting as we see a lot of speakers from the oncology side? Are you also planning to give us more color on your ambitions on the recently launched products and the growth drivers of the pharma division outside oncology? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Florent, on your first question on the magnitude of the core operating margin impact of Co-Diovan, clearly the authorized generic has a positive impact, as David spoke to earlier. But as John mentioned, you know, at day 181, these things vaporize because they have hyper-competition when additional generic competition comes in. So in that sense, it's ephemeral. There's a positive short-term impact.</p>
          <p>We don't give margin guidance. So looking forward, there's not more than I can say. And I'm going to take the Fifth on respiratory as I have historically the last two, three years. We continue to make progress on our programs, both in Europe and in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the Italian site, we do not break down sites per sales, but in Italy we do have two sites, one is Rosia, where we produce bacterial vaccines, and then we have in Siena a second site which produces mainly flu vaccines and that site is one for flu vaccine sites that we have.</p>
          <p>On Bexero in the U.S., we are making progress in discussing with the FDA on really how to develop a better surrogate for efficacy. It's a difficult and complex scientific negotiation, but it is making progress. And we are evaluating now what type of Phase III trial to start. And actually, we have the tendency to maybe go directly into an ABCWY combination routine, which of course would then have a much better public health value. So that's right now where we stand.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. R&amp;D day, main objective, one is to, maybe the most important one is to give you a sense of how we take our innovation money, our R&amp;D money, and turn it into really excellent products, which provide a very, very good return on our investment. In terms of the agenda, it's true that Tim and I will focus mostly on gen med and the others will focus on oncology, which is an important part of our portfolio. But we will cover the entire gamut of opportunities, and I hope that you leave feeling as excited as we do about the opportunities that we have.</p>
