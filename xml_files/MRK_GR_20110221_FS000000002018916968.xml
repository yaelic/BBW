      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to start by summarizing the key highlights of 2010 on slide four. First message is we generated strong financial performance that was well-balanced over all the metrics. We delivered organic revenue growth of 8%, benefiting naturally from the improvement of the global economy, strong market segments of our Life Science and Pharmaceutical businesses, and continued strength in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Second, our Liquid Crystals business generated top performance, record performance, topping &#x20AC;1 billion for the first time, and by returning to margins above 50%. Liquid Crystal is and remains one of the most attractive businesses in the chemical industries. We had an outstanding year, yet we remained excited about its future potential.</p>
          <p>Third, we have transformed our chemicals business with the completion of the Millipore transaction. The transaction bolstered our presence in the U.S. while increasing our exposure to attractive segments like Biotechnology and the Life Science industry.</p>
          <p>The division generated an excellent year of performance, which is particularly impressive, if I may say, given the complexity of integration activities that were executed during the year. I am pleased to report, by the way, that our formal integration activities were terminated on February 1st and the new Merck Millipore organization is now fully in place.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono delivered solid improvements in its growth and profitability. Unfortunately, as you know, the performance is overshadowed by disappointments we experienced in our late-stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to make important investments in innovation to drive future growth. Opening of a research center in Billerica and this is for Merck Serono R&amp;D. Other R&amp;D centers as you know are located in Germany, Switzerland and China. We also opened a new materials research center here in Darmstadt to support the Performance Materials division.</p>
          <p>I would like to look a little bit at the six years history to make a point on our growth profile. Merck's organic revenue growth since 2005, if you adjust it for the financial crisis in 2009, it's basically a double-digit organic revenue growth since 2005.</p>
          <p>And this performance for me is a testament to our ability to drive innovation, establish leading market positions and also effectively manage our portfolio over time. By expanding our markets and continuing to invest in innovation, I believe that we will continue to be an attractive growth company with attractive growth rates also in future.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number six, which shows the sales by region. From a geographic perspective, our top-line performance is becoming more and more balanced. There's considerable growth coming from Asia, where we grew 36% during the year. Of course, the six-months contribution of Millipore contributed considerably to the year-over-year growth we saw in North America during 2010 given their strong U.S. presence.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to point out shortly that we have a considerably strong business in Latin America. This region continues to drive very strong performance, posting 15% during the year.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to the divisions. First, slide number seven Performance Materials. Performance Materials reported approximately &#x20AC;1.4 billion in revenue for the full year. This represents a top-line growth of approximately 38%, which included 27% organic revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The main driver of this performance was Liquid Crystals business, whose record performance benefited from the strong uptake of our PS-VA products, where we do have and enjoy a strong competitive position.</p>
          <p>We also saw increasing volumes for the other products in our Liquid Crystals mixture portfolio, and this led to a 52% return on sales margin, which was the highest level of profitability we've seen in this business for the past two years.</p>
          <p>Our Pigments and Cosmetics business generated good, steady performance throughout the year, delivering good revenue and good profit growth.</p>
          <p>I would be remiss without mentioning that the exceptional performance from Performance Materials came during a year in which the division also completed a reorganization, established a new organization and divested the Crop Bioscience Business. The divestiture was completed in February 2011.</p>
          <p>I move on to slide number eight and turning to the Merck Millipore division. A solid performance for both legacy Millipore and legacy Merck, and the performance was driven by strong underlying trends in several of our markets. This includes benefits from healthy demand from the biotechnology customers, particularly as in 2010 new molecules entered the market. And the division always sees strong incremental growth when a biologic enters the market where our products are part of the value chain.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from steady spending of academic customers. Many of those customers received incremental funds to invest into Life Science tools as a result of government stimulus initiatives. And finally, after a difficult 2009, many of the division's lab customers returned to purchasing laboratory instruments, which they deemed to be discretionary purchases in 2009.</p>
          <p>New product launches contributed materially to the division's growth. Also the division generated strong performance in emerging markets, such as China. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, Merck Millipore successfully completed its formal integration activities as of February 1st. And the fact that we have executed this integration and avoided any major disruption to our operations is a major accomplishment. We have retained key employees, such as Josh, put in place a new organization and launched a new brand identity for the division.</p>
          <p>And just to put this effort in perspective, we had 21 major integration teams involving hundreds of different employees that executed approximately 2,700 discrete integration tasks in only 9.5 months.</p>
          <p>I would like to move on to slide number nine, Merck Serono. It was a mixed bag for the division in 2010. I think we did an excellent job driving solid growth and profitability in the division, however, on the other hand, we had setbacks in our R&amp;D pipeline that will adversely affect our future growth prospects.</p>
          <p>The division generated &#x20AC;5.75 million in revenues during 2010, which included organic revenue growth of 5.1%. This growth translates into core return on sales of 22.2% compared to 18.7% in 2009, which is a marked improvement.</p>
          <p>Clearly, an important event for the division during the year was the negative CHMP decision on cladribine. We are awaiting the FDA decision on cladribine with a date on February 28th.</p>
          <p>On a positive note, we saw the approval of Erbitux in Japan for extended use for the first line metastatic colorectal cancer treatment and the approval of Egrifta in the U.S. for the reduction of excess abdominal fat in HIV infected patients with lipodystrophy. We also successfully divested our Th&#xE9;ramex business to Teva at the end of the year, which resulted in a &#x20AC;69 million gain for the division.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10 shows the growth rates by product and therapeutic area. Neurodegenerative diseases, represented by Rebif, our highest grossing product, grew 8.6% during 2010. This represents 4.5% organic growth, revenue growth that was driven equally by Europe and the U.S. The 10.7% U.S. growth benefited from net pricing gains and the favorable foreign exchange impact.</p>
          <p>Erbitux grew 18%, which was 15% organic growth. This growth was observed in all regions, driven especially by Japan and Latin America. The Cardiometabolics portfolio developed well, demonstrating again that our marketing capabilities can manage many markets of the world are going very strongly.</p>
          <p>Finally, Saizen saw a healthy double-digit growth of 18% in the top selling markets in Europe and North America, and growth in China was supported by launch of Easypod our electronic device of last year.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11; let me move into somewhat detailed comments on the development of our Neurodegenerative disease franchise. First Rebif, we are working on formulation enhancements including the serum-free formulation of Rebif RNF, meanwhile launched in worldwide more than 40 countries. And furthermore, we initiated Phase I studies for the long-acting interferons. And the idea there is obviously to reduce the frequency of injections.</p>
          <p>Second, we extended the scope of our innovative injection devices with the launch of Rebidose, a single-use pre-filled device for a quick and simple injection. We continue to roll out this first and only electronic injection device of its kind for multiple sclerosis; RebiSmart, to now more than 20 markets including Canada and many European countries.</p>
          <p>And third, label extensions will strengthen the Rebif franchise. We completed the two-year Phase III study, REFLEX in October 2010 and presented already the top-line results. The trial involving more than 500 patients with clinically isolated syndrome met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Rebif significantly delays conversion to clinically defined multiple sclerosis. Full results will be presented in an upcoming scientific meeting. We intend to submit these data to European Authorities in mid-2011.</p>
          <p>One of the most common questions, of course, we receive regards the future of Rebif and the MS franchise. Obviously, we need to wait for the final regulatory decision on cladribine tablets in the U.S. before we can comment fully on the future strategy for Rebif. But regardless of the decision in the U.S., we have focused on continuing to serve the current Rebif patient base and sustain Rebif's position as the leading interferon of choice in the industry.</p>
          <p>Page 12, a bit more on Rebif, having said this, of course there is no question that the marketing dynamics in the MS market are beginning to change, and will become more challenging over the long term. We are clearly facing increasing competition fingolimod now in an already highly competitive environment. Price pressure will continue, due to various healthcare reforms, especially in Europe.</p>
          <p>We expect Rebif will benefit from strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets, and the benefits of global lifecycle management activities, as well as the strong position in the U.S. However, we do not expect that these dynamics will be able to fully offset pressures that we are going to see in the market. As a result, we expect that it will be challenging to drive organic growth for Rebif in 2011, and that we are rather likely to see flat performance, excluding effects of currency.</p>
          <p>On page 13, you see an update of the regulatory status of cladribine. First two approvals as you know, were given in July 2010 in Russia and Australia followed in September. The tablets are available under the trade name Movectro in both countries at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>January 2011, CHMP confirmed its initial negative opinion issued in September 2010. We decided then to withdraw the marketing authorization application for cladribine in the European Union. A potential resubmission would require new clinical data and we will consider it after new data become available.</p>
          <p>We are committed to complete our own ongoing studies with cladribine. Top line results from CLARITY extension and ORACLE trials will be available by the end of this year and from the ONWARD study in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Oncology, I'll start with the highlights for Erbitux. One of the highlights I mentioned already, the granting of approval by Japan's authority for the use of Erbitux in first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in KRAS wild-type patients, which was given first in March 2010.</p>
          <p>Japan, as you know, it's a very important market for us and colorectal cancer is the most common cancer among women, the second amongst men with approximately 96,000 new cases every year.</p>
          <p>The latest survival data from OPUS and CRYSTAL studies using standard chemotherapy respectively demonstrate that early tumors shrinkage with Erbitux correlates with long-term survival for patient. The new analysis from Phase III CRYSTAL study showed an outstanding median overall survival of 28.3 months for colorectal cancer patients with KRAS wild-type tumors who experienced early tumor shrinkage during the first line Erbitux based treatment.</p>
          <p>We completed the recruitment of the Phase III study EXPAND, in patients with advanced and previously untreated gastric cancer, at the beginning of this year. The primary objective is to determine the benefits of Erbitux in terms of progression free survival.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, more stories on Erbitux. We presented new data of the Phase II trial BALI-1 for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in December 2010, showing that Erbitux improved overall survival a median of 12.9 versus 9.4 months. This improvement was not statistically significant. Progression free survival improved significantly.</p>
          <p>The personalized treatment approach, which, as you know, is the guiding principle in our strategy on oncology, is widely accepted in the medical community and a number of surveys demonstrate that. A survey showed that 66% of colorectal cancer patients are being tested for KRAS, indicating the preference for targeted treatments.</p>
          <p>And moreover, one survey has shown that Erbitux is used as a first-line treatment in almost 60% of patients with recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer. A second study revealed that 36% of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients are treated with Erbitux. Erbitux has become a standard of care in the treatment of both indications, colorectal as well as head and neck cancer. It is one of our main growth drivers looking forward. We expect Erbitux to continue its year-on-year growth trend with existing indications.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we will fuel this growth number one, by increasing penetration rates, especially, in first-line colorectal as well as in recurrent and metastatic head and neck treatments. Second, by growing geographically, especially, Japan and emerging markets, and third, we intend to broaden our tumor indications for the drug.</p>
          <p>Very briefly on 16; the status of the two other late-stage ongoing trials. I think, you are well-aware, where we are going. We resumed our Stimuvax clinical program in lung cancer in June 2010 following the FDA's decision to lift the clinical hold of the START trial. We closed in July the study STRIDE Phase III as well in women with advanced breast cancer.</p>
          <p>We presented good Phase II long-term follow-up data for cilengitide, for the treatment in glioblastoma at last year's ASCO and we showed that after one year 37% of patients are still alive and the corresponding historic control is 20%.</p>
          <p>Some comments on slide 17 for the pipeline. In 2010, we stopped one &#x2013; some Phase I and II projects. The most new one or most recent one is the discontinuation of one of the three groups of the Phase II, III trial APRIL SLE study in Atacicept. The decision was taken following a recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. They determined that the risk benefit profile for the patients receiving the higher dose of Atacicept was unfavorable. The study continues as a two-arm study between the lower Atacicept and Placebo.</p>
          <p>We announced the signing of a world-wide research and development agreement with Sanofi-Aventis. We collaborate in two Phase I trials investigating novel therapy combinations of specific Sanofi-Aventis compounds and Merck Serono's MEK inhibitor to treat patients with various solid tumors.</p>
          <p>It's important to mention that nearly each of our projects in the portfolio is accompanied by biomarker research activity. This is based on our positive experience with KRAS.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude this part on Merck Serono by stressing that we are confident to safeguard and to grow the business despite recent setbacks. We continue to see growth potential in the industry and for us especially in the next years for Erbitux -- this year for Erbitux and the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Consumer Healthcare on page 18, disappointing, not satisfactory, &#x20AC;472 million in revenues, a deterioration of profitability. We experienced several operational and management challenges during the year, that being said, we expect the division's performance will improve markedly in 2011. And that comes from three priorities. Number one, stabilizing and restoring market share in the Seven Seas brand; second, drive growth in Mexico with a very focused investment on key brands and store placement; and third, reinvigoration of the growth of the division in China.</p>
          <p>So much to the divisions, what I would like to now turn over all &#x2013; look with you on page 19 on the portfolio changes we did over the last year. I believe that few companies have been as active as Merck recently in reshaping their portfolio over the last five years. And this time we have sold our generic business, distribution business, done two transforming acquisitions in Serono and Millipore, and completed numerous other small divestures such as recently, Crop Bioscience in February 2011 and Th&#xE9;ramex, at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>The net effect of all of that is that we now have a portfolio that we believe will enable us to continue to drive attractive financial performance in the future. And also with the full year of Millipore included in 2011, you can see how much more balance we have in the business, particularly as it relates to our core operating result.</p>
          <p>The amount of revenue generated from chemicals will increase from 25% to just under 40% while the percent of our core operating result derived from chemicals will increase from 24% to just over 40% in 2011. And this portfolio shift is about much more than diversifying risk.</p>
          <p>We have built new capabilities in the Biotechnology and Life Science market, driven innovation in markets where we are now a market leader and we have the potential to capitalize on synergies within our various divisions over the next three years. And this is one the reasons why I am excited about the company's future.</p>
          <p>I would like to outline, on page 20, some of the key priorities that I am focused on as we look ahead to 2011. First, three of the five members of our Executive Team will be new in 2011. I list them here on this slide, even with pictures I believe. Of course we will need to come together as a leadership team to determine what initiatives we need to put in place to drive higher levels of growth and profitability in the business over the next five to seven years. I ask for your patience when it comes to revealing those plans.</p>
          <p>Next we need to deliver on the value of the Millipore transaction and continue to establish Merck as a leader in the Life Science tools market. We see a number of important sales and R&amp;D synergies that we are in the process of working to capture. We also will finish the process of driving out costs of the combined organization to deliver on the &#x20AC;75 million cost synergy target that we shared with you at the time of the completion of the transaction.</p>
          <p>Next, we need to focus on optimizing key franchises in Merck Serono and continue the momentum that we have experienced in emerging markets. And finally, in January I communicated with many of our sell side analysts that we recognize that we need to improve investor relations and investor related communication. I am personally going to be involved in this effort. It's very high on my priority list for 2011.</p>
          <p>I would like to close my section of the presentation by stating that 2010 was in many ways a historic year for Merck. It was a year in which we added new capabilities through a transformal acquisition, effectively managed our portfolio, and strengthened the company in a number of important ways. It was also a year of change.</p>
          <p>We are in the process of making changes to our executive management team and we have pledged to improve our overall communication with capital markets. Many of these changes, particularly around operational initiatives will take some time to come together. Some of the changes around communication including the format in which we provide 2011 guidance will be different than what we have done in the past.</p>
          <p>I realize that for many of you on the sell side, this will make your jobs of modeling our financial performance slightly more difficult, but I would stress that we have tried to provide more focus on the business drivers and the upside opportunities and downside risks that the company faces. All of this is done with the single purpose of putting together plan that we can deliver on, and that accurately reflects the current visibility we have in the business.</p>
          <p>With that I would now like to hand over to Michael, who will take you through the financials in more detail. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Karl. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am proud to present the financial details of a year in which we delivered good growth on the top and bottom lines and fully recovered from the global recession in 2008 and '09.</p>
          <p>I will emphasize most of my comments and explanations on our performance for the full year 2010 rather than just our Q4 results as the full year view correlates better with the time horizon of our full year guidance. Unless otherwise stated growth rates are based on the year-over-year comparison with the figures of 2010 versus 2009.</p>
          <p>I would like to begin with the full year P&amp;L for the Merck Group as outlined on slide 22. The reported increase of 20% in total revenues reflects 7.9% organic growth, a 3.7% favorable benefit from changes in foreign currencies and an 8.4% benefit from the acquisition of Millipore.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, we closed the transaction on July 14th and consequently consolidated Millipore for the first time in the third quarter last year. So the effect is six out of twelve months, while in the last quarter, it will be three &#x2013; it was three of three months.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, we reported 11% sales growth in Europe of which 6.9% came from the Millipore acquisition. Sales in North America increased by 31%, with Millipore contributing 21%. In Asia, we saw sales increasing by 37% helped by 8.3% from the Millipore acquisition.</p>
          <p>Finally, Latin American sales grew by 15%, supported by 2.6% growth from Millipore. This gives you an indication of what we can do on the top-line synergies. We profited very much in the U.S. where we are weak, Millipore was strong. We are both strong in Asia and we are strong in Latin America where Millipore was not so strong.</p>
          <p>Royalties came in at prior year's level or slightly above, &#x20AC;360 million. I would like to iterate that we expect royalties to stay roughly flat for the next two years followed by decline of about 20% until 2014 and being stable then again from 2015 onwards.</p>
          <p>Sales increased 21% year-over-year to &#x20AC;8.93 billion, of which organic growth contributed 8.5% and changes in foreign exchange 3.7%.</p>
          <p>The production cost increased 17.5%. This includes &#x20AC;86 million from the step-up of inventories from Millipore. Including this one-off charge, production costs would have been &#x20AC;2.3 billion or 13% higher compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A grew 17% to &#x20AC;3.58 billion including a negative effect of &#x20AC;87 million of transaction and integration cost for the Millipore acquisition. You may remember that previously transaction costs were added to the purchase price and capitalized. That is not longer possible anymore so they come under integration costs. Stripping Millipore's contribution out, SG&amp;A would have been up by 7.5%.</p>
          <p>Going into more detail, marketing and selling expenses increased to &#x20AC;2.23 billion or 20% versus last year, out of which 8.5% was acquisition related. Administration costs were up 13%, including 7% contribution from Millipore.</p>
          <p>The Group's R&amp;D spending rose moderately by 3.9% to about &#x20AC;1.4 billion. Slightly lower R&amp;D costs in our Pharma businesses were more than offset by higher R&amp;D investments into our chemicals business, reflecting our strategy to focus on innovations as a growth engine for both Performance Materials and Merck Millipore. For the next two years we intend to keep the Group's R&amp;D spending rate at a level of 15% of total revenues.</p>
          <p>Finally, amortization cost increased by 24% to &#x20AC;819 million. As a reminder, around &#x20AC;570 million of the costs are related to ongoing amortization of the purchase price allocation for Merck Serono's intangible assets. Additionally the consolidation of Millipore leads to a regular amortization of intangible assets at a level of &#x20AC;190 million per year resulting in 96 million for the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally, the impairment of our pipeline drug, safinamide of &#x20AC;134 million, which we forecasted already in July is also included in this P&amp;L line.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for these amortization charges and one-off costs related to the acquisition of Millipore, the group's underlying profitability expressed as core operating result improved 62% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion yielding a core return on revenues of 22.6% up almost 600 basis points compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving through a brief summary to the Merck Group's performance during the fourth quarter; we can see that the &#x2013; on slide 23, that the revenues of 2.55 billion represented 25% growth. This growth reflects a 20% gain from acquisition, so three months out of three is 16%, six months out of 12 was eight as you remember from acquisitions and 4.8% were benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Our operating result of &#x20AC;129 million more than doubled from 2009 despite higher amortization cost from the safinamide impairment. This was due to higher revenues and lower spending, if we adjust for the cost of the Millipore transaction. Our core ROS increased by 840 basis points and benefited from the year-over-year comparison due to the weak level of profitability in Q4 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 24, exceptional charges in 2010 seem to be minor at first sight with minus &#x20AC;0.8 million on a net basis. However, this line includes two significant events that were booked in the last quarter, but that are balancing each other out.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, the sales of Th&#xE9;ramex to Teva pharmaceutical industries had a positive P&amp;L impact of &#x20AC;69 million. On the other hand, as we announced in December, the settlement of the claim of the U.S. Department of Justice against our former generics affiliate Dey, triggered a payment of &#x20AC;215 million.</p>
          <p>Since we started to book provisions for the settlement, all the way back to 2007, it only negatively affected our P&amp;L by &#x20AC;67 million in Q4. With this payment the vast majority of claims against Dey are settled and the remaining provisions are immaterial since they are in the range of low double-digit million euros.</p>
          <p>The provision should cover all future costs for some still unsettled minor claims. Of course, this statement only applies to the outstanding lawsuits that we are aware of today. Should additional lawsuits be brought forward, we could see higher costs in the future.</p>
          <p>In 2010, the financial result increased 87% to &#x20AC;252 million driven by higher interest cost following the &#x20AC;3.2 billion bond issue in March to finance the acquisition of Millipore. As a reminder, we were able to place the bonds in three tranches with maturities of 2, 5 and 10 years at very favorable conditions resulting in additional interest costs of around &#x20AC;30 million per quarter. In addition, financing fees of &#x20AC;10 million for the bridge financing relating to the Millipore transaction were added in the 2010 financial result.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we saw a doubling of the income tax to &#x20AC;220 million and an underlying tax rate of 25.3%. This compares to an unusually low tax rate of 21.6% in 2009 when we rebuilt deferred tax assets, some of which had been eliminated in 2008. In addition, this increased tax rate is the result of the consolidation of Millipore and resembles the tax rate increase when we first consolidated Serono.</p>
          <p>At the time, the increase lasted a year, and I don't think that this time it will last much longer. As part of the integration, we will restructure some of Millipore's tax holdings to help optimize our tax rate going forward. And if you were to ask me, what proxy to take for this year's tax rate, I would estimate somewhere between 25 and 26%.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line higher revenues and lower costs increased net income to &#x20AC;632 million or &#x20AC;2.91 per share, up 73% compared to 2009. Adjusted for acquisition related costs from Serono and Millipore, the group's core earnings per share rose by 52% to &#x20AC;6.73. I would just like to make a very brief remark to the slightly distorted picture of Q4, where the operating result grows three-fold, the EBIT by 50%, the profit before tax by 30% and the profit after tax declined by 20%.</p>
          <p>The reason for this is that the exceptionals which influenced the EBIT was zero in this quarter and positive by 40 million in the previous year quarter as we released a provision that we had built for the withdrawal of our psoriasis drug. On the level of profit before tax, we had a financial result which was twice as high as last year. And on the profit after tax, we had the effect on the tax rate which I explained, which all took place in the third quarter last year where we compare a 23 million charge in Q4 of 2010 with a 5 million credit in the last quarter of 2009, which then leads to the picture that we have, a minus 20% on the bottom-line.</p>
          <p>This leads me to the financial performance of our four divisions, and I will start with Performance Materials with the result presented on slide 25 for the full year. The division generated revenues of &#x20AC;1.38 billion, up 38% of which 10% came from currency tailwinds. The total revenues of Liquid Crystals were also up 38% as well and crossed the &#x20AC;1 billion mark for the first time ever.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, this strong increase is reflecting last year's exceptionally weak Pigment and Liquid Crystals business, which suffered significantly from the drop in demand for displays and cosmetics. However; on the other hand, it also shows our excellent positions in these dynamic markets which enabled us to fully play out our leadership in innovation technologies and product quality against the backdrop of increasing demand from our customers.</p>
          <p>Consequently, the division's operating result jumped by 166% to &#x20AC;580 million, an increase of more than &#x20AC;360 million. Out of this, Liquid Crystals alone contributed with an increase of &#x20AC;300 million, driven by healthy demand for our flagship technology PS-VA, stronger volumes and higher capacity utilization as well as a favorable foreign exchange development.</p>
          <p>This enabled us to nearly double our return on revenues to 42%, up from 22% we had in 2009. With the return on revenues of 52%, Liquid Crystals profitability returned to pre-crisis levels, in line with this strong performance, the underlying free cash flow increase to &#x20AC;549 million, up 81% compared to full year 2009.</p>
          <p>Now turning briefly to the fourth quarter results of Performance Materials, on slide 26, we report total revenues of 322.1 million. This represented growth of 19%, which included a 14% positive benefit from the changes in foreign exchange and 15% organic revenue growth. We reported 40.5% return on sales for the quarter, which included an impressive 54% return on sales for our Liquid Crystal business.</p>
          <p>On slide 27, I show the effect of the reorganization of the Performance Materials on the division's financials. I wanted to highlight a consideration that you will need to make when conducting a growth analysis in 2011.</p>
          <p>On the left hand side of the slide I show the 2010 actual results for Performance Materials revenues. The division will gain a cosmetics actives business that was previously part of the Merck Millipore portfolio.</p>
          <p>As a result performance materials 2010 adjusted revenues will increase by &#x20AC;68 million to &#x20AC;1.45 billion. The division's adjusted return on sales for 2010, which is showed on the right hand side of the slide, will be 40%.</p>
          <p>When we provide guidance in a few minutes on the Performance Materials division, the forecasted growth will be off of the 2010 adjusted revenue of &#x20AC;1.45 billion. Another key consideration when you consider Performance Materials in 2011 is the sale of Crop Bioscience business which closed earlier this month.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we generated revenues of &#x20AC;46 million and an operating result of &#x20AC;60 million in this business. These results will be in our 2010 base, but will not repeat in 2011 which will affect the comparability of these results.</p>
          <p>With Cosmetic Actives entering Performance Materials, Merck Millipore's revenues are adjusted down to &#x20AC;1.61 billion from &#x20AC;1.68 billion, we reported in 2010. As a result Merck Millipore's adjusted operating result in 2010 will be &#x20AC;48 million. Just like Performance Materials, the revenue growth guidance that I will provide to you on Merck Millipore will be off of the adjusted revenue figure of &#x20AC;1.61 billion.</p>
          <p>Now moving to Merck Millipore's full year results on slide 28, total revenues grew by 81% to &#x20AC;1.68 billion. This performance reflected 69% from the Millipore acquisition, organic growth of 56% and a 6% positive benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Marketing and selling as well as R&amp;D were up primarily as a result of the effect caused by the acquisition.</p>
          <p>With the core operating result of &#x20AC;313 million, the division achieved a core return on revenues of 18.6%, an improvement of more than 700 basis points driven by stronger volumes in all businesses as well as higher profitability for Millipore's business. As a result, the underlying free cash flow more than doubled to &#x20AC;264 million.</p>
          <p>I show Merck Millipore's Q4 financial performance on slide 29, the division generated 6.8% organic revenue growth in the quarter, which reflects the performance of legacy Merck. The division generated exceptional year-over-year improvements in both core operating result and underlying free cash flow in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the full year performance of Merck Serono, on slide 30, Merck Serono increased total revenues by 7.6% to &#x20AC;5.75 billion over 2010 &#x2013; for 2010, driven by 5.1% organic growth. Sales increased by more than 8%, primarily driven by the sales of our top products especially Rebif and Erbitux.</p>
          <p>All regions contributed to the strong sales increase. Europe, which represents one half of Merck Serono sales, grew by only 2.9% consistent with the challenging market dynamics of the region. Emerging markets continued to represent an important growth region and was a substantial driver of our growth during the year. Sales in Latin America increased by 14%, this growth included a 3% headwind from currency.</p>
          <p>Finally, sales in Asia, Africa, and Australasia region increased 20% to &#x20AC;932 million, primarily due to the growth of Erbitux in the region. Royalty and commission income decreased by 2% to &#x20AC;345 million, primarily due to lower sales of Puregon as patents expired in certain countries.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin went up by 7 -- 6.9% to &#x20AC;4.79 billion due to a disproportionate G&amp;A increase in our production costs. These costs included startup expenses for the new large scale biotech production center in Switzerland of around &#x20AC;25 million. Furthermore, a strong price cut in some EU countries affected our gross margin.</p>
          <p>The 10% boost in marketing and selling expenses is due to strong exchange rate effects and investments in new products namely cladribine tablets and Egrifta and emerging markets such as China, where we built up the field force. The 13% jump in royalty license and commission expenses is a result of higher Erbitux sales in Japan and Rebif sales in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The more than 10% in fees and amortization of intangible assets is driven by the just explained impairment of safinamide. Our R&amp;D cost slightly decreased to &#x20AC;1.17 million, representing again our target of 20% of Merck Serono's revenues. The decrease is partly a result of the delay of the approvals of Stimuvax and cladribine tablets.</p>
          <p>Higher marketing and selling expenses were offset by the improvement in gross margin and lower important influences compared to 2009, which led to a 28% jump of our core operating result to &#x20AC;1.28 million.</p>
          <p>Our core return on revenues increased accordingly to 22.2%. The 51% increase of underlying free cash flow was mainly the result of higher profitability of the division.</p>
          <p>I'd like kindly to remind you that with the Th&#xE9;ramex transaction, we completed at the end of year, we have sold &#x20AC;84 million of revenue and &#x20AC;9.5 million of operating results based on 2010 figures. Please keep this in mind when you start comparing Merck Serono's performance throughout 2011 with the prior year's numbers.</p>
          <p>Now some comments on the Q4 performance of Merck Serono on slide 31. The division posted a fine quarter of financial performance posting &#x20AC;1.5 billion in revenues, which reflected 4.6% organic revenue growth, the approximately 10% decrease of royalty and commission income as a result of a lower income from Puregon, primarily due to the mentioned patent expirations.</p>
          <p>The 2.5% growth of the gross margin is below revenue growth due to healthcare reform adversely lowering prices and lower gross margin as result of the negative effects of adjusting for year-end plan cost variances.</p>
          <p>Marketing and selling expenses were up 17.1% driven by higher Erbitux sales, especially in Japan and Rebif in the U.S. led to 7% increase in commission and royalty expenses.</p>
          <p>As already said before and indicated our last conference call, we had to impair safinamide, our pipeline product to treat Parkinson's disease. The approximately 33% increase in amortization of intangible assets is driven by this write-down of safinamide of &#x20AC;134 million, which now results in a residual value of safinamide of &#x20AC;63 million. The impairment was triggered by the results of the Phase III extension study 018, which led to an updated assessment of the market potential.</p>
          <p>In addition, the new valuation covers a delay in the project as well as an increase in R&amp;D cost driven by increased regulatory requirements. This impairment is reflected within our operating result, but did not affect our core result as the P&amp;L line amortization of intangible assets relate to the purchase of Serono. We more than doubled the core operating result at &#x20AC;298 million with a core return on sales of almost 20%. Consequently, underlying free cash flows rose by 141% to nearly &#x20AC;450 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 32, represent the full year key financials of the Consumer Healthcare division for 2010. We generated revenues of &#x20AC;472 million, with organic growth of 2.6% worldwide exceeding average market growth in many countries. Our top five strategic brands posted to double-digit sales increases.</p>
          <p>Marketing and selling rose by 11% and R&amp;D by almost 28% as the division continued to implement its strategy on focusing on strategic brands. The substantial decline in operating result by 71% was due to the following effects.</p>
          <p>We undertook extensive restructuring in China in the second half of 2010 as a result of a too quick expansion outside the four major cities. U.K. was hit by &#x2013; the U.K. was hit by fire in May 2010 that destroyed a warehouse containing Seven Seas nutritional supplements which led to respective bottom line effects.</p>
          <p>Slide 33 shows the fourth quarter performance of Consumer Healthcare, I would like to particularly highlight the good underlying free cash flow, despite the decline in lower revenues and operating result the division saw a very strong cash delivery in Q4, driven by favorable changes in working capital.</p>
          <p>This leads me to the key balance sheet data, the acquisition of Millipore had a significant impact on our balance sheet, which you can see on slide 34. Total assets increased by about &#x20AC;5.7 billion to 22.4. Out of this increase &#x20AC;4.9 billion are stemming from increased intangible assets mainly from the consolidation of Millipore.</p>
          <p>Moving to the group's cash flows on slide 34, you see that we nearly doubled the underlying free cash flow from &#x20AC;852 million in 2009 to &#x20AC;1.67 billion in 2010. This was supported by &#x20AC;265 million higher profit after tax and &#x20AC;254 million higher depreciation and amortization which is included in the profit after tax, but having no cash effect.</p>
          <p>We have capital expenditures lower by 71 million. This lower CapEx was related to the completion of a number of major projects including our plant in Vevey and our research center in Billerica, Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect CapEx to stay at a level of around &#x20AC;400 million per year, changes in working capital show a negative shift of &#x20AC;57 million, driven by higher accounts receivable, following the growth of our business and the sluggish payment in some countries in Southern Europe. The payment of the purchase price for Millipore and the transaction related costs totaling &#x20AC;4.94 billion are summarized in the line. Others; as well as payments of &#x20AC;241 million for the settlement of terminated litigation, Of these &#x20AC;241 million, &#x20AC;115 million relate to the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding Dey as announced in December last year.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we received &#x20AC;10 million already from the sale of Th&#xE9;ramex and expect the remainder of &#x20AC;255 million to come during the actual quarter, actually it has already arrived. Further, we collected significant payments from Venezuela totaling around &#x20AC;90 million leaving receivables of about &#x20AC;40 million from that region outstanding by the end of 2010. In line with that, we reversed a provision for minus &#x20AC;70 million by the end of 2009 to 20 million; finally, restarted first payments with government bonds on total outstanding receivables of around &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>An important aspect of our financial performance is the reduction of net financial debt and you can see that on our last slide before I come to the guidance. And you see that we have reduced since 31st July 2010 our net financial debt by 655 million and this includes the payment of more than 200 million in the Dey case. So without the Dey it would have been more -- far more than 800 million.</p>
          <p>This leads me to the guidance. The guidance for 2011 is shown on slide 37. As we enter the year we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid financial performance. However, we have to acknowledge that operational planning for our upcoming years much more of a challenge than usual given the difficulty in predicting the outcomes of regulatory decisions and the impact from changing market dynamics.</p>
          <p>For example, all of you are aware that the PDUFA date is &#x2013; of cladribine tablets, which is only one week away obviously it is impossible to determine today whether cladribine tablets will be approved or further delayed. Given the potential of cladribine tablets, the approval or lack thereof would have a substantial impact on our anticipated financial for 2011.</p>
          <p>Outside of Pharma another challenge that we consistently face is our Liquid Crystals business where we typically have six weeks of forward visibility and the limited customer base that can quickly adjust its production due to the cyclicality of the consumer electronics industry.</p>
          <p>Predicting the impact of competitive and customer actions in this market is also an ongoing challenge. As a result of these factors we have tried to put forth a forecast that accurately reflects both the upside potential and downside risk we see in the business. We have also adapted the format of our guidance and returned to a wider guidance range to accurately reflect our current visibility and put us in a stronger position to deliver on the expectations that we set.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with the discussion of the top-line performance of the Merck Group and our four divisions. We expect Group revenues to grow between 13% and 18% in 2011, which would result in 35% to 45% growth in our operating result. This performance would include full year of impact from the Millipore transaction which closed in the middle of last year.</p>
          <p>We expect the core ROS of the Group to range between 22 and 23% during 2011.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress that all of these figures assume the approval of cladribine tablets and the corresponding financial effect on the top line and expenses. This assumption is no indication for our optimism regarding the outcome of the PDUFA date. It is neither an indication for the approval or not &#x2013; or delay or not or rejection or not.</p>
          <p>From a divisional perspective, we expect that Merck Serono will grow between 5 and 10%. This guidance again assumes an approval for cladribine tablets in the United States against the background that I mentioned. We have also assumed that incremental costs from cladribine tablets launch offset the impact from the higher revenues. Should we fail to get an approval in the U.S. this year, we expect that Merck Serono will grow between 1% and 6% in 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of the underlying business, we have made several other key assumptions for important drivers of the Merck Serono's 2011 performance. We have previously acknowledged that our prospects from Rebif will vary depending on whether or not we receive an approval for cladribine tablets.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you today is that independent of the FDA's decision, we expect that the Rebif franchise will come under pressure in 2011 and beyond from the changing market dynamics in the multiple sclerosis market.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 forecast assumes that the product will show a small amount of growth, but will fall from the growth rate we delivered in 2010. Our strategy will continue to be on sustaining the current patient base for Rebif and reinforcing its position as The Leading interferon of choice in the market. We will also develop and continue to improve our devices, which are critical for the convenience and differentiation of Rebif.</p>
          <p>We've assumed double-digit annual growth for Erbitux, driven by deeper market penetration in Europe, Japan and emerging markets. Finally, we have assumed that we will sustain the high growth rates that we experienced this year in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>From the profitability perspective, we expect to grow Merck Serono's core operating result in 2011 irrespective of the approval of cladribine tablets. Currently we expect growth in the mid to high single-digits however our core ROS would likely be lower than 22% we delivered in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Performance Materials, I showed to the adjusted 2010 revenues and core operating result for the division earlier in the presentation. The following growth rates are off of these adjusted results and are not based on our 2010 actual performance. We expect that Performance Materials we generate between 2% and 7% growth in 2011.</p>
          <p>This growth assumes solid performance in pigments, similar to what we saw last year. It also assumes that the division is able to increase its overall market share in liquid crystals. Our desire to increase our share is based on protecting our market leadership, increasing our customer intimacy and laying the foundation for new technologies to be adopted by our customers in the future.</p>
          <p>We expect to see increased competition in the PS-VA market during 2011, but we believe the overall impact on our share and pricing in the PS-VA market will be modest.</p>
          <p>Also we have slightly more top line currency exposure in this segment of the business due to the limited number of liquid crystal customers in Asia. Like we do in any other year, we will work to offset this exposure through an effective hedging strategy.</p>
          <p>From a profitability perspective, we expect the operating result of Performance Materials will be roughly flat during 2011. This assumes that we continue to invest heavily in R&amp;D to drive the next generation of Liquid Crystals product. It also assumes a negative mix effect in Liquid Crystals as we gain share in areas like VA and IPS.</p>
          <p>For Consumer Healthcare, we expect sales growth of 7% to 12%, in 2011. We expect the division to generate an operating result of at least two to three times higher than what is experienced in 2010. This improvement assumes a continued global economic recovery and a healthy return from the investments we have made in our strategic brands over the past several years.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to Millipore, we expect the division to grow 51% to 56% off of the adjusted revenues of &#x20AC;1.61 billion during the coming year. This level of growth assumes that the division grows faster than the overall Life Science tools market. Other key assumption for the growth of the division include: growth in Asia drives a significant portion of the division's growth, demand from biotech customers will remain strong, but the division's Pharma customers will remain under pressure to reduce costs. We expect Millipore to report significant higher operating result growth of 31% to 36%. This assumes that we capture at least half of our target cost saving synergy of &#x20AC;75 million during 2011.</p>
          <p>And this is all from my side. Thank you very much for your attention, and I pass back to Joshua to lead the question-and-answer session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Two questions please. Dr. Kley you have indicated that both large and small shareholders have not been happy with the recent share performance of Merck over the coming years &#x2013; over the previous years and everything is potentially up for consideration. I'm just perplexed by the decision to invest another $65 million in a research site near Boston together with the other three you have given the lack of anything really coming out of Merck research labs for decades, one could argue. Perhaps you could outline a strategy and whether we could see some reversal of the historic investment pattern?</p>
          <p>The second question is to Dr. Becker. Obviously, the Department of Justice is on an enforcement drive right now for mis-selling of drugs in the U.S. I note that the DOJ has intervened in a &#x2013; what looks like a key qui tam case, a whistleblower case in terms of marketing of products in the U.S. market with your subsidiary, perhaps you could outline whether you've taken any provisions for this and give any details on the timing of resolution and potential likely scale of the impact on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So maybe we're going to collect a couple of questions and I guess answer them all at once. So we'll take a couple of more questions. Yes, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Richard Vosser from JP Morgan. Three questions please. The first is on the Liquid Crystal business. I just wondered if you'd give us some more help on the market dynamics and what proportion of the growth or what proportion of the panels were sold in China, Japan, U.S. and Europe in 2010 and how you see that geographic variation? What you see the growth rates in those markets varying in 2011? And what contribution each market has to the 11% volume growth that to this &#x2013; I think as mentioned in your annual report?</p>
          <p>And second question is on Stimuvax and I just wanted to ask about the interim analysis and confirm whether that was a just a safety look, whether you have looked at futility from an efficacy point of view yet in that analysis or for other analysis? And if you could you give us an idea on whether there are further interim analysis before that the final data read out in '12 at some point?</p>
          <p>And the final question, I just wanted to ask on the growth rates of Merck Serono. So the Merck Serono growth ex-cladribine 1 to 6%, you've mentioned briefly how you &#x2013; what growth drivers you see, but I do see quite a few headwinds as well: EU pricing; the Th&#xE9;ramex, as you said; Rebif being slightly growing and the pharma market, perhaps from some other companies that have reported really zero growth for 2011. So I'm just wondering how you can get to the top end of that guidance? If you could give us some more color there that would be very useful? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start. Andrew, I do not completely share your view that nothing has come out, but we can agree that little has come out of the Merck pipeline over the last years and maybe one of the reasons is that we were not part of a network in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And when Herr Kirschbaum took over, part of the basic analysis was that amongst other measures like reorganization, like people change, we had a number of personnel changes over the last months and years, some other aspects. One of the aspects was we have to be &#x2013; if you want to play in an orchestra, you have to be where the music is playing. And a good deal of the music is playing in the U.S. And we have not been able with our organization up to recently, to tap those resources in this environment sufficiently.</p>
          <p>So the decision to invest in the U.S. obviously is not a decision today &#x2013; or yesterday and done today, but part of a long-term plan. And gives us the access to networks, we have not been able to tap before. So I expect in a long-term strategy considerable benefits from this investment.</p>
          <p>Second question from Andrew goes to you.</p>

          <p>Yeah the asset litigation in the U.S. which has been settled. The payment is still outstanding and therefore it will not affect the balance sheet in 2011. It has affected the balance sheet in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was middle double-digit.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then there was a question on the different geographic footprint in the Liquid Crystal markets. Obviously, China is still a relatively small segment in the market as you probably have read many of the companies have announced investments in a number of factories, number of plants. The major part of that still has to go on stream. So still today and also 2011, China will not be major contributor to what happens in the Liquid Crystal business. The major part, as in the past, is played in Korea and in Taiwan, which will also remain the major source of revenue and the major consumer of materials, basically of all materials from TN, TFF, IPS, VA, PS-VA. Japan, we see growth returning, so in terms of quantity, I believe Japan will deliver more than we have seen in the last two years.</p>
          <p>On numbers and revenues and profits on countries, we have never disclosed and ask for your understanding that we'll continue not to disclose numbers and values.</p>
          <p>For Stimuvax, I pass on to Bernhard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on Stimuvax, you will not expect me to speculate on internal analysis. But we of course have agreements with the FDA and what I can say after the liftoff of the clinical hold, the recruitment into the study picked up very quickly. And we have actually reached now recruitment rates that are above what we had before the clinical hold, which at least tells you the interest, the continued interest of patients and investigators in the drug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, does that answer all your questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is one last question which was on the Merck Serono growth, what do we have to do despite the headwinds. I believe that in pointing out the qualitative aspects of the business how the business would develop, I have looked at opportunities and headwinds. And I mentioned explicitly the European pricing. The problem with European pricing is you never know who is hit by what, and when, and where. So it is hard to figure into your planning the next tax by any given European health minister. So if they fail to hit us, we could reach the 6%, if they would hit us we could also reach the 1% and that is why we enter with a <mark type="inaudible" /> into the discussion.</p>
          <p>On Rebif, I think I was quite explicit in saying that I don't expect a big deal of growth in 2011. But rather expect stable development and I gave also the reasons why that. So the headwinds are factored in. If the headwinds are all blowing, we should end at one; if they fail, we should end at six, and the probability that we are in between is higher than being at one or at six.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add something to the U.S. litigation. Some doubts crept into my mind whether it did affect the 2010 balance sheet, it didn't affect that 2010 balance sheet, the provision was already built in 2009 so the mid-double-digit, 50 million around provision, we built in December 2009 already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's now settled. It's -- and there is a couple of euros spare and the payment will be next year. So it settled at a lower price, at a lower amount, but the provision was not built in 2010, was built in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Marietta Miemietz, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. My first question is for Mr. Kirschbaum. The Erbitux Gastric Cancer EXPAND study, can you give us any idea as to when you would expect it to read out? Looking at clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like we should expect that late this year or early next year and I am just wondering why would it take so long for such an aggressive cancer to yield on a PFS benefit?</p>
          <p>Second question, staying on Pharma, can you just walk us through some of the changes that the new Head of Pharma is implementing on the operational side and in particular what cost reduction opportunities you may see that are independent of the outcome of the FDA decision on cladribine?</p>
          <p>And then I have a final question on Liquid Crystals, could you just walk us through the competitive dynamics in the PS-VA space. Whether any competitors have actually launched and to the extent that you have seen or are seeing launches, how much of a technological advantage you still think you have in the vast majority of the applications given that you are probably on your second, third, fourth generation of PS-VAs by now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, we'll take one additional question. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Fabian Wenner from UBS. First question on the Millipore savings, you said you wanted to deliver on the value of Millipore. Can you detail to us what you've included in your guidance for the Group's core EBIT? Is the full &#x20AC;75 million in there already?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think it was mentioned this morning that you don't expect to divest Consumer Health, obviously because it disappointed this year. Is that generally your view? Do you not want to divest it? What's your goal in general for this unit? Can you lower the cost and raise margins?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, if I may, cost progressions as well, cost containment on Pharma, what is your target plan for 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; I would kindly ask you to give Stefan Oschmann a little bit of time -even more than a little bit, bit of time. He is just taken over. He is doing a thorough analysis and we have frequent discussions on what we think needs to be done and what will be done and, by the way, Bernhard is part of those discussions.</p>
          <p>So without announcing any specific date or any number, we are working on a thorough analysis and all the aspects and when we feel the time is right to communicate what we plan to do, we will do it and you will be certainly among the first to hear it. This relates to the projects &#x2013; project review. This relates to pipeline, but of course also to costs containment and cost reductions, which of course are part of the game plan going forward. So we will update you at a later stage.</p>
          <p>Second, also Pharma, I have to be careful how I phrase it because the first question is will &#x2013; in the press, will you divest OTC? My answer is, no. Even if I wanted to do it, I wouldn't tell, obviously.</p>
          <p>The second question is, do you exclude selling it? And my answer was, I never exclude anything in life. I'm old enough to have seen everything and portfolio review is a continuous part of our game plan as you've seen in the portfolio changes in the last years. Now the result of this statement was that we're considering selling OTC. Obviously, the two things have nothing in common.</p>
          <p>So I would like to ask you, when drawing your conclusions to keep those two things apart. The general &#x2013; let me give you a general outline how we look at OTC. It's an attractive business to be in. It's an attractive business in combination with the prescription business, and not by chance, a number of companies are interested to build into greater footprint in OTC who don't have it today.</p>
          <p>Second, it also fits perfectly in what we can do and what we are able to do. So also from a portfolio perspective, it's a good thing to have. Third, we are strong in some products and also only in some markets, some countries, some regions. We have no global footprint. So the first strategic question is do we need a global footprint or is it sufficient to work as a regional player in this market? As you know, there are global brands, but also national and local brands. So it makes sense to look at both sides of the coin.</p>
          <p>Number four, if we would decide to go for a global reach and a global brand, we would have to analyze the options. And for the time being, I rule out that we do any major acquisition in this area, because the prices to be paid at the moment are not ones I am willing to pay.</p>
          <p>This does not exclude, of course, all kind of brand acquisitions, license acquisitions, partnering deals or what have you. This is part of our very normal strategy process and I think we have demonstrated in the past five years that we are not shying away from any portfolio adjustments, if we think it's the right decision.</p>
          <p>The competitive dynamics on the liquid crystals is less a question &#x2013; should not be focused only on the PS-VA, but the story behind the liquid crystals is that we're investing in a material. We're trying to place it with the customer which can take anything between three months and three years because it's not as easy as in pharmaceutical, you get a registration, you start selling. You have to place it in the customer, you have to work with the customers, so it's a very intense process.</p>
          <p>And once it's in the market -- once it's in the first set, then the competition sees it and starts to try to find a way to have the same effect we have with a certain mixture with their singles and mixtures, of course without violating patents. This can take anytime, again depending how complicated the chemistry behind it is, between three months to three years.</p>
          <p>If you enter a new technology, it is never forever in this market. So that implies when we have &#x2013; the moment we have launched PS-VA and have the first customer, we start working on the next technology. So while we're sitting here and talking business, somewhere in the back are our researchers working on the next technologies and I promise you there will be technology for the future.</p>
          <p>So I believe that in 2011, we will see competition coming in with PS-VA materials, materials similar to us, and we have to see whether they meet our quality whether and what effect that has on pricing. But I definitely expect in 2011 the first PS-VA supplies from competitors in the market.</p>
          <p>Bernhard will talk a little bit about Erbitux and then Michael Becker will round off this answer set, with comments on the guidance in Millipore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Erbitux gastric EXPAND, you know that we have completed the recruitment. We are now following up with the patients and this is an event-driven study. So this is really the one scenario where it actually may be good news if it takes longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, integration costs, normally integration effects are fully in place on a full year basis after two years and it creeps up until then. So for the time being, we have spent about &#x20AC;35 million of pure integration costs, another &#x20AC;30 million is transaction costs. That's about one-fifth that you should imagine.</p>
          <p>For the next year, we want to spend another &#x20AC;42 million on integration costs and therefore we expect that at the end of next year, we will have a running rate which is close to the &#x20AC;75 million. This means that we have now a mixture of being somewhere between &#x2013; let's say &#x20AC;25 million and &#x20AC;50 million. And we also are considering that we may have a higher out turn of our endeavors to synergies. So my expectation is that we will have about &#x20AC;30 million to &#x20AC;40 million synergies when we exit this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll now take a question from one of our conference call participants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir, our first question today comes from Matthew Weston from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, thank you for taking my question. A couple of simple financial questions, just to follow up and then some more strategic ones. Regarding the financial questions, can you just tell me where the Th&#xE9;ramex revenue is currently booked in 2010, just literally which revenue line; the same for Crop Bioscience, just to really understand where they are going to come out of the revenue going forward? Could you also give us U.S. sales for Rebif as well just in terms of splitting that key revenue driver between U.S. and ex-U.S.?</p>
          <p>Moving on then to something more strategic, you've discussed how you have high hopes that Rebif will continue to be stable in the current marketplace. Can you explain how you expect stability whereas one of your key competitors anticipates that Betaseron will fall double-digit year-on-year given the competition from Gilenya? And can you also explain the timeline for whether or not you expect to refile RebiSmart in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just regarding your guidance, can you explain what you've done with foreign exchange within your guidance going forward? Have you assumed that it remains flat at current levels or have you assumed it remains flat on full-year '10 average, or have you actually made an assumption about the progression of the euro versus the dollar? And, of course, I particularly ask given your LCD business and how sensitive that is to the dollar/euro rate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I start with the Th&#xE9;ramex and Crop Bioscience, where I understood that you mean in which line of revenues does the business go into 2010. It's in sales. The sale of the business goes into exceptionals, so it is deconsolidated and the profit will be in exceptionals. There will be no sales in 2011 related to Th&#xE9;ramex or to Crop Bioscience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>By way of follow-up, what I meant was literally which revenue line in 2010 was it present? Is it other Cardiometabolic care and local?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, you mean in which division. We don't break that down. We are reporting per segment and therefore we have &#x2013; and if you look at the overview that we have given with our main franchises, it goes into the Cardiometabolic care, it goes into the local for Cardiometabolic care.</p>
          <p>And with regard to foreign exchange, we do our guidance always on the same exchange rate that we have our internal planning, and this is a fixed rate which is fixed through the planning process and it is slightly lower than the exchange rate that we have now. But the average exchange rate will be built into the &#x2013; well, the development of next year. So there is no exchange rate that we guide. We take past exchange rate just for calculation purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for Rebif, so it's roughly &#x20AC;690 million U.S. has been in 2010. Your question was then, number one on the lifecycle management, and would we be able to file the RebiSmart in the U.S. That's too early to say. We're still waiting for the result from a study there.</p>
          <p>Second, of course I can't comment on what competitors are saying to probably Betaseron. But we should keep in mind that Rebif is the standard therapy. As the standard therapy, we have certain advantages. Second, if you look at the past we've been gaining market share amongst the interferons in the U.S. so I don't see why that trend should be changing.</p>
          <p>And last, again U.S. even if you have a new drug, you know it takes some time until you get into the formularies and so on. So I was talking about 2011 and not 2012, I still believe in 2011 that the statement which I made is accurate.</p>
          <p>In addition, on the overall franchise, I mentioned also growth opportunities; there number one in a number of other markets than U.S. and Europe, emerging markets and so on. And I mentioned possibilities for lifecycle management in a number of markets. So all of that I think underlines and confirms the possibility that we will be able to keep our euro together in Rebif, despite whatever other companies might be saying on their products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we could take two questions from the live audience? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Odile Rundquist from Helvea. I understood that it's a bit difficult to give any guidance on the impact of European reform for 2011. But could you give what was the impact in 2010 for Merck Serono, the major products?</p>
          <p>And could you remind me what are the new requirements for safinamide approval?</p>
          <p>And finally, as Serostim is one of your five top selling pharma products within Merck Serono, could you just give me how much sales Serostim amounted in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One additional question from the audience, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Wendorff, Commerzbank. A few questions, if I may. And starting off with a follow-up question on the guidance for 2011, clarification question really, did I get it right during your presentation that even if all cladribine will be approved that the cooperating profit contribution will be close to zero or is there an incremental profit would there already been incremental profit visible even in the first year on the market?</p>
          <p>And second question on the pricing and situation of Rebif you've outlined the guidance for 2011, does that include continuous price increase in the U.S. or how do you see the situation there for Rebif?</p>
          <p>And lastly on the pricing of Movectro in Russia and Australia, what's certainly be interested in getting an update there on how you have priced the drug against other existing MS treatments? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start &#x2013; I will start with asking Michael Becker to say something on the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The guidance with regard to cladribine and its profit, if &#x2013; and I say if, and there is no assumption to the probability that cladribine comes connected with the 5 to 10% guidance. If it comes of course a launched product. And I don't think that is possible to have launched product and profit. So this guidance to 5 to 10 &#x2013; includes a negative contribution of cladribine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also &#x2013; maybe a follow-up one on that, if it's not being approved, I would assume that your core return on sales guidance in terms of the margin would be then obviously higher than the 22 to 23%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That depends on how the decision is &#x2013; is it just a blank out refusal, never ever or is it something different? And it depends on our ability to take out cost straight way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it is &#x2013; there are research costs, there are marketing cost, there are other fixed cost which you normally can't take out straight away, so to which extent this will then be result neutral or even we take out a negative product, positive which I doubt depends on our ability to take out these costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the Serostim roughly &#x20AC;70 million in 2010 in revenues and sales. Movectro, I mean at the moment these are two small markets. So the overall situation of Movectro can only be analyzed after February 28. And we also have no reimbursement currently in Russia and Australia. So at the moment, I would like to ask you to wait until we can assess the overall situation. The total impact of EU reforms, I don't have it in hand. Investor Relations will provide a better follow-up.</p>

Just one question, over the last five years biopharmaceutical R&amp;D spending, including government agencies, including the pharma industry, including biotech has probably grown about 10% a year. If consensus forecasts are right, biopharma spending is probably going to be flat to slightly down over the next five years and some governments are going to be spending less on biomedical R&amp;D, NIH, for example in 2011. Does any of that affect the way you think about the growth of Merck Serono, both on the positive side and negative side? So for example, tighter spending, but maybe more variablized costs? I just wondered if you could talk about that for a moment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly the overall amount being spent may be going down, but also make for maybe more impetus to variablize costs, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry. So I just wondered if you could talk about both the positive and negative risks of much slower growth in R&amp;D spending across biomedical players?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just one question left from my side, and it also has to do with Millipore. Could you give us an idea of the organic rates you saw for Millipore in 2010 and what you're expecting for 2011 in terms of organic growth from Millipore and by that I mean the legacy Millipore business, not Merck Millipore? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, I can't give you that organic growth because in 2010 we have no pro forma calculation of legacy Millipore and in 2011 we will have no previous effect of Millipore at all because everything is between blended with the Merck business, and therefore we can't give you an organic growth of legacy Millipore for 2010 or 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe to give you better understanding, what we are doing here, you can realize synergies in the cost area, in the revenue area only if you really put the two businesses together. So somebody representing reagents, has now also to deal lab water and the other way around. So in order to measure the effects in a historical pattern, you would have to go back and do a number of as-if calculations which have no value added practically for the business. And therefore we are moving into the new set of numbers and that is why legacy numbers would lack comparison.</p>
          <p>On the first question one of -- there are two different drivers for the Millipore Biopharmaceutical business. One is, of course, if a new drug enters the market and we are part of the value chain of that drug, then we would have an increase in our business with or without less R&amp;D spending.</p>
          <p>What I wanted to say with that is depend &#x2013; we're in a number of drug developments. If those drugs make it to the market, Millipore business increases because immediately quantities and revenues increase. If the drugs don't make it to the market, then we would fail on that as well. So the question, the short-term question for 2011 is much less of reduced spending, but much more how many of the drugs we are in, make it to the market.</p>
          <p>Long-term of course, we see changes in the industry, the whole pharmaceutical industry is struggling with the issue of R&amp;D efficiency and we are working to find answers also for the Merck Millipore business, how we can deal with that pattern. But this is a strategic discussion which I think goes beyond the scope of the analyst call.</p>
          <p>The other risk is of course on this academia, if you have less incentive by governments in academia, academia is spending less and there it is a question of R&amp;D spend and less of products. But the level going forward for 2011 at least seems to me still being attractively high. So I don't expect a major influence on our numbers from that part of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just following up on a previous question, we estimate that the impact from European healthcare reform in 2010 was a negative impact of &#x20AC;15 million.</p>
          <p>Any additional questions from the audience? Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of brief ones. Just following up on my earlier question about, why continue to invest in research. I think you took my question as meaning how to improve the ROI for research. In actual fact I was saying, why playing in the orchestra at all? You have other asset classes which you're good at, where the environment is less challenging. Is there really a role for an integrated research driven company with the scale that you have in the current environment? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is, if I look at the couple of the recent setbacks Merck has had, you could argue it's the failure to commercialize cladribine and the failure to get approval for Erbitux in lung cancer, both of which arguably were due to an under-investment in running a second trial for the drug.</p>
          <p>I also observe that the compensation of the board is tied to three years rolling profit growth. Many of your peers have adopted over the years EVA or ROC based metrics. To what extent you think that is a consideration that may reinforce correct decision-making throughout the organization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there additional question in the audience? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is a very fundamental strategic question. I do not believe in first place that the question whether to play in orchestra or not has to do with size. It's rather how you play the orchestra. And I don't think that we failed on [Foreign language]. German speakers to the front. Nobody &#x2013; how you tune the instruments. So it's not a question, how you tune the instruments, but rather how you play them. And I believe the tuning was okay, the playing needs some improvement and, obviously, also now we have a new conductor and let's see what comes out from that.</p>
          <p>But still the overall business model of the pharmaceutical industry is certainly one thing which is in discussion irrespective of size as we see, and it is also part of our internal discussion. At the moment, we think we can deliver but the strategic discussion is clearly on for all of us in the sector.</p>
          <p>On the board compensation, I think the first thing we have to do is to get the share price into the board remuneration, and the bodies of the company are discussing that. And I have all indications that from next year on there will be also compensation tied to the share price of the board members. So this for me is priority over other measures. In particular as the compensation of all top managers except the board levels is tied to ROC type investment criteria as well.</p>
          <p>So in practice, I can tell you couldn't run an organization even if there is at the moment still a difference between the board for compensation and the rest of organization, if everybody tells you &#x2013; if you tell an organization, please keep on investing like hell, and they tell you, sorry, then we can't get any bonus, you wouldn't survive as a board member for long. So in practice, there is a link in the compensation scheme that still needs further discussion. But as I said first step is trying into the share and this will be implemented for next year, so in 2011 for 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. Just a few questions, please. Firstly, with respect to Serono, sales guidance seems to imply in the case Serono approval &#x2013; excuse me, cladribine approval in U.S. about &#x20AC;200 million or so in 2011. I am just curious if you can share with us your assumption around what label might be had in the U.S., penetration rates and timing of reimbursement?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with respect to Rebif, in the third quarter commentary, you were be able to provide some kind of volume pricing and currency dynamics for both Europe and U.S. Hoping to get that for the fourth quarter as well?</p>
          <p>And then lastly with respect to foreign exchange, in the quarter you said it was about 5%, I was hoping perhaps, you can give us an estimate of what &#x2013; how much of that flowed through to the bottom line? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>And maybe one additional question from the call before taking Edward's question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. A few questions, please. The first one is on the Rebif, on the new formulation; can you please give us an update regarding the regulatory process in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Stimuvax and cilengitide, can you please give us an update on the timing of the Phase III trials. When can we expect results, at least interim results?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on OLED, can you please give us an update on the market dynamics and the future near-term opportunities for Merck and also for the industry in general? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, can you repeat that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The third question is on the OLEDs, can you please give us an update on the market dynamics and also the near-term opportunities for Merck and the market in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Cladribine, I really ask for your understanding, let's wait for the U.S. decision on the 28th and then we will review the situation and then update you as soon as we have information. At the moment, it is really a crystal ball exercise which I think I wouldn't like to enter into too much.</p>
          <p>For the pricing effects of Rebif in the first quarter and so on, may I suggest that you get in touch with Investor Relations after the call to get details, if they are needed, for your models.</p>
          <p>On Rebif new formulation, as I said before, we're still waiting for study results, so it's too early to say when we can submit it for registration.</p>
          <p>OLED, I still do have the impression that in the TV and display related sector, Liquid Crystal will remain the commanding technology for many years to come. It's a little bit of yo-yo with OLED. Sometimes everybody thinks OLED will be there tomorrow, next day everybody says, no, it will come in 10 years. So my working assumption is that in the display technologies, Liquid Crystals will remain the leading technologies for many years to come.</p>
          <p>In lighting I see better chances for the organic lighting devices and when we open the new material research center here in Darmstadt I was saying that we could hope to be able to tell you more about that in 2012 and that related mainly to lighting.</p>
          <p>On ForEx Michael Becker will add a brief comment and Stimuvax and cilengitide questions will be then answered by Bernhard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To foreign exchange effect on top and bottom line, I understand you meant full year 2010, the currency effect on sales is roughly &#x20AC;270 million plus of course and on total revenues roughly &#x20AC;280 million out of which &#x20AC;10 million flowed through to the bottom line. That is the effect that what a tailwind is for sales and revenues is a headwind for the cost lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe just wanted a short comment in regards to the Rebif U.S. and Europe there was not a discernable difference in organic growth between either region for 2010 for the full year for Rebif.</p>
          <p>So with that, that is all the time we have allotted for today's session. I'd like to turn the conference over to Dr. Kley for some closing remarks. We will have a rebroadcast of this call posted to our website a couple of hours after the event.</p>
          <p>So with that I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Kley for some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There were two questions on Stimuvax and cilengitide, I was just reminded. On Stimuvax, I just mentioned before that the recruitment in the study is going very well. So we planned to recruit 1,500 patients, we are getting closer. And &#x2013; but in terms of speculating what the exact timeline is, we don't do this.</p>
          <p>And cilengitide, glioblastoma going as planned but no further comments on the timelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>In closing, I think we delivered good numbers in a challenging year. The potential in our portfolio is good. The only one who can prevent us from delivering is ourselves. So it's mainly calling ourselves to deliver what we have in hand. I believe that we outlined the opportunities and the headwinds and challenges and believe on that note that good a 2010 will be followed by a good 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to continued and extensive communication with you, all the best. Take care. Bye, bye.</p>
