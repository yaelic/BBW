          <p>Welcome to the annual press conference of the Volkswagen Group. As you can see, this year we have had to extend our stage a little bit because for the very first time here we are welcoming the new Head of Production of the Volkswagen AG, Dr. Michael Macht who is successor to Professor Jochem Heizmann. Professor Heizmann, we'd like to welcome here for the first time in his new capacity as the board member responsible for commercial vehicles.</p>
          <p>So first of all let me tell you about our procedure here today. Professor Winterkorn will be speaking. He'll be looking first of all at the last fiscal year. That will be followed by a detailed analysis from Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, our board member responsible for financial affairs. After that, Professor Winterkorn will once again speak and cast a glance at the months to come.</p>
          <p>After we hear from the board members, we will of course as usual have a question-and-answer session, and this will mainly be, as I said, for our media visitors. After a brief lunch, at about 12:00 we will come back and reconvene at 13:00 and we'll have a Q&amp;A for analysts and investors in particular. So now I'd like to ask Professor Winterkorn to begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My colleagues and I would like to extend a warm welcome to you to our annual media and investor conference. The automotive industry regained momentum in the past year and achieved a sparkling comeback. After proving its robustness during the crisis, our group also led the way in the recovery.</p>
          <p>In 2010 Volkswagen recorded a handsome boost in the image ratings of the group and its brands, in unit sales and market shares, and above all in earnings and net liquidity.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, 2010 was the most successful year in Volkswagen's history. This has also been rewarded by the financial markets. Volkswagen shares were one of the strongest DAX performers.</p>
          <p>Our capital increase in 2010 also showed how strong confidence in our company is. With net issue proceeds of &#x20AC;4.1 billion in the spring of this year, it was one of the most successful in the history of the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Turning to our key figures, at 7.2 million units, the Volkswagen group delivered almost a million more vehicles than in the previous year. Sales and revenue increased by 20.6% to &#x20AC;126.9 billion. Operating profit almost quadrupled to &#x20AC;7.1 billion. This figure does not include our excellent performance in China because our joint ventures are accounted for at equity. Let me put that into context. Our Chinese joint ventures companies generated a pro rata operating profit of &#x20AC;1.9 billion for the group. That was around &#x20AC;1.1 billion more than in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Volkswagen was at full throttle in 2010. Rarely before has so much been asked of our 400,000 employees. Their total dedication and enormous flexibility ensured that our customers received the vehicles they ordered. Volkswagen's success is the success of a strong team, and my colleagues on the Board of Management and I would like to express our sincere thanks to the entire workforce for this.</p>
          <p>Many automotive markets started recovering last year. The Volkswagen Group increased its deliveries by 13.7%, again outperforming the market. We recorded slight growth in Europe despite a difficult environment. Deliveries in Germany declined by 16.7%. By contrast, the overall market contracted by over 23% due to the discontinuation of the scrapping premium.</p>
          <p>We recorded extremely encouraging growth in South America and the USA. Asia Pacific, and especially China, remain the growth drivers. Volkswagen has had a presence in China for more than 25 years; that is increasingly paying off. With almost 2 million vehicles delivered, we further strengthened our number one position.</p>
          <p>Our multi-brand strategy remains our big competitive advantage. Our brand lineup is proving its worth, especially during the upturn. Almost all brands were up in fiscal year 2010, and some posted significant double-digit growth. This enabled us to expand our share in the global passenger car market to 11.4%.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen brand is moving at a fast pace. Its dynamic growth is providing a tailwind for the whole company. In fiscal year 2010 the Volkswagen brand delivered more than 4.5 million passenger cars for the first time. That was almost 14% more than in the previous year. Business in Russia, China and the USA was particularly strong. If you visit a Volkswagen dealership today, you will find cars of a quality, technology, engineering, and design that this brand has never seen before.</p>
          <p>The product highlight in 2010 was undoubtedly the seventh generation of the Passat, which makes premium segment innovation accessible to everyone.</p>
          <p>Audi is moving to the top of the premium segment in leaps and bounds. At almost 1.1 million vehicles, 2010 was the highest selling and most profitable year in Audi's history.</p>
          <p>With innovations such as the A7 and the A8 successor, Audi again set trends for the entire industry. The A1 proves that size isn't everything in this premium segment. And it also shows how the brand is intelligently expanding its portfolio and conquering new segments.</p>
          <p>There is an upbeat mood at &#x160;koda. Sales are to at least double by 2018. &#x160;koda set its eighth successive delivery record in fiscal year 2010 and further extended its position in markets for the future such as China, India and Russia.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda stands for good, practical and attractively priced cars. Our colleagues in Mlad&#xE1; Boleslav are systematically honing this brand profile. In this segment, many millions of customers worldwide are waiting for the right solutions from &#x160;koda.</p>
          <p>These also include eco champions such as the Fabia GreenLine. With a consumption of 3.4 liters per 100 kilometers, it demonstrates how economical our TDI engines are when combined with state-of-the-art efficiency, technologies and engineering.</p>
          <p>SEAT is again recording an upward trend. The brand delivered around 340,000 vehicles to its customers worldwide. And in Spain, SEAT regained market leadership after 31 years.</p>
          <p>Whether its new models such as the Ibiza ST, in its sales activities or in its brand positioning, SEAT is bouncing back. And another key step will be the start of the production of the Audi Q3 in Martorell in the middle of the year. We are convinced that SEAT is making good progress and will again contribute to the group's financial success in the near future.</p>
          <p>The luxury segment has a future, not only, but especially in markets such as China and India. This means the prospects for Bentley are promising. Following the dip in the economy, the brand has regained momentum and increased its deliveries by around 11%. This is due mainly to compelling new automobiles such as the Continental GT. Like the brand itself, this successor to the best-selling Bentley models stands for contemporary, state-of-the-art luxury.</p>
          <p>For Lamborghini, 2010 was a year of transition. At 1,300 deliveries, the brand was down on the previous year. However, we are confident about future developments because demand for exclusive sports cars and in-core Lamborghini markets is picking up.</p>
          <p>Extreme vehicles with more performance but less weight, that's what Lamborghini stands for, and it's what the Gallardo Superleggera represents. This exceptional vehicle again positions Lamborghini as a pioneer in lightweight construction and carbon fiber in the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles is again pursuing a clear expansion strategy. We see major potential for Volkswagen in this segment worldwide, including Europe. In 2010, deliveries rose by over 20% to 436,000 vehicles. Business boomed in South America in particular.</p>
          <p>The Amarok is a good example of how Volkswagen is winning customers and conquering segments with new models. We successfully positioned the most economical pickup in its class in the South American and European markets. From 2012, the Amarok will also be produced in Hanover to satisfy the high demand for this vehicle.</p>
          <p>Following a difficult year for trucks in 2009, Scania has returned to the fast lane, with deliveries up about, almost 47%. And Scania's return on sales of almost 16% means that we are very satisfied indeed with our investment.</p>
          <p>The success of Scania's vehicles is due above all to their high cost-effectiveness and efficient drives. The new V8 series already gives the brand the technical solutions required to meet the Euro 6 emission standard envisioned for the end of 2013. After the dramatic slump of previous years, demand for heavy trucks increased by over 50%. This is a highly attractive strategic business area for the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>As you know, Scania and MAN are holding talks on closer cooperation to achieve substantial synergies in development, purchasing and production. However, it has been established that the full synergies can ultimately only be leveraged through an alliance of the two companies. We believe that such a partnership of equals offers significant opportunities for the two companies, their customers and employees. One thing is certain. The brand-specific features of Scania and MAN are and will remain untouchable. They are the foundation for success and the core of the multi-brand strategy.</p>
          <p>No decision has yet been met on the form of the potential alliance or on a future investment structure. Volkswagen is doing all it can to support these efforts. We have put this area in the expert hands of Dr. Heizmann on the Group Board of Management.</p>
          <p>2010 was also a good year for Volkswagen Financial Services. Every third group vehicle was sold with a finance or leasing contract from Volkswagen Financial Services. Our goal is to leverage the entire automotive value chain even more systematically. Financial Services in particular offer a lot of potential here. In China, for example, only around 10% of all new vehicles are currently loan financed. Volkswagen Financial Services AG is therefore continuing to expand its international presence, establishing a new subsidiary in South Korea and obtaining a banking license for Russia, among other things.</p>
          <p>To sum up, Volkswagen Financial Services remains a sales driver for our brands and a cornerstone of our success, contributing &#x20AC;930,000 million (sic) [&#x20AC;930 million] to consolidated profit.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the automotive industry is reshaping itself. Alliances and cooperations are a key instrument in meeting the growing challenges. Against this background, Volkswagen entered into a strategic partnership with Suzuki. A whole range of attractive opportunities for cooperation have emerged in just one year of partnership. We have targeted the small car segment in India in particular. We can also envisage cooperating in efficient power trains and alternative drive technologies. Concrete projects are currently being discussed constructively with colleagues at Suzuki.</p>
          <p>The integrated automotive group being created by Volkswagen and Porsche is also taking ever clearer shape. Another milestone was the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg's trading business, effective on the 1st of March, 2011. Porsche Holding Salzburg is one of the most successful and profitable dealer organizations in the automotive world. It will continue its proven business model unchanged under the Volkswagen umbrella. At the same time, this move will clearly strengthen our effectiveness in sales and distribution.</p>
          <p>The next step defined in the Comprehensive Agreement is the capital increase at Porsche SE. This is planned for the first half of this year. Preparations are fully on schedule.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen remains totally committed to the Comprehensive Agreement and to the merger with Porsche. However, the tax and legal hurdles still to be overcome along the way are not insubstantial. Nevertheless, irrespective of all the formal issues, I would like to make one thing clear. The integrated Volkswagen and Porsche Group will definitely happen.</p>
          <p>We are therefore making every effort to drive forward our cooperation at an operational level. And our synergy teams are doing good work. We have already developed concrete projects for over 60% of our joint goal to increase operating profit by &#x20AC;700 million per year in the long term, and this does not include any of our major vehicle and modular system projects. However, we will only be able to leverage a large proportion of the synergy potential once the integrated group has been created.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the personnel changes in recent months also show very clearly that Volkswagen and Porsche are growing together fast and following a common strategy. The will to cooperate can be felt everywhere and we have the right team spirit. I am convinced that the team that Volkswagen and Porsche are now forming can and will remain at the top of the league for a long term.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, that ends my review of 2010. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will now explain our key figures to you in detail. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to bid you a very warm welcome to today's annual press and investor conferences here in Wolfsburg. As Professor Winterkorn already said, Volkswagen can look back on a successful fiscal year 2010. In the past year, both the global economy and the automotive industry largely recovered from the repercussions of the financial and economic crisis. The Volkswagen Group is well positioned and participated in the economic upturn.</p>
          <p>We recorded the best results in our company's history in fiscal 2010. Volkswagen increased sales revenue by 20.6% to &#x20AC;126.9 billion in 2010, and our operating profit set a new record at &#x20AC;7.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition, our Automotive Division improved its return on investment to 13.5%, which is well above our 9% minimum required rate of return. Automotive Division liquidity is another key parameter in the Volkswagen group, and net liquidity compared to the previous year rose by &#x20AC;8 billion to &#x20AC;18.6 billion.</p>
          <p>And there are several reasons for this increase. First of all, the capital increase that we carried out is a key milestone in our plans to create the integrated Automotive Group with Porsche and it strengthened the group's financial stability and flexibility. And then secondly, positive business trends together with our disciplined cost management improved the Automotive Division's liquidity position.</p>
          <p>In light of our company's highly encouraging performance and our positive prospects for the future, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will be proposing to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of &#x20AC;2.20 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;2.26 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>In an economically challenging environment, we have impressively demonstrated that our group's financial foundations are robust. We significantly increased our profitability in fiscal 2010. This shows that our decision to continue our policy of disciplined cost and investment management was indeed the right one. The continuous improvement of our products and processes remains a core component that will help us reach our goal of becoming the global economic and environmental leader among automotive manufacturers by the year 2018.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to take a closer look at 2010, starting with an overview of the income statement for the last year.</p>
          <p>We increased our sales revenue by &#x20AC;21.7 billion or 20.6% year-on-year to &#x20AC;126.9 billion. Since our cost of sales rose by a mere 15.1%, gross profit improved by &#x20AC;7.9 billion to &#x20AC;21.4 billion. As a result, our gross margin increased by four percentage points to 16.9% of sales revenue.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;12.2 billion, distribution expenses rose compared with the previous year because of the significantly higher volume. However, the ratio of distribution expenses to sales revenue declined. The other operating result declined by &#x20AC;0.4 billion to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. In the previous year, this item included the proceeds of &#x20AC;0.6 billion from the sale of the Brazilian commercial vehicle business to the MAN Group.</p>
          <p>Overall, our operating profit increased to &#x20AC;7.1 billion. We were able to achieve this thanks to the tremendous commitment and hard work of all our group's employees.</p>
          <p>These figures do not include the &#x20AC;1.9 billion proportional share of the operating profit recorded by our Chinese joint ventures, which are consolidated at equity and are therefore only reflected in the group's financial result. Last year's figures demonstrate that our Chinese joint ventures have continued their positive growth trend. And the good results of our equity-accounted investment in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH are also reflected in our financial result.</p>
          <p>In 2010, the financial result made a positive contribution. Higher investment income from the equity-accounted investments and gains from updated actuarial assumptions underlying devaluation models used to measure the put/call rights more than offset net losses on the measurement of financial instruments used for currency and commodity hedges. Our total profit before tax amounted to &#x20AC;9 billion. The tax rate declined on an annualized basis to 19.7%, producing a record profit after tax of &#x20AC;7.2 billion for 2010.</p>
          <p>Allow me to note at this point that you will find a presentation of the key indicators for the fourth quarter of 2010 at our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, following this overview of the Volkswagen Group's income statement, I would now like to look at certain specific items in greater detail.</p>
          <p>We generated total sales revenue of &#x20AC;126.9 billion in fiscal 2010. &#x20AC;19.8 billion of the revenue growth of &#x20AC;21.7 billion was in the Automotive Division. This breaks down into &#x20AC;11 billion from volume growth, &#x20AC;0.8 billion from price-related measures, &#x20AC;2.1 billion from mix improvements and &#x20AC;4.1 billion from exchange rates.</p>
          <p>As we sold our Brazilian commercial vehicle business to MAN in 2009, its 2010 revenue is no longer contained in our figures. Scania also made a positive contribution at &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Our Financial Services Division recorded revenue growth of &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>The breakdown of sales revenue by market shows that the Volkswagen Group recorded healthy growth in all markets last year. In Europe, including the remaining markets, sales revenue grew by 11.4% year-on-year to &#x20AC;83.8 billion. In North America, the higher volume and an improvement in exchange rate effects drove our sales revenue up by 33.3%.</p>
          <p>We recorded significantly higher revenue growth of 40.2% in the South American market and 60.4% in the Asia-Pacific region. I would like to note again at this point that the sales revenue figure for Asia-Pacific contains only our deliveries to our Chinese joint ventures and not their own sales revenue in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>This chart shows operating profit by brand and business sector. Strong demand for vehicles and financial services lifted the Volkswagen Group's operating profit significantly year-on-year to &#x20AC;7.1 billion. The Volkswagen brand's operating profit almost quadrupled to &#x20AC;2.2 billion, while the Audi brand's operating profit more than doubled to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. The figures for both of these brands reflect the high level of market acceptance for our attractive products and the success of our sustained cost and process optimization.</p>
          <p>The &#x160;koda brand more than doubled its operating profit year-on-year from &#x20AC;203 million to &#x20AC;447 million. In addition to the high volume, mix effects and cost reductions had a favorable effect here.</p>
          <p>The SEAT brand improved its operating result by &#x20AC;28 million compared to the previous year, narrowing the operating loss to &#x20AC;311 million. Positive factors here were first, the slight increase in deliveries compared to the previous year, and secondly, the especially positive sales figures for the new Leon and Altea models. However, our Spanish subsidiary is still facing a decline in demand in the overall Spanish passenger car market. Additionally, upfront expenditures were incurred for new products.</p>
          <p>Although the conditions in the luxury segment remain difficult in fiscal 2010, Bentley again reported a rise in sales figures. Shifts in the market and product mix as well as upfront expenditures for new products had a negative impact on the operating result, and consequently Bentley's operating result declined by &#x20AC;51 million, with the company posting an operating loss of &#x20AC;245 million.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;232 million, the operating profit recorded by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles declined by &#x20AC;81 million compared with 2009. However, adjusted for the proceeds of around &#x20AC;600 million in the previous year from the sale of the Brazilian commercial vehicles business, the operating result recorded a significant increase.</p>
          <p>The Scania brand performed very well in 2010. In the past fiscal year, the Commercial Vehicles sector recovered noticeably from the effects of the financial and economic crisis, and Scania was able to benefit impressively from this trend. Scania contributed an operating profit of &#x20AC;1.3 billion to the group's performance in 2010.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Financial Services generated an operating profit of just under &#x20AC;1 billion in fiscal 2010, again making a significant contribution to the Volkswagen Group's operating profit.</p>
          <p>Please note that the figures for the brands and sectors also include intra-group transactions, in particular, inter-company profits whose elimination is contained in the Other category. Additionally, this category includes the depreciation and amortization expense from the purchase price allocation for Scania.</p>
          <p>A look at the reasons for the significant improvement in operating profit shows that volume, mix and price effects totaling &#x20AC;4.6 billion were the largest positive factors. Exchange rate movements improved our operating profit in 2010 by &#x20AC;1 billion compared to the previous year. The clear reduction in our product costs again had a positive effect on our operating profit. At &#x20AC;1.6 billion, we exceeded our goal in fiscal 2010 of saving product costs in the order of &#x20AC;1 billion, and this shows that we are continuing our systematic work on our cost structures and continuously improving our processes.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was reduced by higher fixed costs of &#x20AC;2.8 billion. The main factors here were the startup costs for our new production facilities in Russia, the United Sates and India, as well as upfront expenditures for our new products. These measures are critical to the success of the long-term implementation of our Strategy 2018 and will also allow us to handle the expected higher unit sales volumes in the years to come.</p>
          <p>As I've already mentioned, we sold our Brazilian commercial vehicles business to MAN in 2009, so the earnings effect was of course only recorded in 2009. Scania contributed &#x20AC;1.1 billion to the improvement in the group's operating profit, demonstrating its importance to the Group. Volkswagen Financial Services made an additional positive contribution of &#x20AC;0.3 billion to the improvement in the Group's operating profit.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, return on investment is the Automotive Division's core financial management parameter. It expresses the return on invested capital for a particular period based on the operating profit after tax. This KPI, or key performance indicator, is therefore our critical parameter for the financial assessment of all strategic and operational decisions.</p>
          <p>In 2009, return on investment, or ROI, was down as a result of the global financial and economic crisis, but we increased this figure significantly in 2010. The ROI of 13.5% also exceeded the level of the good fiscal years 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>We not only earned our current cost of capital of 6.3%, we also significantly exceeded our 9% minimum required rate of return. So as a result, we significantly improved our economic value added compared with the previous year to &#x20AC;3.1 billion. These figures prove the further progress we've achieved in implementing our strategy of disciplined cost and investment management.</p>
          <p>In all our investment decisions, we will continue to ensure that our upfront expenditures are focused on safeguarding the future of our company and generating adequate returns.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services Division improved its return on equity from 7.9% to 12.9%. In addition to increased volumes, this rise was driven by proceeds from the marketing of pre-owned vehicles from our leasing business.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the consolidated balance sheet. The Volkswagen Group's total assets at the end of 2010 amounted to &#x20AC;199.4 billion, an annual increase of 12.5%. Despite the increase in total assets, the group's equity ratio improved by 3.3 percentage points to 24.4%.</p>
          <p>Equity in the Automotive Division was strengthened by the positive earnings growth. In addition, the success of our capital increase in the first half of 2010 contributed net proceeds of &#x20AC;4.1 billion, thus increasing our equity ratio by 5.3 percentage points to 35.5%.</p>
          <p>Equity in the Financial Services Division increased by around &#x20AC;1 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;9.2 billion. In addition to the good earnings performance, positive currency hedging effects and the capital increase carried out by Volkswagen AG were the main factors here. The division's equity ratio was 10.4%.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the individual items in our cash flow statement. The Automotive Division further expanded its stable net liquidity, which rose by &#x20AC;8 billion in 2010 to &#x20AC;18.6 billion. This figure is by no means negligible and demonstrates our company's solid financial basis. In addition to our good business performance, the success of our capital increase was a major factor in this improvement. The earnings growth increased gross cash flow by &#x20AC;5.8 billion to &#x20AC;12.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Following the considerable release of funds in 2009, working capital again recorded a net inflow of &#x20AC;1.6 billion despite the volume growth. And as a result, cash flow from operating activities increased by &#x20AC;1.1 billion to &#x20AC;13.9 billion.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;5.7 billion, investments in property, plant and equipment were on a level with the previous year. Since sales revenue increased significantly, the ratio of investments in property, plant and equipment CapEx to sales revenue, declined by 1.2 percentage points to 5%. However, our disciplined cost management does not come at the expense of our products.</p>
          <p>We can only do this because, in particular, our progress in modularizing our vehicle designs cuts one-time costs for the individual models while at the same time allowing us to achieve savings in direct costs. In addition to these synergy-driven efficiency enhancements, we will continue to invest prudently in new production facilities and in the environmental focus of our model lineup.</p>
          <p>Including additions to capitalized development costs and the acquisition of our holding in Suzuki, cash outflows from investing activities amounted to &#x20AC; 9.1 billion, although this was &#x20AC;1.2 billion less than in the previous year. Net cash flow, in other words the difference between cash flows from operating activities and from investing activities, rose by &#x20AC;2.3 billion to &#x20AC;4.8 billion.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned when I began, our net liquidity in the Automotive Division remains sound. This substantial basis is not an end in itself, rather it gives us the necessary financial flexibility for our investments and the implementation of our Strategy 2018. For example, we purchased Porsche Holding Salzburg just a few days ago for a price of &#x20AC;3.3 billion, thus strengthening our sales activities.</p>
          <p>I would also like to draw your attention to a new publication. This morning we published the notice convening Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft Annual General Meeting in Hamburg on May 3, 2011. In addition to the usual resolutions proposed at all Annual General Meetings, the agenda includes a proposal by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the AGM to create new share capital. We want to use this opportunity to replace a previous authorization, which was not used in the past five years and expires in May, by a new authorization. We are convinced that such an authorization is a standard procedure at large stock corporations such as Volkswagen AG so that we can safeguard flexible financing activities.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me close by summarizing 2010. We can look back on a successful fiscal year. The Volkswagen Group generated profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG of &#x20AC;6.8 billion in 2010. This corresponds to undiluted earnings of &#x20AC;15.17 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;15.23 per preferred share. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are therefore proposing to the Annual General Meeting to approve a dividend for Volkswagen AG of &#x20AC;2.20 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;2.26 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now I'd like to hand back over to Dr. Winterkorn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. Ladies and gentlemen, Volkswagen moved into the fast lane in 2010, and that is where we intend to stay in the current year. Thanks to our new plants and models, our modular systems and the planned integration of Porsche, we are now laying the foundations for profitable growth in all segments and business fields.</p>
          <p>I am convinced that we are doing this at the right point in time. Before the financial crisis, many saw the automotive industry as part of the old economy. Some had already written it off. I believe that this old economy has impressively demonstrated it is very much alive and kicking indeed. The automotive sector reflects Germany's strength as an industrial powerhouse. It is proving its ability to renew itself and it remains one of the sectors of the future.</p>
          <p>But of course we are aware that our business is becoming more and more challenging. The global economy is extremely volatile. Oil and commodity prices are rising, partly driven by speculation. New arrivals are pushing their way to the fore, and the competitive pressure is growing. And especially in Germany, we must continue to acquire and train enough good engineers and specialists going forwards.</p>
          <p>At the same time, a new technology era is dawning. We must make alternative drives ready for production and affordable. We must make new energy sources usable for automobiles. We must redefine mobility in the world's booming megacities.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we can say that the automotive industry has never before faced such challenges in the past 125 years &#x2013; economically, strategically and technologically. We have systematically prepared Volkswagen for all these challenges. Our brands already offer mobility solutions to meet every need in every vehicle class, all around the globe. This diversity is our great strength.</p>
          <p>The trends in automotive development are going to be set in Wolfsburg, Ingolstadt and Weissach. We are further extending this technology lead.</p>
          <p>Strict cost discipline and net liquidity of &#x20AC;18.6 billion mean that financially we also have sufficient fuel in the tank. For example, we intend to invest &#x20AC;53.5 billion in the Automotive Division and an additional &#x20AC;10.6 billion in China in the period to 2015. And last but not least, our group can rely on reasonable long-term shareholders. This give us additional stability.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you can see that Volkswagen has laid all the foundations to play a key role in shaping the future of the automobile. Our 2018 Strategy gives us a clear road map for this. Customers, employees, business partners, shareholders and the public see and sense how serious we are.</p>
          <p>This is because we are also on a qualitative growth path. Our goal is to combine the highest customer and employee satisfaction, the best product quality and excellent profitability with strong volume growth.</p>
          <p>In the past year we have achieved important milestones on this path. Volkswagen's 2018 Strategy is completely on schedule. However, we also know that if you want to be at the top of the automotive industry, you must outperform the competition, not at least in three core areas. First environmentally friendly green mobility; second, leveraging our market opportunities worldwide; and third, our employees.</p>
          <p>Looking at the first point, there are currently around a billion vehicles in the world. In just 10 years there could be well over 1.3 billion. This mobility boom must be handled responsibly, and that means pushing ahead with environmentally friendly drive technologies, developing intelligent and networked traffic systems and making production in our plants worldwide even more resource-friendly. Volkswagen is pursuing these issues very systematically because we are committed to our ecological responsibility and because all these factors also make good economic sense in the long term.</p>
          <p>In the past five years we have reduced our fleet CO2 emissions by around 15% to 144 grams. And the Volkswagen Group already has 20 model variants in its range emitting less than 100 grams of CO2 per kilometer. Further substantial steps will follow.</p>
          <p>One example of how we are doing this is the Volkswagen XL1, as you can see. Our one liter car contains all the elements that make up tomorrow's mobility; that's because a company needs to master the entire range of issues if it wants to develop the most efficient car in the world and to build it in the near future.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen is relying on three key technologies in this regard. Firstly, we are extending our pioneering role in intelligent lightweight construction and innovative materials. Our equity just in SGL Carbon will allow us to share in the positive performance of the forward-looking carbon fiber market.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are lowering the consumption of combustion engines even further and are extending our lead in DSG gearboxes. We expect additional improvements in efficiency of over 15% in this area in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we are driving forward hybrid technology and e-mobility at high speed. In doing so, we are following a clear roadmap that makes both good economic and good technical sense.</p>
          <p>Our customers don't want a quick-fix solution. They want an electric car that is fully tested, suitable for everyday use and, above all, affordable. And that is exactly what Volkswagen will be providing with the E-Up! in 2013 followed by the E-Golf. And here our modular strategy is our core advantage over our competitors because our modular systems have been designed to allow the flexible introduction of all types of drivetrain in all series and brands.</p>
          <p>At the same time, this allows us to cut costs and complexity. One-off expenditure and unit cost targets can be cut by 20%. Manufacturing time and complexity are being slashed. And last but not least, we are achieving significant reductions in vehicle weight and emissions. We expect that these measures will result in substantial economies of scale and cost benefits in hybrid and electric vehicles as well. In other words, the Volkswagen Group meets the technical and economic conditions needed to help e-mobility enter the mainstream in the long term.</p>
          <p>Just how seriously we are taking this issue can be seen from the fact that we are setting up our own e-mobility campus here in Wolfsburg. We will be investing roughly &#x20AC;80 million in the coming years in this facility which is located at the center of our R&amp;D site. This is where we will concentrate e-mobility expertise at our headquarters, putting it literally at the heart of our development activities. All in all, the e-mobility campus will house around 1,100 researchers and other staff.</p>
          <p>Audi has also opened a large e-mobility development and test center in Ingolstadt. Its roughly 840 employees are taking an integrated approach to the issues of drivetrain technology, batteries and power electronics.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to turn to the second topic: our opportunities in world markets. 2018 could be the year in which more than 100 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are sold for the first time.</p>
          <p>The center of gravity is shifting more and more to the BRIC states. For example, we expect market volumes in India to double, and Volkswagen is growing faster than the market there. The role played by China, by far the most important and largest market, is increasing. As the market leader, we will benefit substantially from this thanks to our massive investments in new production facilities and vehicles. In the booming ASEAN region we will be starting local vehicle production in Malaysia as well in 2012. However, traditional automobile nations such as the United States also offer us significant opportunities.</p>
          <p>It goes without saying that Volkswagen must continue expanding its presence in all these future markets and it must continue to increase customer satisfaction in relation to both its vehicles and its services.</p>
          <p>Allow me to illustrate this using two examples. The Russian automotive market has gathered momentum and grew by around 30% last year. According to our exports, the country will be the largest sales market in Europe as early as 2018. Up to 150,000 vehicles a year are rolling off the production line in Kaluga, including the Polo Sedan which was specially developed for our Russian customers.</p>
          <p>Now we're taking the next step. Together with the GAZ Group we want to produce more than 100,000 Volkswagen and &#x160;koda cars a year at the GAZ location in Nizhny Novgorod. Rapidly expanding production and dealership capacity will allow the group to profit substantially from the Russian automobile boom.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen is also seizing the offensive again in the USA. By 2018 we want to increase annual group unit sales there to 1 million vehicles.</p>
          <p>We have laid the groundwork for this with our new U.S. facility. This is one of the most modern and greenest factories in the world. In Chattanooga, we are initially going to build up to 150,000 units a year of the Volkswagen Passat version that was especially developed for the USA. The Passat and the Jetta, which is produced in Mexico, form the backbone of our U.S. campaign.</p>
          <p>The critical points here are as follows. Roughly 85% of the parts for the U.S. Passat are sourced from the region. We are planning to increase local value added still further by opening a new engine plant in Mexico. This will make us less dependent on exchange rate fluctuations, and that in turn will allow us to sell our vehicles at competitive prices.</p>
          <p>Regionally tailored products, modern high-performance facilities sited in the area and local sourcing of components and raw materials are the three critical success factors for profitable growth on all global markets.</p>
          <p>This will also benefit the German locations. For example, we supplied China with more than 600,000 gearboxes and engines from Germany in the past year alone.</p>
          <p>Allow me to make one thing very clear in this context. Volkswagen's strength in Europe and Germany is and remains the basis for our global success, not least because we can build here on extremely well-qualified staff and a unique automotive cluster. This is why Audi has invested &#x20AC;300 million in its Brussels factory. This is why more than half of our investments in property, plant and equipment are made in Germany, and this is why our 62nd production facility is located in Osnabr&#xFC;ck. The specialist knowledge they have built up there in the areas of small series and cabriolets is extremely valuable for the group. Production of the Golf Cabriolet has just started and more than 1,800 jobs will be created at Volkswagen Osnabr&#xFC;ck by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>This brings me to my last point &#x2013; our staff. Our order books are well filled, our production facilities are operating at full stretch, and we have introduced special shifts in many locations. At the same time, we are continuing to push forward with the Volkswagen Way, which is designed to boost productivity in our production facilities and administrative and operations even further. We can only do this with a qualified and highly motivated workforce, and this is why employee satisfaction and commitment is one of our four core strategic goals.</p>
          <p>In this situation, we are going to increase our human resources. By 2018 we expect the Volkswagen Group to have created more than 50,000 additional jobs. A large proportion of these will be in our growth markets, and especially China. However, we also intend to add 5,000 to 6,000 qualified new positions in Germany in the medium term.</p>
          <p>What is more, Volkswagen has also become a magnet for top management talent in the sector. We offer our management staff, both male and female, excellent development prospects within the group. At the same time, we are selectively recruiting top staff from outside the company to ensure we can successfully master the growing tasks.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, we are also investing in the next generation at Volkswagen. In the current year the group will recruit 7,400 university graduates and 3,300 vocational trainees. This means we will again be taking on substantially more young people than in the previous year. The increase in university graduates alone amounts to 40%.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Volkswagen stands for more than just good cars. It also stands for responsible, fair dealings with its staff; for good working conditions and high social standards in all 62 facilities worldwide; for an outstanding system of vocational training and continuous professional development, for example, in the new Volkswagen Academies in Pune and Chattanooga; for exciting development opportunities for both men and women. And last but not least, for ensuring that staff share financially in the company's success in an appropriate manner. For us, these things aren't merely soft factors, they're not just nice to have; they are very definitely economic value drivers. And they form the basis for Volkswagen's ability to manage its growth effectively.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in the next few months our group brands will launch around 30 new products for customers. These include such key vehicles at the new Golf Cabriolet, the New Small Family, the Audi A6 and the Q3.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we are continuing to keep pace with our products. At the same time, automotive markets throughout the world are gaining momentum. Volkswagen has built on this to get off to a flying start in 2011. In January and February we delivered more than 1.2 million vehicles worldwide. At 17.5%, our growth is once again clearly in excess of the market.</p>
          <p>However, unit sales are not the only encouraging thing about how our business is doing at present. Our group is expecting a strong quarter on all fronts. As a result, we are looking to the coming months with optimism and assurance, despite the economic uncertainties.</p>
          <p>We expect 2011 to be a good year both for the automotive industry and for Volkswagen. We are forecasting that our group will sell even more vehicles, generate even more sales revenue and report an even higher operating profit than in our record year of 2010.</p>
          <p>In all this we are relying on Volkswagen's proven virtues: a strong team spirit among our brands and regions; environmentally friendly technologies and fascinating vehicles; uncompromising quality; robust finances and disciplined cost and investment management; and a responsible approach in all areas in the interests of our customers, employees, shareholders and society.</p>
          <p>As you can see, Volkswagen is remaining true to itself, and you can continue to expect a lot of us in the future.</p>
          <p>Many thanks for your attention.</p>
