        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ken, and welcome, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>This quarter, foreign exchange rates weren't much of a factor in our overall results, compared to our guidance of a negative 2% currency effect to new license revenue, and a negative 3% currency effect to total revenue. We beat the high end of our guidance range for new license revenue, total revenue, and earnings per share with a record earnings per share for the first quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, we also beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue, total revenue, and earnings per share. In short, Q1 was an excellent quarter for Oracle.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, new license revenues were $1.3 billion, up 25%. The Americas grew 33%, EMEA was up 12%, and Asia was up 26%. With each region up double digits on a constant-dollar basis as well, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals.</p>
          <p>Technology devices revenues were $937 million, up 32%, as the Americas grew 44%, EMEA was up 25%, and Asia was up 19%.</p>
          <p>Applications new license revenues were $349 million, up 10% from last year. The Americas grew 14%, EMEA was down 19%, and Asia was up 54%.</p>
          <p>Our software license updates and product-support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 11% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our hardware systems products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from hardware systems support were $680 million. Our services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 18%, as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins.</p>
          <p>Our total revenues were $7.6 billion, up 50% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 27%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 39% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate for the first quarter was 24.7%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.35 to $0.37. Earnings per share were up 38% from last year. In Q1, we repurchased 10.8 million shares at an average price of $23.13 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we have $23.6 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 45 days, compared to 46 days last year, and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Safra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. I'm going to just make a few brief comments on Q1, and then I'll review the guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark. Obviously we are extremely pleased with our Q1 results, which follows a really great FY 2010. Our software license growth was, frankly, outstanding. I was more than double the high end of our guidance, actually. And as I said in the past what is really going on is we have a lot of company-specific momentum in each line of business, both software and hardware systems.</p>
          <p>Our customers are realizing that it's far better to buy open and integrated solutions from us rather than discrete components from half a dozen separate vendors, clearly the benefits of engineered systems are obvious to them.  We are just seeing more opportunities involving more of our products, and deals seem to be getting a little bigger. Customers are buying our applications, including industry specific applications and of course, they are deploying those applications on our middleware suite, database, and operating systems, both Solaris and Linux and now they are seeing real benefit to deploying those applications and technologies on our optimized hardware systems, so discrete product competitors are just becoming less and less relevant.</p>
          <p>Our hardware system revenue also came in, as you can see, better than we had expected, particularly, since this is the first time the Sun guys have had an August close. Because I actually do read what you guys write, I want to repeat something I said on previous calls regarding Sun's hardware business, and how we changed it. First, we have ended numerous reselling agreements, accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware revenue that usually came to Sun at little or no profit at all. Secondly, Sun lost a lot of money chasing commodity server share, but never really had the volume to actually compete effectively on price. We are not going to chase highly unprofitable revenue, and thirdly, we have redirected the hardware business to the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage. Think Exadata. There is a reason we talk about it all the time. We're focused on the sweet spot of the market for us where we can deliver unique value for our customers.</p>
          <p>So comparing hardware revenue to Sun's historical revenue is just not terribly meaningful. Now you can see all of this show up in our gross margins for systems, which was over 48%, higher than last quarter, which was 46, when &#x2013; even though our volumes are much lower in Q1. So, in addition to our strong top-line performance in both hardware and software, we delivered very strong operating margins as usual. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 39%, substantially higher than our peers, including IBM and SAP, actually our 39% operating margin is 10% higher than SAP even though we're also selling hardware.</p>
          <p>So let me get to the guidance, and we do believe that the guidance I'm giving is realistic, though conservative.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both software and hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 3% currency effect on license growth, and a negative 4% on total revenue growth, that &#x2013; with that, our guidance for Q2 is as follows: New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 9 to 19% in constant currency, and 6 to 16% at current exchange rates; hardware product revenues are expected to be between 1 billion and 1.1 billion in constant currency or 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion at current exchange rates. And that does not include the hardware support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 43 to 47% in constant currency, and 39 to 43 at current exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue at somewhere between 42 to 47% growth in constant currency, and 38 to 43 at current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be 45 to 47 cents in constant currency and 44 to 46 up from 39 last year, assuming current exchange rates. GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to be 28 to 30, assuming constant currency, 27 to 29 cents at current exchange rates. Now my guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 30.5, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5.</p>
          <p>Of course, it may end up being different, and of course, our Board again, declared a dividend of $0.05. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Safra. I know there has been a lot of concern about Oracle going into the hardware business, so I'm going to focus my comments about the Sun hardware business how we found it, and what we have done to try to make it better. Let's see, we have two fundamental goals in the Sun hardware business, first to make it profitable, and quoting one of our great Presidents, "Mission accomplished."</p>
          <p>We now have a very, very profitable hardware business, that made a substantial contribution to our overall profitability in Q1. We have a profitable business, and we think it's going to become more profitable throughout the fiscal year, but, again, I want to emphasize, the Sun software business is clearly profitable. I am going to focus on the Sun hardware business. And I'm saying it is already making a substantial contribution to our profitability.</p>
          <p>Since &#x2013; since we took over Sun, we have improved the gross margins to 48.4%. That's up from a nadir of around 38% when Sun was running things. And we think there's more to go. I don't know if we can get to 50, but 50 is kind of a target, it depends on our product mix, and it's not going to happen overnight, but, again, I think we can very substantially improve those gross margins.</p>
          <p>So, again, we're profitable. We want to make it more profitable. It's going to get better throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Once profitable, and we are profitable, we have got to grow the size of that business, and we think we can double it. It is going to take some time, but, again, we think we can double the size of that hardware business, and we think we have to. We have to go out and aggressively take share from IBM and our other hardware competitors.</p>
          <p>To make the Sun business more profitable, what have we done, and what are we going to do? The first thing and the easiest thing to do was stop pursuing business that was not profitable. As Safra pointed out, let's stop chasing revenue and start chasing profit. We're not selling Hitachi disks anymore. It is a terrific product, but we don't make any money reselling it.</p>
          <p>We're not selling Veritas NetBackup anymore. We're not pursuing these high-performance computing deals which are big deals and very prestigious, but I don't know anyone who makes any money on these things.</p>
          <p>So we're out of those businesses, and that &#x2013; you know, I think a lot of people are looking at our top line and saying that we're not growing. Our top line is growing, but that growth has been offset by kind of dumping these unprofitable lines of business. We filled in &#x2013; we filled in with other businesses which are more profitable. The other thing we are &#x2013; so that's done. We don't resell things, and we don't pursue business that's unprofitable.</p>
          <p>The other thing we're doing is trying to optimize operations over there. We will be to a single integrated computer system for order management, for network support, for dispatch, for field service, we'll have all of that done around January. So that's a pretty good &#x2013; a pretty good record. Oracle and Sun will be on a single unified global system in January, everything: HR, payroll, accounting, service, order management, inventory, everything is going to be in place in January. And that's going to be a big help. That will make our operations more efficient and more profitable, and we're reducing the number of contract manufacturers, and reducing the number of contract manufacturer locations, so we're simplifying that, and by doing that, we're able to negotiate better deals with the contract manufacturers.</p>
          <p>We're directly shipping from those manufacturers to our customers, which we hadn't been doing before, which will lower our costs and get our customers their products sooner. We had, I think, seven &#x2013; seven or eleven &#x2013; I can't remember which &#x2013; parts depot locations in the Bay area alone, and we are reducing that to a couple. So we're simplifying and optimizing the operations.  Again, we think this is going to have impact throughout this fiscal year. But we'll be in pretty good shape by the end of this fiscal year, and that's going to help the profitability of our business and the responsiveness of our business to our customers.</p>
          <p>All right, that &#x2013; the other thing in terms of growing the top line of the Sun business is we have got to innovate in the area of interesting new products, and we inherited some new products from Sun which were terrific, like the ZFS storage appliance and again, the unique thing about the ZFS storage appliance, it's a Solaris disk system that integrates hardware and software where the hardware and software is engineered to fit together, so we love that product that was done at Sun.</p>
          <p>We are working -- of course, we had been working with Sun to do other engineered hardware/software combinations, Exadata being the best known. My quote in the release was the Exadata pipeline for the full fiscal year is now up to $1.5 billion and growing rapidly. We think this is going to be a huge business for us, and we're going to be introducing more hardware/software combinations at OpenWorld next week. That's a big focus for us which is to leverage our advantage, which is being both a software company and hardware company, engineering all of the pieces so they fit together and work together well. We think that is going to make customers' lives a lot easier. We're looking at systems that are easier to operate, more reliable, and faster. That's certainly true of Exadata and it will be true of the other products we announce in this area. We're upgrading our SPARC processors. We think we can build processors as fast as anybody else. IBM has got a terrific processor, Intel has got a terrific processor, and we will have a terrific processor. We've got a way to go yet, but I think we're making really good progress building the team and building the next generation of SPARC processors. Okay. That's kind of on the technology side of the Sun hardware business, where I think we're making good progress and we will continue to invest in that area.</p>
          <p>The other thing is in distribution. Sun had been going from direct sales from the old Ed Zander days, if you remember that name, where sun had one of the great sales forces in the industry, to virtually laying off the bulk of their sales force and going through partners, and that's not the kind of company we are. We sell directly to very large customers, where we offer them technology and the service &#x2013; and the services to exploit that technology effectively, and we have those &#x2013; we already have those direct relationships with those big customers in software, and we need those same relationships both on the sales side and on the service side in the hardware part of the business, because we see that as a unified business.</p>
          <p>There really is no such thing as the hardware business or the software business. The business that we're in is the systems business, and we have to provide support in the systems business. We have to sell systems. Those &#x2013; it's really one business. And since we're direct in software, we need to be direct in hardware. That's going to improve our margins. That's going to improve our penetration. That's going to increase our top line.</p>
          <p>We're adding about 2,000 salespeople, and &#x2013; but which include not just salesmen, but also includes sales engineers and service engineers, and by the way, we're doing that with basically no net increase in our overall Sun division head count &#x2013; I mean, we're eliminating or have eliminated about 2,000 positions of non-revenue producing, non-technical people, replacing them with revenue-producing people and technical people. So we expect we can grow that business, we can double that business, we can deliver better products, a higher quality of services to our largest customers, we're very excited about this, and we fully expect to exceed that target of 1.5 billion in operating profit in the full fiscal year, and 2 billion the following year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm turn it over to Mark Hurd, and Mark, welcome aboard.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Larry. It's great to be here with Larry and Safra. Over the last 25 years, I have competed against and partnered with Oracle, and I can tell you that Oracle has amassed the most enviable portfolio of technology in the industry. What led me to come to join Oracle is not what Oracle has accomplished in the past, but the clear growth opportunities I see going forward. The company is well positioned for where the industry and where customers are headed. I don't believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle.</p>
          <p>Oracle is obviously the leading database and middleware company at a time when data and digitization are increasing exponentially, so we essentially get to monetize the growth in data occurring around the globe. Oracle is way ahead of the competition in engineered systems. And Exadata is really just the beginning, and Oracle is defining that market. The growth opportunities with highly optimized engineered systems are just starting, and there's really no one else in the market with the software and hardware assets that can match Oracle.</p>
          <p>In addition, I think there is a large, unappreciated opportunity in the industry verticals: telecom, banking, utilities, insurance, life sciences and others. These industries can no longer afford to do their own software development. Many of these vertical markets individually are larger than ERP in its entirety. We have a huge lead in industry-specific applications, with our global business units, and the fact is, no other large software company has even started addressing these markets.</p>
          <p>Last, Oracle is a large global platform at a time when much of the growth is going to occur outside the United States, and we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth. What really gives me confidence in Oracle's growth is the sheer size of our R&amp;D investments, and our financial capacity to execute.</p>
          <p>We generated 8.5 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, and we expect that we will spend over 4 billion this year on R&amp;D, and we are going to spend all next week at OpenWorld explaining just how we are spending that money. Without giving anything away, let me assure you, it's well spent. So I'm coming up to speed quickly. I'm really excited about the opportunities, of which I've just touched a few.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to our Q1 results. Listen, I've been doing this a long time. 25% license growth in a company this size is a big number, especially for a company that closes in August. And again, I have been doing this for a long time, I've been selling for over 30 years, but I personally never had to close the books in August, so the credit for this really has to go to the sales organization. This is a fantastic performance.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we had several end-to-end Oracle wins, which were sold products from applications to technology and systems. An example is Vivo, the largest mobile telephone operator in the Southern Hemisphere. We replaced their in-house legacy customer system with a Siebel system running on top of our middleware, database, operating system and Sun M9000 servers, top to bottom Oracle technology.</p>
          <p>We had a particularly strong quarter in technology, both database and middleware with growth of 32%, and double-digit growth in every single region.</p>
          <p>In Database, we continue to see a strong migration of customers to 11 GR2, which also benefits our database options such as Advanced Compression and Database Vault. We had a key database win along with Active Data Guard option at the New York Police Department to help with their counterterrorism efforts.</p>
          <p>In middleware, our base of customers is now approaching 100,000. Fusion Middleware 11G, which we released last year, continues to do very well with the fastest adoption curve we've seen over any of our previous releases.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we released a major new release of Oracle Business Intelligence 11G. While the product is very new, we have seen strong interest, and had competitive wins, for example, at the Parliament of Victoria in Australia and at the state of Nevada.</p>
          <p>On the applications side, we had key wins against SAP at Mayan Resorts in Mexico, and Molina Healthcare of California.</p>
          <p>Shifting to systems, we saw growth again this quarter for the Sun products. On the high end, we saw great wins with the M9000 at Banco Ita&#xFA; in Brazil against IBM, and also at Center Link in Asia-Pac where we beat IBM again with the M9000 systems. In the mid-range, we beat IBM in winning a big deal at Telef&#xF3;nica in Spain and both an M-series and T-series product. And we had a significant win at NTT in Japan.</p>
          <p>In storage, we had a key win at Center Link to modernize their tape infrastructure. We also saw storage wins at Banco do Brasil, the state of New York, and Branch Banking and Trust.</p>
          <p>Overall, a very strong quarter for Oracle, and with that, I'll turn it back to Ken.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, and congratulations on obviously a very good quarter. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the database technology business, up over 30%, one of the best numbers we've seen in a long time. Mark talked a little bit about the impact of Fusion Middleware, but was there anything else that stood out in the quarter that was particularly strong, and what is the outlook in that line item in particular for next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Exadata. People think of Exadata as a hardware sale, and of course, it's a combined hardware, software sale. And whenever we sell Exadata, we sell database licenses, unless the customer already has database licenses, and we sell storage-server licenses. So for example, let me name my favorite Exadata sale, which was we put three Exadata racks into Softbank and replaced 60, 6-0, Teradata racks, and about half of that sale was hardware and half of that sale was software. But that was a &#x2013; imagine the 60, 19-inch racks, kind of a room full of gear, take Teradata's machine, out it goes &#x2013; by the way, Softbank is Teradata's biggest customer in Japan, and in goes three Exadata machines.</p>
          <p>By the way, the three Exadata machines way outperform those 60 Teradata racks. And that &#x2013; a sale like that is reflected in both our hardware line and our software line and that really &#x2013; I think Exadata really is helping our technology software growth substantially.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just looking at how you've retooled the hardware business, I was wondering if you could help us think down the road, is this something, given the margin improvement that you've had, that we could see get even better and think about it in the likes of Cisco and EMC who have gross margins in the 55 to 60% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Heather, again, I &#x2013; when we first took over the business, we set an internal target of around 50%. We just want to at least get to that point, which is reasonable, and we're just about there. In Q1, we were 48.4 and I think in Q2 we'll crest the 50 mark. But I think 60 is absolutely reasonable in gross margin, and can we do better? It depends on the product mix. How many Exadata and other engineered systems, ZFS storage appliances versus some of the other systems that are &#x2013; T-series which is a little bit lower margin. But I think depending on the mix, we can get to 60 or better. And I think we can just as importantly double the top line. So we can dramatically improve margins and double the top line.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks so much. A more strategic question, just given those comments on the opportunity in vertical industries and just given some of Mark's actions at HP, is a natural next step to have a bigger IT services component, or Larry, are you still of the belief that you're cannibalizing services and that that's the right shift for customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; again &#x2013; I don't think we're going to end up &#x2013; again, IBM is a great company, and I appreciate the kind words from Sam Palmisano about us as being their number one competitor now. And actually, I mean that sincerely. I think Oracle is flattered. We've worked very hard. We look at IBM as our number one competitor, and we're thrilled that they look at us as their number one competitor now, and we're going to work, we know we have to work very hard to be successful in that competition.</p>
          <p>IBM's services business seems to be the dominant part of their business, and their product business is &#x2013; you know, is important, but secondary to the services business, if you will. We look at it just the reverse. We look at our products being the dominant part of our business, and one of the things we're trying to do with our products is obviate the need for services. So if we do a very good job of integrating our applications together, and making them easier to install, and easier to upgrade, you don't need as much service.</p>
          <p>So our goal, again &#x2013; if we engineer these hardware/software systems together like Exadata, where the storage and network and servers and the operating system and the database and all of the stuff is in one box, you don't need as much integration services. So we're trying to attack the -- you know, to reduce the amount of services required to take advantage of these systems.</p>
          <p>Having said that, our customers, especially in the big verticals, which Mark mentioned, you know, in banking, we go to big banks going through transformations, and we can't eliminate all of the services. That's just fantasy. We can eliminate some of the stuff, but we're going to &#x2013; I think you'll see us engaging with our customers, and providing services because they want us to, but we also have to be prepared to partner with other service-oriented companies, and in fact, one of which is IBM.</p>
          <p>We've actually got a very good relationship with IBM in services, which we're trying to expand, let's say in banking. IBM has got a terrific presence in banking, we've got some great banking products. IBM doesn't sell banking software, and we'd love for IBM to become expert in using our software to transform banks. And &#x2013; so, again, our partnership with these service companies is absolutely critical. The American companies: the Accentures, the IBMs, the Indian companies: the Wipros, the Tatas. I know that Mark knows a lot more about this than I do, so I'm going to let him comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Larry is exactly right. Listen, when you're running a big services company, the biggest issue is labor, and you've got a lot of incidents that occur, and you've got a lot of labor trying to deal with those incidents with customers. And the secret to services in the future is a way to automate those incidents, and you automate them through software. So the future of services is software.</p>
          <p>When you automate a process, you not only reduce the labor, you actually eliminate the labor, and you actually raise the service level simultaneously. So the R&amp;D that we have, in fact, isn't really &#x2013; it's a supplement, if you will, to the services capability. And as we get to more of these engineered systems, where we can build something once and sell it many, many times, and do that work remote, and do it in an automated way, it is, frankly, a replacement for what you today think of as very labor-based services.</p>
          <p>I think as a product company, we want to be supporting those labor-based service companies, though, and partner with them when it makes sense. So I think our strategy is to do both, to automate those processes, to be able to sell those automated capabilities, and then to partner with the services companies as it makes sense.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys. I've got a question for Larry and then a follow-up for Safra. First, Larry, these Exadata results and the pipeline that you're talking about, it's pretty clear that this is becoming a big-winning product for you.</p>
          <p>Can you maybe layout the vision for how this can expand to other workloads like custom-developed and packaged applications, and what does that mean for your opportunity to get more data center share of spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please come to Oracle OpenWorld on Sunday. That's a very good idea. Yeah, it's something we certainly have thought about, and makes complete sense, and I think we'll be announcing some very interesting things on Sunday in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I have to wait, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that's fair. I was going to follow-up with Safra, real quick. These results for August were clearly better than we expected, but the environment actually hasn't been that great for IT spending. When you sort of look at what is going on out there, do you need the IT spending market to pick up much or can you continue to put up these type of results with sort of a status quo environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the truth is, we've actually been putting up these kind of results through, really, much of this environment. The reality is that what we've got going is really very company-specific. We are taking share from others.</p>
          <p>As Larry described in the Softbank case, that type of thing is really happening everywhere. Customers are looking at us as their &#x2013; really, frankly, their most important vendor. And since they are buying so many things from us, they just &#x2013; many of them more and more are just doing what you know as "Oracle first."</p>
          <p>If we have it, they'll buy it from us. They can't afford to be putting all of these little pieces together from dozens and dozens of vendors. We do it better. We spend more on R&amp;D than anybody else does, and we make it our business and our job to make sure these things work together so that customers don't have to figure out how to do it themselves.</p>
          <p>This is both sort of intuitively appealing and obvious to our customers, who, otherwise, have to run very, very complex systems, and that's why our deals &#x2013; so we had no mega deals in the quarter or anything like that, but just deals are getting a little bit bigger, a little bit more products in every case, and as they buy from us, we're obviously taking share from everybody else. So in this environment, as you can see, we're doing just magnificently, and that's because customers are just buying it from us, and buying more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just first of all, welcome aboard, Mark. Glad to see you here. But I have a question for Safra.</p>
          <p>Safra, as Jason said, this was a really strong quarter and very clean across all of the geographies. But I actually have a question on Europe, and not so much regarding Oracle, your comments about company-specific momentum seems to ring true at least historically and leading up into this quarter. But especially things that are happening in Europe, and in Europe, it seems to me, anyway, that there is a much greater percentage of IT spending that comes from government spending, whether it's direct or indirect through healthcare or however it is done. And I'm just curious what you are seeing in this region and I'm not just &#x2013; the apps license number was down year-over-year, but that is not different from what we are seeing from other companies, so I'm not ticking on that at all. But I'm just trying to &#x2013; we cover a lot of companies, right? Jason was trying to get to that. But what are you seeing in that region? And how &#x2013; how does &#x2013; how did that effect your guidance this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, the truth is, a number of the governments have been struggling for a number of quarters, and as you know, we sell to governments, but for us, you know, Europe, Middle East, and Africa is a lot of countries. There's a lot of potential there for us, and our overall license in constant currency was 18% growth, which, you know, I think most folks would have thought was impossible, and yet, you know, what is really happening is the same momentum we have in other geographies.</p>
          <p>We have -- it is true some of these governments are struggling, and that if they weren't, we would sell even more? Absolutely, of course. But as it is, we have so many products, and so much, still, opportunity, and I'll tell you in addition, I think our competitors are absolutely falling out of bed.</p>
          <p>So as a result, we are &#x2013; we are both the safe choice, and we are the obvious choice, and to the extent that they have got &#x2013; you know that they have budget, they use it with us, and secondly &#x2013; the truth of the matter is, these companies cannot just stop, and these governments cannot just stop buying our software. They need it. They use it, and they ultimately have to go ahead and buy it, and they are doing that.</p>
          <p>So it's true, you know, 18% growth in this kind of a quarter in the summer in Europe, you know, I would say that's pretty darn good, and, you know, we expect &#x2013; and, you know, actually Europe, even the apps number you mentioned, they actually had a very tough compare compared to everybody else. And all around, I expect some very reasonable numbers, very good numbers out of Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can comment about the European apps number. We have been tracking &#x2013; we track our apps business especially in Europe as a percentage of SAP, because SAP is stronger in Europe than they are anyplace else in the world. And clearly certain countries, like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, they have a virtual monopoly, closing in on 100% share in those countries which makes it very difficult. We're up to about 50% of the size of SAP in Europe now in applications. And that's the toughest market, and we're -- you know, and we are bigger than they are in North America, for example, which is our &#x2013; kind of our home territory. So we think things are going, you know, pretty well in applications in Europe.</p>
          <p>Albeit, you know, it can be a bit lumpy, you know, Q1 is our smallest license quarter, and, you know, you point out that this is, you know, the one deal &#x2013; you know, we have gotten this one deal closed the first day of this quarter, or, you know, Q1 apps would have looked a lot better in Europe. But we think overall, over the last four quarters, we have done very well in Europe against SAP, taking share from SAP in their home markets. We have a number of deals, especially in the verticals, which I think, you know, Mark rightly emphasizes.</p>
          <p>We are a large software company, and we have a lot of software that's industry specific for retail, for telecommunications. You know, we're winning all of the retail deals in Germany, against SAP, all of them. I'm going to repeat that, 100% of them. So, you know, we're &#x2013; we're very happy on &#x2013; on how things are going overall looking back over the last four quarters with our most important software competitor in Europe which is SAP.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Larry it was good to see you talk about the goals of doubling for the hardware business. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color how should we think about this? To keep the &#x2013; to double the revenue and get the margins up to 55, 60% almost seems like you are going to be out of the low-end business. Looks like it is almost as big as the IBM mainframe business that you're looking to create or maybe potentially larger than that. How do you create that position given where Sun has been operating, and if we have time for Mark, what would be your key priorities as you step into Oracle? That's it from me, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make some opening comments and then I'll turn it over to Mark, but I think the big thing is these engineered systems, Exadata being one example. Another &#x2013; we'll be announcing some more systems at Oracle OpenWorld, the ZFS storage appliance. We have to &#x2013; we have to have product &#x2013; you know, products that offer unique value in the marketplace, like IBM mainframes. I mean, IBM offers unique value with those products. Those mainframes run software that doesn't run on other computers so it's kind of a unique value proposition.</p>
          <p>With Exadata we have got to run the Oracle database 10 times faster than on any other kind of machine, and we do that. And with other things, we have to have very substantial performance advantages, reliability advantages, security advantages and cost advantages to go out and compete, but if we have those advantages, we have highly differentiated engineered products that combine hardware and software, we think we can improve our margins, and grow our share dramatically, rather than mucking around, kind of &#x2013; you know, trying to tell a low-end server on price against Dell. We're partnering with Dell. We think Dell is a great company and we love partnering with them, but we don't want to compete in that space. They are very good at that. Mark?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'll just add that from a priority perspective, first, this is a very well-run company. We want to grow and we want to grow profitably. We want to take share, want to be in a position where we can delight our customers and earn more of their spending, and that's my priority. You know, when you look at the R&amp;D and the things that we will be announcing next week, we want to have the best sales force on the planet, win customers' respect every day and we want to deliver the best service on the planet. And those are the things I'm working on.</p>

          <p>And ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question, we'll take that question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Really impressive quarter, guys. I've just got two questions, first one is for Safra. Obviously we talked a little bit about the applications rebound and while database is driving away and overall license growth, when you look at the apps business, what is really driving it there? Are we talking about core ERP seeing a rebound, or is it still these edge applications where you are getting attraction?</p>
          <p>And also, Larry, just as a follow-up here on database, obviously doing phenomenally well, but we have seen some competitive announcements in the database market with SAP buying Sybase talk about in-memory, EMC buying Greenplum, just curious your take on those? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, listen, for us even &#x2013; you know, even ERP &#x2013; with &#x2013; remember, with us, our numbers are so big that we've still got to sell ERP every quarter to do well, but the edge applications are doing very, very, very well also, and it's going very well all around, as far as big ERP wins, you know, a lot of people are not necessarily changing their ERP system, but they are buying more for their current systems. They are buying additional modules into their systems, and for us, it's really all around going &#x2013; you know, going really quite well. Performance management is doing quite well, things like that. So it's really &#x2013; it's the edge applications, and, you know, the basic business remains solid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of database technology announcements Greenplum, SAP, in-memory, and those things, you know, we're pretty good at this database side, and I &#x2013; I was &#x2013; I guess the word might &#x2013; was used was dismissive of SAP's in-memory database, and SAP took that and Hasso Plattner did a movie where he interviewed himself. If you haven't seen it, it's on SAP's website, it's really worth watching. And he interviews himself. He plays two characters, and he talks about the SAP in-memory database. Now, I never said we didn't believe in in-memory databases. I said I thought it was peculiar that SAP would choose to compete with us in the arena of database technology.</p>
          <p>I mean, they compete with us in ERP, and they got there first. They were ahead of us and they have done quite well, and they are the leaders there, but to compete with us in database just seemed like a peculiar choice, especially if you can remember NetWeaver, their attempt to compete in middleware. So they tried to compete with us in middleware, were not very successful and they hardly ever talk about NetWeaver, so after a failure in middleware, for them to immediately move on to, well, let's go tackle them in database, with a two-prong strategy, let's buy Sybase, which does not run SAP, and then let's build an in-memory database technology, kind of trumping Oracle in R&amp;D and getting to market before them.</p>
          <p>Let me announce today &#x2013; I'll make the announcement now, that Oracle has had under development for some time, an in-memory that is a part of the Oracle database, and we will deliver that to the market before SAP delivers theirs. So we'll be out in the market with our technology &#x2013; you know, this is not radically new technology. There are a number of university projects, there are tons of research papers. We have been following this for a very, very long time. We don't live under a rock. We have been working on this for a very, very long time and we'll deliver our product well in advance of their product.</p>
          <p>Now I believe that Oracle will do a better job of delivering in-memory database technology, which is primarily the query optimization, and it's based on a variety of different kinds of compression -- it's basically hybrid columnar compression. I'm not going to go into what the technology is, but we have been working on it for a long time. We'll be in the market before SAP, and I believe, just like we beat them badly in middleware, where Fusion Middleware beat NetWeaver, they had even less of a chance to beat us in database technology than they had to beat us in middleware technology. I just think that was a colossal mistake to take us on in middleware. It's a bigger mistake to take us on in database, and in the meantime, they have got this all-new product called Business By Design, which is aimed at companies of 4 people &#x2013; between 4 and 100 people or something like that, which is floundering horribly, and they have done nothing new in their core ERP business for 25 years. They still built in Ada.</p>
          <p>This, I guess, will come as a surprise to nobody. After five years of development, next week at Oracle OpenWorld, we will be announcing our Fusion Application Suite, all of the ERP products, all of the CRM products, all the HRMS products have been redone 100% in Java, all with integrated, you know, social networking, web 2.0 interface, integrated brand new stuff from the ground up, and SAP is going to go and compete with us using their 25-year old technology. And so rather than focusing on their applications and upgrading their applications like we did with Fusion, they said, Oh no, I have a better idea, you have got to watch the video where Hasso interviews Hasso, it's called "Hasso on Hasso," or something like that. You have got to watch it.</p>
          <p>Instead of competing with us in applications and modernizing their applications, they say, oh, no, let's go kill Oracle in database technology. Good luck.</p>
