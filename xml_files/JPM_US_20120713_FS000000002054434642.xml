          <p>[Abrupt Start] joining us early in the morning. Few announcements: please turn off your cell phones. All materials are now available on our website. We will now open the floor &#x2013; we will open the floor to Q&amp;A at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>During the Q&amp;A sessions a few things that will be important because some of the people are in the room: please wait for the microphones and say your name to make sure that the people on the phone know who is speaking. Please be cognizant of others in terms of follow up. If you have several follow ups we may have to come back to you towards the end. And then we'll go to questions to the telephone. And last point, we know that Wells Fargo is having their call at 10:00. We have set up a room, 207 on this floor, and a few breakout rooms for those who want to listen from here.</p>
          <p>With that, are we on in terms of the audio? Please take a look at the forward-looking statements and I'm going to turn it to Jamie.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sarah, thank you very much. I appreciate you all coming today. So we have a whole bunch of presentations to take you through and I'll start with me. I'll try to cover some of the high points. Unfortunately, I think you might have seen this morning that we announced a restatement of the first quarter. Doug will describe it in detail, and Mike, we don't take it lightly. We talked to our best advisors, accounting and legal and tried to do what we thought was right and the most conservative thing to do. Hopefully this is what the SEC Chairwoman herself would have done if she had seen all the same facts at the same time.</p>
          <p>Today I'm going to cover &#x2013; just give you a quick overview. I'm going to talk about a whole bunch of significant events, items in the quarter, which we break out for you right in the front of the press release, give you an update on the synthetic credit portfolio, talk a little bit about Treasury and CIO. There's some questions about it, so I'm going to answer some of those. Our capital plans, I'm going to turn it over to Doug who is going to take you through what I would call the regular earnings presentation, though it's got a slight &#x2013; more disclosures. And then Mike will give you an update in the CIO task force. It's kind of the anatomy of the problem, all the good, the bad, the ugly of it.</p>
          <p>The review is continuing I should point out. It's been guided by the board and if we find out more, which is always possible, or anything different or material we will let you know as appropriate. If we do find out more, we will do the right thing like we always try to do.</p>
          <p>One thing which I would love people to focus on a little bit at one point is to actually look at the businesses, the fixed businesses. They have really good underlying performance. And that to me is why we are here, the main reason why we are here.</p>
          <p>We've significantly reduced the total synthetic credit risk in CIO. It's down substantially I'm going to give you real numbers and describe how we're going to be managing that going forward including the risks that are going on there. We've substantially &#x2013; taken all remaining synthetic credit positions transferred them to the IB. We put them there because the IB has the people, the expertise, the capacity, the trading platforms, the market franchise to effectively trade and manage these positions, and importantly, they can do it within their historical VaR and stress risk limits levels. This is what they will do. It's going to let the rest of the Firm go back to do what it should be doing.</p>
          <p>We have closed down synthetic credit trading in CIO. We will no longer be doing it. Let me tell you one exception of one short position we're keeping there. Our fortress balance sheet remains completely intact, in fact, I would call it un-dented. An extensive review has been conducted. Mike will take you through that.</p>
          <p>Very importantly, all of CIO management has changed; Matt Zames is here. While you may know him professionally, but he obviously brought in a lot of additional risk people, traders, finance officers to help manage the CIO area and they've been through it top-to-bottom, all the governance, reporting limits, etcetera in CIO. We do believe these events are isolated to the CIO and Mike will talk about it a little bit more.</p>
          <p>These types of events are terrible, but there's one gratifying thing in them, is you find out that people come and bring their best every day. We've had hundreds of people kind of working around the clock now for three months to get this thing fixed and wrestled down. And I think we've mostly accomplished that. And then now we can focus our energy on what we do best which is growing our businesses and serving our clients and communities around the world. Hopefully after this is over we will be a stronger company for it.</p>
          <p>We did report net income of $5 billion for the second quarter. That would have been $4.6 billion had it not been for the restatement, earnings of $1.21. For the first half we'll have earned $9.9 billion that is not &#x2013; obviously unaffected by the restatement and the balance sheet and capital ratio is not affected either. In the second quarter let me take you through each one of these items a little bit slowly.</p>
          <p>CIO trading losses, that's the synthetic credit book, $4.4 billion. But, in the first quarter, it was about $1.6 billion. Not hiding that. We're not doing that. That's $1.6 billion in the first quarter, which removed $600 million by the restatement, $4.4 billion this quarter. Corporate CIO securities gains we'd announced that actually when we told you the first time about this problem. We did not take additional securities gains. All I want to point out here is these are always broken out in the P&amp;L. So you can never hide them. And we take them generally for investment decisions. Do you want to own or not own that security? We don't generally take it to offset something like that. And I've pointed out before that taking gains is generally tax inefficient. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. It's just generally tax inefficient.</p>
          <p>Loan loss reserves came down by $2.1 billion. That's mostly in mortgage and credit card. And that's exactly the same conservative principles we've used before. The good news is charge-offs and delinquencies are coming down. And so, reserves had to come down. Doug's going to give you a little bit more information on that.</p>
          <p>The Investment Bank had $750 million of DVA gains. You all know we don't really consider that earnings. On Corporate, we expect a full recovery in the Bear Stearns note. Some of you may remember when Maiden Lane was done, where the Fed took on $30 billion of Bear Stearns assets, we guaranteed the first $1 billion of loss. Okay? Maiden Lane, they completely repaid the Federal Reserve. We've now been paid $200 million. I think we get another $300 million sometime in a couple weeks. We expect full recovery of the $1.2 billion plus interest and that's just writing the note back up to what we expect to get in cash plus interest over a little bit of time.</p>
          <p>I won't go through the capital ratios here, kind of talk about them a little bit later. With the synthetic credit portfolio, the only thing I would mention too, of the losses in synthetic credit, it is kind of costly. The worst part of this whole thing is when we started this thing is that we knew we had these large illiquid type of things to manage down and we had $2 billion plus at the time. The way to figure this we is we basically &#x2013; have been reducing the risk substantially. I'm going to go through these numbers but it's costly to do. It's costly to do. I'm going to give you the final ultimate risk here but we did get it down I think a little bit faster than we thought we might be able to.</p>
          <p>Number one, we're transferring about &#x2013; these are &#x2013; I'm going to give you rough crude measures of risk here. I mean they generally are accurate but this is in the trading book so we're not going to disclose specific positions. The risk-weighted asset transferred to the IB and this is a fairly decent measure of risk is about $30 billion. So their risk-weighted assets go up by $30 billion. It's down substantially from the peak and it's about probably where it was on December 30th so it went way up. It's come way down.</p>
          <p>We've significantly reduced net notionals and credit spread sensitivities. We show you the credit spread sensitivities. The CS01 is how much you would gain or lose if credit spreads widened by one basis point. You can see it's down from the peak of $51 billion to $7 billion. $7 billion is closer to what I'd call a norm.</p>
          <p>We have a significant reduction in the on-run and the off-the-run basis. That's part of what we all read about all the time about the IG9. The IG9 itself is down 70%. We've reduced the basis risk between high yield and high-grade risk in Europe and the United States. These are the kind of risks that got built up, complex risks that we kind of wished we didn't have when we realized it was there. They're down by 70% and what remains is not in my opinion that big a deal. The residual portfolio that's transferred over to the IB is largely a delta-hedged tranche portfolio. It's stuff they know how to do. They're better at it than CIO is. But it's still large. We're not saying it's not large. It still could obviously lose money or possibly make money. Some of the positions are currently cheap; they're theoretical. It's not how they were when we inherited them.</p>
          <p>When that Matt Zames joined us &#x2013; and I'm giving you one number, here. Extreme, simulated scenarios indicate potential loss between $800 million and $1.7 billion. This portfolio can make money. The extreme, simulated losses are things like a Eurozone crisis, a credit crunch, and the 99.9% statistical stress would have a loss of about $1.4 billon. So we do think this is a box and I hope we don't have these losses at all. To help us a little bit in the quarter, we will have about a $900 million gain on swaps we've terminated against some of our TruPS. So we think we're pretty much done with the financial loss of this if you can look at that gain too.</p>
          <p>I've already mentioned that we transferred it to the IB and why and they are already more actively trading it than we were. If you look at the combined IB and synthetic credit portfolio risk within the IB historical, the RWA I mentioned went up by $30 billion, so not that significant to them. Their VaR, I think it will be disclosed that the IB VaR on the end of the month &#x2013; the spot VaR was $74 million. The next day when we transferred it over, July 2, it went to $113 million, well within numbers we're used to and comfortable. We've gone as high as $200 million. The remaining portfolio that we left at CIO is simple. It's an $11 billion short of basically fairly liquid indexes. It's identified to offset some potential losses in a much larger AFS portfolio. They're asymmetric. One is mark-to-market and one is not so we're not worried about this.</p>
          <p>The gain in the one will far offset the loss in the other, vice versa but we need to make separate decisions, do we want to own those investments or not own those investments. We thought now was a rational time to keep the hedge on certain credit exposure around the world, particularly with what you see going with the Eurozone. This hedge will come down over time. We don't intend to keep it there necessarily forever. Obviously we'll make those decisions as we see fit. It will show a VaR, remember there's $11 billion will have its own VaR because it's not hedged against anything and it's asymmetric. It'll have a huge VaR like $135 million, coming down over time and on its own, it's about $34 billion of risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>So the next page, I going to talk about some Treasury and CIO activities. And kind of go through this. First of all, I should point out Treasury and CIO have been and always will be, subordinated to the needs of the rest of the company. They can only invest when, where, how, why for the needs of the company. And that involves their &#x2013; the duration they invest in, that involves the credit they invest in, it involves where they invest in around the world. So it's not a <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; that's the thing (11:07) portfolio. It's a logical portfolio.</p>
          <p>Why do we have it at all? We have $1.1 trillion in deposits. We've got $700 billion in loans. Now that would generally be considered totally conservative. We like making loans, by the way. But between our acquisitions and the fact we're a money center bank, we get a lot of deposits in, we end up with a lot of extra deposits. The extra deposits of $423 billion, plus equity, plus some other net liabilities, give us $522 billion that's not being lent out that we have to invest.</p>
          <p>We actually split it in two pieces. Some companies do it differently, some combine Treasury and CIO. Most have functions like this. The first piece is $199 billion, which we call Treasury deployment. We're going to make a disclosure. It's on the balance sheet. It shows up as cash and due with banks and sometimes as government repo. Most of that money is very short duration. Most of it is at central banks around the world, some is in government repo and we have it there just for liquidity because we have a lot of money that comes in and out of this company every single day. We bank member nations, sovereigns, sovereign wealth funds, large companies, who can easily swing $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion a day.</p>
          <p>Treasury CIO has $323 billion. It's down a little bit because we haven't been reinvesting in the last &#x2013; we're waiting to give Matt a little bit of time to figure out what he's got before he starts reinvesting. But it has an average rating of AA and an average life of 3.7 years. I'm going to show you a little more detail on the next page.</p>
          <p>Funds Transfer Pricing, we take all the assets, all the liabilities, generated by the company, so take loans and deposits, they're constantly dynamically evaluated for their risk pricing, their duration and liquidity and we generally then pay units market prices on what they did. So they're paying market prices, they have the right kind of incentive to grow, but not grow their balance sheet. They do not get gains &#x2013; securities gains or excess returns in CIO. They get kind of market rates and steady income.</p>
          <p>If you go back in the years, you saw we had a lot of income in CIO. Back then we told you that was going to get very high rates. We didn't pass on to the businesses, because it wasn't going to continue. So CIO invests to achieve a desired asset liability duration. We can obviously change this all the time. All the companies worry about this. I should point out our two biggest exposures are credit and interest rates. This is the place we kind of manage for the most part the interest rate exposure.</p>
          <p>Currently, if you asked to be duration neutral, like to the best of our ability to offset all interest rate exposure, we'd have to invest this portfolio at an average interest duration of 3.7 years. It is invested currently at an interest duration of 1.2 years. What that means is that our balance sheet will reprice quicker, the assets will reprice quicker than the liabilities. That is disclosed in a disclosure we made called Earnings and Risk that says if interest rates go up 100 basis points, our earnings would go up by $2.4 billion. So that's how you generate that kind of number. Obviously, you could change this over time. I would put this in the conservative category.</p>
          <p>Obviously the composition of our balance sheet will change over time, loans will go up. We need to meet the new LCR and Basel III requirements. CIO has reinvestment a year of $40 billion. They have to invest every year probably if you want to estimate it, an additional $20 billion to $30 billion of additional deposits. That flow will be invested in the things that we think have the most logic for the company in terms of liquid asset buffers, return on risk weighted assets, etcetera.</p>
          <p>Loans would be our priority by the way. This is not our priority. We want to grow our businesses, but we do have this money to invest. Obviously, the more liquid assets buckets you buy, you might reduce NII a little bit, but it also reduces RWA. They're not a complete offset, but it's close. And also over time there's a pretty good chance we'll increase duration. If rates ever go up again, you'll probably see us go long on the curve and earn back more NII. So this is where we try to manage that all the time, and to do the right, fairly conservative thing for the Company.</p>
          <p>The next page shows you the investments. I've already mentioned the green line at the top, the Treasury Deployment and the cash and deposits at banks is mostly central banks. Reverse repo, I told you government securities, they do have some very short-term AFS securities. And then you can see below how we break out this. I'm not going to go through the detail here. If you want later on, you can call Investor Relations and get some more detail.</p>
          <p>I just want to point out two things. 80% of it is either government backed, U.S. government agency credit or better. The only other thing I want to point out is that every investment has risk. This concept that somehow you can buy Treasuries and think you might not lose money; you can buy credit, you might not lose money; you can buy mortgages and you might not lose money; any of them, you have to make a decision of where you want to put your company in this, and the future is always different. So now that we have Basel III, you might know that Basel III accumulated &#x2013; what's it called? OCI goes into your capital. So obviously you have to invest being careful about how much capital might swing around. So as time goes on, we will be reorienting this book a little bit. We still think it's fairly conservative.</p>
          <p>On the capital planning side, the first column shows you net income that we just reported, $4.96 billion. But if you look across the top, these are your analyst estimates now. I'm just taking your estimates for the company for the third quarter and fourth quarter, and you can see your estimates for the 2013 and 2014. I just want to point out, we hope to beat all of them, all those numbers on that page, but we can't promise that, but we hope to.</p>
          <p>The next line down, RWA, is our estimate. We are constantly estimating Basel 2.5 with NPR, etcetera in there, and we have run-off and model mitigation, a whole bunch of things. That's our best estimate today. But if you look at the bottom line, our Tier 1 common goes from 7.9% today, there is no stock buyback &#x2013; no stock buyback, 8.5% the third quarter, 8.8% in the fourth quarter, 10.5% by the end of 2013, 12% by the end of 2014, i.e., we have a lot of capital generation. That's why we think it's a logical thing to buy back stock.</p>
          <p>You could buy back &#x2013; if you said &#x2013; if you were my Board of Directors and you said how much stock do you want to buy back? We can get to 9% Basel III by the end of 2013 and buy $23 billion. We can get to 9.5% and buy $15 billion. So clearly we have the ability.</p>
          <p>What are we going to do? We would like to buy back stock, but after discussions with the Federal Reserve, and we need to work with the Federal Reserve, the board is determined not to buy back stock until two things take place, until we finish the board review, which I think is a logical thing. So we come to a conclusion of the board review and we find no other major stuff, which I don't expect to find, and that we submit a new plan, capital plan to the Fed, only as to repurchase not as to dividends, the dividends are sacrosanct.</p>
          <p>Hopefully, if all goes well, we can start buying back stocks early in the fourth quarter. The dividend will continue to be 30%. In the past we've said to you all we hope to have a 30% payout ratio. It is possible, when you look at these numbers, strategically you might raise that ratio some years down the road, but we will decide that when we get there. We are on a strong trajectory to meet the 9.5. We have plenty of capital and plenty of capital generation.</p>
          <p>In spite of this accident, this event does not change what I think has been the bedrock of JPMorgan Chase for the last five or six years. We believe in a fortress balance sheet. I've given you &#x2013; and conservative balance sheet management. We always believe in high capital. Through this whole crisis you never saw our capital go down. We believe in conservative funding. I won't go through the detail there; a lot of liquidity.</p>
          <p>Here it says strong reserves. I will tell you we believe generally in conservative accounting principles. We don't like to deceive ourselves about whether we're earning money or not and obviously this thing is also a little bit of an exception there. And I already mentioned at the bottom the fairly conservative balance sheet management and asset liability management.</p>
          <p>Our earnings, the real reason we are here is to grow a company. We think we have a strong and diversified business model that's been a source of strength for this company, not a source of weakness, particularly in the storm. We have greater earnings power. We still think the earnings power if you adjust for all kinds of ins and outs about $24 billion a year. We think we have some the best franchises in our businesses in the world almost every single one of them. They might not be the best but I think they're damn close.</p>
          <p>And we think we have a very disciplined and detailed management team. All of whom are sorry that we missed this thing. But we think the way we run our business day-to-day we have pretty good businesses and management teams.</p>
          <p>This slide I like to look at because it just shows the buildup over the last six years of our book value on a tangible book value. I think our book value is clean with strong reserves and strong accounting and good loans, and all of good assets and things like that. You can see throughout this whole crisis, this never stopped growing. So we were able to grow in difficult times and I think that's a sign of strength not a sign of weakness and it was driven by diversified businesses, constant investing in the businesses, building what we consider market-leading franchises and maintaining our conservative principles.</p>
          <p>So to wrap it up, we are not proud of this moment but we are proud of our Company. We not making light of this error but we do think it's an isolated event. One of the reasons you do hold capital is for known and unknown events. Obviously this one we shot ourselves in the foot but that is one reason you have capital, for things you are surprised about.</p>
          <p>We've learned a lot. I can tell you this has shaken our Company to the core. And what happened here is that most of the management team went back and said let's redouble our efforts to make sure we're running a great company, granular, thoughtful, disciplined in every way possible. We could never say that you won't make mistakes. We operate in a risk business. So say you're doing &#x2013; we think it is nice if it does not make mistakes. Hopefully they will be small and few and far between.</p>
          <p>We have great franchises, we never stopped growing in this crisis, serving our clients through tough times. And we think we have great growth opportunity going forward.</p>
          <p>So with that, it will turn it over to Doug Braunstein, who will take you though the regular earnings presentation. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jamie. So I'm going to go through the earnings deck so if you turn to that. On Page 1, Jamie really covered this page. Just to highlight, $5 billion of net income, $1.21 per share. We did announce this morning that we are restating our first quarter earnings, as Jamie said.</p>
          <p>The restatement is really based upon recent facts that we have uncovered regarding the CIO traders' intent as they were marking the book and as a result we question the integrity of those trader marks. We felt as a result of that it was both prudent and a conservative approach to restate our first quarter.</p>
          <p>We've also, as a result of that, determined we had a material weakness in CIO's internal controls over the valuation of the synthetic credit portfolio as of March 31. We believe however we've substantially remediated that weakness at the end of the second quarter. Mike's going to provide you the details on how we uncovered trader intent, but from a financial point of view let me give you four facts and then we are going to move on.</p>
          <p>The first is the loss of the portfolio prior to the restatement for this quarter would have been $5.1 billion, after the move to $4.4 billion, in total year-to-date $5.8 billion in losses. Second, we effectively moved $460 million after-tax to the synthetic credit portfolio from the second quarter into the first. Third, year-to-date earnings, $2.41, unaffected by the restatement, the restated earnings of $1.19 in the first quarter, $1.21 this quarter effectively a move of $0.12 approximately per quarter. And then the last, as Jamie said, year-to-date revenues, year-to-date net income, year-to-date capital, year-to-date balance sheet are not impacted by the restatement.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn you to page 2 and I want to focus on the $22.9 billion of revenue. If you excluded the significant items that impact revenue in the quarter, revenue would actually have been $25 billion for the quarter. That revenue strength really came from some strong performance across a number of our client-facing businesses, as Jamie talked about. Let me highlighted a couple of factors.</p>
          <p>First is we had positive loan growth again. We have added $40 billion in loans on an absolute basis in the last year. That's after almost $23 billion of runoff in our mortgage portfolio that we had told you we had intended to do and are doing every quarter.</p>
          <p>We had record commercial bank loan balances this quarter, up 17%; Business Banking origination up 14%; small business loans up 35%; mortgage originations up 29%; strong growth in AM up 36% year-over-year; trade finance loans in TSS up 28% year-over-year, so good underlying fundamental loan growth. We've also had some favorable franchise trends that continued: we continue to be the number one in global IB fee provider this quarter; deposit balances in CBB up 8% year-on-year; sales volume in card up 12% year-on-year, so very good underlying fundamentals. Return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 15%.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 3, the Investment Bank, we've circled net income of $1.9 billion for the second quarter that's on $6.8 billion. As we've done the last couple quarters because we've had significant item related to DVA I'm going to talk about it excluding the $750 million gain in DVA. $6 billion in revenue for the quarter, $1.4 billion net income, return on equity of 15%. IB fees were $1.2 billion this quarter, down 35% year-on-year, that largely reflects declining transaction volume and activity in the quarter. But as I said and you see in the appendix, page 23, we maintained our number one share.</p>
          <p>Markets revenue, $4.5 billion, down about 15% year-on-year, 30% quarter-on-quarter following what, as you know, was a very strong first quarter; Fixed income revenue of $3.5 billion. That largely reflected the weaker market conditions but we did have strong client flows in the quarter. Equity revenue of $1 billion, that reflects cash volumes that were weak. We had strong results in our Equity Derivatives business and Prime Services, despite low spreads, had a good quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the expense number it's down but it's primarily driven by compensation expense. Comp-to-revenue ratio was 35% year-to-date which is consistent with the guidance we had given you at the start of the year. And just a reminder, as Jamie mentioned Q3 will have the impact of the synthetic credit portfolio in VaR for the IB.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 5, Consumer and Business Banking, circled net income of $950 million, that is down about 14% year-on-year, flat essentially quarter-on-quarter; net revenues of $4.3 billion. Revenues primarily were impacted by Durbin on a year-over-year basis but again there were some very favorable business trends. So I said balances were up 8%, we believe that is significantly above the industry averages.</p>
          <p>Business banking originations were up 14%. Actually June, the month of June, we had our highest production month in a number of years in Business Banking and our loan pipeline in Business Banking today is at its highest point in history. Client investment assets are up 5% in this business. We opened year-over-year a million more checking accounts, 2.5 million more active mobile customers, 45,000 new clients in CPC so real strong underlying fundamental growth.</p>
          <p>Expenses continue to be impacted by all the investment spend we've been doing and I think as you look forward to overhead ratio in Q3 we are likely to return to the ratio we had in Q1 rather than this quarter.</p>
          <p>Deposit margins were down this quarter six basis points. We continue to see that margin pressure. We've talked about it for a number of quarters. That's a function of the lower reinvestment environment opportunities that we have. It's consistent with the $400 million in net income guidance that we said for the full year related to this deposit margin pressure. But the aggregate NII was actually flat quarter-on-quarter and that really reflects the margin decrease being offset by deposit growth.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 6, Mortgage Production and Servicing: circled net income of $600 million; Production revenues, so three parts production revenue of $1.6 billion; volumes of $44 billion, up almost 30% year-on-year; record retail originations largely driven by refinancing activity including HARP. Margins are down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We expect them to continue to trend lower. It could be another 25 to 50 basis points really depending on the rate and refinancing environment.</p>
          <p>You will see repurchase losses in the quarter of $10 million. Settlements were $225 million in the quarter and that's a function of reduced repurchase demands in mortgage, reduced pipeline of demands and an improvement in the repurchase rates that we experienced this quarter. Based on this and our lifetime estimates for repurchases which was $3.2 billion going into the quarter, we really believe we have reached an inflection point that we had talked about and was inevitable over time and as a result of that we reduced our reserves for repurchases by about $215 million this quarter and if these current trends in our estimates for projected repurchases continue we'd expect the net repurchase number to be approximately zero for the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>On the servicing side, you see pre-tax income of $65 million. It continues to reflect very high levels of servicing costs. We have not seen the decline that we had expected in terms of default servicing expense for a number of reasons. But that was offset this quarter by some of favorable MSR risk management results.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 7, the Real Estate Portfolio, net income of approximately $700 million for the quarter, revenues down 15% year-over-year. It's in line with the estimates that we had given you. It is a function of that runoff, the $23 billion year-over-year. Charge-offs, circled number of about $700 million. The charge-off rate is down 28 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Delinquencies have continued to decline and a result of that is that we reduced our loss forecast going forward. We released $1.250 billion in reserves this quarter and I'll talk about that a little bit more detail in a couple of pages. We are also reducing our guidance for net charge-offs going forward to $750 million or below on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Page 8, Card Services and Auto, consolidated net income of $1 billion for the quarter. That is down about 7% year-on-year. It's on revenues of $4.5 billion in the quarter. We are continuing to see some positive underlying trends in this business. I said sales remained strong, up 12% year-on-year on new product sales. So for Freedom, Sapphire and Ink, sales volume up 20% year-on-year and we continue to believe we are gaining market share in the Card business; auto originations, up 7% year-on-year and very strong merchant processing revenue growth, up 13% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Credit cost for the quarter, $730 million. That reflects $750 million reserve release. That release incorporated a policy change for our Troubled Debt Restructured loans, TDRs. As a result of that, we moved forward our charge-offs on these loans to 120 days from 180 and that resulted in an acceleration of charge-offs of about $90 million in the quarter. No P&amp;L impact because we are fully reserved for those loans.</p>
          <p>But if you include that policy change, charge-off rate circled at the bottom is 4.32% if you exclude it, it was a little over 4%, 4.03%. Delinquencies also in that circled number on the quarter, 2.13%, and I &#x2013; we went back as far as 2003. This is the lowest rate we have experienced in delinquencies during that period of time.</p>
          <p>So with that, I do want to take a moment on the next page, page 9, to talk about the credit trends. So we put here second quarter, first quarter and a year ago and then provided at the bottom trends around net charge-offs. So we continue to see positive trends. Charge-offs are down $260 million in mortgage, $550 million in Card year-over-year and those trends are demonstrated on the chart at the bottom and delinquencies as I said are down.</p>
          <p>The reserve actions that we took, as Jamie said, were effectively necessary to remain neutral given that improved credit environment and the reduced expectations that we have for losses. And if you look at the one number that I think is particularly interesting is loan loss reserves to annual net charge-offs. That's this quarter's charge-offs multiplied by four. And those essentially stayed flat quarter-on-quarter even after the reserve releases.</p>
          <p>So we think we continue to be appropriately and conservatively reserved on these two portfolios and across all of our portfolios but if the current trends continued, we would expect to see further reductions in the mortgage book reserves and just remember a normalized credit environment you would expect to see about 12 months of charge-offs. You can do the math and we are substantially in excess of that number today. As it relates to Card, I think given where we are in the cycle you can expect reserve releases to be at or near an end.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking &#x2013; oops, oops, I pressed that button, if we could go back up. Thank you. Commercial banking we had net income of $670 million in the quarter, that's on record revenues of $1.7 billion. That is driven by those record loan balances that I talked about, higher year-over-year deposits, and that's marginally offset by the spread compression we have experienced in our deposit taking businesses. Loan growth, we think continues to reflect both improvements in our customer base as well as real market share gain. So our C&amp;I growth year-over-year is up 24%. We think that is almost double the industry rate.</p>
          <p>Record middle market loan balances I think the ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 18%. And while utilization still remains modest, we actually saw this quarter a modest uptick in utilization, so a little bit of additional activity. The credit environment in the Commercial Bank remains benign. Excluding recoveries, net charge-offs in the quarter would have only been 13 basis points.</p>
          <p>Treasury &amp; Securities Services on page 11, net income here of $460 million. That's up almost 40% year-on-year, 32% quarter-on-quarter. Revenue is up 11% on very positive underlying trends. Liability balances year-over-year up 15%; assets under custody up 4%; international revenue increased 12%; and expenses were only up 3% year on year, as we start to benefit from some of the technology and expense initiatives that we have been talking about in previous quarters. The result is fairly positive operating leverage for the quarter, pre-tax margins of 34% for TSS this quarter, but do remember we get a little positive impact of seasonality in our WSS business from our ADR business. So we have stronger second and fourth quarters on the revenue side.</p>
          <p>Asset Management on page 12, circled net income of a little under $400 million. That is up slightly quarter on quarter on revenues of $2.4 billion. Assets under management were effectively flat year-over-year, down quarter-on-quarter as a function of markets. We continued to actually see liquidity outflows this quarter in AM, but it was offset by our 13th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows in AM.</p>
          <p>If you go to page 13, Corporate and Private Equity, we reported here as a result of the CIO activities, $1.8 billion in losses for the quarter. Jamie walked you through the specifics of the portfolio. What we're going to do going forward is report this as three distinct items: Private Equity, a Treasury/CIO line item and then Other Corporate. We are going to try to give you a little bit of incremental, updated guidance.</p>
          <p>For Treasury/CIO for the next quarter, you would expect to see us generate $200 million plus or minus in losses. And that is a function of the reinvestment opportunities and our need to redeploy at this point but it will all so depend on our reinvestment strategies for that, and the number can vary quite materially, up or down an additional $200 million.</p>
          <p>Other Corporate we expect to be a positive $100 million on average, but it can be very volatile. That's even before significant items. So you saw that this quarter, so tax runs through here, real estate, other small litigation can run through this line item. So there is a variety of items, but on average it should be about $100 million for the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>On page 14, you see what will be now contained in the supplement of our additional disclosure on CIO and on Treasury on a combined basis. So we will have both the revenue and the net income line. I would draw your attention to the bottom right, which as Jamie talked about, the VaR in the IB. At the end of the quarter the VaR in CIO was 180 for this hedge position. It is now 123, so again, coming down over the last several weeks.</p>
          <p>On page 15, fortress balance sheet. Jamie talked a little bit about our coverage ratios, but let me just spend a moment more on the 7.9% that we reported for the quarter, just to clarify. That is reported with the full impact of Basel III, both the new 2.5 rules, as well as the published NPR as if it were adopted. That however is our best estimate at this point in time and obviously things can change as we continue to refine and work with the regulators on the application of those rules.</p>
          <p>If you actually look on a comparable basis to how we reported our second quarter, our Basel III ratio was up modestly. We also, in the appendix, I'm not going to go through it. We added a walk for you on both Basel I and Basel III. So on Basel I, if you add the impact of 2.5 rules to Basel I, it would reduce our Basel I reported ratio by 150 basis points. If you took the NPR as written, it would add an additional reduction of 100 basis points. So we're obviously with the industry in discussions with the regulators around the interpretations of that NPR. We are going to continue to report Basel I as is until the first quarter of 2013 when the new rules take effect.</p>
          <p>The last thing I'd just remind you on this page, actually put it on, we're going to keep this on now. As you think about returns on balance sheets given the different business mix, we internally look at returns on RWA relative to our competitors to sort of set different balance sheets on a comparable basis since RWA is only reported reliably on a Basel I basis. We're doing that comparison. And you see we had a positive 1.6% return on our risk-weighted assets for the quarter comparable to the first quarter, and we think we'll compare very favorably to our peer group for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Outlook on page 16, I've covered most of the items here but I really want to cover two in specific. The first is in corporate Private Equity. Jamie mentioned it. As a result of the TruPS redemption we're going to book in the third quarter about $900 million in gain associated with swap terminations that were related to the TruPS that we are redeeming. In addition to that, you see the net income impact, NIE impact from that redemption. That assumes no refinancing and obviously that number would change depending on how much incremental financing we do against those redemptions.</p>
          <p>The second is an update on expense, and if you look to the bottom right, on firm-wide guidance, we expect our adjusted expense number for the second half of the year to be flat with the first half of the year. And if you compare that to what we said at Investor Day, that would be up somewhere in the order of $1.5 billion to $2 billion relative to that guidance. There's really two reasons for it. About three-quarters of that difference is associated with mortgage and that gets broken down half-and-half. Half of the increase in expense in mortgage is associated with incremental revenue and production. So it's good expense, and it's made good profits, but we didn't anticipate that at the time of Investor Day. The other half is associated with those high-elevated costs in servicing related really to the Consent Order, the IFR, and a variety of other matters.</p>
          <p>We expected that to come down sooner. It has not. But you should think about this as timing as opposed to absolute difference in expense. It will come down over time as we work through these issues. About a quarter of the expense is associated with the environment we're in, which is we've had higher legal, higher compliance, higher FDIC than we had anticipated, and that has run through a variety of the businesses.</p>
          <p>Page 17, the final sort of piece of Corporate in terms of guidance, we've added this core NIM page as you know a couple of quarters ago. Core NIM declined by 10 basis points this quarter. For someone who's going &#x2013; I figured given other topics, no one's going to jump right in with the NIM question first off so I figured I'd give you the answer now. NIM is down 10 basis points really on the lower rate environment, the mix change in our loan portfolio and the important impact this quarter was actually accounting from FAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness. That was really the primary driver both in our investment securities yield portfolio as well as in our long-term debt portfolio. And if you'd just focus on the security sales that were associated with the $1 billion of gains, that actually did not have a material impact on the portfolio for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Last comment is really on page 18, which is our European disclosure as it relates to the periphery. $6.3 billion of total disclosure &#x2013; total exposure rather, at the end of June. That's down from $12.5 billion at the end of March. And what I want to caution everyone is the significant portion of that is really a function of hedging activity on that exposure which we may or may not do on a go-forward basis and the net exposure I think you should expect to return to the levels more consistent with where we were at the end of the first quarter. We do continue to be active with our clients in the region, but we're clearly being more cautious given the environment today and focused, really, on helping those clients do business in the market.</p>
          <p>So with that, I am going to stop, turn it over to Mike, and then, after Mike, we'll be back for questions. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Doug. So I hope everybody's coffee's kicked in and mine as well. We're going to spend a little while here going through the task force update. So for those on the phone or on the web, if you go to the next section is what it's called.</p>
          <p>So, in the room here, I'll dive right in on slide #1 which describes the management review that's been underway for the past two months. So my job has been to lead this firmwide response and conduct a rigorous review of the events leading up to the losses, assess what went wrong and mobilize the company to make the necessary fixes happen. And while some work remains, I'm glad to say that the scope and intensity of what we've already done allows me to give you today what I think is a very clear picture of what happened and what we've done about it.</p>
          <p>I have to say that it's been an incredible effort by many people and I just want to thank everyone who's been involved in getting this work done to get us here. So now what I'm going to do is go through this presentation in three sections. First, we're going to spend a bunch of time just walking through some facts, then we'll go through observations and implications of those facts and then finally I'll bring it to a close with the remediation actions that we've taken in response to all this.</p>
          <p>So if you start &#x2013; let's begin on slide 2 and that is just a summary of the key findings of the review. So there are five key observations. The first is the actual cause of the losses and the other observations are things that, had we done them better, may have reduced the size of the losses, allowing us to detect issues earlier.</p>
          <p>So the first one, which is the cause, is that CIO judgment, execution and escalation were poor in the first quarter; second, the level of scrutiny of CIO did not evolve commensurate with its increased complexity; third, the designated risk management team supporting CIO was ineffective in dealing with the challenges of this portfolio; fourth, that risk limits in CIO were not granular enough; and fifth, that the model &#x2013; the approval and implementation of a synthetic credit VaR model, that we'll talk about happened in the quarter, was poorly done.</p>
          <p>So with that overview of these observations, now let's slowly go through the pertinent facts that these support, so on slide 3, some historical context on synthetic credit portfolio itself. So the portfolio's primary purpose had been to provide a partial offset to losses we would suffer elsewhere in CIO and the company in a stressed credit environment. The portfolio got started about five years ago. It was generally short credit, but also included some long positions in order to reduce the cost of carrying credit protection and consistent with its objective, the portfolio produced gains in the stress period of 2008 to 2010 and was breakeven or positive each year from 2007 to 2011. And all-in, it generated about $2 billion in gains during that period.</p>
          <p>So next, on slide 4, now we get into a summary of the first quarter 2012 transformation of the portfolio that led to the losses. In late 2011, CIO was directed to reduce the synthetic credit portfolio's risk and risk-weighted assets. That direction came as part of the annual budgeting process in which we developed the Firm's capital plan including our glide path to Basel III.</p>
          <p>Now in the second bullet, I will attempt to explain what it appears the synthetic credit team and CIO hoped to do and that was to move their portfolio's risk position from a net-short position to a neutral one while reducing risk-weighted assets in the process. They also hoped to retain some tail protection against corporate credit defaults, which was the synthetic credit portfolio's historical mission. So they had a lot of things going on that they were trying to accomplish and found it difficult to find a balance that they liked.</p>
          <p>To simplify what they did, it amounted to them going long investment grade indices, while increasing short positions in junior tranches and high-yield indices. And the size of the portfolio grew dramatically as they continued to add positions later in the quarter when they were struggling to balance the portfolio as the market began to move against them.</p>
          <p>So the question of why they didn't just pursue an outright reduction of the portfolio? It appears, and that's all it is, an appearance, that they thought about it a bit, but they believed that it would be more expensive than the approach they chose, which obviously proved to be wrong, and were focused on thinking about high execution costs to reduce the portfolio in size and the lost carry of a reduced portfolio, so they went ahead with the approach they had. That's my best shot at describing what it seems they were trying to do.</p>
          <p>Now you move to the third bullet, where you see what we now know, which is what they did do was increased the size and complexity of the portfolio dramatically in the first quarter. And along with it, the sensitivity to a variety of risks, which you can see listed there, all of which contributed in some part to the losses, and Jamie touched on some of these earlier on.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, I just give a graphic presentation of basically the same thing, which is the growth of the portfolio in the first quarter. On the left, you see the total notional size of the portfolio with the red dots being the net of long and short notionals, which as you can see, tripled in the first quarter. You can't look at this slide and fully understand the risk of the portfolio. What it does show is that the significantly increased size and complexity of the portfolio left little margin for error when the expected pricing relationships across the portfolio began to break down and generate losses. It was a very risky approach they took, that should have been discussed and vetted at more senior levels, but it was not.</p>
          <p>So now for the next three slides, what I am going to do is lay out some key events that happened during three sequential time periods. The first one, slide 6, covers the first period. And that is from the beginning of 2012 to late March, March 23, by which point the cake was fully baked on this thing and essentially all the loss-making positions were already on the books.</p>
          <p>During this period, what you see on this slide is three key events I want to talk about. So the first one was that certain CIO level risk limits got exceeded and how those excessions were handled. These types of business level limits are common across the company, and when they are exceeded the independent business unit risk managers are responsible for reviewing the reasons for the excess and either granting relief or ensuring that action is taken and to get back inside the limits.</p>
          <p>Specifically, two CIO level credit-spread widening limits were exceeded over the course of the quarter. In January, a measurement of the impact of credit spread widening that ignored correlations across instruments exceeded its limit. This was reviewed by CIO's Market Risk Officer, who granted relief from the limit on the basis that the measure was an unsophisticated tool for measuring risk in these circumstances. Secondly, the other one there was on March 23. The second CIO level credit spread widening limit was exceeded, and this was obviously of little use as a control measure, since it occurred after the positions were already put on.</p>
          <p>Now, the second event that you see on the slide here in the middle bullet was the approval of a new synthetic credit VaR model in late January. This was approved by the independent model review group in Corporate Risk Management. For the week before the new model was implemented, John Hogan, the new Chief Risk Officer, and Jamie were asked to signed off on a temporary increase of firm wide VaR in an e-mail which noted that a CIO VaR model was soon to be approved, which was expected to lower VaR, and they assented and went ahead with that approval. But the problem with the second event here, which is why it's on this slide, relates to the model approval itself. Again, this was done by the model review group, despite reasons for concern about the weak operational environment supporting the model, which we will come back to later on.</p>
          <p>The third event on this slide was the February 29 CIO business review with folks from Corporate. The CIO attendees at that meeting indicated that the portfolio, the synthetic credit portfolio was well positioned and that RWA reduction was on track and raised no other issues.</p>
          <p>That's it for the key events up to the period of March 23, and that is the period by which all the positions were substantially on the books that led to the losses and the portfolio transforms.</p>
          <p>So now let's go on to Slide 7 and move onto the next time period I just wanted to talk about, and this is the period from then March 23 then to the April 13th Earnings Call. First, the portfolio experiences losses in late March and early April. Around this time, market visibility of the synthetic credit positions becomes a concern, particularly after press reports on April 6. At that point Doug and Jamie asked for a review of the portfolio in preparation for the earnings release a few days later.</p>
          <p>Ina spearheaded the review with engagement by John Hogan, Doug Braunstein and others. The main output of that review was forward scenario analysis that produced a probable P&amp;L range for the second quarter on the portfolio from positive $350 million to negative $250 million with a bias to the positive end. So at that time, the group got comfortable that the portfolio's risk was manageable though in need of heightened attention going forward and assurances to that effect were provided to Jamie and Doug.</p>
          <p>Now let me just make a few additional points about this review. First, that analysis was led by Ina, which made sense as she was very capable of driving a review of an activity in her area of responsibility. If there was a question about something like this in TSS, for example, I'd fully expect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:24) to lead the charge on bottoming it out, as would other operating committee members for their businesses.</p>
          <p>And the second point is that Ina in turn relied on the managers and traders responsible for the portfolio and who knew it best to produce the supporting analysis at that stage over those few days and in hindsight, obviously, their views may have been unduly influenced by their conviction that the market's awareness of their positions was causing aberration in pricing that would reverse.</p>
          <p>I will also just say here that the VaR model was not a focus during the pre-earnings release review because there was no indication at that stage that it wasn't working properly. It's a backward-looking indicator and actual losses had already prompted demands for the forward-looking scenario analysis that was being done. And so on April 13, this period ends and we announce our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on to slide 8, this is a set of facts for the period between the earnings release and the launch of the management review. So in late April, losses pick up and the heightened monitoring that followed the earnings call gets taken to another level when a senior team from corporate risk is sent to examine the portfolio from the bottom up.</p>
          <p>So they begin providing daily updates and construct an independent analysis of the portfolio that becomes the basis for risk measurement that the new CIO team picks up a few weeks later. It's during this period that problems with the new VaR model are discovered. We use the old model for the VaR number in the 10-Q and disclose that we had used the new model on April 13. This event has caused us to tighten up our procedures around model change disclosures going forward, by the way.</p>
          <p>We filed the first quarter 10-Q on Thursday, May 10 and held the investor call that evening with an update on the synthetic credit portfolio and finally on Monday, May 14, Matt Zames is announced as the new CIO and our management review is launched. So that's it for the facts.</p>
          <p>On slide 9 we transition from those facts which you just see summarized on the left to the observations they support on the right which is what I covered at the beginning. And now let's spend a little time going through each one of those observations in a bit more detail.</p>
          <p>So on slide 10 is the first one, which is the observation that CIO judgment, execution and escalation were poor. So first, the trading approach itself was poorly conceived, reviewed and executed. As we saw in the facts the portfolio grew to a perilous size with numerous embedded risks that the team did not understand and were not equipped to manage.</p>
          <p>The second bullet on the page is about insularity. Even within CIO the discussion of the portfolio stayed in the chain of managers with direct responsibility for it. A robust review among peer leaders in CIO would have provided for a discussion and challenge on the business side which is what I am accustomed to seeing across the management teams in this company and it did not happen here.</p>
          <p>And this was again compounded by the failure to surface issues related to the synthetic credit portfolio in the February business review with corporate. And then finally, the CIO led review and analysis of the portfolio in advance of the April 13 earnings call was poorly managed resulting in the view that potential losses were manageable, that the portfolio was balanced and would recover.</p>
          <p>So now before leaving you to these findings I'm just going to comment quickly on the remediation actions that relate to it that we will get to later. And for this one those fixes are the people changes that have been made in all the relevant CIO roles and the complete revamping of the management processes in CIO.</p>
          <p>So the second observation is that the level of scrutiny that CIO faced did not evolve as the complexity of the synthetic credit portfolio increased. Some of the contributing factors here was the belief and experience that the core activities of CIO were managed appropriately, contributing to the unit's successful track record. Second was the capability and experience of Ina herself and third was the modest but positive results of the synthetic credit portfolio historically. As a result, we collectively ended up with a level of scrutiny that fell short of the high standards we apply to our client businesses, especially as the complexity increased.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 12, the third observation is that CIO Risk Management was ineffective in its responsibilities for the synthetic credit portfolio. I would acknowledge some factors that presented challenges for the CIO Risk Management team, including what in hindsight was a lack of quality resources and a less robust risk committee supporting the risk team. Nonetheless, the CIO risk team failed to meet reasonable expectations in my mind.</p>
          <p>First, a primary responsibility of the business level risk team is establishing adequate risk limits. In this case tighter, more appropriate limits would have forced more discussion and debate about this portfolio, and if needed, would have prompted escalation to more senior levels. In fairness to the CIO risk team, they had an effort underway to improve risk limit structure for CIO, but it was too late to matter.</p>
          <p>Second, the CIO risk team did not perform adequately when it came to the VaR model approval and implementation. I will cover that in a couple slides.</p>
          <p>Third, CIO risk wasn't forceful enough in challenging the front office, and they never developed a sufficient understanding of the risk of the portfolio to escalate concerns to senior risk leaders outside CIO during the first quarter. To remediate this, we've added new people in key roles. We have also significantly strengthened the risk committee framework that covers CIO and other corporate sector activities.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, observation number 4, which is that risk limits in CIO were not sufficiently granular. This is a critical one, and we saw it in the facts on slide 6 that we gave ourselves too few opportunities to engage risk or other senior people, as would have been the case if we had a well-designed limit structure around this portfolio.</p>
          <p>First, there were no risk limits specific to the synthetic credit portfolio. The limits applied to more aggregated portfolios, often at the level of CIO, which was clearly inadequate. Obviously though, what was needed was granular position level limits for the portfolio itself.</p>
          <p>I would just say that in our Investment Bank Credit Derivatives business, the limits are already very granular. I believe that had the synthetic credit portfolio been risk managed under equivalent standards, it would not have experienced the unchecked transformation and growth that led to the losses. As for remediation here, we now have granular risk limits for all CIO and verified that they are in place where needed across the firm.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14 is the final observation is that the synthetic credit VaR model approval and implementation were inadequate. There has been some speculation here that this model was approved abruptly and by CIO alone, but that is not true. The fact is that CIO began working in consultation with the independent model review group in corporate risk in mid-2011 to upgrade the VaR model used for synthetic credit to a more accurate model that captured correlation risk as required for Basel 2.5 compliance, which we did not have with the old model and we obviously wanted to get. The expectation of all parties involved in the model approval was that the new model would lower measured VaR on the basis of the improvement of the calculation methodology together with the infrequent band breaks of the old model, which suggested that it produced conservative calculation of VaR.</p>
          <p>A fundamental problem with the VaR process was a lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities for each element of the process across the model review group, the CIO risk group and the CIO front office. The primary problem in the end though, was sloppiness and bad execution in implementing the new model, operational problems which included incorrect data feeds and certain calculation mistakes resulted in a VaR that was lower than what the approved model would have produced. A properly implemented model would still have lowered VaR compared to the old model, but not by as much. So it would still have taken us a bit of time to catch the overall problems, but as we said, it probably delayed us a little bit. To remediate here, we've strengthened the procedures around significant model approval and implementations.</p>
          <p>So slide 15, another transition here. So now we've just finished up reviewing the observations on the left side of the slide, and now we'll touch in a little more detail on a couple of the major remediation actions that I've foreshadowed a bit.</p>
          <p>So on slide 16, moving to that, first we have what is effectively a complete revamping of the CIO unit itself. On the people front that includes new CIO management team members including Matt himself, plus the head of CIO Europe, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer. All of them are very highly regarded and have substantial experience at our company.</p>
          <p>In terms of governance, the new team has instituted a robust committee structure, new review processes, and better reporting which will provide for better discussion and debate to ensure mistakes like this one &#x2013; that occurred here don't happen again.</p>
          <p>And in terms of CIO's mandate, Matt is refocusing on the core mission of managing the AFS investment portfolio. The synthetic credit activity has been shut down and the liquidated portfolio transferred to the Investment Bank where it will be better managed.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, you see a summary of the risk management remediation actions both for CIO and the firm. For CIO, as I've mentioned, we have a new Chief Risk Officer and have added resources to support his efforts. This new CIO will have responsibility for all the areas of the corporate sector, not just CIO. As we learned from this event, all activities outside our client businesses need robust risk management coverage and by broadening the mandate of this new Chief Risk Officer we've accomplished that.</p>
          <p>Next is risk governance, as I've said, we've created a much more robust risk committee for all activities in corporate that is modeled after the committees in our client businesses. It includes significant representation by senior executives and subject matter experts from outside CIO. The committee has already met numerous times and has completed detailed reviews of the activities of CIO ensuring risk parameters are consistent with the newly refocused mandate.</p>
          <p>And as for risk limits, we've introduced proper limits on all other CIO activities. Across the rest of the firm, we thoroughly reviewed the market risk limit structures to see if we lacked granularity elsewhere and found them to be in good shape. And finally, we've bolstered the policies for dealing with risk limit excessions by requiring higher levels of escalation and more frequent reviews.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 summarizes the remediation of the model approval and implementation, and monitoring processes. So here we've clarified the roles and responsibilities between the firmwide model review group and the line of business risk management functions. For the model review group which sits in corporate, in addition to reviewing and approving the VaR calculation framework which is their core activity, the group must also assess now the quality of the analytical testing and the soundness of the model operating environment whoever it is that's responsible for that.</p>
          <p>We've also formed up a new team inside model review that will monitor model-related responsibilities across the risk management function firm wide. They've been underway and they've already reviewed all market risk VaR models and confirm that data integrity and operating environments are sound. And then for the lines of business, we've clarified their responsibilities across all aspects of model governance including post-implementation monitoring. And we've heightened the expectations for model oversight through the line of business risk committees.</p>
          <p>So finally on remediation, I'd just say that &#x2013; I just reviewed the remediations that &#x2013; the ones that directly address the observations from the management review of CIO. But I should add that we've picked up a lot of other learnings along the way during this work and that we're acting on those things as well to make the company better.</p>
          <p>So now just to wrap it up, on slide 19, I'll wrap it up by saying that based on everything the team and I have examined and reviewed in the past two months I believe that the synthetic credit event is an isolated failure. That's both because the circumstances in CIO were unique, but also because of the thorough shakedown of the whole company that we did to be certain that we weren't making similar mistakes elsewhere.</p>
          <p>I'd say in closing that our management team has always been and continues to be very highly focused on managing risk and this event has caused us to step up our game everywhere. So thanks, for listening to this. We're going to move to Q&amp;A now and while Jamie and Doug rejoin for that, I'm just going to get it started with a couple of topics that you see here to get Q&amp;A going.</p>
          <p>So to just pick up where we &#x2013; Doug already covered a lot on the restatements, I just want to link it back to the work that I've done. So this slide gives some supporting information on the restatements that Doug covered earlier. All his numbers are the ones that are in there.</p>
          <p>So the context is because it's really the management review effort that has created the highly unusual circumstances we were faced with in the making the decision to restate the first quarter. Remember we started the management review on May 14, which was a couple days after we &#x2013; all the work supporting the 10-Q filing on May 10 was completed. But as I've described, the management review fact-finding has been very exhaustive. We have done obviously lots of e-mails being reviewed but also tens of thousands of voice tapes, many of them in foreign languages and so it's taking time to work our way through and work continues.</p>
          <p>But it brought us to the determination in the past few days that, as Doug said, we don't have sufficient comfort that for the first quarter the trader marks met the requirements of being where the traders thought they could exit their positions, I'll just point out though, that's even though the marks were generally within the bid ask spread, which is what otherwise is acceptable for GAAP. So given the unusual circumstances, we have taken the conservative approach to restate, bringing the marks to the VCGF mix of external mid-market benchmarks.</p>
          <p>Next, I just want to say a few things on the people side. So first on claw backs. So employee related actions for CIO managers here, slide 22. Now Jamie is going to talk about Ina in a minute. I'll talk about several other managers, all of the managers in London with direct responsibility for synthetic credit portfolio are now separated from the firm. None are receiving severance and no 2012 incentive compensation. We've made the decision to claw back compensation from each of these individuals and that amount is the maximum permitted. We have invoked that. It represents approximately two years of total annual compensation for each individual covering stock and options.</p>
          <p>We took into account or what was taken into account was a broad set of factors. I'll just make the point that the balance of factors for any individual in this balances differently, but all ended up with the same result of a full claw back. The board's reviewed all of these decisions.</p>
          <p>I just say further because there may be questions on people actions, what's covered here is the three London managers with direct responsibility for synthetic credit but there are several other changes in senior people in CIO, some of whom have been reassigned to more appropriate roles and others who will be leaving the Firm. We believe we are taking all the appropriate people actions in a timely manner, but beyond what I've said, I've told you here we're not going to be providing more detail on people actions and obviously not going to be talking about individuals.</p>
          <p>And then finally on 23, I've got a board statement to read on compensation determinations. And forget the three people I just covered and as I said Jamie will cover Ina. Advancing the slide here. So now, for all other individuals and that includes Jamie, the 2012 performance year compensation and claw back, if appropriate, will be determined in the ordinary course, considering, among other things, the factors you see listed, which is company, unit and individual performance on absolute and relative basis, the achievement of non-financial objectives, which of course are the same things we would always consider in a total picture on compensation. Of course involvement in and responsibility for the CIO matter will be included in that and just an added point, we're only going to make public information about what we do on claw backs if it's required.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand it over to Jamie, who wants to make a comment about Ina and then we'll go to Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. So let me just say a word about Ina Drew. I have enormous respect for Ina as a professional and as a person. She has made some incredible contributions to this Company. When she decided to retire I got several letters from former chairmen who talked about her contribution. One even said she saved the Company in his judgment.</p>
          <p>In my experience she has acted with integrity and tried to do what was right for the Company at all times even though she was part of this mistake and I believe that's true here as well. In that spirit Ina came forward and offered to give up a very significant amount of her past compensation, which is equivalent to the maximum claw back amount.</p>
          <p>So with that, we will turn it over to Q&amp;A. Sarah, are you going to run the Q&amp;A?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Glenn Schorr from Nomura. Thank you very much. That doesn't count as a question right? So in the past couple of Investor Days you've shown us a slide on the earning power of the Firm being in the range of $24 billion pre-buyback over the cycle earnings. I'm curious on post the CIO-related changes how you think about that? I do appreciate that you showed us $2 billion over the last four years in the synthetic credit portfolio earnings. Is that it? Is that how should we think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This does not affect the earnings power of the Company at all. The $24 billion will still be accurate, and we can probably show those numbers &#x2013; we didn't put them up there, but we could probably show you the numbers almost the same we showed you last time. A lot of that is where we are today minus the burden in mortgage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no other big changes to the investment philosophy in CIO. Okay, good, thanks. On the European exposure slide that you have in one of the slides, I guess I'm looking for a net comp or net take away. Has the situation in Europe gotten any better? Because it hasn't from a lot of people's view. And then maybe your level of confidence around your exposures hedges and what you are doing behind the scenes to potentially prepare for the potential redenominations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think &#x2013; we have been fairly consistent. We've kind of had a roller coaster ride here. You see progress two steps forward, one step back. We still think they're going to muddle through, but it may not be in the form or fashion or the timetable we all would prefer. The number is up there. We went from $12 billion to $6 billion of net exposure. We think it's a rather good number. We stress test what we think our risk is. We talk about a potential loss of $3 billion. In a bad scenario it could be worse, in a complete extreme scenario, like a falling apart of the whole European Union. The important thing to us is that we continue to conduct business there. We have a lot of clients. We have been in Italy and Spain for 100 years or so, and we are going to do that carefully. And obviously we have been doing more hedging of the exposure there, and that's a decision we make periodically over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last one, maybe &#x2013; I don't know if there's a point of clarification, because I think everyone appreciates the full run through and disclosure on the CIO, but coming into today I was saying, wow, it would be great if they could tell me what the loss was? What they think the expected loss is? And what percent is gone or left? You've got us on the loss side. You got us on the full run through, but I'm not sure I'm clear on what's left? How much of it is gone? Or how much of it is still with you? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we showed a lot of numbers. Showed the risk itself is down two-thirds, 70%, 80% so depending on how you measure it. It's moved the IB. It doesn't have to lose money at all. We said the extreme stress scenarios, simulated stress scenarios, which means in a Euro crisis, a credit crunch, a 99.9% statistical analysis could be as high as $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion. That does not mean we expect it. I'd be surprised if it got that big.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. I'm going to ask the same question that Glenn started off. Just as we think about longer-term earnings power, how can we completely ignore that there's some profit from the macro hedges? There's going to be some de-risking of the securities book. So I kind of want to ask the same question again and try and get some numbers around it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's $2 billion of profit in this book over a four or five-year period. We didn't assume any of it going forward at all, so it's not like we're taking a lot of risk and assuming big profits. We were not. That was not in our numbers. It doesn't change the $24 billion or anything like that. We are not de-risking the AFS portfolio. When it's fully invested, it's about $350 billion, it has a 2.6% yield. You can go buy Ginnie Maes or Fannie Mae today at 3.25%. So you could easily extend duration. We're very short duration, extend duration, earn more NII. I think the portfolio is actually conservative. It will be a source of higher earnings, if and when rates go up. This will not affect the earnings power of the Company at all.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As we think about the core businesses and specifically the Investment Bank, you've talked about looking through, rechecking all the risk, bringing down some limits potentially. Will we see any of that impact going forward?</p>

          <p>The Investment Bank is doing what it's supposed to do. They were not asked to take on any other risk because they took on synthetic credit.

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, hi. Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. So two questions, one on capital. You indicated that you think that you've got a strong trajectory to 9.5%. We're getting two numbers for the starting point there. Either it's the starting point is the 9.1% post mitigation or the 7.9%. Which one are you referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the 7.9% is we fully phase in everything upfront.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're saying for the 9% is you actually fully phased in the runoff stuff and some of the models we know we're going to do, we would get another one point back within the next two years so I'm just trying to show apples-to-apples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So but your 9.5% that you're saying is the trajectory to, is by what timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That 9.5% was the end of 2013 and it was like 10.5% or something at 2014. If we don't buy back stock it's like 10.5% and 12.5% &#x2013; go right to that slide, you can see it. That's without a stock buyback. That's not taking &#x2013; it's only taking advantage of mitigating items the year they actually happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then separately, a little bit of a follow-up on the LIBOR question, so one of the concerns that people have had is that clearly with a large London presence and with what had happened in the CIO, there's a question around controls in that region. And so, it gets to people thinking about, gee, if the CIO office didn't have the controls in that part of the world why should we believe that the rest of the organization did? And so, I think that's what's on people's minds as they're hearing today the CIO trade is all boxed and wrapped up. But looking forward, next six months, how do we know it's not going to come up in some other area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can never prove a negative, okay? And so Mike went through our expense controls and disciplines which we feel pretty good about. We can't prove to you that because you're not going to see it. We think this is isolated. We think the controls in Europe are just as &#x2013; Mike was referring to the controls around the country, around the world. We think they're pretty good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Nancy Bush, NAB Research. Jamie, two questions for you. Your underlying trends were very positive this quarter and there just seems to be a disconnect between what you're seeing in your underlying trends and what we're hearing about the economy which seems to be softening, everybody's gloomy, things are terrible, etcetera, etcetera. Could you just flesh that out a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're making a good point because Doug showed the numbers like eight quarters of continuous Middle Market loan growth. Anecdotally, I hear that from other companies too. Not all other banks but a lot of the banks. I hear from a lot of the banks, small business loan growth. The fact is the underpinnings of the American economy aren't that bad. Corporate America, middle market companies, small businesses are okay. There's a lot of liquidity. There's not a huge order book so sales aren't growing dramatically. So we have slow, modest growth and you're starting to see it in our calculations. Some of what we're getting is market share gains. So remember we did Middle Market. We weren't doing Middle Market banking in California. Now we do. We weren't doing small business in California. Now we do because of the WaMu acquisition. So we are gaining share in some of our businesses through credit card, middle market, small business, IB's holding share.</p>

          <p>Second question, not a lot of discussion about litigation reserves in your commentary today. Could you just comment broadly about, with the CIO matter, with upcoming whatever may happen with LIBOR etcetera, what you guys think about your litigation reserves at this point?</p>

          <p>Yeah, so I think, last time I spoke about mortgage. We think it's kind of well &#x2013; we've really done a good job there and it could change over time. We put away a lot of &#x2013; we put a lot away from mortgage over time. This quarter, when you see the 10-Q, as you get to see the 10-Q, it will show litigation expenses of like $300 million. So we try to keep up with reserving for things we know about. This quarter of course we had some big ins and outs. It isn't like just one thing that happens.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The $3 billion was my estimate after tax. It was $5 billion pre-tax. I did it with my own methodologies. I said it was a bad outcome. It's not the worst outcome. If you said that Europe unraveled, the Euro falls apart, I think it could be worse than that. The IB just recently, IB is constantly looking at these for the company. So TSS does it. Their number recently would be more like $3 billion. We have a Euro command center. We've got a lot of &#x2013; we know exactly what we are doing. If something goes wrong, we are prepared to deal with it. We don't have to necessarily have losses at all. The issue with Europe and the complexities with Europe are what contracts apply, how they apply, who leaves the Euro, what currency are you paid in, what does it do for losses in the country. So there are these complex things, but those numbers would still be rough estimates of a bad outcome, but not the worst outcome.</p>

          <p>Mike Cavanagh had a statement saying the level of scrutiny did not evolve commensurate with the increased complexity. He was referring to CIO, but I wonder if that statement could apply to the Firm as a whole. I mean on February 28 we were all here, eight hours of presentations, over 200 slides, no mention of CIO. And then we had the CIO event, a risk model that didn't capture the risk, a new risk model that wasn't accurately tested before. Some checks and balances that might've been possible with the investment bank seemed a little siloed. So I'm wondering if the Firm as a whole has reached some sort of tipping point when it comes to bigness or complexity that makes it more difficult to manage than in the past?</p>

We had record earnings the year before. It's likely, if you look at your own estimates, we'll have record earnings this year, that we have gained market share in Investment Banking, in TSS and Asset Management, our Commercial Bank in Small Business and Middle Market. We are just not doing a great job in marketing the company, we are going to sit back some other time and make this a more attractive company for you all. We made a mistake.

          <p>Chris Whalen from Tangent Capital Partners. First, just quickly on the CIO, does the nature of these instruments, these over-the-counter instruments, make you reconsider whether or not all of the controls and risk management and everything else you are putting in place can be effective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not the nature of the instruments. A lot of these things are traded on exchanges, most of the indexes you can go buy and sell in the marketplace easily. Most are on clearinghouses and if you still want to see, you can see them. So I think this portfolio became very big and very complex. That is true. It should never ever, ever have gotten that big and that complex. And on May 10, the first I said it was too big, it was un-vetted, it shouldn't have been done. It was illiquid. It was bad. We should've caught it earlier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But that's kind of my point. When you have an instrument that doesn't have a clear basis, and the basis may shift, the correlations may shift very quickly. Can you manage that risk?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>None at all. The AFS portfolio is held for sale. So it's mark-to-market in the equity account but not mark-to-market. We think you should be allowed to portfolio hedge. We are not going to do something like this again, but we think pure portfolio hedging is not necessarily a bad thing. So we all talk about Europe, one of the quick ways you want to go hedge Europe, right now you get on the phone and you can buy $1 billion of protection on European, 100 or 120 European credit names. That is a good thing if you want to protect yourselves from Europe. It's not that complex. So Volcker changes the future for a whole bunch of things. We will adapt to that, whatever that is.</p>

The real issue is the NPR on Basel I, and that is a work in progress, but all the numbers that you see there in the projections we have, just assume continued growth in the mortgage business. So we will get some benefit. That runoff portfolio is going to liberate a substantial amount of Basel III capital, and as a result RWA and as a result free up some capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a question for Doug, you talked about some of the net interest margin pressure coming from hedge ineffectiveness. Could you quantify of the 10 basis points how much you think that is? And do you expect that to revert in the third quarter? And then just generally, given the really oppressively low interest-rate environment that we're in right now, maybe some sense of your view on the net interest income trajectory of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first, it was several basis points of the impact. It's going to vary quarter on quarter, and it has varied quarter on quarter. So part of the difference this quarter is we had some positive results last quarter and negative results. The swing is what's reported from a NIM standpoint.</p>
          <p>On the NII, in aggregate, we have some portfolio runoffs and we've been &#x2013; we've provided you some guidance around that. We continue to build our balances and build our loan portfolios so the question is going to be which exceeds the other here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one disclosure you're going to see is that this AFS portfolio is yielding 2.6% but this quarter it's going to be -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2.47%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2.47%. That is hedge ineffectiveness. It's really still yielding 2.6%. So it isn't that we did something like that, it's just that hedge ineffectiveness when it goes against the asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as a quick follow-up, you talked about potentially getting &#x2013; being close to zero in terms of mortgage repurchase costs through &#x2013; at least though the income statement over the next several quarters. Can you give us maybe a little more commentary around that? Are you seeing a significant decline in claims starting to come in? And then secondarily can you make any comments in terms of your sense of what's going on in the private label side of mortgage repurchases either in terms of claims or with respect to litigation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the real differential, there has been a modest decline, the real differential is our cure rates. Because as these demands go deeper into the securities, they are taking more mortgages that have been paying for longer and the result of that is that we've been decreasing the amount of demands we actually have to repurchase. That's really been driving in part the analysis. On the private label side you will see in our supplement we had a modest increase in demand but much of that is going to make it's way through litigation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Also for Doug, I wonder if you could walk us through a little bit on the changes in the Basel III ratio. At the end of March you reported 8.4%, this is 7.9%. Obviously the NPR must have had an impact there and I was wondering if you could break down what the bigger chunks of that impact are. Is it the treatment of home equity loans or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Actually 20 basis points was refinement of our earnings as a function of the restatement so there was a move from the restatement, actually about 10 basis points. The remaining 30 basis points you can think about that principally as the CRM minimum that was added to the Basel 2.5 rules. That's the bulk of the RWA. It's an increase of about $40 billion for our portfolio. We would estimate, because that is subject to model approval and you need at least 12 months of operation model approval from the first quarter of 2013 so we're hopeful that $40 billion comes back into and it's included in some of those projections that Jamie showed you, coming back as reductions. So we were pretty close on our Basel III estimates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now the way I read it though in the home equity loans in particular it looked like for over 80% loan to values that you were going to have a 1.5 times capital charge -</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. I understand from your information that one of the reasons for the losses here was that perhaps the success of the unit led to some complacency in overall governance of the unit. And as I look through some of the discovery information it seems that the risk management profile here was one that excluded certain basic tenets of risk management, granular levels of asset, concentration risk, etcetera. So I guess that begs the question: was this unit ill-conceived from a risk management perspective from day one and it took five years to reach the end result or were there are perhaps some small successive lapses in credit management over time that ultimately, and perhaps we can look at the new VaR model as inadvertently being one of those, that ultimately led to this result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would say it is something that the complexity of synthetic credit was there over five years and there were things that obviously we could have caught it sooner but it didn't, until the circumstances of the first quarter, get us. But the overall mistake was allowing something that wasn't like the rest of the ALM type of activities to get housed inside CIO that had one form of risk management structure and then put something new in that required a whole different type of risk wrapped around it and didn't do it at the time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Mike and Jamie. Mike you talked a lot about the VaR model and some of the changes. Jamie, you've talked in the past about your feelings one way or the other in terms of the usefulness of VaR, if you will. What I'm curious about is with all the discussion on VaR, if you will, what changes have been made in terms of the dependence on the models themselves and how that relates back to the risk management and the model group and what other control tools you may have put in place to again make this a more robust process if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't run a business on models. If you do run a business on models, you will be dead. It doesn't work. VaR is one model. We use tons of other models, and I think Mike pointed out the right way to do it is have lots of other granular limits, notional amount limits, credit spread limits, single name limits, all these things. VaR is just one. VaR does not capture underlying changes in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:39:34). It doesn't capture changes in correlations. It's only backward looking. So it's a data point that helps you manage your business, that's all it is. Now, having said that, Mike, we've got to do a better job implementing some of these models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It's the process of <mark type="ph" /> running (1:39:29) models, not the models themselves that is defining there. And the granular risk. Those are the two big takeaways if you look at the findings that I would say is get the right limits around the activity, one. That's not necessarily a VaR model or any one given type of activity, but if we're going to put things in, we've got to have belts and suspenders to make sure we're approve for the right reasons and have the right operational support around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, it's my understanding as an example with the CCAR process and the review of the trading operation specifically, a lot of the dependence was placed on the models in terms of that review. What are you sensing now in terms of given the event that has transpired, how that evaluation is going to change on a go-forward basis, particularly as we think about next year's CCAR process in light of this event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have certainly put a lot of attention on it ourselves, and I think that the takeaways that we saw was just bolstering all processes around model of governance, implementation, approval, a new team, we took a 25-year veteran risk manager in charge of a new group that's really going to lead up, watching model activities, all parts of the process. Because really the mistake we made here was roles and responsibilities.</p>
          <p>So whereas I would say we are very good in particularly our Investment Bank, which is the heaviest user of models. We have got a very robust in-business market risk teams that have the handoff of dealing with parallel testing, back testing, running the operational model themselves. CIO is weaker in that regard. So when we have interaction between the independent model review group and the market risk teams in the business, again a particular mistake here. But that's a policy and procedure thing that we've tightened up, and John Hogan has done a lot in the past two months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CCAR is not VaR dependent. It's stress testing. We do &#x2013; I would say stress testing is more important than most of the other stuff. So we do extensive stress testing. And so to me, you've got to get that right. So CCAR has embedded in it is one test. We do 100s of stress tests, and obviously we should have done stress testing in this particular portfolio better too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Jamie, the 10-year today is right around 1.5. We keep on hoping as banking analysts that it keeps on going up, but every quarter it goes down. The ten-year, the flat year curve, which is really starting to weigh on a lot of people's net interest margins. Your net interest margin was down like 13 or 14 basis points. It really feels like this 10-year is not going to move and we're going to live with a flat yield curve longer than anybody wish, maybe in the 2014 or 2015. How do you as a bank position yourself for that environment, even if it goes down as a lot of people are thinking to 1% at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not talking about going down to 1%, but we are getting near the end of the margin compression from the yield curve. So if I remember correctly, about a year or two to go, we might lose another $400 million or $500 million. And then it flattens out. If the 10 goes down more, it's even more. We're short. Most banks have a much longer duration than we do. So we could easily today change what we are doing and put on $50 billion in mortgages at 3% and earn a lot more. If you really believe that, we could change our structure to earn back some of that income, and in fact far more than we might lose on the 10-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Take a bigger step back, if we're going to be living with this flat yield curve, banks like to live with a steep yield curve. That's what we've all been raised on for the last three or four decades, but if we are going to live in this environment, how do banks operate? How do you position your institution to go forward with a continued flat yield curve? You can adjust the balance sheet, that's a one-time issue, but going forward, how would you run this institution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I was telling you, I don't think &#x2013; most of the effect of the yield curve has gone away. If it stays like this forever we're still going to earn about what we're earning. So it isn't like you have to deal with a negative every year after every year. It will &#x2013; obviously how you do your loans and your deposits and a lot of things in our balance sheet which earn very little because we're almost doing it as a service to clients, you might do less of that. So you set up $200 billion of treasury assets we have we're earning five basis points on that. We don't need to keep those deposits that we may modify that but you will change your pricing, your products, your services to try to earn a fair return on capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've, so basically, if you did the number today it might show a gap but that gap is easy for us to fix by just changing our asset mix. So we will be LCR compliant by reinvesting the AFS portfolio or doing a slight different things. We want to see the final rule before we start swinging the balance sheet all over the place. We'll be fine. We are a very liquid company.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And following up on the yield curve commentary that you just made Jamie. Are the returns acceptable? As you pointed out there is not any incremental negative impact for you guys if the yield curve stays this way, but are the returns on equity acceptable or would you try some other strategy, possibly shrinking the balance sheet and buying back even more stock?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We ask that question all the time but we're actually believe it or not getting good returns right now. When you look at the returns in our businesses, the 15% return in tangible equity, the record earnings, so could you do more? What we'd like to do is build the business. Bankers, services, clients, execution of services to grow our business over time and we have been doing that so that's what we focus on and we'll modify pricing, products and balance sheet to get a fair return.</p>

          <p>It's very hard to add to the debate you read about it every day. You now are reading about what they kind of need to do and they need to do all of them. One of the banks have their European bank regulator or European bank scheme to stop bank runs, to have some facility that can finance the Italian and Spanish sovereign debt in the meantime and a fiscal union that people believe in. We figure to see that kind of in fits and starts over time. And just be prepared for the roller coaster.</p>

          <p>Hi, Nancy Bush, again. Mike, a question for you. Looking at your slide number 8, the events in late April, you say senior corporate risk management team began on site bottom-up engagement on April 27. Had a senior risk management team done an on site bottom-up engagement in the CIO before and is that now sort of an established part of risk management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that's a good question, Nancy. What we referred to there is that in late April that's the stage at which John Hogan over there and a team of folks from outside CIO and across business went into to really sit on site and pick the book apart. Prior to that, there was obviously work being done with Senior risk folks, but looking through the lens of the CIO risk team. So it took it to a different level of intrusion.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Obviously we looked at all that. None of the people in CIO are on any form of formulas. The business is not on a formula. We obviously looked at compensation for what we were doing in CIO relative to what you would see pay related to running a $350 billion fixed income portfolio. I can't obviously get in the minds of the individuals that have been making individual decisions but we looked for evidence of particular things that were problematic around our compensation schemes and found no particular issues.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. A couple of quick questions for you, Doug. First of all, you mentioned that the net interest margin effect of the AFS gains or the securities that were sold to generate the gains this quarter had no effect on this quarter's NIM. Does that imply any effect on future quarters' NIM as well, depending on when the sales were done.</p>

          <p>No? Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Okay, and then in terms of the Investment Banking and Sales and Trading results, those appear to be, even if you strip out the DVA, reasonably strong. Could you give us a sense as to what your outlook is for those numbers, to the extent that you can guess it? And what the drag from Europe is on your outlook there for the next quarter or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, as you know Investment Banking revenues are unpredictable by their nature. And whenever they come in with a low number, I would say, well it could be much higher. So right now it looks similar to what it was last quarter. That can change at any one point in time. Obviously I think you see everywhere business in Asia and Europe are down. America remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Dave Sochol, Levin Capital. Maybe from the perspective of a buy-sider and a long-suffering shareholder and my clients, I would like to follow-up on Mike Mayo's question and also reference a KBW report that looked at the potential of splitting off the Chase Consumer Bank with auto and credit and having a standalone JPMorgan commercial bank, Investment Bank, trust, and TSS and the point being not just the tipping point or actual diseconomies of scale and even if there are economies of scale, the stock market refuses to acknowledge it in terms of the multiple continuing to come down. I look at the track record over the past year or so and notwithstanding the great performance relative to a pretty low bar, but still a good performance, but we've had the mortgage servicing issues, mortgage foreclosure issues, the military veteran issues, energy, commodities, sales practices, now this inexcusable, just unbelievable CIO debacle, now potential LIBOR. And I think about what has to happen for you as a management team, or you as a board to finally say, we are a great institution and we own a lot of great businesses, but we have reached that point where we are too big to manage and in the interest of our shareholders, there is a different corporate structure that would better serve your owners? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I beg to differ. Okay. There is huge strength in this company that the units get from each other. So we don't have the strategy that we're guessing at things. The Investment Bank or the Commercial Bank, the TSS gives huge order flow to the investment bank. We think there is an enormous amount of cross sell. And we do just as much as anybody else out there between the Consumer Bank, small business, private wealth management, credit card, mortgage. Our job is to do a great job serving clients, grow the business and eventually the stock will reflect it. And so I think also people splitting off companies, my whole life there's people who splits it off as a higher fee, lower fee, that's very short-term stuff. Have a strategy, execute on it, build the business, that's how you build value. We don't feel great that we haven't done a great job for shareholders recently. That we completely acknowledge. But we're going to keep on building the company and one day the stock will reflect it. If the board ever thought there were better strategies then that will be considered at the time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. I would respectfully say that certainly the cross sell is very obvious and that's why I would not look at separating it into numerous companies. But I'm just wondering at what point it does become more apparent that there are diseconomies and is there potential that &#x2013; is it possible that had CIO been part of a smaller institution it would have gotten the management look that it required?</p>

          <p>Jamie, quick follow-up on sort of your perspective on capital. So since investor day in February, it seems like the world's gotten a little bit of a &#x2013; to be a scarier place in terms of we're more concerned about Europe. We have the LIBOR thing has cropped up. We're talking more about global economic slowdown. I know you mentioned you'd love to buy back the stock at one times tangible book. But is there anything about the last several months of events, just from a macro standpoint, that make you want to drive to higher capital ratios or get to 9.5% on Basel III Tier 1 common equity faster than you might have thought you wanted to back in February?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>A little bit and you know what those things are. It's Europe, the fiscal cliff in the United States, it's all those things that make you be a little more cautious. But again, I think we're going to earn money next year regardless of those things, whatever happens.</p>

          <p>Mike, you gave us a very thorough, detailed disclosure on how you attacked this problem with the CIO and you're very confident that you have your arms around it.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't speak for the regulators. But certainly they've been &#x2013; we've spent a lot of time with them to keep them informed and obviously wanted to guide our work from the get-go in a way that was going to satisfy a lot of different constituencies.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're going to do their own work as they should and come to their own conclusions. Remember the board, as an independent group, are still guiding this task force and will come to its own conclusions too.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, when you went through your review, do you think that maybe the idea that there was no formula for comp in CIO might have led to some of the trouble and the stretching? And then on a go-forward basis, as the follow-up, which is probably more important, how are you guys thinking about structuring comp in the CIO office over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think &#x2013; when we talk about formulas, individuals getting a cut of revenue, none of that existed, and I don't think that's a good thing. I think the kind of practices that are common in CIO are the same as what we do in our investment bank, it's taking the totality of managers' subjective judgment of performance and a multiyear view of how good a person is in a job over multiple years. All that together with the pay practices of how we defer compensation, all are sound policies and it's the application, obviously, that you have to get right. Matt, who is now running CIO, I'm sure will just bring his own individual management style into doing that, but we didn't walk away with the feeling that there was anything different about that unit of the company or that the company broadly should be doing differently around administering compensation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the idea now that we don't have synthetic in CIO, clearly that's going to mean we should probably just assume more volatile results out of that business, particularly in times when credit is getting a little funky?</p>

          <p>I showed the portfolio, AA plus. It's an AFS portfolio. It's not marked-to-market in the P&amp;L. It's got a 3.7 year average life, 80% government, government guaranteed or government type of entity guaranteed. You're not going to have more volatility in it.</p>
          <p>If we have a small hedge there, if we are so &#x2013; and you see we hedge more in Europe, that's why we need the ability to hedge. But really it has very little to do with AFS. AFS is subordinate to the rest of the company. Nothing would please us more than to reduce AFS and make some more great loans. So they can't say, be paid just on the revenues and their profits, because they're not there for that. They are there to manage this portfolio. We need some very good people. It's $350 billion. It operates, I forgot, out of how many countries under multiple currencies, so it is &#x2013; we need some very good people managing that book, just like we would at PIMCO or BlackRock, big fixed income portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I mentioned three things. Obviously the operation of the consent order. Second, is this independent foreclosure review, those costs are larger and are going on longer than we expected. And third is we just continue to have a lot of default properties that we are processing through. Those will come down over time, but they haven't. They remain at a level. So our expectation is we had thought we would see more movement in the second, third and fourth quarter. It's more likely that's a 2013 event.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning. Doug, this is a question for you on the margin. I just wanted to help if you could flesh out why we saw a decline? It seems like in the trading assets you had securities borrowed turn negative in terms of the yield. Other trading assets understood that you have a lower rate environment, but on the flipside the cost of the trading assets on the liability side seemed to go up. Is that the hedging impact? Or can you explain a little more detail on why we are seeing this dynamic of a negative spread in securities borrowed and other issues?</p>
