          <p>Good afternoon. This is the Chorus Call Conference Operator. Welcome to the Roche Full Year Results 2008 Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dr. Severin Schwan, Chief Executive Officer of Roche. And I'll join you to the conference room, thank-you.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen please hold the line, the conference call will begin shortly, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, looking forward to an engaged discussion this afternoon. Glad to be back in London. But before we get into the numbers, let me just make two comments; one on our strategy and one on the Genentech transaction.</p>
          <p>I think in particular in such turbulent times, it is very important to stay on course, to stick to our strategy. And our strategy is clearly focused on our two core businesses; Pharma and Diagnostics. It is focused on innovation and we define innovation by medical differentiation.</p>
          <p>We put ourselves high hurdle in terms of developing innovative tests and therapeutics, which really make a difference to patients' life, which improve the quality of life, and which prolong life. And we have no intention whatsoever to diversify into other directions, be it OTC or medical devices or even generics. We will stick to what we're really good at.</p>
          <p>Now, as for Genentech, you have seen that last week we made a public tender offer to the minority shareholders of Genentech. Unfortunately, over the last seven months, we have not succeeded to agree on a negotiated transaction. And that basically left us no other choice than to directly go to the minority shareholders.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to emphasize however, is this changes nothing, absolutely nothing in the way we want to organize the combined organization, in the way we want to integrate the two businesses. We have an enormous respect for the Genentech organization. We have an enormous respect for what Genentech has achieved. We will keep research and early development, as we already announced in July last year, we will keep it as an independent center within the Roche Group. It will not report into the Roche R&amp;D structure and we will do everything it may take to nurture this very specific innovation, science-driven culture at Genentech.</p>
          <p>Now let's get into the figures. First of all, what did we promise, one year ago here in London, how  did we deliver on it?</p>
          <p>We did grow both our businesses; Pharma and Diagnostics, above their respective markets. You can see Pharma with a growth of 10%, outgrowing the market by a factor two. Diagnostics is also influenced by the Ventana transaction, actually it accounts for four percentage points of the growth. But even then, we clearly outgrew the market and indeed for Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>On a Group level, we grew by 10%, slightly ahead of our guidance, which was in the high single-digits. And we delivered on our guidance for Core EPS, by growing 2% in local currencies versus the previous year.</p>
          <p>If we go into the two divisions; Pharmaceuticals, again up by 10%, mainly driven by the dynamics, the continuing dynamics in oncology. In fact we have, in spite of the financial crisis, we have seen no slowdown in these dynamics in the third or in the fourth quarter. Oncology now accounts for 20 billion Swiss francs. That is 55% of the overall Pharma Division, and two-thirds of our Pharma portfolio consists of true biologics. So, there is no doubt, Roche is by any means the biggest biotech company in the world.</p>
          <p>As for Diagnostics, again 4% growth, this was attributed by Ventana. I'm extremely pleased about the performance of our Ventana colleagues and how it was integrated into the Diagnostics Division. Not only did we already complete the integration, we have grown substantially above market and certainly exceeded our ambitious goals which we have set ourselves at the beginning of last year after we closed the Ventana deal. We saw also strong growth in Applied Science and Professional Diagnostics which was partly offset by a flat development in Diabetes Care.</p>
          <p>Now certainly, one point to note is that whilst we have grown the 10% in local currencies on a Group level, we have a decline of minus 1% in Swiss francs. So, let me quickly illustrate again the bridge of what the main factors are. 4 billion Swiss francs organic growth, 10% on a Group level, and then you see as expected, as we announced, actually pretty much, very much on spot on our guidance we gave last year, 1.6 billion decline in Tamiflu, because we expected a decline in the pandemic order.</p>
          <p>And then you can see the massive impact of the exchange rates. The Swiss franc has strengthened against all major currencies in particular of course the U.S. dollar and the euro and as such we lost 3.2 billion in Swiss franc on the top line which basically led to a flat result in Swiss franc terms.</p>
          <p>Turning to profitability; operating profit increased by 4% in local currencies. In spite of heavy investments which we made in research and development, and I will come back to this, and you see this development also reflected in the EPS growth. The strong profitability is also reflected in our cash flow. You can see that the operating cash flow has virtually doubled in absolute terms over the last five years. We have now reached a very healthy return on sales in terms of cash flow of 27%.</p>
          <p>Now, as we go forward, as I said in my introductory comment, we clearly focus on innovation and we believe that in particular in such times, this is the recipe for success in the long term. We do expect as we go into 2009 a decrease in our financial return. As you know, interest rates have sharply come down in the second half of 2008, and as we go into 2009 and expecting that the interest rates will not, I expect we have the full year effect, we expect.</p>
          <p>Now closely related to our commitment in innovation is our investments in our pipeline, is our investments into research and development. And you have seen that research and development reached 8.8 billion Swiss francs, almost 9 billion Swiss francs. That is an increase of 13% in local currencies or twice as fast as the sales. So, where does this come from and, perhaps more importantly, what is the outlook as we go into 2009.</p>
          <p>The reason is, the underlying reason is, that there are a number of opportunities which is now shifting into late stage which is shifting into Phase III. I've here outlined the new molecular entities which we are running at Roche. And you see in 2007, we had two new molecular entities. We added another three in 2008 and we will add another four as we go into 2009. And you all know best that development costs really get expensive in the Phase III when you roll out products in huge clinical trials to many patients and that is what you see here, that is what is driving research and development. It is late stage development costs which are growing and I consider this good news.</p>
          <p>So, this means that we have real opportunities at hand that it is worthwhile to invest into. Now, we also have a number of other programs, new indications which are moving into Phase III. We had three new molecular entities in 2008 which we are moving into Phase III. But in total, we had 12 projects for another nine indications, important indications, which we are removing into Phase III adding to the over-proportional increase in research and development.</p>
          <p>And in fact, we have a similar picture in Diagnostics. We had an increasing number of key launches in 2008 and you have seen a strong growth in research and development in 2008, and we see a further increase of projects coming through in 2009 mainly driven by the new products in Diabetes Care.</p>
          <p>And that, to a big extent, explains our guidance of a stable EPS as we go into 2009. We keep the EPS on the high level of 2008, in spite of those investments into research and development and in spite of the lower financial returns and we do this by our organic growth. We get a windfall if you like, by our product mix and of course, we continue to work on our operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to close out for 2009. Again, above market growth for both our businesses; Pharma and Diagnostics. We expect to grow in the mid single-digits for both divisions and for the Group as a whole and to keep EPS at 2008 level.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Bill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Severin. Good afternoon, everybody. Pleasure to be here, the Artillery Hall, the Drill Room, it looks like this is where you can put us through our drills.</p>
          <p>2008, strong year, double-digit growth, if we take the Tamiflu to one side for a moment. Even if you included the Tamiflu revenues, it still market performed, a price market if you park the Tamiflu pandemic sales to government. So we did signal at the beginning of the year, 1.6 &#x2013; 1.7 billion to be washed out of the revenue stream there.</p>
          <p>We've managed, despite the investments that we're making into R&amp;D, to keep a high level on the margin, and you'll see that in a moment, and also a number of growth drivers for us in the year to come; Avastin with paclitaxel. You'll remember this was a bit nail biting in getting the FDA approval where the independent X-rays had to be reviewed and then the AVADO study came in and also contributed to this, and then further in the year RIBBON-1 came in. So there are now three significant studies showing the benefits of Avastin in breast cancer.</p>
          <p>We have also Actemra launched in Japan mid-year, approved in Europe at the turn of the year, and we still have with the same dossier, the same database to satisfy the FDA, largely because they're looking for some preclinical data to get there. But it's more preclinical data that would be typical of a small molecule, not of a large molecule.</p>
          <p>So then on the filings; following up with AVADO in Europe, glioblastoma towards the end of the year, it's now submitted both in the U.S. and in Europe. And MabThera, first-line in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, not only had first-line been submitted during 2008, but in January we got the approval recommendation from the European Union. And we've also by the end of year filed the REACH data on the relapsed CLL. So mission accomplished.</p>
          <p>Good clinical data coming through as I've mentioned on Avastin in metastatic breast, some data on -- for Xeloda in early breast cancer, and then again partly last year and also just a couple of days ago, first-line maintenance therapy in lung cancer that both SATURN, which was in monotherapy has shown a clear role and then ATLAS, which is on top of Avastin in the first-line maintenance has shown a clear role.</p>
          <p>12 new Phase III projects initiated, three NMEs, and also I think a fairly good year in terms of licensing and business development. Four acquisitions that we brought in, some of them really enablers from a technology point of view. Our siRNA program where we have very good leads, we needed some delivery approaches for this and also some products and then a number of other key enablers and biomarkers and other things, actually a total of 50 deals that we conducted in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>This was the scorecard at the beginning of last year, and you can see where we've got to our main growth, fully met at 10% rather than 9% is usually what we talk about as high single digits, up to eight, nine, but there we are. And also as the year went on, really the final one in the final quarter was this glioblastoma submission. The rest we've been walking you through as the year has gone on.</p>
          <p>To the total sales, this was the sixth consecutive year for a double-digit growth, excluding Tamiflu. It may be important to say that for Tamiflu itself, over recent years we've now built up that we've sold more than 220 million treatment courses to world governments. That's secured, over those few years, revenues of more than 4 billion on a totally new model to all of us, we had no idea really at the beginning of the journey how this would play out.</p>
          <p>Clearly with the world economic crisis, some governments have eased back even in their interest for this type of activity. But you'll have seen in the last &#x2013; I think it was the 6th of January, the U.K. government announced another award both to Relenza and to Tamiflu, two-thirds to Tamiflu, one-third to Relenza.</p>
          <p>And we also have built into our budgeting guidance as we have the U.K. business, new orders from Japan. You can see here, pro memoria, the quarterly growth in both at the divisional level and also in Roche Pharma. So, I think solid growth across the four quarters. And this resulted in the 36.1 for a 0.6% improvement in the operating margin. It doesn't seem so many years ago that we embarked on the course from 19%, or up towards 25. We're at 36, certainly a top tier performance.</p>
          <p>And in the individual one-on-ones I've had with you over the recent years as we improved on these activities. We did &#x2013; when we were talking margins, now, just remind you, one of the discussion points we had was should we just insanely keep building the margin and save ourselves the debt, or should we be investing in pipeline. And to a person you all encouraged us, yes, you should be investing in pipeline. That's the future. Not the amount of money, but the intelligent use of money behind trials, behind trials that have a chance to be differentiated medicine and to keep building the business.</p>
          <p>When you look at the P&amp;L for the year, sales for local growth of 5%, including all the Tamiflu business, you see a cost of sales, virtually no change there, but actually behind it, the COGS and the period cost, period costs are our definition of idle plants, and equipment costs actually came in at minus 8%.</p>
          <p>That's a little bit greater as a saving than &#x2013; as I mentioned on the conference call in 2007 we had 135 million for the virus at write off. So on that year-on-year comparison we did not have that 135 for this year. But even if you take that out, there is still significant improvement in the cost of goods line.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales also incorporates royalties preferred, profit share with third parties and what have you. But still well contained. If you think that our marketing and distribution, Tamiflu government sales really it's the work of a General Manager or one Commercial Manager with the government.</p>
          <p>The main part of our marketing and distribution invest went behind driving the key brands that achieved the overall 10% growth.</p>
          <p>So, containing the cost here to 2%, I think is a fine job by all my colleagues around the Roche world. That allowed us the investment in R&amp;D. G&amp;A contained at no growth and therefore the overall operating profit moving forward faster than sales.</p>
          <p>Now I have read in some of the reportage since this morning's conference call. We know what we expect from this company is a major cost cutting exercise. Can I just remind you that, 2001, we took out more than 3,000 jobs. We were out of shape; we've completely reshaped the business. And frankly as my first year in the job, I did not want to go through such an exercise again.</p>
          <p>So, you will have seen us consistently year after year, trimming at costs, trimming at factories. We sold another factory this last year in France taking some of those hits, redeploying primary care resource in Europe towards the developing markets of Eastern Europe and to China.</p>
          <p>You should expect us to continue a number of these tasks to intelligently control cost.</p>
          <p>One of the ways of showing this operating efficiency is to look at the last five years. I am focusing in here on Roche Pharma, where you see that our CAGR on head count was at 3%, where on the blue line, the 13% CAGR on the sales and that has resulted as arithmetically easy 9% CAGR on the operating efficiency per head.</p>
          <p>Sorry, I'm getting excited and the microphone is coming off. So a real good improvement in the operating efficiency for my colleagues around Roche Pharma.</p>
          <p>Let's take the different therapeutic areas that we're involved in. With Oncology, it's the virtually 20 billion in sales. You see here 27% growth in Japan, at the top, this was 7% of the revenues bearing in mind that Avastin is a relatively recent undertaking in Japan. Tarceva, a recent undertaking and those products are growing strongly. We have with all monoclonal antibodies and new products there to recruit 3 to 5,000 patients under a pharmacovigilance program, take the data after a certain duration of time to the MHLW and then agree that we can go into a broader commercialization phase. So it's rather constrained to begin with until, from a pharmacovigilance point of view, they feel comfortable and then we can go forward. With Avastin, we've achieved that. I'll tell you later. With Actemra, we're not there, and with Tarceva, we're not yet there.</p>
          <p>In terms of emerging markets within a Europe/Rest of World, there's a 20% growth. We certainly see adoption improving for Herceptin, MabThera and Tarceva, particularly in the Far East. Also within America, with a combination of Genentech and Roche, it's a plus 9%. Typically, the products are about one year more mature in that market than they are in the Rest of World. But interestingly enough, as the penetration for our products like Herceptin have achieved a high penetration rate of the population in the United States for early breast cancer and in Europe, more of the volume growth is coming from the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>If we look at the top brands; top three more than 5 billion in revenues each. MabThera, the principal growth still coming from first-line indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I'll come back to rheumatoid arthritis in a moment. For Avastin in the U.S., as will you have heard from my Genentech colleagues, mostly in metastatic breast cancer this last year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, it was the expansion of the label about February of last year into the broader cohort including oxaliplatin containing regimen and also the metastatic breast cancer indication. Lung is slower at the moment in Europe.</p>
          <p>Penetration of 75% in the top five EU, a bit more than that in America and it is the emerging markets that are also contributing into the growth. For Tarceva, at plus 23% principally in second and third-line non-small cell lung cancer and of course you should expect us to get this first-line maintenance moving forward at the registration dossier now that we're <mark type="inaudible" /> There's a fair part of the increase coming from adjuvant colon cancer. There is some increasing improvement in breast cancer and really the key, the next key milestone for Xeloda will be in the United States, where during this first quarter, we should get the XELOX data on the label. That's the use of Xeloda plus oxaliplatin, which has been one step delayed in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Just to show you here three points that I would like to make on Avastin's take-off. If you look at the performance in first-line, you see that we're getting towards 35% of the first-line patient population and about 25% in second line. So, good penetration so far and a relatively fast take-off. Second point being a bit of an inflection, as you see the data and the expansion of the label last year kicking in. And the third point is that, with 30% of the 25%, plenty more growth to go. So, we're not fully done yet.</p>
          <p>When we look at how the late stage pipeline is shaping up, I've mentioned MabThera in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the REACH study that was filed in January. So that's now with the European authority. I know that Genentech is taking the two dossiers and working on that profiling during this year.</p>
          <p>The HERA study, a number of people had asked towards the end of last year wasn't there an interim analysis coming up and indeed there was and we were just told to carry on. So the good news for the patients is it has not reached its endpoint yet. Maybe the bad news for planning purposes is that it's 2011 before we can actually expect the box to be opened.</p>
          <p>RIBBON-1 filing in 2009 and also the first-line maintenance SATURN and we'll enrich that with the ATLAS data filing this year.</p>
          <p>Looking at inflammation/autoimmune, really a very strong emerging platform here. MabThera as you can see, 450 million was our best estimate a year ago for the revenues post TNF or people intolerant to TNF or not responding to TNF. That's now reached 800 million and we are the leader in that segment of the market. And we've also got the data that comes in, in the early DMARD intolerant &#x2013; DMARD complementary database. This has been submitted by Genentech in the United States. The European authorities wanted also to see the X-ray data. We now have that and that will be a submission this year.</p>
          <p>Building on that, Actemra in the first six months in Japan, 3 to 4,000 patients now in that pharmacovigilance setting. Extremely good results, people like it, doctors like it and that's encouraging. We've just started the journey in Europe with the approval at the end of the year. And so from Germany; now Switzerland, now it will start to roll out across Europe.</p>
          <p>I think one of the key elements here; what we've seen is of the 4,000 patients that were in our Phase III programs, 97, 98% asked to continue with the therapy post submission. Where, on an ethical basis, we continue the medicine until it's available in the given country. And since that time, so we're now about a year to 18 months down the line, only 3% of them have come off the drug. So, there is &#x2013; for those that it works for, they like it and the sustainability to the response. So, I do believe we are on a very good journey here with Actemra.</p>
          <p>Our one disappointment of the year was that with the same database, the FDA pushed back and there were certain questions related to preclinical data. We have no more critical data to perform for them. And they are wanting to see some mice studies that show that the drug does not pass across breast milk into the unborn child.</p>
          <p>Now to any of you that are biologists in the room, you know that the proteins don't do that, they're not they'd really be destroyed in the stomach acid. This is a small molecule, formerly CDER requirement, which when CDER and CBER merged, so the biologicals merged with the drug part, became part of the checklist. And probably on an ethical basis, we argued too long, because really these mice should not be destroyed just to tick the box, that's what we have embarked on.</p>
          <p>So we've got that to do, but in parallel, we will come up with the risk evaluation management program which is part of the new FDA act from '97 and there does need to be a validation of supply chain, there does need to be an educational program for the doctors and a follow through. This is not unique to Actemra. There are other products that are coming through from that division and indeed from the FDA generally, that will require the stronger educational approach and pharmacovigilance approach. This is part of the new reality we have today for the United States.</p>
          <p>CellCept had another strong year with 13% growth, and really the point to make sure is on the radar screen, we do have the patent expiry in the United States in May of this year.</p>
          <p>In virology, starting at the bottom, Tamiflu certainly washing out as previously planned, still actually quite a credible, more than 0.5 billion in sales. Principally last winter's outbreak in America had a high usage of Tamiflu, we had good sales.</p>
          <p>There are in world markets at the moment &#x2013; there's a rogue virus H1N1, which is not sensitive to Tamiflu. The virologists are stumped as we are. There is no logical reason because it's not out of exposure to the drug. However, the other strains that were encountered and in preparation for H5N1 or variant form that could be the basis of the pandemic, WHO is still recommending it, still as valid as ever. And we just give you pro memoria the quarterly sales of Tamiflu seasonal and pandemic.</p>
          <p>Cymevene, still strong double-digit growth in preserving the sight of people who have CMV retinitis as a result of immunosuppressant, principally in today's world in transplantation.</p>
          <p>And Pegasys, where we've been more developing market share. The number of new cases coming forward in the United States and in Europe, mainly Western Europe, are not so great. So it's more a market share battle, we are standing at more than 70% now in the United States with Pegasys versus the other guy. But we are also seeing some good take-off of the product in hepatitis B, principally in those parts of the world; some of Mediterranean Europe and the Far East where hepatitis B is an issue.</p>
          <p>And of course, unlike the oral products that just suppress the virus, there is a real chance of getting  a fuel conversion with Pegasys which improves the outcome. And you've also seen us in the course of the year, achieve a more personalized healthcare approach to this product. Using Roche Diagnostics, we can tell what's the viral load &#x2013; does the patient have hepatitis? After one month, we can tell if they are on the right journey or not. Having done the genotyping at the beginning, if it's genotypes 2 to 4, we can offer them even shorter treatment courses now to get to a good outcome.</p>
          <p>We've also, at the other end of the spectrum, been able to show the people that failed on pegylated interferon, principally the other guy, that was the study that we did, that actually by continuing or treating that group for up to a year, again you can get to a good outcome. So, we are looking at subsets and refining the treatment in a very strong way for them.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we could say while we are on Pegasys, the two oral products earlier in the journey are doing a good job. The one that we are partnering with InterMune and other one with Pharmasset and indeed we are the first company that has got into Phase I, the oral combination of a protease inhibitor and polymerase inhibitor, trying to get some proof of concept. This has been much talked about in the &#x2013; with the medical circles, we will try and see what does this do.</p>
          <p>Outlook, pro memoria, you know it better than I do. We have a low exposure to patent expiries in the next few years. CellCept in the U.S. is the one that's upcoming.</p>
          <p>Quite a lot of food for growth as we roll out these approved indications for our key assets and also enrich it with some of the potential approvals coming up.</p>
          <p>A lot the work that we're doing, and the growth that we saw comes by the initiation of these 12 Phase III programs that we had last year. And on a single line here, you've got a study on 15,000 patients through to a mortality/morbidity outcome study.</p>
          <p>When I looked, and I think it was one of the questions Alexandra was asking earlier about just the degree and size of the programs in our Sustainability Report, sheer number of patients on drugs, two years ago, we had under -- it was about 166,000 patients involved in clinical trials in Roche products. This last year 2008, it was 235,000 patients on drugs. So, it's a huge amount of clinical work.</p>
          <p>Now, in areas like oncology, some of the clinical work also is part of marketing as well, the clinical experience, the further endorsement, the reassurance, the understanding.</p>
          <p>We will have up to 10 potential Phase III starts this year. I'm not saying that all of them will jump the hurdle. We need to see what the Phase II data looks like; we need the usual discussion with the regulatory authority. But we do have some interesting assets upon which to make decisions this year.</p>
          <p>From our IGF-1R that's in Ewing's sarcoma, through &#x2013; we have already taken the decision for the armed antibody of Herceptin, that's T -DM1 to go into &#x2013; we're in Phase III at a late stage of the cancer. Glioblastoma first-line will certainly be a post approval commitment from the authorities for getting into brain cancer, and so it goes on.</p>
          <p>There's a number of others where we've interesting points to discuss, including Aleglitazar, our PPAR &#x3B1;-&#x3B3;; which the clinical result was terrific. It's still a PPAR, and so we have to decide is there a way through here? And if so, how and what is it that's intelligent to do.</p>
          <p>And I'll finish again with the scorecard. This will be our tracker as we go through this year with you. On the major clinical data, that will be coming up on the key filings, one of which is already got a tick against it, CLL relapsed with the REACH study, and that we are signaling above market, mid single-digit in local currency.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to pass across to J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer to take you into the Diagnostics Division. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Diagnostics Division continued its strong sales momentum, growing 10% in local currencies. Once again, this was faster than the IVD market growth, which is estimated to around 5%.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit margin decreased 5.3%, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, lower diabetes sales and the increased investments in the business. These investments however, had contribute to our top line sale. Three main drivers of our growth were a strong increase in the number of instruments placed, the key of all growth, the number of important product launches of both new tests and new automated systems, along with the strategic acquisitions made in 2007 and 2008. These investments will continue to drive our growth in 2009 and onwards.</p>
          <p>2008, the Diagnostics Division recorded sales of 9.7 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 10% in local currencies. Professional Diagnostics, Applied Science and Tissue Diagnostics continued to drive growth with all three clearly outperforming their markets. Diabetes Care declined 1% for the year due to continued strong competition and price pressures particularly in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics had a good 5% growth also in a strongly competitive market. Tissue Diagnostics grew 23% in local currencies on a standalone basis for the year and contributed around 4% to the overall growth.</p>
          <p>All regions contributed to our growth with a particularly strong contribution from Japan and the emerging markets. The established market in North America and EMEA also grew above their market.</p>
          <p>Despite a strong double-digit increase in sales, our operating profit margin declined from 17.6% at the end of 2007 to 12.3% of sales. While cost of sales increased primarily due to amortization of product intangibles along with some one-time charges due to our acquisitions over the last two years.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had a strong increase in instrument and interplacement to expand market share. Both M&amp;D and R&amp;D increased due to investments made to develop the acquired businesses as well as increase the investment to strengthen Diabetes Care. On the other side, G&amp;A decreased by 4%, as a result of a number of programmes aimed at the rationalizing of the business.</p>
          <p>As you can see, over half of the decline is due to the impact of recent acquisition. The rest of the decline is due to increased investments to further drive the ongoing businesses, along with portfolio mix effects and the lower contribution from Diabetes Care.</p>
          <p>To offset this, we have implemented a number of actions aimed at cutting costs and improving the profitability of the business. Examples include, nearly in &#x2013; nearly all organizations, we now have a zero base budgeted process. As of September, we have in place, a head count freeze and we have initiated several efficiency programs aimed at reducing cost of goods. With these and other measures we plan to improve our profitability, while still insuring that we continue to invest in the business for continued strong growth.</p>
          <p>Now looking into details of the business areas. The main growth driver behind Professional Diagnostics continues to be immunoassays with 19% growth for the eighth consecutive year.</p>
          <p>This is due to strong placements of the cobas 8000 and 4000 systems along with a continued uptake of our new assays, the number of which are first to market. And here you see a list of some of new assays that we launched in 2008, as well as those we plan to launch in 2009 do not only close gaps in our manual, but also allows us to enter new market segment.</p>
          <p>Roche now has one of the leading menus on one platform keeping us ahead of the competition. This will continue to drive both system placements and reagent sales and strengthen our leadership in the largest IVD market. The Diabetes Care business declined to continued competition and pricing pressure particularly in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>New products such as the Accu-Chek Aviva and Performa had double-digit growth and had to offset the decline in the sales of the older products which now represent less than 30% of sales. We have also taken strong actions to return this business area to growth. We have strengthened our sales force both in number and in training and support to increase our commercial presence. We have initiated programs aimed at reducing our costs to compensate for the pressure on prices.</p>
          <p>Within manufacturing for example, such programs have already started to reduce our cost of goods. Over the coming months, we will launch a series of new products to increase our competitiveness in market segments where we currently have a low presence or there is an unmet need.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to announce that Molecular Diagnostics returning to growth with the impact of the expiry, the foundational PCR patents almost washed out.</p>
          <p>Virology continued growing due to automated real-time PCR platforms with the FDA approving our automated HCV and HBV tests.</p>
          <p>Within weeks of approval, several large U.S. laboratories, signed new contracts for viral load testing. The FDA also approved our multiplex HIV, HCV, HBV tests for blood streaming. So, now we have a more competitive offering in the important U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Applied Science continues to outgrow the Life Science markets with 19%. Sales of DNA sequencing product nearly doubled due to the ultra-fast Genome Sequencer FLX with a new titanium software which increases wave length five times. And microarray systems contributed to the growth with the launch of new high-density arrays which are faster and more cost effective than conventional math method.</p>
          <p>And as you know, we completed the acquisition Ventana in February '08 which formed a new business area, Tissue Diagnostics. Integration is completed and I am pleased to report that strong and focused sales execution has ensured no slowdown in growth. Commercial initiatives are well under way to expand the business in new markets in Europe and Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, 2008 was a busy year with important launches in each of the business areas. 2009 is no less busy with a number of new platforms and innovative tests that will further strengthen our offering to our customers and we will continue to drive our business.</p>
          <p>Due to this, the outlook for the Diagnostics Division for 2009 to continue to grow above the market in local currencies. And ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that Roche is the clear number one in in-vitro diagnostics with 20% market share which is about 8 percentage points more than our next competitor.</p>
          <p>While focused on improving efficiencies in the laboratory combined with producing products that offer a clear medical value, we aim to stay number one and continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>With that, I want to thank you and &#x2013; over to Erich.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xFC;rgen. Ladies and gentlemen, it's good to be with you here. Several years ago, here in London, when sales lines were growing double-digit and when Tamiflu pandemic was in the upswing, we promised you that we would not fall into the trap, actually to trust in the wind shadow of this sales uptake, grow the cost structures. And if you look at the left of this picture, which I've repeated from Bill, I think you'd see that we have very moderately grown the head count and have tried to be proactive.</p>
          <p>On the right side, you have the factors influencing the financial situation of the Group below the operating profit and I will address all these points in detail. But still the operating profit situation, I think altogether if you look at it percentage-wise, it is going definitely into the direction where we see a hi-tech health care company going. Of course you can say we have a very specific product portfolio for instance, at the customer end. So it's logical that our M&amp;D cost should be at the lower end of the industry percentage-wise, but I think what has been achieved is really the result of a very, very intensive effort of re-shifting the &#x2013; the resources from customer support organizations in the mature market into the emerging and growing market.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales, again as a group on the control of course, as you have seen, as we have profit sharing agreements, which are successful. Bonviva for the first time was $1 billion product. This actually then is reflected in higher shares of profit sharing with our partners.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, and this sticks out and I've addressed it this morning and it's really worth a reflection. If you think that now Roche with this figure in 2008 is the number two of all companies in all sectors in Europe standing the second most after Nokia.</p>
          <p>I think and again I'm repeating that it's not a matter of league tables here, not at all, but isn't it to a certain extent worrying that we are growing not only in this position, not only because we continue to invest, but because everybody else is copying that from innovations. And of course this has short-term benefits, but it's also a little bit worrisome that we are coming to the lead also in our industry worldwide now with innovation spending, because everybody else is copying that.</p>
          <p>And I think you have seen and Bill is ready to answer any questions then in his break-out session on Pharma that's its not us wanting to spend money just on innovation. The good news is that there are more and more attractive new chemical and this is our molecular entities and products coming into late-stage of development.</p>
          <p>What we tried to &#x2013; bring attention to you and we really try and we're also very positively impressed this morning how many of you were in our website to download the data with the tools we are offering to you. This is encouraging us a lot. I mean, my team is putting a lot of efforts behind this, but when we can see that it works and that you &#x2013; I think the first person was 7:02 -- was in there downloading the figures. That's very motivating for everybody. Because people say, yes, they use it. But it's not everything that we can give you there spreadsheet-wise. And that's why we then try to be helpful with these kinds of explanations.</p>
          <p>And especially, this part here was a big surprise for many of you. You were really highly impressive from our side how you predicted the impact of U.S. dollars and euro on our results, but the fact and it's really &#x2013; we went several half years back now, the fact that all currencies, almost all currencies have depreciated against the Swiss francs is very unique. Usually, all the various vectors of all these currencies here have actually added themselves out, so that the impact was not very strong.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the financials. And here again I respect it was very difficult to predict the second half year. And I will come to the 609 on a special chart. But what you can see is, if we compare 2007 with 2008, you see of course the fact that we have gone out of equities almost totally into '07. In hindsight, it might be considered the right move, because we realized profits on all these equities. But then you have always these effects at year-on-year, you're missing this 180 million. But if you go through the other elements, this is a logical one. We have constantly reduced our debt load, so the interest expenses of course logically have to go down. So we have improved.</p>
          <p>But I think that's also a special work. I don't know how many of you are a little bit close to hedging. And especially in the second part of 2008, hedging costs just exploded. Especially for anything which is not the common currencies like U.S. dollar, euro and maybe yen. But if you want to hedge the Turkish lira or Brazilian real and so this is really challenging. And the fact that we did better than actually 2007 in a much more volatile environment, I think should also give you some confidence that we are trying to be up on these things.</p>
          <p>So this leads to 609 and again here, I mean on the average in 2007, the year before 2008, the Group had 24 billion in Swiss francs to be invested.</p>
          <p>Last year in 2008, it was just 20 billion around. So we had 4 billion less to be invested. And what you have seen in the second half year, we almost got nothing for investing the money. And at the risk of repeating myself again, in the second half year, you will understand, in many occasions it was more a question to whom do we entrust our 20 billion? Do we get the money back, then, how much we can actually get on this money.</p>
          <p>So, this is this effect here. And then you have of course these two elements, where we have occurred losses. And here, there are elements that in &#x2013; that if you go and look what kind of currency distribution that all cash and marketable securities had at the beginning of last year and at the end of last year, you would see a very clear move from euro and Swiss francs in to the U.S. dollars which is logical. We want to have U.S. dollar available. This means of course, if we for instance, in July or August have sold a euro bond in this market environment that we have occurred a certain a loss on this bond. But on the other hand, we had the opportunity to turn this euro at a very attractive rate into U.S. dollar and get the money ready.</p>
          <p>So the positive effects, you don't see anywhere, you just see the percentage of U.S. dollars we have ready on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, logical development; Genentech continues to improve their share on the profit and since their tax rate is high, it drives the overall tax rate up. They had some good effects on their own tax rate which was counter balancing this mix profile, profile debt, Chugai, no impact. And then a very nice element on the Roche core, where with of course, 10.1%, we are really at the low end and here I made the comment and I have make it that about 1 to 1.5% of this was a one-time effect which you please do not just extrapolate into the future, but the rest of the tax rate here is solid for the future.</p>
          <p>This brings everything together, from sales into net income and I think, yes, this was a record year with 1.6 billion more in Tamiflu pandemic sales which all &#x2013; then also improved of course down to the net income line, but we still consider the 10.8 billion we realized in a rather challenging environment also from the currency situation, quite a good result which was achieved by our 80,000 co-workers around the globe.</p>
          <p>If we go to free cash flow, I mean you'd see very clearly where the cash comes from. The operating free cash flow is actually $12.4 billion and the major part coming out of Roche Pharma and Genentech. If you then deduct the taxes and dividend, you come to a free cash flow of five billion, and you would see that we have invested heavily last year by closing the Ventana transaction, bringing them into the Group, several Piramed and others in the Pharma field and not to be forgotten, we have increased our stake in Chugai by 9.9%.</p>
          <p>So, we used up the free cash flow actually for these activities, which means that we had slightly lower situation of the net cash at the end of the year, you have it's here, altogether and you have of course the detailed chart of fixed rates down in the annex of the presentation.</p>
          <p>If you go into the Roche legal entity column, you then see that we have paid down almost all our debt. Roche have no bank debt left, Roche have just two bonds left, and one is called Chameleon and this will be paid back by the end of July this year. And this will leave us then with just U.K. sterling bond, which runs another 22 years.</p>
          <p>Equity changes, the typical development, dividend of equity, net income and then various effects which all by then, you don't just find that's one figure, is somewhere in the financials. Because it's &#x2013; all of them are certain delta. I mean, this, we always have to point out, if we increase our ownership in a subsidiary, which we already majority controlled, this is a so called step-up acquisition. So, everything we pay there goes directly against equity and you have here two elements, which are of course the 9.9% of Chugai increase, but what many of you maybe instinctively do not see why. Ventana was closed in two steps. So, the first step, we acquired a clear maturity of Ventana and some weeks later, we acquired 100%.</p>
          <p>So, the second step of the transaction was so-called step-up acquisition, which then showed up here. And it will not surprise you if all currency almost have depreciated against the Swiss franc, then all these assets around the globe of the Roche Group mirrored in Swiss franc look smaller and that's why we have these effects on the equity side here, but still a very strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Dividend payouts, in 22 years, Roche has increased the dividend and we have last year committed that over the next three years, so this is the first year, we are committed to increase the payout ratio. You'll see the effects here and I repeat it here that we are not moving away from this commitment, so we have two more years left of this commitment from now on.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to the objectives which in the interest of Q&amp;A time, I don't think I have to read and repeat again.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Michael Leuchten from Deutsche. Just going back to the chart that you both have shown, what strikes me is the linear shape of the curve, when you look at the revenues per employee. I would have thought, in theory, that should be exponential and how far is that a reflection of your attitude currently to be willing to add infrastructure to the company and forego potential leverage within Roche Rx and how long do you think that's acceptable until you actually want to drive efficiency more aggressively within that part of the business where you have control?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not 100% sure whether I got the question right. Are you referring to Genentech specifically or are you referring to the Group overall?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Roche Rx.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Bill, you if you want to take it right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael. I think what you've seen in these last five years is a number of different issues that play out too, and I was trying to give that as an overall summary. For example, Herceptin in early breast cancer. If you have a breast cancer field force dealing with Herceptin, you don't need more resource to get the exponential sales that are going to come from that early breast cancer setting where there's twice as many patients as in the metastatic setting. So, some of it is mix and organic.</p>
          <p>But for example, over the last five years, we've taken out about 10% of the manufacturing head count, and that journey is not over. And that's as we move from small molecules, large factories with tablet production and needing more in injectables, less in that sort of the facility. You saw it's also a part of the Genentech transaction, announcing the closure of the factory in Nutley, New Jersey. So, we do not in any way allow just head count to keep going forward.</p>
          <p>In the marketing and distribution area, over the last three years, we've reduced 5,000 people in North America, Europe. But we've effectively put about the same head count back into Latin America, Eastern Europe, China and so on. So, it's always thoughtfully done. It is not just a matter of allowing it to go and we will continue to chip away at it. As sales growth, maybe of the world market, slows down a bit, it's not &#x2013; you don't get the double leverage. You only get the leverage out of what you are doing yourself.</p>
          <p>If behind the question is this idea that Roche is sitting on an infrastructure and is just waiting for one of these dramatic announcements of some of our peer group. I've tried very hard to make sure that we don't get to that overheated position. And to make sure that we are &#x2013; after all, we've come from what 19, 20% growth in that Roche Pharma business to over 30, over the course of the last six or seven years and some of that's mix and some of that's efficiencies and we've sold about 40 or 50 factories.</p>
          <p>Informatics, we are really diligently chipping away at. We've got centers that are supporting informatics in Spain, in Warsaw, lower cost centers. We've outsourced some of the back office transactional work in Europe to Budapest. We've taken some of the transactional work in our development organization to India. So, there is a huge amount of work looking for operational efficiencies that is day and daily in the divisions. So, I don't see a future high inflection point, if anything it's softening out of that. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add from a Group perspective in terms of acquisitions, you see in the industry, a lot of acquisitions ongoing and normally it's combined with a big cost-cutting exercise. That is certainly not the way we pursue acquisitions. If you look at our smaller and medium-sized acquisitions which we did also over the last year, Ventana is one example. The other acquisitions which we did in Pharma. We see those acquisitions as growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We do the cost-cutting as we need to do it along the way, anyway. I don't need to acquire another company to do cost-cutting. We see acquisitions as growth opportunities and as such, what's happened is that initially we might even put more money into it. I've read many comments this morning on why has the Diagnostics margin gone down. And behind that question is a deeper question, if you now integrate the infrastructures of Diagnostics and Ventana, you should have cost saving.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, we've spent 3.8 billion Swiss francs for Ventana, and do you honestly believe that the first thing we will do is cut the costs. What we did on the contrary was we invested into this business. We drove the R&amp;D, we drove the pipeline forward and, I am glad to say this today, it paid off. We have an enormous growth, almost twice the market with already a very strong position. And we do further invest into R&amp;D. Of course, there's always possibilities to improve efficiency. But we do invest outside of the U.S., in the case of Ventana, into the corporate product pipeline. We do the same with acquisitions, we do in Pharma and if we come to Genentech, I've heard the question over and over again over the last six months, your $800 million, this is much too low.</p>
          <p>It is not too low, because the rationale of Genentech is growth, it's innovation and there are, of course, cost efficiencies, and we will seize them but they are limited. They are limited because the organizations already today are very complementary if it comes to research, development, even on the commercial side, we have the sales forces operating in different franchises. So, we will not make sales people redundant. We said this in July already and I'd like to repeat it here again.</p>
          <p>Our policy of acquisitions is for growth, for innovation, strengthening our core businesses. It is not just acting top line and then stripping out everything below. We have further questions. I think, Alexandra, second row here.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. I have just a general question. I don't know who wants to answer it. Compared to two years ago, are you more confident or less confident in your long-term growth outlook? You could say more confident because your R&amp;D spend is going up, because you're having all these wonderful Phase III opportunities which you have to bring home now or less confident because growth is so much more expensive because return on R&amp;D is declining as the regulators require longer and simply more trials? That's the first question and I have a couple of Diagnostics questions after that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you want to start off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Good, philosophical one, Alexandra. When I look at the programs that are running and the programs that are coming through into Phase II and that's the decisions that we'll be having to make for Phase III and indeed the ones we have made for Phase III, I'm enormously encouraged. I think we are on a very good path. And the intriguing part is that to many of the folk in this room and having come through in your workplace that the financial disaster is there. I understand there is a bit of downbeat mentality. And to find a company that is actually going countercyclical to the rest of the industry that's trying to save itself to death is also intriguing.</p>
          <p>But, I don't fundamentally -- the people that have been saying for the last year, "Oh! the Pharma model is dead." I don't believe it's dead at all. What is intriguing and has been part of the approach for a number of years now, and maybe we were encouraged early because of the Herceptin experience, are being prepared for smaller patient audiences with more clinical differentiation and being able to look society in the eye and ask for the business.</p>
          <p>These are hurdles that we practice day in daily. This last year, when we stopped one of our programs, <mark type="inaudible" /> in the DPP-IV space, there were a number people that I met one-on-one who did not believe that we would turn off a product that looked clean and looked efficacious.</p>
          <p>We turned it off because it wasn't differentiated enough to get into that market area to my way of thinking and to my colleagues from the Pharma Executive Committee because to ask for some form of differentiated price, you need strong data. And if anything, what's playing out in world markets today makes me even more encouraged that we're doing the right thing. If you don't set the clinical hurdle high, then why should society move the treatment algorithm in our direction, why shouldn't they just take advantage of generics or whatever is cheap and cheerful around.</p>
          <p>So, the days of me-too-ism marketed like hell are over. You need strong clinical differentiation and then you need to do what's right to get the change in the marketplace for that. So, I'm &#x2013; in my passionate way here, very encouraged, that for the mid-term, we are building this business.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>More or less. Maybe different projects but I am an optimist by birth, it's genetically in there. So, I am probably more optimistic.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then three quick questions on Diagnostics. The first one, just to clarify, you said you had the measures in place to improve the margins, are we actually going to see improving margins this year? The second question is about a year ago, did you actually expect that 5% point decline in the Diagnostics margin? And the third point is that I would like to get a bit more color on this sort of the schematic charge about 50% coming or the half coming from the acquisition and half coming from other effects because I can really only see the intangibles in the Ventana inventory by itself which is significantly less than half. If you could just help me here a bit more to understand that acquisition -- contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to your first question. It is more than 50%, it is 60% and we have not acquired only Ventana, also 454, NimbleGen, HCV. So, there are some one-time events and of course, there's goodwill and it will continue but it will wash out.</p>
          <p>So, we are expecting already an improvement of the profitability this year. The 5%, one year ago, yes, we were. No, it was not so clear when the Ventana deal was closed. So, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean what is certainly the case is that we were disappointed about the development over diabetes. If you would have asked me one year ago whilst I was standing here, I would have argued for a growth in Diabetes Care and what we have seen is a flat development.</p>
          <p>And in Diabetes Care, you have an immediate drop to the bottom line if the sales are not coming in. So, clearly, Diabetes Care was below expectations. There's no doubt about it. On the other hand, it was overcompensated by a performance above expectations, not only in Ventana but also in Professional Diagnostics and also very much in Applied Science.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I am more confident as we go into 2009. I think we are launching four new products in diabetes which should provide us with growth as we go forward. But certainly on the Diabetes Care side, if you would have asked me 12 months ago, I would have been more bullish and probably a bit more cautious on the other parts in the Diagnostics business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Kevin Scotcher from Liberum Capital. Firstly, I want to congratulate you on the level of disclosure, because it actually allows me to ask my question. It goes really to this issue of investment and growth in innovation. I did some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations. Your operating cash flow return on net operating assets in Diagnostics was 7.8% in 2007 and it declined to 3.6% in 2008.</p>
          <p>They, to me, look like margins below the cost of capital. How long do you think shareholders should put up with returns below the cost of capital in order to finance growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I remind you that it took us 10 years to get Genentech profitable? We bought Genentech, the majority of Genentech in 1990, and it turned profitable in 2001. Now my question for you is, should we have bought Genentech or not?</p>
          <p>May I remind you that in the beginning of the '90s, in '91 we bought the PCR patent for U.S. $300 million, the stock price went down, everybody was saying they're completely stupid, they are buying a technology that has not a single product out there. It took us years before we launched the first product. Today, we have a franchise of over 1 billion in Molecular Diagnostics based on this technology. It took us a decade to come to this point.</p>
          <p>When we put down 3.8 billion for Ventana, I didn't expect to satisfy your operating cash flow return on the assets in year one. That was a strategic acquisition. That was an acquisition for the long-term and that is how we developed the business. We are not looking in our investments of whether this pays back in one year or whether it pays back in two years or even three years. We are looking into investments which make strategic sense for the long-term and that is what you see reflected in Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Ventana was the biggest acquisition, but there was a number of add-ons which completed our portfolio and which also allowed us to work closer between Pharma and Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>But building on your point, of course, this type of return, this type of operating cash flows, free cash flows are not at the level where we want to remain. We do this investment so that they pay off in the long-term, but not in year one.</p>
          <p>Here in the third row please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Philip <mark type="inaudible" /> from Natixis Securities. A broad question maybe again about the long-term, because if we look at your slide, the first three, and do the same calculation on 2010, I think  the new  Phase III and thinking that many of the Phase III that begins  in '09 will be full year 2010. We can imagine from the same argument that R&amp;D will be increasing in percentage in 2010. That will be the case and basically, I mean you're asking your shareholders to have a second year of less earnings, when will the long-term come? Will it be 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now of course it is difficult to predict in R&amp;D how exactly the cost will play out in the long-term, because as Bill pointed out, we take the opportunities as they come. And if there are opportunities, then we invest into it. If we wouldn't have a late stage development project, we wouldn't invest into it. So a lot depends also on how many of these projects will actually go into Phase III. For some of them, the decisions are still pending and that is the very reason why we give the guidance for one year and not for two or three years.</p>
          <p>The guidance for 2009 in fact is that we will have an over-proportional growth in R&amp;D and this is one of the reason, which leads to a more moderate development of the EPS. So, I'm not in a position to give you a guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>We had a question in the second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent Meunier, Exane BNP Paribas. Three questions please. The first one is on the PPAR &#x3B1;-&#x3B3;. Can you please give us the criteria and the timing for the go/no-go decision for Phase III?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Actemra. Can you give us an update on the U.S. sales force and any plan to divest here waiting for the FDA's final approval expected in H2 2010.</p>
          <p>And the final question is with regard to diabetes. Can you give us any idea of the potential incremental cost linked to the launches to take place in 2009, because you told us that you want to  fuel growth but that would come at a price with regards to the operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I was actually referring to the R&amp;D investments, to our late stage development investment, less so to our expenses in marketing and development. Perhaps Bill if you could take up the specific question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So sure. With PPAR &#x3B1;-&#x3B3;, clearly with the questions that have been raised over the role of the PPARs in diabetes, we have to be thoughtful here. We see differentiation that was played out between Actos and Avandia in the market and in the clinical utility. So we don't embark upon it lightly. The intriguing thing is, when we've shown our Advisory Board the influence that it has on some of the dimensions of diabetes and of heart and of lipids, they are absolutely intrigued with the molecule. We probably find that the cardiologists are more excited that the diabetologists. So, we're trying to look at approaches where the real key benefits that we have here, it may be again to a subpopulation that we're looking at to go for rather than the broad market. That would also give us a more focused development program. We probably would need some form of outcome study, but in a more focused way.</p>
          <p>So we're being &#x2013; that's what we're being thoughtful about there. Some of these approaches are being discussed with the health authorities to enrich the debate and also with some of the specialists in the field, and then I expect the project team to come back and we'll have the right discussion. So that was on that one.</p>
          <p>On Actemra, yes, we have a specialist field force in the United States and we continue with that field force. Interestingly enough, they are at the moment contributing into Bonviva -- Boniva activities and that specialization we will need, so we will continue with that. There are no layoffs at all planned.</p>
          <p>And then finally it was on diabetes. And here with our GLP-1 again a lot of this is going to depend on the way in which the competitive landscape shapes up. Whether we're in the sheer share of voice market or whether still the majority of the patients are going to be driven by the endocrinologists and the follow through in primary care, we're principally talking the United States here. We have the infrastructure in other countries and we have a very good basis for the infrastructure in the United States with the Bonviva field force. So I don't see a drama here at all. I think we just need to be thoughtful. In 2009, in pre-marketing terms you don't need all the foot soldiers; you need a number of people that are doing the right preparatory work that we can enter in with conviction to the area. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Turner from Mirabaud Securities. In Diagnostics, if you exclude the Ventana acquisition in Swiss francs, and sales went backwards, and you talked about 2009 outperforming the market. I wonder whether you might be able to speculate on whether you see the market growing or contracting in 2009.</p>
          <p>A further question in regards to Chugai, which assuming the fourth quarter and the numbers that you've given on slide 19 by the recent Tamiflu effect that the growth is relatively systemic given what you talk about as being a strong launch of oncology drugs in Japan. I wonder whether you might make further comments on the situation in Japan and whether or not there are tell products at Chugai that are declining at what would appear to be an accelerating rate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. J&#xFC;rgen, you take the Diagnostics question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we deduct Ventana, that's true, then we are coming from 10 to 6% and our core main competitors published their year-end figures last week. It's from 3, 3.5, 4.5 to 7%. So all in all, the market grew around about 5%. So, we clearly outgrowed the market. What we are expecting for '09 is that the market growth will a little bit slowdown I think, it will be something between 4 and 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Nick, if we take Chugai, then a couple of things to say on the development in Japan and I'm just looking for the right chart number for you. It would be page 60 or chart 67 in the handout would be relevant for you. But let me lead you into that. This last year, from the beginning of the year, products were reverted to sanofi-aventis and this was somewhere between 90 and CHF100 million worth of products that reverted to sanofi-aventis. So that was one key dimension.</p>
          <p>The second one was the normal price reductions every second year that took place in Japan, March, and that played out. And the third element has been the continuing competitive nature of the erythropoietin market in Japan from a couple of dimensions. One, the launch of Aranesp or NESP as it's branded there from Kirin. That's been a strongly competitive race. We have lost a bit of market share over the course of the year in Japan, not a drama but a bit. But there has been a lower sales or lower pricing per unit because of the competition and also the changed reimbursement system in Japan where people are given a fixed sum to look after all the dialysis treatment, has meant more competition within the pricing of erythropoietin.</p>
          <p>So, you have those playing out and they still played out through the quarters of the year. But if you look on page 19 as well, you will see that Chugai for the four quarters was minus 23, plus 2, minus 1 and now plus 5. So, what I see between that shape and that it's getting a bit better towards the year-end and the growth that you see for the key products, indeed when you look at these three &#x2013; the buckets on 66, 7, Japan is now getting featured more and more systematically in our top products. And there is 200 million of MabThera, there is 200 million of Avastin, there is 250 million of Herceptin. So it's the Roche products that are coming in nicely, to fill out the portfolio in Chugai. So, I think as we go into 2009 that will play out, we'll have washed out some of the historic price reduction and the sanofi products. There will be a bottoming out more in the EPO market and the growth will start to kick in. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question here in the first row, and then we'll come back to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Peter McDougall from Druganalyst. I think you will agree with me, it's a pretty tough day. We are looking at the Roche share price, it's down 10%. There's quite a lot of disappointment. This obviously happened this morning seeing your figures. At the close of play last night, the median forecast for your core EPS was growth at 11% in 2009, so your comments today saying that it's going to be flat despite R&amp;D and whatever else, it's tangible the disappointment that's in the room. I just wondered if I could ask you the question what do you think we got wrong because on this side of the table we obviously got something wrong when we are looking at Roche now. I just wondered whether for 2009, somebody could talk me through what you think that I got wrong or you think the market got wrong, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Interesting question. I mean, if I look back at the guidance we gave you in February 2008, we said that we would grow EPS at least on the record level of the previous year. If you tell me that the consensus was 15% against a growth of 6% in local currencies for the Group overall if you include Tamiflu then your expectation was that EPS would grow twice as fast as sales. Now, I can't fit this together.</p>
          <p>We have given guidances in earlier times where we said that for example EPS was in line with sales that would have brought it only to 6%. You know that throughout the year we did not change the guidance. We stick to it. You know that in the past, when we gave the guidance at the beginning of the year, and the situation went more positive, we upgraded our guidance, we didn't do this. So that's an interesting question you asked me. We say the guidance is at least at previous year's level and you assume a EPS growth which is twice as fast as sales. Honestly, I don't get it together either.</p>
          <p>Yes please, fourth line over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Justin Smith from MF Global. I'm was just trying to tie in your comments about Genentech earlier in terms of the long-term profile that you weighted there. Just thinking about Chugai, with some of the challenges that Bill mentioned, how long do you think we should wait to be making a fair judgment about the Chugai deal in terms of it's working the way that you want it to work given that it was acquired a number of years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you referring to a change in the capital structure or &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really I just I mean me personally &#x2013; I know that the oncology sales in Japan are now starting to improve and I know the markets are different. But I just was wondering, interested to see how much longer you feel we have to wait on that deal, to really start to see the benefits come through given that the emphasis today is very much on your investing for the long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean Chugai boosted our position in Japan. The Japanese market is a difficult one, and as Bill has elaborated in more detail, we had a number of special effects coming through in 2008, in particular of course the unexpected return of the Sanofi products back to the principal. And we are facing a really tough competition in the EPO market.</p>
          <p>Now our position is that those effects should wash out and we remain confident that we get more traction in the Japanese market. But even though the relative price of Japan has dramatically decreased versus the overall pharmaceutical market over the last decade in fact, it is still the second biggest market in the world and it is still a market that we're very committed to and we do believe that with all the products which are coming through from the Roche pipeline into Japan, however, delayed, but they will come through eventually, that there is if you like, in a delayed matter, a growth potential, we should have the patience to wait for but maybe we should also make sure that the organization is on the course to seize its potential. But we remain committed to Japan, there's no doubt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you remain confident there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take that when we first did the deal in 2002, we could see a lot of this development work coming. Nippon Roche was number 27 in the Japanese market, Chugai was number 10.</p>
          <p>So, one of our key absolute requirements was for development capacity within Japan to do justice to this burgeoning development portfolio. We would never have got anywhere close to where we are today, if we had just been trying to organically grow and you're in a country where principally you recruit from the universities, it's lifetime employment and there's remarkably little mid-career changing.</p>
          <p>So, this gave us a strong step forward in development capacity. We've seen a dramatic restructuring within Japan, both of focusing on two clear research centers, closing down four or five production sites. So, operational efficiencies that have come through and you're now seeing the principal asset that was in late stage development of Chugai, reach world markets in Actemra.</p>
          <p>And there's also one or two of the earlier molecules that we've opted in. So, I do think that this is certainly well on track and I'm not at all disappointed by the progress that we've have made today and at the returns to the Group from the investment in Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had another question back there just to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Matthew Epston from Credit Suisse. Two questions, if I could to Erich on financials. The first is really to have very clearly how much losses were booked from the conversion of euro bonds that you owned into dollars, or the sale of them to then allow the money to be moved into dollars in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Can you let us know whether there are more sales of euro assets that you anticipate in the first half of this year that could lead to similar losses if currencies remain in the same place?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you also highlighted the very significant increased cost of hedging and I wondered whether or not that has led to any change in your hedging strategy or what we should expect from hedging and currency movements at Roche going forward into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To the first question, I want to prevent misunderstanding. It was not the full amount, if I got you right, you now were saying the full amount was according to this. This by far was not the case. I mean you know that this figure I showed you includes also all the results from Genentech and if you could take the time to go into their 10-K, you'd see that they have on their own side certain effects in there.</p>
          <p>The one effect I have given you is just part of the overall effect affecting the bond portfolio. I think we are more or less, if you look at the currency structure by the end of the year, we are where we want to be, and I do not see at the moment nature effect which can come on. But in this volatile environment, please respect that I won't give you any guidance on strategic lines and this goes into the forex situation. I mean, what has happened is that certain currency, you just take as they come, because paying hedges is sometimes not even possible anymore, or it's so expensive that it's just not &#x2013; it doesn't make sense.</p>
          <p>So dependent on what's happening in the market, there maybe more volatility, what is to a certain extent still unique, at least from our experience if we compare half year to half year, quite many years backlog that in the second half year of 2008, a lot of things all went into the same direction and nothing was netting itself out.</p>
          <p>So, I'm very sorry, it's not bad will from my side. It's just not knowing exactly what's happening out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We have a question back there, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeanne Whalen from The Wall Street Journal. On the sales growth slowdown that you are expecting for this year, can you explain a bit more what you mean by a more challenging environment other than the obvious world falling apart issue, and also how you expect that environment to affect all of your products, cancer drugs, other drugs, diagnostics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. If you look into the sales development, there are two major effects which can be clearly singled out. One is that our patent for CellCept expired in the U.S. So, that is the effect we already know at that point on the Pharma side. And on the Diagnostics side of course we had a one-time effect with the acquisition of Ventana, which will wash out into 2009. So, those are two specific items we can see at that very point.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the impact of the financial crisis, in fact it has not affected us in any material way up to date. You have also seen that the growth dynamics stayed basically constant also throughout the third and the fourth quarter. It is of course difficult to predict how the governments around the world will if at all, adapt the healthcare policies, how much funds will be available for healthcare within the overall budget. But I do believe that at any rate, with our strategy which is focused on high medical differentiation, we should be much less exposed to whatever happens in the financial market or other industries. So, I am confident that we are relatively little exposed as we go into 2009. Bill you want to add something in particular for Pharma?</p>

          <p>No, I think that's the main theme. What we also reflect when a product like Herceptin gets to 75, 80% of the available patient pool, incremental growth is harder to fight for in those territories. We then are more looking to emerging markets for the growth of products like that, which may be a little bit tougher when people have to pay for the entire cost of the medicine themselves. So, there are some of those elements, which are a combination of penetration of some of the key assets and some of the slowdown in world markets. But it's a composite of good penetration in some products, starting gate as you saw with some of the cancer indications for Avastin, but more to go and CellCept washing out, it's just a mixed effect that we're dealing with here.</p>

          <p>Next question please. Perhaps one in the back again?</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. Two financial questions please. The first one just coming back to U.S. guidance, it seems you have a lot of moving parts in your business and also in your financial results? Yet for the guidance, you have really only given us one number instead of a range. So, I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a feel if a lot of the Phase III's that are currently to be confirmed, don't actually happen in '09 or if the interest environment picks up a little bit? What is sort of a maximum growth level that you could maybe achieve?</p>
          <p>Second question, just on the Diagnostics margins; the launches you mentioned on slide number 45. How big a launch cost could be associated with that? I'm just wondering should we maybe break for another short-term Diagnostics margin dip if there is a lag effect between those launches and a pick-up in sales and operating leverage? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I respect that you are interested in more details on our guidance. However, we don't have the crystal ball either. It's now another 11 months to go for the full year and that's the very reason why we want to stick to our guidance of mid-single digit growth on a Group level and for the two divisions Pharma and Diagnostics without giving more specific ranges at that point of time and the same is true for the EPS guidance. Sorry, Erich you wanted to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just try to add here. You may know that we always monitor very closely the value of our Company by the so called warranted value and the warranted value is nothing more than the build-up of the value actually over the next 30 years. You know that we have a revolving business plan cycle. Every year we really, bottom up, try to get a grip on our future. The interesting thing, and this also goes together with &#x2013; Alexandra was asking of do you see more confidence, be more confident of the future or less.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that we see at the moment more warranted values than we saw some years ago, which I think &#x2013; if you know that warranted value is the discounted future cash flow which should be a good story for you. Interestingly now, we also play all scenarios, and this, I think, you reflected very nicely in your question here. If we would have bad luck in one of these big studies that for certain scientific reason, something would happen, and I please -- I just say that we are simulating these things. Interesting effect would happen; immediately, the very short-term future would look much more attractive. But interestingly, and maybe not surprisingly, the warranted value of the company would go down, partly quite significantly, even that these future cash flows are discounted heavily towards today.</p>
          <p>So, this concept of looking at the warranted value we are building including terminal value, gives us a certain confidence that we should not sacrifice these potential &#x2013; value potentials just for the short-term improvement of certain single indicators.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in another words, we didn't get a more precise guidance on EPS for 2009, but certainly for the share price. Should we get the next question please? There's one here in the front. And then perhaps one more question before we go into the break out session.</p>

          <p>Eric Le Berrigaud, Raymond James. One question first to help us in doing a better job in 2009 than we did in 2008 for estimates. Back on the slide number 13. Could we have to consider the size of the different blocks on the right scale and because, on the red part of it, as you stated this morning that it could be zero or slightly negative. We could expect a downward trend by 250 million, then it's one third of the downward. So the other green part would be twice as big. And then we could pre-tax, we could be around 1 billion. So is it fair to look at that in that way and does that include any currency impact from  --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am afraid that those charts are really illustrative. And you might have noticed that all the parts are very similar size on the positive side as well on the negative side. Sorry, we can't give you more detailed guidance on that. A last question here on the front and then we go into the break-out.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Three quick questions. So the first one is, you mentioned your R&amp;D expenses which should fuel future growth. So what will we required from the infrastructure side, so where do you stand with your CapEx investments basically? Then could you maybe give us just a rough idea of pricing impact on growth in Pharma and Diagnostics in 2008. And then I'd like to take the opportunity to pick up a question that was not answered before I think, that was on Diagnostics. So meaning, what impact could we expect from launch costs on margins in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just may take the first one on the R&amp;D infrastructure before we hand over for pricing to J&#xFC;rgen and Bill and the launch expenses for Diagnostics. Now, by the very nature of the move of our portfolio into late-stage, what we see in particular is development costs going up. So we wouldn't see capital expenditures, we wouldn't see infrastructure going up. We wouldn't see internal head count, fixed costs if you like, going up. It is simply a management of those huge trials which had started during 2008 and which we hopefully can start during 2009. So it is not burdening our current infrastructure, it is a matter of late-stage development costs. First, if I may hand over to you Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. When looking at the pricing impact in this last year of 2008. Despite all the soothsayers saying that this may be a very significant downward pressure, the interesting thing when I look at the Roche figures around the world, we have been able to implement some price increases in some markets. We've had some price erosion on things like Erythropoietin that we've talked about. But the net result is almost zero, it's point something, less than 0.5 negative on pricing, from the formation of all our work around the world and that we've not seen price erosion on our oncology products, is another important point to make.</p>
          <p>So I do think that there has been lot of worry in this room and others about it being draconian and really downward as a pressure, thus far the health economics has held up. I know we're sitting here in London where <mark type="inaudible" /> has some of the more dramatic elements to contend with.</p>
          <p>There is a small bit of breakthrough that you may have seen today and sort of coming out overnight where one of the competing products for Renal Cell Carcinoma has been given reimbursement, given the new ground rules that are taking place for end of life and an easing up of the cost-per-quali.</p>
          <p>At the moment the Avastin data in the same setting is still subject to -- there is a sort of tendency to say, no, we don't want to reimburse it, but there's still lot of discussion to go before that comes to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>So, despite the environment we maybe live in here and the optic from the U.K. certainly worldwide we are in good shape on the pricing front so far this 2008. J&#xFC;rgen?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Diagnostics of course, price erosion will play a role in the various businesses to different extensions, so we dealt with price erosions over the last couple of years. It is one, a little bit more than 1% and I think, this will also continue in 2009, and this will not have an impact, an extraordinary impact on our margin because we increased already marketing distribution expenses, especially in diabetes. So this is all in our marketing and distribution expenses for '09. No extraordinary expenses for the launches.</p>

          <p>For the sake of time I'd like to stop at this point for the questions in the panel and may I ask you to stay in this room for Erich and myself on the strategic questions. Bill will have a breakout for Pharma, J&#xFC;rgen and Burkhard for Diagnostics, and we do have a specific workshop on accounting issues as we go forward. And we'll start in two to five minutes. Thank you very much.</p>
