          <p>Good day and welcome everyone to the Google, Inc. third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Jane Penner, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Penner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management; and Nikesh Arora, President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development. First, Jonathan and Patrick will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter. Then Nikesh will join Patrick and Jonathan to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Also as you know, we recently began distributing our earnings release exclusively through our Investor Relations website, located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.</p>
          <p>Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding Google's future and investments in our long-term growth and innovation; expected performance of our business; and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>Please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are also expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Jane mentioned, Jonathan and I will begin with our prepared remarks, and then Nikesh will join us for Q&amp;A. In addition and as a bit of a surprise, we may actually have Eric join us for the first 30 minutes of Q&amp;A before he has to run to a plane.</p>
          <p>So let me start by giving you some general thoughts before I get into the details of our financial performance for Q3. At the highest level, we're very pleased with our Q3 results. And it's clear that the digital economy continues to grow rapidly, a relentless trend that continues to drive continued growth in both our core business, core search, and creating market and also for fueling momentum in our newer businesses.</p>
          <p>Our Q3 results clearly reflect this phenomenon; that is our continued strong growth in our core business and continued very strong growth in our emerging businesses year over year. And indeed, we saw strength in every major product area in Q3; that is search, display, mobile, as well as apps enterprise.</p>
          <p>And when I say our newer businesses are seeing great momentum, I really mean it. And in that, Jonathan will back that statement up with some hard facts in a few minutes, so stay tuned for the details.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to specific performance in the quarter from a financial perspective. Let's move quickly through the results. Gross revenue grew 23% year over year to 7.3 billion. Our Google website revenue was up 22% year over year to 4.8 billion, with strength, as I mentioned, across most major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year over year to 2.2 billion, again reflecting continued strength in our Google Display Network. Our other revenue was up 35% year over year to 254 million, down sequentially, reflecting the end of our direct-to-consumer sale of the Nexus One.</p>
          <p>Our global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy, up 16% year over year and also up 4% quarter over quarter. Aggregate cost per click growth was up 3% year over year and 2% quarter over quarter. You should note that the FX had a negative impact on CPC growth year over year, but the impact for quarter over quarter was quite neutral. Remember too that this is an aggregate number which includes both Google.com and our AdSense properties.</p>
          <p>So now turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and rest of world are growing at a healthy pace, as our results reflect; but also while the UK continues to lag a little bit in the economic recovery, again seen in our results. Revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year over year to $3.5 billion. And in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK, and rest of world to show you the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.</p>
          <p>International revenues accounted for 52% of our total revenue or 3.8 billion, up 20% year over year, which includes an 89 million benefit from our hedging programs, and that compares to a 39 million benefit for Q3 of last year. If we used fixed exchange rates, our international revenues would have been roughly 169 million higher year over year. The UK was up 10% year over year to 840 million. But actually if using a fixed exchange rate, that number would have been just shy of 20%.</p>
          <p>So now let me turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were 1.8 billion or 26% of total advertising revenue for this quarter. Other cost of revenue was 747, including stock-based compensation of 8 million. And finally, all other operating expenses totaled 2.2 billion, including approximately 372 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year over year in OpEx was primarily due to increase in payroll, professional services, and advertising and promotional spend.</p>
          <p>So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation, increased to $2.9 billion in Q3, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin of 40.2%, essentially the same as last year.</p>
          <p>Headcount was up approximately 1,500 versus Q2. And we ended the quarter with approximately 23,300 full-time employees, of which about 300 came from acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, down from 24% in Q2, and this is mostly because we released certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our 2005 &#x2013; 2006 tax audits, which are now completed.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash management. In the line other income and expenses, it was 167 million for Q3, which includes good progress on our portfolio management performance, although that was slightly offset somewhat by the impact of our hedging expenses associated with FAS 133. For more details on OI&amp;E, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our Investor website.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow, very strong for the quarter at 2.9 billion; CapEx for the quarter was 757 million, again mostly primarily related to our data center operations. And as a reminder, we continue to make significant investment in CapEx, and these have shown to be quite lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to make these investments. So in the end, free cash flow was also very good at 2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I close, I want to say a few words about how we're continuing to grow the business for the long term. And when I say the long term, we really mean not the next quarter and the following quarter, but we're thinking about the next five to ten years.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity in our agenda in both our core and in our emerging businesses. So simply put, we're on this growth agenda at full throttle. We're doing it largely in two ways, if you think about it: continue to invest heavily in people, and also in product.</p>
          <p>In people, it's a pretty simple story. The explosive growth in the digital economy that we're experiencing, it's really created a war for talent in our industry, the digital economy, and one that is quite out of sync with what's happening in the rest of the economy. So we believe this trend is only accelerated in the next 18 months and will continue to accelerate.</p>
          <p>So in context of that, we've stepped up our hiring machine and we are currently exploring how we can continue to attract and retain the very best people in this exceptionally competitive environment. So we strongly believe that the difference between the winners and the losers in our industry will be to a large extent determined by who we can attract and who can retain the best talent. So to that end, we're incredibly proud to have attracted approximately 1,500 people to join Google in Q3, the majority in engineering and sales once again.</p>
          <p>On the product side, our goal continues to be to develop truly innovative products that leverage computer science to solve these incredible problems that we tackle, and offer obviously significant ROI across a number of very large growth opportunities. As I mentioned, Jonathan in a few minutes will be speaking of this great momentum our products are experiencing. And as always, we're investing with discipline, following the Google tradition of being generous but frugal.</p>
          <p>So in summary, very pleased with our performance of Q3 across revenue, margins, cash flow; and we plan to continue to attract, hire, retain the very best talent in the world, wherever they are, to fuel our innovation agenda.</p>
          <p>Now is the moment for me to turn the call over to Jonathan, which usually means that my number part is over. But today I've actually asked Jonathan to share with you, and let me emphasize, on a one-time basis, a few product-specific metrics that I think everybody will be very interested to hear. And as the CFO, I'm usually the official buzz killer, so I need to make it very clear we will not be updating these numbers going forward. We are merely sharing them with you as a proof point of the great momentum we're experiencing in our emerging businesses.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it to Jonathan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Patrick. So I think you guys can see from the financial numbers, we've got tremendous momentum in the core business. But in these emerging businesses, you guys basically have to invoke your Jedi guesstimation skills to try to figure out what's going on. So today, with Patrick's permission, I hope to shed a bit more light on these businesses with some numbers that we've not shared before, but let me start with the core.</p>
          <p>Search is more important than ever. The Internet, as you guys know, continues to explode. There's lots more websites. There's more videos. There's more images. There's more books and news. All this stuff is coming online. And at the same time, more people are coming online too. And what do these people do when they get online? The first thing they usually do is search. So search is still at the heart of the web. And with all of this new content coming online, doing search well is even harder than ever. I actually believe search remains one of the most challenging computer science problems of our generation and probably the next one as well.</p>
          <p>This is why we're so incredibly proud of Google Instant. Many of you guys speculated that we launched Instant to make more money. Let me tell you that's simply not the case. We launched Instant because it's so much better for the user. In fact, from a revenue standpoint, its impact has been very minimal. And from a resource standpoint, it's actually pretty expensive.</p>
          <p>So why did we do it? Well, we believe from a user standpoint, Instant is outstanding, and the data that we're seeing actually bears this out. We took something that no one thought was a problem and we created something that once you use it, you can't recall how you lived without it before. It saves about two to five seconds per search, and users absolutely love it. The percentage of people who select Instant results before they finish their query is steadily rising. So in other words, that means the more they use it, the more they like it. So let me be clear that Instant wasn't based on a narrow financial calculation. We launched it because we could and because it's great for our users, as we've always said.</p>
          <p>Of course, I know it's an earnings call so let me be clear on another point. We do in fact care about money, and search is still the most monetizable moment on the web. And as search gets better, our ads have to keep pace. The good news is, they are. It turns out we also have a lot of great momentum with AdWords, and this is particularly true with the new ad formats.</p>
          <p>On past calls, I've talked about making ads more useful with the new formats like site links and ads with seller ratings and product listing ads, which we think we can see now are starting to have a real impact. These ads appear on more than 10% of the queries where we show ads, and people like them. We see this because click-through rates are up for some formats as much as 10% and up more than 30% on some others.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing great momentum in our newer businesses, and this is where Patrick is letting me give you some big numbers, so I hope you find them useful. The numbers all begin with the letter B. And remember, as I often remind my team at Google, a billion is 1,000 million.</p>
          <p>So the first big number, 2.5 billion, as in display is on an annualized run rate of over 2.5 billion; so that's non-text display, meaning it doesn't count text ads running on our network. What it does count is YouTube ads, non-text ads on the Google Display Network, and of course on the DoubleClick platform. So you guys often ask me, Jonathan, where's the next multibillion dollar business after search? There's your answer. It's display and it's already here clocking in at over a $2.5 billion run rate.</p>
          <p>So clearly we're firing on all cylinders in display. The advertisers are running great branding campaigns. The Ad Exchange is taking off. We're partnering very well with agencies. And of course, more publishers are making more money. And if you want to know more on the display front, Nikesh, who is here, is passionate about this business. He has made enormous strides with the sales force and clients, which I'm sure he'll be happy to talk to you guys about in the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So second big number, 2 billion, as in YouTube is monetizing over 2 billion views per week. That's up over 50% year over year. And when you think about that growth, it's important because the RPMs are really strong on YouTube. We've just launched some new ad formats called TrueView, where the viewers get to choose which commercials to watch or they can even skip watching the ad altogether. It turns out when advertisers only pay for the commercials people watch, we discover the ads are a lot more valuable to advertisers when they're only paying for viewers who have actually chosen to watch them.</p>
          <p>Finally, third big number, 1 billion; Mobile is on an annualized run rate of over $1 billion. This means that people who are accessing our products and services through their mobile phones are adding $1 billion annually to our existing revenue streams. Clearly this is the future of search in the Internet, more people in more countries coming online from these smartphones. Our mobile search queries have grown five times over the past couple of years. And of course, a lot more of those queries are now coming from Android phones.</p>
          <p>So they're the facts that Patrick has let me say just this once: non-text display, 2.5 billion run rate; YouTube, 2 billion monetized views per week; and Mobile, over $1 billion added to our business. And Patrick, maybe I'll ad lib on more one fact here without asking you. You should know all these businesses are growing. So I hope this gives all of you a sense of why we're so excited about the incredible emerging businesses at Google.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll take it back to Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jonathan. Before we take your questions, I just want to add one fact regarding the disclosures that Jonathan just gave you. Obviously, this information reflects our revenues from two different angles of our business. And with it, we recognize in some cases some small overlaps. So for example, the AdMob revenues are obviously included both in the mobile number because it's a mobile product and in display because it's also a display product. So these are very small, but I wish to just clarify it out for everybody.</p>
          <p>So with that in mind, what I'd like to do is turn it over to [Connie] to open &#x2013; and we have Eric with us. So the may is now an actual; Eric is with us. He's got 20 to 30 minutes, then he's running for a plane, so delighted to have you with us, Eric. What I'll do is I'll turn it to Connie for the Q&amp;A questions period. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll take our first question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. I'll ask two separate questions, if I may. The first one, if I look at your paid lead growth, it has been remarkably consistent and not decelerating. I think it was 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2008, 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2009, and 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2010. Is that because your query growth is also fairly consistent, or are you supplementing query growth with monetization initiatives that increase paid lead takeup?</p>
          <p>And secondly and separately, thank you extremely much for disclosing the billions in terms of mobile and display advertising; but within the 2.5 billion plus of display advertising, how do you account for advertisers spending through the DoubleClick Ad Exchange? Is that on a gross or net basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try to take the first question. Certainly the highest correlation between ad clicks and anything else is query growth, so that's going to certainly by far dwarf any other factor.</p>
          <p>I think the other factors that we're seeing is that the new formats that we have, which I've mentioned, certainly drive click growth as well. I mentioned that those formats appear on 10% of the queries. If you try some of those like Halloween costumes, you'll see that they make the ads much more compelling, as do things like merchant ratings if you type in laser printers. So by improving the ad formats, we are increasing the relative number of clicks because the click-through rates go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the other one, the Ad Exchange is included in. So if you think of the elements, the Ad Exchange, the DoubleClick platform, all these are included in display, and it's done on a gross basis. Thank you for your question. Let's go to the next question, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon. I guess since you guys are sharing some numbers this time, I was just wondering if we can delve into the YouTube numbers a little bit. Of the 2 billion views, Jonathan, I was wondering roughly what percentage of the total views is that currently. And then you guys have talked in the past about getting closer and closer to profitability. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of where you are with respect to profitability as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On profitability, let me jump on that one first, which is we have not made any comments on it. You will remember we talked about it a long time ago because there was so much distortion in the market. We just thought it was okay to set the clocks properly, but since then we have not and will not comment on it. On the billions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. So there are basically two points that we've given that you can use to connect those dots. We've said that traffic over &#x2013; we have over 24 hours of video uploaded every minute and over 2 billion views per day. When you couple that with the 2 million monetized views per week, I think you can get to the answer that you're looking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's go for the next question, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have a question for Eric as he is on the call, and then a follow-up housekeeping question. So Eric, I think the two big trends on the Internet, obviously the web is becoming more social and real time. As the web becomes more social and real time, how does Google compete in that world in terms of real-time search market, and how does it impact your business?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the mobile trend, obviously you have this Apple ecosystem with Apple applications and people are going directly to applications. How does that impact Google's business model over the long term?</p>
          <p>And the housekeeping question, near-term question, is the tax rate is 20% on the quarter. Is there anything specific in this quarter? How should we think about the tax rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do your questions as two separate questions here. With respect to social and real time, we use complex signals to do ranking. And over time, we will add additional social, if you will, ranking clues. Fundamentally, we want to make search more personal, and as we get more information about who your friends are, we can make the search that much better. We are quite convinced that that produces better search results for people who choose to give us that information. For people who want to continue to do what is generally known as anonymous search, that's also possible. One of the ways to think about that is that we want users to be more logged in to Google. The more logged in they are, the more likely we can provide them not only the social information, but the other information.</p>
          <p>You also asked about real time. We already have significant feeds from real-time information providers. We have a real-time index, which of course is very, very successful for us, and you can see that whenever anything interesting happens. It's already right there in Google. But for example, we use Twitter as a real-time source of information. So if you search for almost anything, you'll see the Twitter feeds now as part of Universal Search. Could you repeat the second part of your question for me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one was, Eric, on the mobile front. We're seeing explosion on applications on mobile platforms. So does that impact your search volume as people go directly to the vendors to the app? It seems like Amazon talked about $1 billion sell-through coming from mobile devices. So how does that impact Google's business long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't seem to. This is one of those worrywart questions that we get all the time; that the success of one thing, could that impinge on something else. And in fact, the rising tide lifts all boats. I would say that again, what I hear is this presumption it's a zero-sum game and that one wins and another one loses. What's really happening is that all of the companies that are driving the web and web applications are all doing really well. People are moving from offline to online. And in the course of doing that, they're using these systems more. They're searching more. They're using apps more, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Now from our perspective, you have this phenomenal success of Android, which is well past anything that I had ever hoped for, and looks like it's on its way to being a huge, huge success with the number of partners, number of devices, open model for access, lots and lots of innovation, more dynamic, more competition than any other part of the platform. They're up to 90,000 applications on Android and growing very, very fast. And those applications of course have search services inside of them. So we don't see them as negative; we see both as very strongly positive.</p>

          <p>Let me go back then, Imran, to the tax question. We did get a one-time benefit this quarter on the tax side, and it is related. As the statutes expired for 2005 and 2006, all of our taxes are now closed. And in doing so, then we had an opportunity to reverse a set of provisions we had taken that we ultimately didn't have to take. So you can see the tax rate this quarter as a bit of an anomaly again.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Connie, let's go to the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take next question from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Eric, while we have you, I want to get back into mobile. Just when you think about Android as an operating system, how is that proprietary to Google when you think about your search services? Does that give you an advantage over other phones for some of your services? And does the phone operate better when you're using Google services?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I think you were quoted in an article as saying maybe someday Google can make $10 per phone. Would you see that as mostly advertising, and is that number right? It's something you did say. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the latter one I made out of thin air. So we don't really have a notion of exactly what it is, but it's probably pretty big.</p>
          <p>So one way to think about Android is that it's probably the largest single platform play available on the market today because it's a platform for computation, for location, for everything that you could do with the new and most popular set of computing devices that are emerging. That market is larger than the PC market. The tablet market is a small component of it, but an important part of it. So if you think of mobile as a platform, phone plus tablet plus all the other things, we hope to become the leading platform in that space, and we're doing it with an open source approach.</p>
          <p>In the open source approach, that means we give the software away, which is always paradoxical. People say how do you make money from that. Let's start with the fact that the evidence we have is that people who use Android search twice as much as everything else. So clearly there's more revenue associated with those searches. Another thing of course is that if they're using Android systems, the revenue that we share in the searches is shared with the operator but not with anybody else, so again it's more lucrative. So not only is there more searches and there are more ads, but it's also more lucrative. So on that basis alone, Android is hugely profitable. And we maintain the anti-fragmentation and other things by a series of contracts around the store and so forth and so on.</p>
          <p>So Android is likely to be financially successful to Google without even any of the applications that are possible. So Patrick calls up and says okay, what else can you do for us? And the answer of course is that we can layer on value-added services, which is how you get to the $10. And the value-added services could be of any kind. Our primary purpose right now is building this open platform. Google chose to make a bet on open systems and open platform and the open web. That has served us well so far and it looks like it's going to work really well for Android.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Justin. Connie, let's go to our next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, two questions on the cost side. It looks like this is the first quarter in about a year and a half in which costs per employee on annualized basis have declined sequentially. Is there something that you've been able to put in place that gives you confidence that that will continue going forward?</p>
          <p>And just on the mobile revenue opportunity, are the results strong enough from your perspective in terms of dollars and growth such that you'll stay with an indirect monetization approach towards Android? Or are you going to keep the door open and potentially charge per operating system as a share of applications in the future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost per employee, look, it's just another reflection of &#x2013; I wouldn't read anything forward looking into our results except that it's just another good example of how we are &#x2013; I talked earlier about generous but frugal. We're investing but people should not confuse the fact that we're investing and we're investing aggressively where we really see fantastic opportunities from being wasteful. We're just not a wasteful company. And so in that sense, that's a good signal, and we'll continue to do so.</p>
          <p>On the mobile, maybe Jonathan or Nikesh can give us an indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just following up on what Eric said earlier, we are very, very keen to build this ecosystem. And I think Jonathan's disclosure on the fact that we're on a $1 billion run rate in mobile is testament to the fact that we have a revenue model which we are very excited about. That revenue model proves to us that &#x2013; roughly the revenues are split between our search efforts, our display effort, and our application effort. And we are able to play across all those three spaces on our mobile monetization efforts. And the more people who use smartphones, the more people who are able to access their wireless devices, the more we see the trend that people are going to search on them, they're going to give us opportunities to put display advertising on them. So we see no reason to change our monetization model. We think the current approach to Android drives more users and more usage and drives the ecosystem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Nikesh, I think you've argued that display will become a very large component of the mobile revenue because of the success that we're seeing in our mobile business and the hockey stick there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mark, for your questions. Let's go, Connie, to the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take next question from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking the question, two things. First on display, can you give us some context in terms of breaking out YouTube, AdSense for Content, and the Ad Exchange?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, what's your view on other potential competitive Android app stores that are out there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll answer the first and then I'll get Jonathan to talk about the Android marketplaces. So on display, we just don't break it down, so we will not give the details. What we wanted to give today with the numbers we're sharing is a sense of scale and trajectory, and that's really what we wanted to share. So we unfortunately won't give any more details on that.</p>
          <p>On the Android competitive stores, Eric, maybe you can give us more perspective on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The goal of the store is to make money for the people who are writing the software and the applications, and it's not a revenue goal for Google. So there certainly will be multiple stores. There will certainly be the key one from us. We think it's a net win for everybody. So it's not a primary focus on Google from a revenue perspective, it's really for the developers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Brian Pitz from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Would you provide us with a relative idea of how the difference between average CPCs and click-thorough rates are basically on mobile versus the PC now that you have a large enough number of devices in the market? And secondly if there is a gap, which I imagine there is, can you close that gap longer term between the two? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. Nikesh can maybe give you more of a customer based perspective. I think that some of you know we recently started smart pricing on the mobile devices. And it is the case that CPCs on the mobile devices are a good bit lower. It's primarily because there isn't the measurement &#x2013; there isn't as much of a consummation of a transaction on the mobile devices. People don't have their credit cards in them. It's harder to type into them. So the mobile rates remain relatively lower. As payment platforms get built into the mobile devices and as people are more likely to actually complete a transaction, I think you'll see those things go up substantially.</p>
          <p>I think it's also the case that on devices like the iPad, the kind of activity looks a little bit more like it does on a PC, primarily because people have a larger window, a bigger browser, and they're also more able to input information. Nikesh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only thing I have to add to that is there are some formats which we've started to introduce which are driving better monetization of the mobile site, formats like click-to-call and hyperlocal because people are searching on their mobile devices when they want to then make a phone call, or they are searching on their devices when they're looking for something in a very local context. And there we're beginning to see better CPMs and better monetization. Generally, we think that's where the trend is. That's where we're going to see more and more monetization. And clearly, we are seeing monetization on the application side of mobile because with the AdMob theme that we have and all the advertisers want to be part of the applications, the applications are becoming a big share of people's mobile usage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys, two quick questions. First is you guys have discussed the cannibalization topic before between smartphone and PC. But when you look at the search data, can you see whether tablet searches or iPad searches are incremental, or is there any cannibalization versus PC? And is the tablet option within AdWords going to be similar to the desktop/laptop option, or is it going be a separate category?</p>
          <p>And then, Nikesh, can you just give us a little bit more color on the rest of world growth just in terms of regions that were driving that 26%. Was it broad based or was there anything that stood out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll let Jonathan answer the first part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so we don't see cannibalization. We tend to see mobile as very complementary to the desktop. I think you do see some differences in the search patterns. People use mobile at lunch. They use it in the evening. They use it on weekends. They use it more on holidays. But we see both mobile and web search traffic growing, and they appear to us to be complementary and not cannibalizing each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nikesh, do you want to cover the international growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the U.S. growth was very good for us. I'm very pleased at the way our U.S. team has driven the revenues across the board, across our revenue categories.</p>
          <p>On the international side, I'd say generally the trend has been positive across the board. I know the U.K. has been a bit weaker, but there's a bit of currency in there as well. But France, Germany, and those markets have actually been very, very robust. I'd say southern Europe has done way better than some of the northern European countries, but that's expected because they are enjoying a different growth curve. And clearly some of the Asian markets are growing robustly for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So good growth across the board. Thank you, Ross, for your question. Connie, let's go to our next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, a couple questions. I guess you're on a pace of doing about a $30 billion gross revenue run rate. I guess maybe a different way to look at your business plan, since it's an ROI-driven model, I guess can you quantify or give us a sense of what kind of gross dollar value of transactions that entails for all the merchants and customers that are participating in the system?</p>
          <p>And second, I guess if you look at your competition in mobile or another company in the space in mobile, they make about $300 in operating profit per handset sold. I guess do you think this is more the upper bound as it relates to lifetime profit per handset? Do you think it can be higher? And obviously you're going after a different strategy. But where do you think is the upper bound in terms of the profit potential on let's say a two-year handset in terms of monetization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeetil, on the gross value, rather than to try to give you more details on this call, Google has actually published some economic data about the amount of value that is actually transacted across the system. And so I may just refer you back to the IR team that can actually dig that up because we actually shared that with the public over the last eight months or six months, and it's actually very detailed into how much economics is actually flowing to our systems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the handset question, this is Eric, that you asked, I understand the question that you're asking. Our model, remember, is that the handset manufacturers and the operators are going to make a lot of that money. And our model is that our operating system is free, and that we're going to make money from advertising and value-added services on top of the Android platform, so it's just a completely different model. It's very difficult to compare the two. They're really apples and oranges.</p>
          <p>It would be I think premature for us to estimate what that would be. But if you assume that search monetization on handsets will become equivalent to PCs and then eventually exceed it, which is my personal view, then it should be highly lucrative because the customers are using Google services. They're going to use them more because they're more personal, they're more targeted. And so ultimately it should be a very, very strong revenue stream compared to a PC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric, and thank you for your question. Connie, let's go to our next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Jason Maynard from Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, good afternoon. I just had a question about Social Search. I'm just curious about how do you capture the signal from social networks without a relationship like you have with Twitter where you can actually get fairly easy access to the data feeds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we're careful about is not to describe how our signals are actually assembled. But the answer is that there are some ways in which we can do that. And we also have in development other ways in which people can give us that sort of information that can make it even more personal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then maybe just a follow-up for Nikesh. When you think about mobile advertising, maybe just help me frame. Where do you think advertisers are at in their life cycle of actually committing dollars to spend in this medium and form factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important part to understand on mobile space is the reason the $1 billion number is an interesting number is that just means that now the larger advertisers can get more interested because we can help them spend reasonable amounts of money. It's very hard to go make a pitch to a large advertiser when the maximum inventory they can offer them is in the $5,000 to $10,000 or $50,000 range, especially with advertisers with a $100 million or $200 million advertising budget. So to get them interested, if they get interested, they'd like to be able to deploy reasonable amounts of money against this market.</p>
          <p>So the part I'm excited about is that the inventory continues to grow. There is diversity in formats. People are interested in search based advertising. People are interested in display based advertising. They want to be in the middle of applications and get customer engagement. So we are seeing reasonable broad based interest. Clearly the early adopters are people who can actually consummate a transaction. So insurance services want to click-to-call; they want to be able to pitch. They want the customer to be able to pick up the phone and call them. There are people who are in the local space who want the customer to come to their restaurant. They want the customer to come show up where they're offering a local service. So that interest is going up.  Now the retailers who actually are interested when you're looking for a local JCPenney or a Radio Shack, that we can tell you where it is and they can actually click and find out where it is.</p>
          <p>So the interest continues to grow as you look at the local categories, as you look at the click-to-call categories. And as Jonathan said, as payment capabilities start getting built into the phone, you'll start seeing even more interest from the e-commerce players.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, this is Jonathan. Try typing in some things that will generate the hyperlocal feature that we have on mobile search ads. If you try, for example, typing in car rental, there's a very good chance you'll see an Enterprise Rent-a-Car ad that tells you how far away it is to their nearest location, half a mile along with a phone number and a link to a map, and I think that will give you a sense of how powerful it is.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One of the questions that investors continue to have is ultimately what's the right long-term growth rate to think about for international. Prior to the recession, the company was obviously putting out very large international growth rates, and we've seen a slowdown and now a rebound. Is there additional color you can give us as far as you think about long-term opportunities let's say in the more developing countries and how that's impacting your results internationally? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it's guidance, forward-looking guidance, we just can't comment. I think that you have to take it from the current performance that you see over the last couple quarters that there is clearly a separation in the world of economic growth in general and the digital economy growth. And from that, you have to infer that that's why we're so optimistic about the future of international and we're investing so much in it. Let's go to the next question, Connie, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, Patrick, your traffic acquisition cost rate seems to be the lowest you've had I think since the IPO. What accounted for that, and is that sustainable going forward?</p>
          <p>And two, growth in the last few quarters was driven largely by volume, not price. So to what extent is that driven by more SEO [Search Engine Optimization], less SEM [Search Engine Marketing], maybe a mix of domestic versus international? And how realistic is it for us to expect a hockey stick where &#x2013; maybe not a hockey stick, but a reacceleration in pricing trends? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll take the first question. And then on pricing, Jonathan can probably give you some perspective. On the TAC, it's very simple. This quarter we've had two really factors. One is our MySpace deal is now over, and with it there was a contract with minimum guarantees that now has expired. So that's one element. And then the second one is simply the mix of our partners within the network actually will affect our TAC, and that's really the effect that you see for this quarter. There's nothing more or less.</p>
          <p>In terms of forward looking for volume versus price, Jonathan, any insights? Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not really sure how to answer your question without saying anything forward looking. So is there anything specific, Youssef, in terms of trends that you've seen that you're asking for clarification on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've been hearing from agencies and advertisers that they are spending more on SEO. They're getting smarter about how to spend their ad dollars. And so to the extent that that continues, then that really is putting a dampening effect on CPC growth going forward. The mix between domestic and international should shift to more international and that over time we should see higher CPCs. I'm just trying to see as we look at the business over the next several years, how realistic is it to assume that, one, i.e., the increased international CPCs will offset the SEO trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I don't actually agree that I've necessarily seen such a trend in terms of more SEO versus SEM. As far as I can tell, SEO has always been pretty big. Pricing has been pretty healthy from my perspective coming out of a recession. Bids are healthy. We've got very strong conversion rates, and presumably that's because the advertisers are seeing buyers again. And the advertisers look at the total value they get from Google, and they're optimizing across everything under their purview. So I'm not necessarily sure I agree with the trends the way you've stated them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the thing that's going on is that we're continuing to make algorithmic improvements to our ad targeting which flow through the system as the inventions are brought out. We brought out hundreds of them in the quarter, the small ones. But the sum of them is actually helping drive basically the revenue performance on a per-query basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Youssef. Let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. A few years ago, there was a lot of discussion around crawlable exclusive data or databases. And while yesterday's deal with Microsoft and Facebook was not exclusive, I wonder if you think that's going to be a topic that may become more of an issue going forward, particularly with Microsoft. And then also just quickly, a lot of discussion lately around daily deals and private sales and those kind of things. Can Google participate in that in any way? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, the web continues to grow at such a blazing pace that if you think of all the signals available, any one that would be private is completely swamped in the sea of the Internet. And in that sense, it's not really a relevant question if you think of what Jonathan would call the petabytes or terabytes or exabytes. So from that perspective, I think that we continue to organize the vastness of this, and that's where most of the value comes from. So I think that we're not concerned in that sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's always a concern that large private collections of data are not accessible to web search engines. We have teams that spend an awful lot of time trying to make sure people know that if they optimize their stuff, it's easy to crawl. We have site maps and other services which are standardized among the web search industry. So it's obviously up to the content owner to decide how much of that information to expose. But we've taken the position both in a religious and a business perspective that the world is better off if you take the information that you're assembling and making it searchable. It provides a larger audience, it drives more traffic to your site et cetera, et cetera, and we fundamentally believe that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, do you want to take the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. There's no question, Ben, there's very exciting space related to daily deals which we're seeing. And there's obviously a lot of small companies that are doing a fabulous job there. We do participate in it to some degree. There are some companies that use site links for hot deals. So there is a mechanism that we already have where advertisers are actually putting in today's deals and highlighting them. But there's no question that's a very exciting and hot space and there are a lot of innovative players building some pretty effective business models there right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Connie, why don't we go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Jordan Rohan from Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of follow-up questions on mobile while we're on the subject. I'm a big fan of Google Instant. I'm wondering when it will be fully rolled out on BlackBerry, iPhone, and other devices there. Also, curious if you happen to disclose the number of Android devices activated in the quarter; I think last quarter it was around 200,000 a day. And finally, instead of smart pricing obscuring the discount placed on mobile search clicks or calls, why not let advertisers just bid directly on the mobile search inventory? You might be surprised about the yield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me &#x2013; on Instant, Jonathan, when is Instant available for all these mobile devices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's relatively soon, sometime this fall. Fall lasts a little longer in California, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; the last public number is 200,000 handsets activated a day, and that's the last number that we've been using, so we stick to that one for now. And can you just repeat, Jordan, your last question for me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, smart pricing is, as I understand, and maybe I'm getting it wrong, but Google has an algorithm which discounts the value assigned to advertisers, which advertisers have to pay for certain clicks if it's believed that those clicks perhaps are less frequently tied to conversions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they can set up a separate campaign now. So the smart pricing is a convenient mechanism for them if they want to leverage the existing campaign across mobile. But many advertisers have increasingly set up separate campaigns for mobile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They can right now, full visibility there; so that's how you at some level inform your decisions about smart pricing for the rest of the universe that accesses the inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that's &#x2013; no. The smart pricing is done algorithmically on the basis of what we see. We're not doing &#x2013; we don't necessarily look at differentiation between specific bids across different campaigns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jordan. Connie, let's go to our next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal from Caris &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Actually I have two questions. One is, Eric, given that non-core search business is becoming more material part of your business, in the past you allocated resources 70/20/10. Is there a shift in terms of how you're allocating resources now? And secondly, this may imply more of asking on guidance, but I guess my question is, by when do you envision mobile advertising overtaking display advertising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The latter is a very speculative question, and not something that &#x2013; one, we don't know. And two, if even we knew, we probably wouldn't talk about it.</p>
          <p>On the question of allocation of resources, I think at the end of the day, Larry and Sergey and I have talked about, it's our job to use our best judgment based on the sum of technological opportunity, business opportunity, and so forth to divide, if you will, between classic core businesses from what you're really asking it from these emergent ones.</p>
          <p>So we're informed by the hockey stick nature of these things. So there's a couple of ones. I'll give you an example of Android, which is small in resources and growing very quickly. So they pretty much have been able to get whatever resources they need, and they're going up against very large giants with a factor of ten more resources, and so we measure it that way. When we then go back and solve for 70/20/10, it turns out we're roughly consistent with 70/20/10. But it's not really as much of a formula as it's much looking at where the real excitement is.</p>
          <p>The thing that we're doing is we're organizing ourselves, and Nikesh is actually leading this effort, into more of an internal business unit structure, because, frankly, it's just become so large and so complicated that it has been difficult for us to keep track of all the details. And so that will give us a better tie-in between where the current and future revenue is and where the resources are going. And I think, Nikesh, it's on the order of 10 &#x2013; 15 structure by the time we're done, with the obvious big ones being search and ads and display and enterprise and that kind of stuff, YouTube.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so just in closing on that, what really matters the most to us as we actually do the resource allocation is, as Eric said, when you see a hockey stick, pour on gas on that fire. And when we do actually &#x2013; and we keep the flexibility to make sure that we really see the winners so that they keep the momentum, as you've seen, for example, in Android in the last 24 months, which has been tremendous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you for your question. Connie, we probably have time for two more questions, so let's go for second last.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we'll go next to Mark May from Needham &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Big picture question about data because that seems to be an increasing factor of differentiation in growth for online ad companies. How does Google think generally about leveraging user data both to better target ads and how to stay competitive with those like Facebook and Microsoft and Yahoo that are leveraging data possibly more so than what Google is today? And I think this is particularly relevant for using search data for your display business. But I would love to get your thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a pretty strong opinion that we're not going to do very much of it. The reason is that we take our end user data privacy incredibly seriously. And the trust that people have with respect to giving us that information, both their search histories as well as other pieces of information, they get very upset very, very quickly if we in their view misuse it. So what we typically tell people is we're not going to do the kinds of things that you could do with this, in particular, use it to generate strange ads against your history and things like that without your explicit permission. And we probably in many cases won't do it forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. Let's go to our last question, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our final question from Marianne Wolk from Susquehanna.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It looks like you did a great job converting a lot of the advertising on the content network over to display. Can you talk about to what extent that's now video based, and is that helping monetization rates significantly? And do you expect that to be 100% display shortly? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nikesh, maybe you want to talk about the display and how it's evolving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've been waiting for the entire earnings call, Patrick, to talk about display. I'm glad that Patrick and Jonathan have allowed us to disclose that we're at a run rate of $2.5 billion. I think this puts us in one of the top three display networks in the world. I also believe that the technology suite we offer is second to none.</p>
          <p>In terms of the video versus the other display formats, it is primarily a lot of this is still display in terms of banner ads and other formats, and this video is beginning to come into it. But we believe in the future there is going to be a lot more rich media involved in the Display Network. As we go forward, you're going to see more and more monetization of video whether it's on YouTube or other partner sites that's going to happen. So we believe the Display Network we offer has maximum frequency and maximum reach. We can reach people more times a day than anyone else. So I'm very excited about display.</p>
          <p>I was not sure what you meant by what becomes 100% of display.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Of the roughly 1 million partners that are part of the partner network, to what extent is that now converted to display, and could that ultimately be entirely Display Network? And then also since I've got you, can you clarify the run rate information you gave? Is that a trailing 12-month figure or are you annualizing the current quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Patrick answer how we come to $2.5 billion. But in terms of the million partners we have, the entire partner network is part of our Display Network that we offer. And we actually have the ability to offer them display advertising or text based advertising. And basically it's based on ROI and CPMs that we make that determination, or the publisher makes the determination, or the advertisers make the determination. So the entire network that we have is open for display advertising already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the follow-up question, it was about &#x2013; it's just the trailing quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that, thank you for your question, Marianne. Let me give you a couple closing thoughts. One is I just want to reiterate that what we did today was give you a few indications of why we believe we're successful in these emerging businesses. These data points are not about giving you more information on the coming quarters, but more to give you the confidence that what we're investing in is really fueling at great growth rates and building meaningful businesses.</p>
          <p>I want to thank Eric for taking the time. I know he's running for the plane, but it's terrific to have you on the call and take a few minutes with our analysts and shareholders. And then I want to take a moment to thank all the Googlers for their hard work. All this strong performance is really on the back of fantastic work from our team worldwide, our great engineers, our great sales force, and our great support staff everywhere. I just want to take from the OC just the time to thank them again in the public domain because they do such a terrific job.</p>
          <p>With that, Connie, I'll let you close the call.</p>
        </plist>
