          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Schoberl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to the telephone conference of BMW AG for the First Quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>With me today, Dr. Norbert Reithofer, the CEO of the BMW Group, and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, the CFO of the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Norbert Reithofer will talk about the company's business achievements during the first quarter and then about the company's strategic outlook. Afterwards, Friedrich Eichiner will give a brief overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of this year. Then as always we will have time for a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Dr. Reithofer, the mic is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our strategy is paying off. We are reaping the benefits of focusing on our four pillars of our strategic approach; growth, profitability, shaping the future, and access to new technologies and customers.</p>
          <p>To be clear, we are not resting on our laurels. It is our responsibility to ensure the ongoing strength of the BMW Group. And we are able to do so from a strong position: financially, strategically, and technologically.</p>
          <p>We have just achieved the best start to the year in our company's history. Our key figures for the first quarter demonstrate this. We achieved a record pre-tax result at the Group level of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Net profit stands at &#x20AC;1.2 billion. And in the Auto Segment, we have recorded an EBIT margin of close to 12%. We continue to generate high levels of profitability in line with our targets laid out for 2012.</p>
          <p>Our Financial Services division also posted its best-ever quarterly result before taxes, &#x20AC;429 million. These figures show the strong global demand for BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce cars and motorcycles.</p>
          <p>You know that in the first three months of this year, we delivered over 382,000 cars to customers worldwide, more than ever before in a first quarter. This is due to both the launch of new models as well as the continuing success of existing models.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some examples. We sold over 85,000 new BMW 5 Series, including the BMW 5 Series GT, in the first three months of the year, making it number one in the upper mid-size segment. Other segment leaders include the 1 Series Convertible, the 3 Series Convertible and the BMW X5.</p>
          <p>The BMW 7 Series has never had a more successful first quarter. At more than 55,000 units sold, the BMW 3 Series Sedan continues to perform at a high level. And more than 16,000 customers bought the new MINI Countryman in the first quarter alone.</p>
          <p>Rolls-Royce has delivered 723 motor cars to their new owners. This is a considerable increase from the previous year's figures.</p>
          <p>The Motorcycle Segment also had an excellent first quarter, with BMW improving by 11% and Husqvarna by 18%.</p>
          <p>In April, we launched our very first BMW six-cylinder motorcycles. Additional new models for both brands will be launched over the course of the year. April built upon this positive sales trend. We recorded a total of over 136,000 cars sold, up 17% on the prior year level.</p>
          <p>As a global company, we aim to continue our balanced growth in both mature markets and emerging growth markets. In the first quarter, the U.S. and Germany have been neck-and-neck in terms of sales. And China is the third largest sales market. But we also saw impressive growth in the dynamic young markets of Brazil, Russia, India, Korea and Turkey.</p>
          <p>We have been able to meet strong global demand because of our highly flexible production network. Our associates at the Regensburg plant are hard at work preparing the launch of the new BMW 1 Series. Plant Dingolfing mastered the start of production of the new BMW 6 Series Convertible in late 2010. Starting this summer, they will also produce the new 6 Series Coupe, available this fall. We are currently evaluating how to expand our production network further, in line with our growth strategy. One possibility is an assembly plant in Brazil.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are strengthening our global dealership network in China, in India and in many other markets. We have every intention to stay on track. The BMW Group understands that we must earn our success every day. Our long tradition of innovation and our strong brands create a platform from which we will develop revolutionary products in the era of sustainable mobility. This means to make the right investments and promote the right innovations at the right time.</p>
          <p>In the past decade, we laid a solid foundation for today's competitive advantage with EfficientDynamics. And back in 2007 we charted the roadmap for our development up to the year 2020 by launching our Strategy Number ONE. We intend to shape future mobility by using our strong financial footing and continuing to innovate. As we see it, this includes the following aspects: to maintain our technological lead in the field of sustainable drive systems with both combustion and electric motors, to pool the most promising expertise within the company, and to provide customers with attractive mobility services.</p>
          <p>Here are four examples. First, we are a major driving force in the field of e-mobility. Beginning in the fall, customers in the U.S. will be able to lease the electric BMW ActiveE. In Shanghai, we presented our BMW e-car from China for China. It is a plug-in hybrid based on the BMW 5 Series long version. In all-electric mode, this car has a range of 50 kilometers.</p>
          <p>Second, we will also offer innovative mobility services. Together with our partner Sixt, we will establish DriveNow. This program will offer customers an alternative to rental cars, taxis, and public transport.</p>
          <p>300 MINI Cooper and BMW 1 Series cars will be on the streets of Munich soon. Our investment company BMW i Ventures became a partner in the New York-based My City Way. Their mobile app provides information on cities in the U.S. and around the globe.</p>
          <p>Third, we are also using more modules in our new cars. This approach was fully implemented for the first time with the new BMW 1 Series. In the future, our drive system module will allow us to share up to 60% of the components between our three, four and six-cylinder engines.</p>
          <p>By standardizing processes even further, we are reducing costs while also improving the quality of the vehicles. In fact, the BMW Group recently received top marks for quality. According to the most recent German ADAC rankings, MINI ranks first among small cars for the fewest number of breakdowns; the BMW 1 Series first in the economy mid-size segment; the BMW X3 first and the BMW 3 Series third in the mid-size segment; and the BMW 5 Series second in the upper mid-size segment.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we are strengthening our global design expertise. In the second half of this year, we will open a new design studio in Shanghai. This new studio will be integrated into our global design team of DesignworksUSA with offices in California, Munich and Singapore.</p>
          <p>According to customer surveys, design remains a top reason for choosing a brand. Designworks is responsible for providing the BMW Group with new ideas and external perspectives. Today, many trends come from Asia. We aim to create synergies and by doing so, improve our understanding of our Asian customers, particularly those in China. This will expand our design language even more globally.</p>
          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we had a strong start to the year. As a result, we confirm our targets for the overall year. We aim to exceed our 2010 results; sell well over 1.5 million cars; achieve record results for our three brands BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce. These targets are based on the assumption that global conditions will remain stable.</p>
          <p>We expect that global demand for cars will increase further this year. However, we will see uneven development in the individual markets, while demand in the BRIC countries, the U.S. and Germany is picking up, growth in China will slow down, and sales in Western Europe are expected to plateau. It is important to remember, there remains volatility in our business environment, both in politics and the markets.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenges, the BMW Group has a clear strategy. Our aim is to provide individual mobility for a new era and we will do so this from a position of strength and independence. This is the BMW way.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from my side as well. The BMW Group is the world's leading premium car company. In the first quarter of 2011, we continued to expand our position in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>Our earnings performance increased once again. In the first quarter, we achieved a margin of 11.3%, based on pre-tax earnings of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. This is even higher than our very profitable fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The initiatives implemented under our Strategy Number One are having the intended effect. Most of the measures we initiated as part of our profitability program have been completed and continue to have a positive impact on profitability.</p>
          <p>We continue to work on efficiency improvements. We are not looking for one-off effects. We aim to keep our long-term profitability and EBIT margin within the target range of 8% to 10%. This should also be possible in spite of life-cycle effects and volatility.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to be a company with solid earnings that is efficient and profitable at all levels. This will give the BMW Group the financial strength it needs to continue innovating.</p>
          <p>Let me go into a little more detail about the Automotive segment. Continuing to benefit from strong demand, we sold nearly 383,000 units from January to March. This is 21% more than in the first quarter last year. Nevertheless, these figures reflect basis effects from the crisis that still dominated the first quarter of last year. So growth rates may be lower for the full year.</p>
          <p>The Automotive segment generated revenues of &#x20AC;14.4 billion in the first quarter, representing an increase of 35% year-on-year. EBIT for the segment totaled &#x20AC;1.7 billion. The EBIT margin of 11.9% was even higher than the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Our price positioning benefited from strong demand in the first quarter. Because of this, we once again improved our net pricing from the previous quarter. Financial steering system we implemented for the Sales division in 2010 showed positive effects on our earnings. We expect a further positive and significant impact on results for the full year.</p>
          <p>Earnings were also boosted by reductions in the cost of materials as a result of product development and agreements with suppliers. Combined with higher volumes for the X3 and the 5 Series, this resulted in comparably lower manufacturing costs.</p>
          <p>Our production volume for the first quarter exceeded sales volumes by 47,000 units. This is mainly the result of longer transfer times for vehicles headed to rapidly growing markets overseas. Related expenses are not booked until the corresponding revenues are recognized. Our strong operating performance in the first quarter boosted free cash flow in the Automotive segment to &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Services segment also had a very dynamic start in the new year. The division reported pre-tax earnings of &#x20AC;429 million, thanks to attractive financing conditions and interest margins. The risk situation further eased and led to lower provisions for credit risk. This had a positive impact on earnings. Segment earnings also contained positive effects of &#x20AC;60 million from the off-lease business and the adjustment of credit risk provisions.</p>
          <p>Our leasing and customer financing business reported strong growth in the first quarter. We concluded almost 277,000 new leasing and financing contracts worldwide. The customer business grew by 14%. In particular, growth in U.S. and strong demand for the 5 Series Sedan among corporate and small business owners in Germany helped strengthen our leasing business. Combined with the lower manufacturing costs of our new vehicles, we could eliminate a larger share of intra-group profits. This reduced our profit before tax in the Eliminations segment to minus &#x20AC;228 million.</p>
          <p>The penetration rate -- the percentage of new BMW Group vehicles handled by Financial Services segment was at 40%. This is almost seven percentage points below the rate for the first quarter of the previous year. This is due to our financial service activities in China. BMW Financial Services China began operating in the Chinese market at the start of 2011. Its lower penetration rate is now included in our global figures.</p>
          <p>So far, our new organization has financed only a small percentage of new vehicles in China. Financial services organization is mostly supporting the expansion of the Chinese dealer network and providing interim financing for dealers. We see further potential for development in China, which we aim to leverage through our financial services business.</p>
          <p>How did the risk situation develop in the Financial Services segment? We saw used car markets in Europe continue to stabilize in the first quarter. In the United States, prices for pre-owned BMW vehicles trended upwards. For the first time this year there will be a much smaller number of end-of-lease vehicles in the U.S., in part because we have been actively steering new customer business towards loan financing. This will further stabilize used-car prices.</p>
          <p>Right now, we are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. market. But there are still a number of factors, such as rising oil prices that point to possible volatility. A downturn in the economy would also have a negative impact on the used-car market. We remain cautious about European markets. In particular, the debt crisis among southern European members of the Eurozone implies a certain risk of volatility for the coming months.</p>
          <p>Globally, the credit risk situation for the Financial Services segment continued to stabilize in the first quarter. The credit loss ratio for this period was 0.55% worldwide. This was 10 basis points lower than the same quarter last year. If the recovery continues, we will take a close look at our risk provisions and may adjust them accordingly.</p>
          <p>The increase in key interest rates in Eurozone in March did not significantly impact our business forecast. We expect to see a further gradual increase in base rates in the near future. It is possible that this could somewhat dampen the momentum of our financial services business in the medium-term.</p>
          <p>But overall, we are confident about our performance. There are three primary reasons for this. Strong rates of growth in the auto business, ongoing favorable financing conditions, and a sound risk position and healthy risk provisions. We still anticipate that earnings for 2011 will be higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, sales volumes also increased substantially in the Motorcycles segment. We delivered 25,000 motorcycles: 11% more units than last year. This was mainly due to our new models. Our key motorcycle segments experienced a mixed performance in the first quarter but, overall, we were able to maintain last year's level.</p>
          <p>Our main motorcycle segments in Germany, France and the U.S. reported modest growth. BMW Motorrad increased its first quarter revenues by 13% to almost &#x20AC;400 million. The segment generated an EBIT of &#x20AC;31 million. As we announced previously, Husqvarna earnings will be consolidated in the Motorcycles segment for the first time in 2011.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, after three strong months, we maintain our guidance for 2011. We continue to aim for record sales of well over 1.5 million vehicles, with new sales highs for all three brands. In the first six months of the year, we expect to see significant sales increases due to our new models. Growth rates will be overstated, however, due to basis effects. We anticipate a slower rate of growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The BMW 1 Series will be approaching the end of its lifecycle. And with another high-volume model soon to be phased out, this will also become more of a factor. We also expect high expenses for launching and ramping up new model versions. We believe that raw material prices and currency risks will move in opposite directions over the course of the year. We are hedged at a good rate and expect the effects from both of these areas to offset each other overall.</p>
          <p>We are aiming for an EBIT margin of more than 8% for our automotive business in 2011 and a ROCE of more than 26%, in line with our strategic goals. This assumes the current positive trend on the auto markets will continue.</p>
          <p>Given the income information we have to-date, we expect motorcycle effects to dampen earnings in the second half of the year. We are confident that we will be able to keep returns within our target range beyond 2012. This is based on the assumption that the global economy and economic and political conditions remain stable.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are <mark type="ph" /> reaping (22:06) the benefits of the positive sales environment and our cost improvements. Together, they put the BMW Group in a much stronger position. That said, in light of the risks, we are also prepared for potential volatility. Overall, we are on track to meet our targets this year. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question is by Mr. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks a lot. Good afternoon everyone. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. First question is on your Strategy One target for 2012. You mentioned in the past that you expect a sequential increase of the profitability of our company in 2010, 2011 to peak profitability at least on this plan in 2012. Given that you are now at a much higher profitability level already could you confirm that 2012 should be a more profitable year for BMW?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Arndt Ellinghorst. The answer will be coming from Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt, thank you for the questions. So first of all, I think, 2012 is still a way out and there are still some headwinds out there. Just think about the currency and we still believe that is the best guidance you can give is that we will be in a position to stay in this target range of 8% to 10%. If everything comes on a positive side, clearly we will be more at the upper end of this range and if we would have face more headwinds then may be more in the middle. So that's what we expect from today's perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I may ask on the currency would it be a fair picture for next year if we were to assume a net dollar exposure in the area of 11 billion to 12 billion out of which roughly 70% is hedged at <mark type="ph" /> 130 (24:33), which would leave us with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear this is dollar and renminbi again?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dollar and renminbi.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Stuart Pearson from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, just a few questions from my side. I mean you've alluded to in the second half motorcycle effects dampening the profitability. So I mean just I actually had a question on the mix trends and particularly the profitability of your smaller car franchise going forward and I just wonder whether they could be structurally more profitable going forward than they have been in the past.</p>
          <p>I mean we are seeing Ford achieved huge pricing in the U.S. on cars like the Fiesta. So I just wonder if it could be the case that we are all being too conservative on the negative mix impacts of growth in the MINI and the 1 Series at least from a margin perspective. And even potentially the 3 Series and actually in mix trends may not be so negative. Or if you think we still need to be cautious as those models come on stream?</p>
          <p>Here's the first question. The second question just on quickly on CapEx, noticing just ex the R&amp;D capitalization is down for less than 3% of sales. Just wonder if you can give -- update us on the guidance for the full year on the CapEx number please.</p>
          <p>And then the final question just on cash return, maybe you could just think or remind us how you think about the criteria or metrics that you look at when deciding how much capital to potentially return to shareholders one day and how you think about the timing of that. Anything you can help us to just think about please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much, Stuart. The questions will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about the smaller cars I think you are aware of our strategies and initiative that we are coming up with a new architecture for smaller cars, which will enable us to allocate more volume to those architectures and improve our economies of scale and this is giving us an advantage on a profitability side.</p>
          <p>So I don't see that the investment into these segments to really jeopardize our mid-term target of 8% to 10%. And talking about 1 and 3 Series, for those cars, we exactly know where we are, because they are close to launch. And the profitability of those cars are pretty much improved, as compared to their predecessors.</p>
          <p>Now that's that small car segment. CapEx was really a bit low in this quarter, but it's a seasonal effect. It was much higher in the fourth quarter. If you look -- if you recall this number and the -- I would say on a CapEx side, we think we will less capitalization, R&amp;D capitalization we should be in the range between 30% and 40% at the end of the year. That's what we are expecting there.</p>
          <p>Now cash return, where is that -- we would like to let our shareholders participate on a success of the Company. I think we already have shown a significant step for our 2010 results. We also -- we will have to talk about 2011 at the end of the year. And clearly, the commitment is there. And our guidance while at the end of the day, we should go -- reach a range of 30% to 40% that is the next target for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have several questions. First again on the currency hedging situation, I didn't understand your answer acoustically. Could you confirm again the amount that you have as dollar net exposure taking altogether all the different dollar regions? And could you tell us at what levels you're hedged and what you have hedged for 2012 and 2013 already in terms of percentage of the net exposure?</p>
          <p>And secondly, when we look at the provisioning, provisioning in the fourth quarter was relatively higher with &#x20AC;650 and in the first quarter it was only &#x20AC;180 million. Can you say whether there were any effects in there that also helped earnings in the fourth quarter? And then again could you confirm the total CapEx level for the full year 2011, what we should expect there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Christian Breitsprecher. The answers will be, come from Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First talking about currency. So clearly the major exposure in Chinese currency and U.S. currency was at that order of magnitude we discussed already. With Mr. Ellinghorst, so it was &#x20AC;10 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion that was what we said. And we are clearly hedged &#x2013; more than 50% hedged in those positions. That's what I can say about 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, CapEx overall, I think CapEx will be a bit higher than 2010, but will not be at the target ratio of 7%. It will still be below 7% and the reason is the strong revenue growth we are expecting this year, which you can see now first quarter result as well.</p>
          <p>The last one was about the provisions. I mean, as far as I know in the fourth quarter provisions had a negative influence on our profit, on our P&amp;L not a positive one and so we had if you look at our cash flow statement, you'll see provisions in there around &#x20AC;250 million. That is something we had to accrue in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but you accrued a lot more in the fourth quarter -- in special effects that helped you in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we always have a kind of a year ending fact. That is coming back and we disclosed that already that fourth quarter is always a bit special.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one question regarding the dollar exposure, the &#x20AC;11 billion is the euro number that's not the dollar number, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but just to remind you there is so much volatilities still on the volume side, right and this number will clearly go up and down and this is maybe a kind of a rough planning figure you should look at. So -- and clearly, it was a euro number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is by Mr. Michael Tyndall from Barclays Capital, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Michael Tyndall from Barclays. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions, if I may. If I cast my mind back to when the E90 was launched so the last 3 Series in March '05 and look at margins prior to so in the first half of '04 it was 8.1% and then in the second half it was 6.8%. So you lost roughly 130 basis points during the changeover. Is that the sort of order of magnitude we should be thinking about for the second half of this year? Obviously you will have something in your planning there.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is in relation to China, and as you expand out of the major cities into the regional cities, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about pricing and mix and what you are observing there at the moment? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we start first with Mr. Eichiner. E90.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean, I don't want to give you a feedback on a percentage number. I think overall we expect roughly a number around &#x20AC;500 million that is related to expenditures of launch cost and extra spendings on the marketing side. Though this is relevant for the changeover of a volume product like the 3 Series, just to give you an indication.</p>
          <p>Now talking about China, what we still see in China is high demand for luxury cars, especially for the BMW brand. We still have a high demand for the upper end of our portfolio. So talking about the 7 Series, the X6 Series and fortunately for the 5 Series long version that is locally produced in China. So the mix still is very strong and what we see on the, on a local market side, more and more momentum is coming out of the second tier cities. We are now on our way to build up more dealers there and this should strengthen our position in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any view on pricing at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing is still very solid, very solid. We have the lowest, well, trade allowances levels in the major markets in China. So it's very solid much better than in all of the other markets.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is by <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Fraser Hill (34:33) from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions from my side, just to follow-up on the launch cost for the 1 and the 3 Series, the &#x20AC;500 million. How many quarters would that be spread across? Would that be the second -- sorry the third, fourth and the first quarter of next year or just in the second half of this year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on your capacity how much flexibility do you have today? What would be the upper end of your production possibilities? And if indeed you are close to capacity which products are you especially constrained within? And then following on from that, if you are going to be looking at additional capacity, perhaps in LatAm, how much do you think you would need to build and roughly what would be a rule of thumb for the cost of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost with the launched cars that clearly is relevant for the second half of the year and just keep in mind we started the 1 Series later than -- the 3 Series will come in so it will not be an even distribution and we've only been talking about the 3 Series so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Production capacity Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean at the moment our capacity utilization is more than 100%. That means our production is really on full steam. And you asked me from a production capacity increase point of view, I mean you have to see last year, in the year 2010 to give you one example, the production figure in our plant in the U.S., in Spartanburg was roughly 160,000 units.</p>
          <p>After the launch of the X3 in our plant in the United States, we will be able -- I mean our original capacity was 240,000 units for the year 2011, we will be able, because of flexibility measures to improve the capacity already this year to 260,000 units. That means it is compared to 2010 an increase of 100,000 units.</p>
          <p>And then you have to see to jump to China, our production capacity last year was roughly 55,000 units. And this year will be between 85,000 and 90,000 units. That means as well an increase of about 30,000 units, if you add both together it's already an increase of 130,000 units. That means we are working to increase our production capacity. And of course, we still have ideas in Dingolfing, Regensburg, Munich and Leipzig. Although that we can say on an overall level, we will be able to increase production capacity in 2011 compared to 2010 by about 150,000 units.</p>
          <p>So that means capacity will not limit our sales. But if you see certain models like the demand on the BMW X3 with an order bank of roughly four months, of course the customers they have to wait sometimes six months to get the car. So that is the current situation.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is by Mr. Georges Dieng from Natixis. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon. I have a few questions. First of all, I was wondering on the gap between sales and production that we've seen in Q1, whether you expect to have the same gap in the second quarter as well and what is the estimated boost that you have in terms of profits in Q1 coming from that item.</p>
          <p>The second point is on the financial services, whether you think that the current run rate you had in Q1 is sustainable over the next quarters or whether we should face some headwinds ahead of us, and finally looking at the EBIT walk down, I know that you are not providing a walk down on a quarterly basis, but if we look at the different drivers, could you at least rank the key factors behind the jump in the automotive EBIT in Q1, and in particular how important was the contribution of efficiency measures and whether the base of savings should accelerate as we move towards the <mark type="ph" /> new one (39:23) approach? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, George. The questions will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first let's start with the gap, I mean, we are &#x2013; we have to support a growing business. And if you look at the retail number of the first quarter and the guidance we gave to you that it should be fairly more than 1.5 million in the course of the year. It is very clear that we still have to ramp up productions in pipeline in order to achieve this target, and that is a reason why we had to produce more. And keep in mind that we have an issue with the introduction of new cars in the second half of the year. And this always has a certain influence on volumes as well, if you change major volume product, so that I think explains why we had and to produce more in order to support our overall retail target for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, the question of the EBIT impact, I mean there is a full cost number behind that. That is around &#x20AC;100 million. So that is more or less the story behind this. And now your question about the SF running rate. It's -- we have very favorable conditions actually and clearly with the increasing of interest rates this will dampen a bit the positive effects. So I think we should not multiply this result by four because we could expect that in the course of the year, financing could be a bit more expensive and this clearly should have a certain pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>Having said this, there is still one thing that we disclosed as well. We have to look at our portfolio and in Q2, we have to see whether a reevaluation of the provisions has to be done or not. So that was the SF question.</p>
          <p>And then your question what is the background of the margin? Strong margin in the first quarter. I think the facts that we already disclosed in Q4 are valid for this quarter as well. We could improve pricing further that was one of our targets. We benefit from a better manufacturing, lower manufacturing cost. That is coming out of purchasing. And we have a strong mix in the market, that is very pretty much relevant for overseas markets and this strong mix helps us to come up with a strong margin at the same point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is by Mr. John Lawson from Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. My first question is can you share with us please how much of the negative &#x20AC;257 million reconciliation line in EBIT is based on the increased volume of leases, and how much is actually adjustment of the level of write-off that you might have made in the quarter?</p>
          <p>Second question is, is making a one-off contribution to Financial Services equity in 2011 still on the agenda or are you seeing such a high level of profitability now that you're going to be able to get to the 12 times leave it position just on retained profits?</p>
          <p>And finally, Dr. Reithofer, you also referenced political volatility in your speech. I'm sorry to be a bit slow witted here. But could you perhaps share with us any specific issues which you have in mind when you referenced that political issues? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with Mr. Reithofer and the last point of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean look if I have in mind political issues, and of course I have in mind as well regulatory issues. I mean, if I see for example Europe, the United States, China, We are still in a phase of uncertainty where will we end, let me say, from a limit point of view, if it comes for example, to emissions, in the year 2020 and what does it mean? What we have to spend on top if it comes to research and development to be able to cope with the new regulations. So -- and we know let me, roughly what will come between 2016 and 2025 in the United States, but still with the uncertainty of 10% to 20%.</p>
          <p>So in the European Union we have still voices in Brussels. They say the new regulations for 2020 are not tough enough for the car industry. And in China as you know, I mean, we saw the impact that the Chinese government said for example in Beijing that they give only an allowance for 700,000 cars in the year 2011. For us the result will be that our sales figure in Beijing, compared to the total sales figure in China was last year 10% and we expect this year it will be only 5% because of the impact of that regulation for the city of Beijing. Of course, as Mr. Eichiner said, we will be able to compensate in other areas of China, but these are how we see it from a political point of view are still certainties.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first about the negative &#x20AC;257 million consolidation line, well, clearly the maturity of this is due to the intercompany profit elimination that comes out of the growing, leasing business. That's really the majority of this.</p>
          <p>Now, the question about the equity. Well. We have to see how much profit we possibly could achieve within our financial services business. I mean, if we are talking a few 100 million that possibly could be injected but it's not yet decided and not yet clear. We still have to see how the business develops over the forthcoming months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My formal question is if you can't confirm though that you made an adjustment to the level of the write-off was that a small part of the total &#x20AC;257 or was it a large part of the 257?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. First question is on capacity and the potential plants you are planning for Brazil. I mean, Brazil is a growing market but still a very small market for BMW. If you would build a plant there is that mainly for export to Europe to the U.S. or are you assuming a much higher market share in Brazil?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be on the German market, maybe you could comment on discussions we heard yesterday on potential changes on the company <mark type="ph" /> contact (47:40), is there the potential risk and maybe you could remind us of how many of your annual sales volume would be affected by that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. This question will be answered by Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to start with Brazil. If we think about an assembly plant in Brazil, we start with the assembled cars and not to start with the paint shop, not with the body shop. We will assemble cars.</p>
          <p>Brazil is a very promising market for us. I mean year-to-date March we had a growth rate in Brazil of more than 40%. So last year it was a good year in Brazil and we think a small assembly plant is the right start. But to start with the small assembly plant having in mind already the future; let me say looking ahead for the next 10 years. So that is Brazil and if it comes to new ideas for company cars in Germany, I mean we can say key aspects of the articles and analysis of the study are factually incorrect and the conclusions it draws are wrong so. And of course we have our opinion the German car in the street.</p>
          <p>We think it is not a good idea and now we have to see what does it mean and we have to start first to negotiate and to convince our partners in politics and not to start already to speculate what could it mean for us. It is far too early because we really will fight to avoid it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe the number of company cars you're selling in Germany?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Germany I think in total can it be 700,000? It's now speculation from my side, overall company cars. I mean I don't know, but it will be above 500,000 units.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, this is Thierry Huon speaking from Exane. So, two questions please. One, could you share with us breakdown of the revenues, I mean volume mix and forex effects. Because if I look at the volume we could assume excluding China, there is the one produced by <mark type="ph" /> the activity in China (50:18). I have some troubles to reconciliate the numbers I have got with what you published.</p>
          <p>And the second question is about, still about the mix, but this time in China. Have you noticed any significant difference in terms of mix between tier 1 cities and tier 2 cities for BMW? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, talking about China first. I think that we so far, I don't see that we have a big difference between the cities there. Everywhere we have a strong demand for the models, for the 7 Series models and X5, X6 models. And demand is still higher than supply there. So we have not reached a point where we are able to meet demand. It's still very high.</p>

          <p>And your second question is kind of a breakdown, just to give you a few numbers that are relevant on the volume side. If you look at major markets, the overall volume, now China makes 15% -- 15.3% of our volume why is the German market is at 17%, and U.S. market is at 17.3%. And overall, if you look at the continents, Europe is always roughly 50% of the overall volume. That's a balance that is very stable and in <mark type="ph" /> excess (52:14), but the majority of our business is still in the mature markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That would be a bit difficult to do it here, but I would kindly ask you to talk to our Investor Relations colleagues here, they would give you maybe a bit more detailed information.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think we have time for two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is by Mr. Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three quick ones if I may. First of all, coming back to a question that was raised earlier on, on this production, over production impact on the profitability. The number you gave would suggest that we should use about &#x20AC;2,000 fixed cost capitalization, given that you produce 48,000 units in the quarter more than you sold. That sounds a bit low to me. But could you just confirm that number?</p>
          <p>Secondly, we spoke a bit about hedging early on, conceptionally, in the past, BMW whenever the dollar was above your PPP rate, you basically stopped the strategic hedges and you went to technical hedging including collars. And equally when you provided in the past the sort of percentage rates that always meant that you have a higher percentage rate at the beginning of the year and declining towards the end of the year. I wonder whether that is still the case or do you still apply collars when we are hovering around these comparably weak dollar levels in particular.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just a very quick one on your cash flow. I noticed you have the &#x20AC;600 million positive contribution from other. Could you just quickly tell us what is in there in the automotive segment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Mr. Gehrke. I think all questions will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd like to start with the production indication and the fixed cost allocation of that. I mean as we said, it's probably overall we are talking a number of &#x20AC;100 million -- around &#x20AC;100 million and that is something I -- we really would like to confirm. Now hedging I mean hedging normally we are not disclosing our instruments so that we are using different instruments. There are many implications cost is one issue, flexibility the other one and so we are using this mix of instruments, options, forwards and whatever arrange options in adjusted nearly on a weekly basis. So that is how we manage the FX hedges. And as I said, we don't want to like to disclose the instruments.</p>
          <p>But overall I'd like to say as you know we have fairly hedged for this year and then we have a very solid position for next year and we already have a position for 2013. So that is giving us some, let's say, stability looking forward and looking at our midterm targets.</p>
          <p>And now your question, cash flow statement, the other items. This is mainly due to personal related liabilities for example unused occasion days, increase of overtime. I mean you have to consider that we had to push a lot of production out. And this is -- has an influence for example on overtime work and things like that. And that is what you see mainly in that column. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Last question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The final question is by Mr. Horst Schneider from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I have got first of all, the question on free cash flow, which was very strong in Q1 in automotive, I think it was around &#x20AC;1.6 billion. So you've guided us in March for full year free cash flow of &#x20AC;3 billion. So does that mean that the free cash flow or the free cash flow for the next two quarters there has rather slowed down or would you say from today's perspective that you could make maybe more than &#x20AC;3 billion free cash flow in 2011?</p>
          <p>Then another question is with regard to prices. You have been in previous conference call a bit more specific on pricing. So could you maybe say to which extent prices has improved year-on-year and also versus Q4 and Q1 '11?</p>
          <p>And then last question then related to reconciliation. So if -- am I right to assume that the level of elimination that we have seen in Q1, I should also expect for the next two quarters respectively in line with rising sales, elimination figure could even increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Thank you for your question. I like to start with the last one, elimination. I think this will continue, and clearly we are expecting a number roughly around &#x20AC;900 million or something like that. That is absolutely something that could be relevant for this year with a growing leasing business in the growth and sale side that we are expecting.</p>
          <p>Now, and your second question then was about the pricing effect. Our guidance was that our target is to improve pricing by another 100 basis point in the course of 2011. That is our target. I think we've seen a bit better in the first quarter, but we have to see looking forward in the second half of the year for the run out of 1 Series and the run out of 3 Series. There will be a bit more pressure on pricing than in the first half of the year. So on average, we're quite happy with the guidance and we think those 100 basis points should be materialized at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And then your, the question around the free cash flow, it was very strong. I absolutely agree. Just to recall the guidance, we said more than &#x20AC;3 billion. With this strong start into the year 2011 I think this will clearly support the guidance that it will be more than &#x20AC;3 billion in 2011.</p>
