          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome also on behalf of my colleagues to our second quarter results conference call.</p>
          <p>With me on the call are Marijn Dekkers, our CEO; our CFO, Werner Baumann; and the representatives from our subgroups: J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt from Healthcare; Sandra Peterson from CropScience; and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Marijn will start off with a very brief summary of the developments in the quarter. We assume you have all received and reviewed our stockholders' newsletter, the investment analyst briefing document and the conference call slides so that Marijn can concentrate his introductions on the main part.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Marijn, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. Thank you, Marijn.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Alexander.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It's our pleasure today to speak with you about our strong second quarter. You've seen we saw continued growth momentum and a strong operating performance in the second quarter. We delivered record sales and lower reported EBIT due to high special charges but nicely improved adjusted earnings. And currency effects had a positive impact as well.</p>
          <p>The strong operating momentum in our business was broad-based. HealthCare delivered the best quarter ever both in terms of sales and adjusted EBITDA. CropScience set the new record for a second quarter performance and MaterialScience generated record quarterly sales and the highest adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter since 2007.</p>
          <p>Against this background and based on our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full year. So let me now elaborate on some of the key figures for the quarter. When talking about sales, I will concentrate on portfolio and currency-adjusted data.</p>
          <p>First, group sales rose by 5% to a record level of &#x20AC;10.2 billion. All subgroups contributed to the increase, especially CropSciences, which continued to grow strongly.</p>
          <p>Reported earnings in the quarter were impacted by special charges of &#x20AC;762 million. This sum included provisions of almost &#x20AC;500 million for all litigations in connection with the YAZ Yasmin of which we are currently aware and which we consider to be worthy of settlement.</p>
          <p>Special items additionally comprised impairment losses of &#x20AC;137 million recognized on intangible assets and restructuring charges of &#x20AC;107 million. Reported EBIT decreased as a result by 41% to &#x20AC;750 million. Adjusted EBITDA, however, improved by 7% to almost &#x20AC;2.2 billion driven by higher sales at HealthCare to continue its strong business momentum at CropScience and a slight improvement at MaterialScience. In addition, positive currency effects of around &#x20AC;70 million primarily at HealthCare contributed to the increase. And then core earnings per share rose 14% to &#x20AC;1.47.</p>
          <p>Now, from a regional perspective, the strongest growth was generated in the U.S. where business moved ahead by 10% in the quarter, driven by strong business expansion at CropScience and solid growth at both HealthCare and MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>In the emerging economies, we achieved a 7% sales increase. These markets accounted for 36% of group sales. The highest growth rates were in Latin America and Eastern Europe. The emerging Asia grew by 6% with China posting a 13% increase.</p>
          <p>On cash flow, <mark type="ph" /> gross (4:50) cash flow in the quarter declined by 20%, due especially to the high special charges. Net cash flow was down by 11% particularly on account of significantly higher tax payments in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt rose from &#x20AC;6.9 billion at the end of March to &#x20AC;7.9 billion on June 30. Cash provided by operating activities partly offset the outflows for the dividend and interest payments. In addition, the weak euro resulted in a higher disclosure of foreign currency debt.</p>
          <p>So let's now move on to the performance of our subgroups, beginning with HealthCare. Sales of the HealthCare subgroup increased by 4%. FX adjusted to &#x20AC;4.6 billion driven by the positive developments at both pharma and consumer health. From a regional perspective, business developed particularly well in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>At pharma, sales rose by 4% due to good business with the majority of our key products. Sales with Betaseron improved 10% on price increases and the release of provisions for discounts in the United States. Cogenate gained 4%, Nexavar and Aspirin Cardio both 8%, and Gluco by 3%.</p>
          <p>As expected, business with our YAZ Yasmin line of oral contraceptives was hampered by generic competition, especially in Western Europe and North America. Sales declined 6%. Revenues from Mirena increased significantly by 27%, mainly as a result of higher volumes and a major order in the United States. Levitra saw its sales down 17%, mainly due to weaker business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We are particularly pleased with the performance of Xarelto. We achieved sales of &#x20AC;68 million in the quarter, following market launches in further countries and the expansion of indications. From a regional perspective growth at pharma was achieved mainly in North America, where business was up 12%, and in the emerging markets, especially China. Overall, in the emerging markets business, moved ahead 9%. There was slight decreases in Europe, particularly in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA of pharma increased by 12% to &#x20AC;809 million. Earnings benefited from higher volumes and from positive currency effects. This effect was partly offset by increased expenses for the marketing of new products and investments in business development in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Sales in the consumer health segment rose by almost 4% in the quarter with our OTC pharmaceuticals in the consumer care division generating a 6% top-line expansion, our medical care division a 1% top-line expansion, and our animal health division 3%. Also, the consumer health segment developed especially well in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA of the consumer health segment came in at &#x20AC;439 million, 1% above the prior year quarter. The positive earnings contributions from higher sales were largely offset by higher market investment. The good business in the pharmaceutical segment and positive currency effects result in an improvement of the adjusted EBITDA of HealthCare by 8% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>So that was HealthCare, let's now move on to CropScience. Sales of the CropSciences subgroup advanced by almost 13% in the quarter to &#x20AC;2.3 billion, thus continuing the strong business momentum of the first quarter. We once again saw particularly strong growth in North America due especially to the realignment of our own marketing activities. Business in Europe and in Latin America, Africa and Middle East also showed a good development while sales rose moderately in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>Crop protection sales advanced 14%. Nearly all business units saw double-digit growth rates. The expansion of business with seed treatment products was particularly strong following a moderate performance in the preceding quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales of crop protection in Europe rose by almost 11% with the fungicide, seed treatments and herbicides businesses posting excellent growth. Sales of insecticides remained level year-on-year. CP sales in North America improved by a considerable 22% where we achieved double-digit growth rates in all business units with insecticide sales expanding particularly strongly compared with the prior year.</p>
          <p>CP sales in the Asia Pacific region grew by 4%. We significantly improved sales in Australia and India while business in Japan and Thailand was down against strong prior year level. Sales in the Latin America, Africa, Middle East region moved forward by 13%. We registered the strongest gains in Brazil where business with seed-treatment products doubled. Sales of insecticides rose sharply. Fungicides also developed positively mainly in corn cultivation.</p>
          <p>BioScience expanded sales by 21%. We achieved the strongest sales growth in North America due mainly to significant growth in volumes in broad-acre crops. Our cotton seed brands, Stoneville and FiberMax boasted particularly strong performance. Sales of our vegetable seeds business declined slightly. Sales of the environmental science business unit moved back by 4%. This decline was attributable to weaker business with both professional users and products for private customers especially in Europe and Japan.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA, advanced in CropSciences by 17% to &#x20AC;549 million driven by higher volumes and higher prices. Progress made with our efficiency improvement programs also had a positive effect on earnings.</p>
          <p>So now let's move to MaterialScience where sales advanced 2% in the quarter to almost &#x20AC;3 billion. This growth was the result of slightly higher selling prices and small volume increases. The polyurethane business unit raised sales by 7%. All product groups contributed to this growth with higher volumes and prices. Volumes expanded primarily in Asia Pacific and Latin America, Africa and Middle East while we achieved price increases in nearly all regions.</p>
          <p>The polycarbonates business unit, however, posted sales down 10%. This was attributable above all to lower selling prices. Volumes were 3% down mainly as a result of volume declines in Europe. Sales in the CAS business, coatings, adhesives and specialties business unit moved forward by almost 3%, driven by higher prices. Volumes came in at the prior year level.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA of the MaterialScience subgroup increased by 3.5% to &#x20AC;385 million largely as a result of higher selling prices, savings generated by efficiency improvement programs and positive currency effects. By contrast, higher raw material costs had a negative impact on earnings.</p>
          <p>So on the outlook. Following the good operating performance in the first half of 2012, we are also confident for the second half of the year. In addition, we are benefiting from a favorable currency environment. Against this background, we are raising our sales and adjusted earnings forecast for the full year as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>For the group, we are now anticipating a currency and portfolio adjusted sales increase of between 4% to 5%, versus previously, just 3%. We now plan to increase EBITDA before special items by a high single digit percentage compared to our previous plan of a slight improvement and core earnings per share are expected to improve at about 10% versus the slight improvement previously.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we are a little bit more optimistic about the developments at HealthCare. We now expect sales to increase by between 3% and 4%, and we plan to improve adjusted EBITDA by a mid to high single digit percentage to which positive currency effects will contribute.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are raising our outlook for CropScience significantly. We now anticipate organic sales growth of approximately 10% versus mid-single digit increase previously, and adjusted EBITDA to improve by approximately 20% compared to a mid single-digit increase before.</p>
          <p>For MaterialScience in the third quarter of 2012, we aspire to achieve currency-and-portfolio-adjusted sales and EBITDA before special items at the level of the good second quarter. We plan &#x2013; we continue to plan for currency-and-portfolio-adjusted sales and EBITDA before special items in 2012 to remain level with the prior year 2011.</p>
          <p>So before opening the Q&amp;A session, let me just briefly summarize the main points again. First, we delivered record sales and very good operating performance in all subgroups in the second quarter. And we are optimistic for future developments and are raising our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>So this concludes my remarks and we would now be happy to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Jeremy Redenius of Sanford Bernstein. Please state your name and company name followed by your question, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Thanks for taking the questions today.</p>
          <p>First of all on MaterialScience, is there anything other than economic uncertainty in Europe that's prevented from raising the full year guidance? Because if we assume you meet your third quarter guidance, the fourth quarter would have to be almost as bad as last year's fourth quarter to not beat the full-year guidance? And within MaterialScience, I'm also wondering did BSF's downtime in polyurethanes give you a one-time benefit?</p>
          <p>And the second's in CropScience. Could you talk about how the crop protection business in Latin America is developing as we move into the third quarter, please? And then finally in North America, the dry weather and damaged crop, have you &#x2013; do you run the risk of high chemical inventory as a result of that? And if so, what are the ways you could manage that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the question. Thanks, Jeremy. On the MaterialScience guidance and then, Sandy Peterson, will talk about CropScience just to answer your questions. I think the situation is rather uncertain in the economy. And even though we are encouraged by the performance of MaterialScience in the second quarter, we chose to be careful and maintain our guidance at the previous level. We still have a half year to go and now, it is an uncertain economic environment as we can read every day in the papers. So prudence drove us to keep the guidance where it is at the moment. Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy, thanks for your question. As it relates to Latin America, at the moment, we are through the period that we had in the earlier part of the year of having a drought in Latin America. We'll talk about the U.S. where obviously it's a very different situation. So all indications at the moment are that the Latin American marketplace should have a relatively normal season.</p>
          <p>The one wild card in Latin America is given what's going on with commodity prices in North America and the situation in North America, farmers are still marking decisions and choices between soy beans, cotton and corn. But most of the trade-off quite honestly is between soy beans and cotton.</p>
          <p>So that has &#x2013; that may have some impact on the business at the back half of the year. But at the moment, our best sense is that the marketplace is still relatively robust and we should have a relatively normal season in Latin America in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As it relates to your question about what's going on in the United States specifically. I'd say a couple of things. Obviously, the drought has had an impact on what people are actually doing today, the farmers are doing today, in terms of spraying fungicides on the ground.</p>
          <p>As you know, the season started early so what that meant for us in particular is things like fungicide sprays and herbicides pre-season actually got on the ground earlier than it would have in another kind of market environment. So we also have looked at the best estimate we have at the moment on consumption data. And the consumption data that we have indicates that earlier in the season than normal, we're seeing a lot of the stuff getting into the farmer's fields and getting on the ground.</p>
          <p>But the reality is we are not going to actually have a very good view and transparency to what is in the channel until towards the end of the third quarter where we actually do a true-up on the season. And at that point in time we'll have a much better sense of how much is left in the channel versus how much has actually been used in the marketplace, and what products actually got in the ground and what didn't. So there is some risk of some fungicides being left in the channel. Who's they are and where they are is a question mark that we won't have real full visibility and transparency to until probably the very beginning of the fourth quarter, end of the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jeremy, I'll &#x2013; Patrick will answer your question on the <mark type="ph" /> BSF (20:19) situation impact on our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeremy as you know these plants are shutdown on planned basis and when the plant fails, and I don't think the situation during the second quarter was particularly unusual. I think if you looked at the polycarbonate business and clearly we had a lot of extra capacity coming on stream particularly from Saudi Kayan and Mitsubishi which did have an effect in the polycarbonate pricing arena. But on the polyurethanes side I'd say it's relatively normal in any quarter to have some of the assets around the world shut down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry on polyurethanes then as well you said it looked normal from BSF news, it was essentially planned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It was essentially planned. So I think the market factored that in. I think other plants were running which weren't running before, so I think not any one quarter one of the competitors will have plants down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, this is Rashie in for Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my question. With one thing if you could share the mix of your geographic sales breakdown with us? I'm particularly interested in U.S., Japan, rest of Asia-Pac and important new markets. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I'll be pleased to do so. First of all, we see the United States 12.9% increase, which gets us to overall sales level of &#x20AC;52 million in the second quarter of this year. And Japan is &#x20AC;29 million. China is &#x20AC;19 million.</p>
          <p>We have France and Italy with &#x20AC;12 million and &#x20AC;11 million each. And we have for the first time a bit more significant volume also in Latin America with Brazil at &#x20AC;5 million and Mexico at &#x20AC;4 million. Overall, the emerging markets altogether have a sales volume of &#x20AC;62 million in the first &#x2013; in the second quarter of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You have identified two one-time items in the second quarter, in the sense of a provision release for Betaseron and a large, one-time order for Mirena. I wonder if you could, excluding those, give us some sense of the underlying position? And whether there was &#x2013; one would imagine that both of those being positive, flew straight through to the bottom line from the top line?</p>
          <p>Could you also please just update us on your plans of building infrastructure? Where you're at in terms of getting ready for new launches? In particular, EYLEA, which I see you'll be launching in Australia in the second half of this year? Should we expect to see a materially higher SG&amp;A in 2013 than 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jo, thanks for the question. Yeah, you're right. I mean we had two significant one times for Betaseron and for Mirena, as Marijn mentioned.</p>
          <p>The underlying trends differ a little bit. For Betaseron, you could see a 10% growth in the second quarter, which doesn't reflect the underlying trend. We have been guiding for Betaseron for mid to high single digit decline this year, which is not going to be obviously the guidance anymore for the full year.</p>
          <p>We would now assume full-year sales for Betaseron to be around flat. That doesn't change the overall &#x2013; let's say volume development for Betaseron, which is still negative in the mid single digits.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we see a little bit of an improvement here. You may have seen Novartis Extavia sales which are negative in the second quarter. So maybe there is a little bit of market share regain for us. But I mean we'll have to see how the rest of the year develops. But overall, we would think that sales for Betaseron should be flattish for 2012 and then decline again in the mid single digits thereafter.</p>
          <p>Mirena has a very positive underlying trend, that's not only in the U.S. but also in the rest of the world. Obviously, there is significant deal that we could conclude in the second quarter <mark type="ph" /> which influence (25:05) especially the U.S. numbers, but also the rest of the world is in the high single digits growth. So overall, we think that the guidance of high single, low double digit sales for Mirena can certainly be met. And I would think that for the full year, we should be in the double-digit range for Mirena.</p>
          <p>Now with regard to SG&amp;A and infrastructure. Yes, we have quite a number of launches coming up. I mean you mentioned earlier, we would also next year think that Regorafenib and Alpharadin could be launched. So overall, there are obviously preparations ongoing.</p>
          <p>You will not see that much of an impact in 2012 because as you know, <mark type="ph" /> and here (25:40) is a relatively limited sales force effort. It is certainly existing, but when you compare it to Xarelto it's a totally different ball game. But nevertheless, we are preparing for that adequately, which led us to the guidance that we had for this year, which indicates for pharma, just a small, low single-digit increase in EBITDA. Margin-wise, you will probably not see a significant impact whatsoever. If anything, the margin overall, also due to currency effects, is probably going to stay flat.</p>
          <p>For 2013, it's a little bit too early to give a guidance, but obviously, we will make adequate investments in these launches to make sure that they are successful.</p>

          <p>Just so I understand that, the provision release for Betaseron, that reflects the fact that you didn't have to give discounts, because actually Betaseron wasn't growing as much as you might've expected? Or why was there a provision release?</p>

          <p>The next question is from Fabian Wenner of Kepler. Please state your name and company name followed by your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First for Marijn and then for Patrick. In the strategy slides in May, you mentioned you want to leverage the gas-phase technology in TDI. I just wondered whether you can give us an update of how you intend to do that. I'm asking since Sabic obviously in February kind of announced the partnership with Mitsui and not with Bayer. Does that mean you basically are not thinking about leveraging through partnering? Is that excluded?</p>
          <p>Second question, to Werner, you retired about &#x20AC;2.7 billion of debt in H1. And by year end, your net debt to EBITDA is going to be around 0.7, and that's very comfortable for you. A-minus rating obviously. But do you see any opportunity to enhance returns from the current low interest rates?</p>
          <p>And last question, for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:55) maybe, can you give us any update on Alpharadin and maybe Regorafenib as well. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. The first question on TDI leverage, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Fabian. Yeah, the new TDI gas phase technology goes up and running in China at the moment. And we're still learning more and more from the technologies as we get the plant running at a faster and faster rate. So that is a success.</p>
          <p>And we're leveraging that primarily into Europe, where we just got the first permit approvals for constructing a sister plant in Germany, which will then replace our two older facilities. That will allow us to improve our cost efficiency quite dramatically in our old two European operations by closing them and replacing them with the new technology.</p>
          <p>The second question you asked, related to the joint venture that was announced between I think Sabic and Sinopec in China, which was to look at polycarbonate technology, polycarbonate capacity. It's something we continuously evaluate, of course, but at the moment we don't see the intrinsic benefits in partnering on one particular product stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Patrick. Just to follow-up on that. It's a partnership between Mitsui and Sabic for TDI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yeah. Sorry, I was on the other end of your collaboration, sorry. Yeah, but TDI is a technology collaboration. So this is where Mitsui are licensing their technology, which I guess is relatively small-scale. And they are, I guess, are doing that for tax reasons, by licensing to Sabic.</p>
          <p>Sabic have stated for many years that they intend to try and acquire this technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Something like that is out of the question for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we would not license this TDI gas phase technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then Werner about enhancing returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Fabian, thanks for the question. That's something which we are, of course, are thinking about as well.</p>
          <p>But first of all, I'd like to comment on your net debt projection for the company. You mentioned &#x20AC;4.7 billion. That is a figure which is not familiar to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x20AC;2.7 billion, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But at the end of the year, you said &#x20AC;4.7 billion we would reach in net debt &#x2013; or did I misunderstand you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I said net debt to EBITDA is going to be 0.7. Sorry for the misquote.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So it looks like our net debt position at the end of the year is going to go below our 2011 level. That means that it's slightly higher than what we guided for at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>The reasons are certainly related to the business expansion, specifically in <mark type="ph" /> crop year (30:55), we traditionally have a very high working capital tied up in the business, so that's the downside of that very, very positive development.</p>
          <p>We have on top of that, our overall debt position. There, of course, you also have to include the changes in our pension provisions. And only in quarter two, given the very low interest rates we currently see, that pension provision has increased by &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>So if you look at our overall debt position, which is critical for our rating, you have to take the two into account. And it's kind of &#x2013; it sounds like a broken record. We do not have as much flexibility as you might think by just looking at our net financial debts. Yet still we do have liquidity which is building up based on our free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>And as usual, there are multiple opportunities what we can do with the money. We can certainly &#x2013; we will look at, as part of our dividend guidance, into increasing our dividends. It's going to stay within the 30% to 40% range of our core EPS. I don't see us de-lever much further, but rather we might also look at generating higher returns by selectively funding our unfunded pension obligations. That is something we are currently looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Fabian, this is Jurgen. I'm going to take your questions on Alpharadin and Regorafenib. Actually, there is not that much news at the moment to be reported on both products.</p>
          <p>As you know, we indicated that we are planning for second half filing for Alpharadin and that's still the case. In addition to that, we are preparing for a number of additional studies, which we want to start next year, where we will look at monotherapy and also combination therapies of Alpharadin at different stages of prostate cancer patients.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, for Regorafenib, again, also no significant news. The review process is ongoing. As you know, we got priority filings, so we would expect our priority review. We would expect the FDA for the colorectal indication to come up with a decision before the end of the year. And we would expect the European decision in the first or second quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>So overall, both products for the time being on track. Just for Regorafenib, we can obviously only file in Europe once we have approval for colorectal, and we expect to file in the U.S. in the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Norbert Barth of Baader Bank. Please state your name and company followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello, Norbert Barth from Baader Bank, two questions concerning material signs.</p>
          <p>First of all raw material impact, you mentioned in Q2 still negative. Can you evaluate what the figure was? And am I right that going forward into Q3, there should be already a positive impact flowing from declining raw material impact? Is that right? Can you elaborate on that?</p>
          <p>And second question is generally concerning China chemical market environment. I was a little bit surprised to still see volume up. It looks like, in general, the Chinese market did not recover as it was expected at the end of first quarter. So have you a different situation there or can you elaborate a little bit on how the situation is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I take the numbers, Norbert, from sequential causes, then the raw material effect and energy price effect was about &#x20AC;25 million negative sequentially, quarter one to quarter two. And I'd expect a positive benefit going into quarter three of roughly double that number.</p>
          <p>But a significant part of that will be in propylene. The main feedstock we're seeing price reductions on is propylene, and propylene finds its way through to product price very quickly. So this is a margin that is passed on very, very quickly when you see propylene price rises. So roughly, I would say 60% of that improvement that I'm forecasting for quarter three will be passed through to the market on a relatively quick basis because of the pricing mechanisms for propylene oxide and for polyether polyols.</p>
          <p>On your question for China, I guess there's a couple of things that we see going on in China. First is the Chinese government is doing selective stimulus to the economy. We see a lot of infrastructure projects that were frozen being released, and that's positive from the point of view of the coatings business.</p>
          <p>The regional subsidies are coming into place for the appliance industry again. The appliance industry suffered a lull in quarter one and in quarter two, and now we're seeing some of the regional governments promoting efficiency in the food chain, and therefore, refrigerator production. And we believe the next area that we'll get some stimulus &#x2013; there's some talk of this &#x2013; will be the automotive industry because of a high installed capacity and the desire to get more environmentally acceptable vehicles on the road.</p>
          <p>The sector that's not getting any support at all is the housing sector. But the infrastructure projects are certainly getting some support from a construction sector point of view, but domestic housing is not.</p>
          <p>I think there are discussions going on in the government and in the regions about further stimulus. But there's absolutely no doubt that the high level of discussion about the quoted 7.5% growth in GDP in quarter two suggests, even in China, that there's some suspicion that that number may not be terribly accurate.</p>
          <p>And that's probably my best overview on China that I can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ronald Kohler of MainFirst. Please state your name and company followed by your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Ronald Kohler from MainFirst. Actually I have three questions.</p>
          <p>The first question is on currency effects. Actually your currency effect in Q2 was around &#x20AC;70 million was lower than the &#x20AC;85 million you stated in Q1, despite that obviously the currency on the top line was much more beneficial. So a little bit of explanation on that would help. And then obviously hedging might be the explanation. So the question is, going forward for the second half year, would you expect the positive effect on EBITDA to improve significantly based on today's currency rates, given that potentially hedging is rolling over or at least having a less limiting effect here?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Bayer CropScience in Brazil. Obviously, every eyes are now on Brazil. Everyone is expecting a very strong season. The question is a little bit what are your expectations, especially looking at your new products like <mark type="ph" /> Fox (38:31) and others. So I guess you might continue to outperform the market as you did in the first half year? Or what would be your, let's say, internal expectation in Brazil? And a little bit in outlook on pricing in Brazil would be also appreciated given your discount strategy on your new products.</p>
          <p>A last question actually on LEMTRADA co-promotion. Could you give us any insight now as we're becoming closer to potential launch? What's your strategy here to work together with Sanofi? That's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we'll start with Werner and the currency effect also going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ronald, first of all, your assumption that some of that currency improvement has been driven by hedging is correct, even though that's not the only explanation.</p>
          <p>The second explanation is driven by the business mix and the structure of our business. Also the seasonality of our crop business. We reported positive currency effects for BMS and for HealthCare for the quarter, yet for CropScience, the net currency effect was negative bottom line, even though we saw a positive effect on the top line. So all of those factors are weighed in.</p>
          <p>As we move into the second half of the year, yes we built the &#x2013; based on quarter two and currencies, stronger currency support than what we have seen in the first half of the year. Giving you some sensitivity around currency, if currency is moved by one percentage point across the entire basket of our currencies, that would translate into a &#x20AC;30 million bottom line effect, EBITDA effect by the end of the year or the second half of the year. Yeah, so a 1% move of the entire basket results in a &#x20AC;30 million variation on EBITDA level and top line is about &#x20AC;128 million, &#x20AC;130 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I rightly understand, that is just for the second half year or the half year effect or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No that is for the second half, the sensitivities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you would take the last six months and you look at a currency variation of one percentage point based on quarter end 2000 &#x2013; second quarter closing rates, that gives you a positive or negative depending on the currencies move, effect of &#x20AC;130 million top line, &#x20AC;30 million bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to understand it, on a full year basis it would be then twice as high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Full year basis, a percentage move is about &#x20AC;60 million. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. So Sandy, Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you know, we had a very strong first half of the year in Brazil and we outperformed the market both second quarter and actually the half year. Our growth rate was about 30% so we're confident we actually gained significant share in the first half of the year despite some of the challenges with the drought. Our expectation is that we'll be able to continue that positive momentum in the second half of the year. As you know, we are already in the process of doing a lot of pre-ordering of lots of our products, not just the fungicides but also we've had very strong growth in insecticides and herbicides and seed treatment in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So our expectation is that we should have an equally strong above-market performance in the second half of the year. Our expectation is if you look at the &#x2013; our portfolio in totality both, if you look at the seeds and trade business as well as the older chemistry as well as the newer chemistry, that we should be able to continue to generate value by how we actually do pricing across that portfolio in the back half of the year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean actually that you expect pricing levels at a similar increase like in the first half year in Brazil or any major difference here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expectation at the moment is actually we should be able to see better pricing in the second half of the year than we saw in the first half of the year, just because of where the market is in the second half of the year and what the portfolio looks like in the second half of the year. And as you know, our first season of Fox was extremely positive and there is very high demand for that product. So our ability to sustain very strong margins in that product we're more bullish about than we were at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then, Jurgen, LEMTRADA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding LEMTRADA, as you know, we have executed our co-promotion rights for this product, and as you also know, we have a significant presence in the market with Betaseron which we obviously want to build on. And we are discussing with Sanofi as to how best to do this in order to create value for both companies. That's all I can comment on at the moment. So the closer we get to the launch maybe I can say a little bit more there.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, one add-on question, your Bayer MaterialScience, the principle of force majeure is now obviously lifted but it was four weeks down. Was there any, let's say, more significant impact in Q2 or will there be anything in Q3?</p>

          <p>The next question is from Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Please state your name, company, followed by your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. A couple of pharma-related questions please. First one just on the emerging markets, I just wonder if you could comment on how sustainable that 9% growth is. What you're seeing across your basket of emerging market exposure and how you think that will develop going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly just in &#x2013; on Europe, just how the pricing situation or price pressure you might think would develop in the second half? We're seeing from other companies the idea that some of the Southern European countries might put some more price pressure or more price controls in place. What's your perspective please?</p>
          <p>And then finally on Nexavar, just how the adjuvant trial is progressing? Is it still reasonable to think of a readout for back end of the fourth quarter? Just your expectations there please. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Richard. Ulrich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the emerging markets, as you have seen in the numbers, we had very healthy growth overall in that region again. Obviously, we see differences depending on the region. So traditionally, we are strong in China and that continues to be the case. When you look at the rest of Asia Pacific, obviously there are countries like South Korea where there is negative growth at the moment based on price decreases that happened in this country last year.</p>
          <p>When you look at Latin America, there is a mixed picture as well. I mean Brazil has not been developing so dramatically positive over the first six months as many people would have expected. However, we are optimistic going forward. So overall, I would say that our expectation for our growth in the emerging markets is roughly at the level that we are at the moment. It may change a little bit country by country. But overall, we are relatively optimistic as we have been in the past.</p>
          <p>Regarding Europe, we have &#x2013; as you could see in the number, we have a slight negative growth in Europe overall that is true for healthcare overall but it's also true for pharma; pharma a little bit  stronger. We see a negative impact of healthcare reforms in Europe. We would expect that to be at a level of around &#x20AC;60 million for the whole year. Yes, we also see, especially in Italy, some further negative activities in the second half of the year. Spain at the moment is not so clear but at the moment we think that that may have been it for at least this year. Or &#x2013; we also expect like many of our colleagues in other companies a single digit negative or small single-digit negative impact in Europe.</p>
          <p>However, you also need to see that that is to a large extent compensated by new product rollouts especially Xarelto, I mean which we have not even launched, at least not really launch neither in Spain nor in France. Yes, we have started to offer it but obviously, as you know, August is not a good month to launch any of these products in Southern European countries. But in September, we will put full pressure behind Xarelto especially in Spain and France. That we have now also a price plan for these countries. So, that should support our business in Europe overall.</p>
          <p>Regarding Nexavar, relative for the time being, I believe we will still stick to the timelines that we have been giving before. But obviously, the closer it gets to the end of the study, the more precise it can be.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank and thanks for taking my questions, and three if I may. And starting off with a question on ConsumerHealth, and you guide for a high single digit increase in adjusted EBITDA percentage-wise for the ConsumerHealth segment, it was only up around 3.6% in the first half of 2012. So do I have to see the EBITDA margin in Q2 more of an outlier? And if so, what was the reason for that?</p>
          <p>And then two short product related questions, one on Betaseron. I was just wondering whether you could provide any more details on the price increase you experienced in the U.S.. And then on Xarelto, could you potentially comment on the product uptake in the U.S. and how Xarelto was doing in particular versus Warfarin? That's helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you then, Ulrich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. ConsumerHealth. Yes, you're right. I mean we have relatively full development EBITDA-wise in ConsumerHealth in the second quarter but that had to do with significant investments that we're currently making in our presence in a number of emerging markets, for example, in China. We intensified our efforts. China has not been really in the focus of ConsumerHealth activities over the last few years.</p>
          <p>We are intensifying that now significantly, obviously also by adding capacities and improving our sales force. We also have a focus on Brazil where we keep on investing and we have a strong business in ConsumerHealth in Russia but also that needs further investment. So overall, you saw a peak of investment in the second quarter that is a little bit of an outlier, otherwise we would not be able to get to the high single-digit overall guidance for the full year which I think will be feasible and can be achieved.</p>
          <p>Regarding Betaseron, yes I can give you some further detail on the price increases. Actually we did have a price increase for Betaseron in 2011, which was in September which was at the level of 5%, and then we had two price increases this year in January and in July at levels of 9% and again 5%. So that altogether leads to a significant, obviously, improvement of the performance.</p>
          <p>Xarelto in the U.S., obviously you would have to talk to our colleagues of J&amp;J who are very pleased with the performance of Xarelto and we share their pleasure there. What we see, especially with regard to Warfarin is that the rate of growth, volume growth for Warfarin comes down significantly since six to nine months. Whereas in the first half of last year, Warfarin volume was still growing. It's not anymore. And actually when you look at the last few months, Warfarin comes down at a level of 8% to 10% month-after-month. So the volume is declining, which actually, is a good indication that the only active components Xarelto and Xeractan really take now more and more market share.</p>
          <p>We see for Xarelto itself that we grow market share in the &#x2013; especially cardiology business month after month and week after week. So overall, we are quite happy with that performance.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Andreas Heine of Barclays. Please state your name, company and your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question on MaterialScience. Could you explain a little bit why the trend in the polyurethanes and polycarbonate when it comes to volumes is so different and give some outlook what you see in the business trends in the third quarter and whether price increases in MDI and TDI are still possible?</p>
          <p>And on the CropScience area, you were mentioning that Belt was very successful in the U.S. Is there a special reason why you mentioned Belt in the U.S. but not in Asia? What I would assume is a good area for insecticides?</p>
          <p>And also, on X-Pro and Prosaro, the active ingredients are not that new. But this formulation is probably very valuable. What is the reason that this is growing now so strongly all over the place and has not so much in recent years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrick, the MS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Andreas thank you for this question. This is &#x2013; looking at first the difference in polycarbons and polyurethanes. In the polycarbonates market in quarter one and quarter two, we saw new competitive material coming into the marketplace primarily from Saudi Kayan and also from Mitsubishi. We also saw traders destocking significantly because of concerns about the market in quarter two.</p>
          <p>So we saw quite a lot of extra material coming in. Most of that material was going into the ODS, optical data storage and extrusion markets. So there was a quite a lot of disruption in what I call the commodity end of the polycarbonates business. And we followed a value before volumes strategy in that case and remixed our portfolio which you can see from the pricing movements in PCS.</p>
          <p>I think on MDI and TDI, there was limited capacity additions. There was some bottlenecking that's going on but generally the markets remained fairly tight during quarter two, and that's the reason for the difference you see in terms of their performance. In terms of trends looking forward, TDI prices went up significantly in quarter two. We would expect to see that hold during quarter three. I think the same is true of MDI, there was significant price increases achieved during quarter two and we now are seeing rollovers into quarter three for those pricing levels.</p>
          <p>And I think there is some fundamental drivers of growth that we see intact in, particularly MDI, where now the Chinese are beginning to release some of the new building permits for using polyurethane as a building insulation material in several of the provinces in China, which is a positive breakthrough for us as it allows us to expand our Chinese market for MDI. So that's my overall outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one question on polycarbonate, so the volume decline was more supply driven rather than that there is a decline in the overall demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think this was a combination of new material coming into the market finding a home at the bottom end of the market and us choosing to exercise value before volume strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sandy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on CropScience, couple things. As it relates to Belt, on a global scale in &#x2013; for the first half of the year, Belt's actually growth rate was over 80% year-over-year. So we had strong performance in Latin America and Asia but given that the vast majority in the first half of the year particularly the second quarter was the U.S.</p>
          <p>So it's not that it didn't grow in other places, it's just that it had particularly strong growth in North America. And we will see in the third quarter continued positive performance of Belt as we, or in the counter season in Latin America as well as in Asia in the back half of the year. So it's &#x2013; Belt's doing fine in Asia. It's just &#x2013; the North America, particularly the U.S. was particularly strong in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As it relates to X-Pro and Prosaro, so X-Pro was launched last year for the first time in the UK and in Germany. It was launched this year in France and it's &#x2013; so this is the first full year launch of that product in a number of markets in Western Europe. And so we're seeing the positive uptake of a new product in the marketplace which has very positive impact on keeping disease down but also having some positive yield impact.</p>
          <p>And in particular in the UK, given how wet it's been this year, there's been a very strong infestation of fungal diseases and so there's been a very heavy demand for that product which seems to  perform extremely well in the cereal marketplace. And Prosaro actually is similarly, in North America in particular, our go to market strategy with that product has been very effective and we're seeing very positive uptake of that product in North America as well. So in general, our fungicides are doing quite well across the globe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Damien Conover with Morningstar. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to circle back to Betaseron, just with two questions. One, when you are looking at your outlook for mid single-digit declines after 2012, can you kind of parse that out between pricing and potential volume losses to new entrants BG-12 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:46).</p>
          <p>And then a second question, just wondering if you've done any sort of pharma economic studies that look at the pricing potential in the U.S. to continue as we've seen the pricing in the Interferon market approaching 20% for several years with not much deceleration. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ulrich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's correct that obviously the overall <mark type="inaudible" /> (59:18) product is a mix of price and volume. What we see for Betaseron when you &#x2013; forget the U.S. for a moment, is continued decline in volume in the rest of the world and we see also in some of those countries pricing pressure. So we have a negative development for Betaseron still in 85% of our countries.</p>
          <p>But obviously the U.S. being 50% of our overall sales level for Betaseron has significant impact. So that's, but also in the U.S. we see negative volume development with Betaseron. That differs a little bit quarter-by-quarter but nevertheless volume comes down and we would expect that to continue to be the case.</p>
          <p>So regarding pricing sensitivity obviously, I mean the industry has been benefiting to large extent and over many years from the price flexibility that exists in the U.S. We will have to see how that's developed. So I believe for Betaseron and for the MS market overall, obviously the new interest did help to increase the flexibility that exists in this market. However, I believe that that is coming to a little bit of an end. I believe that we are getting at a, in a situation where there is not as much flexibility in the price anymore than it used to be over the last 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>We have to see what is feasible for us going forward. But overall, the guidance that we gave with this, a single digit mid single-digit decline indicates to you that we don't think that there is much of a pricing flexibility any more going forward.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Andrew Baum from Citi. A couple of questions, one for Kemal, many physicians have highlighted the lack of stability as being a potential concern for adopting the new antithrombotics. Could you just update us on your reversing agent and what are the clinical requirements in terms of end points in bringing such an agent to your market?</p>
          <p>And then second, with regard to your U.S. consumer business, could you outline what, if any, the withdrawal of Novartis' Excedrin has had on your aspirin franchise in that market?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the consumer health and Excedrin, well we have seen a little bit of a positive impact. On the other hand, not that much yet. Obviously, it's not only Excedrin, it's also Aleve that may benefit. We also have just recently launched a new pain medication that actually is pretty competitive to Excedrin which we think may see some uptake now in the second half of this year. So overall, impact so far has been very modest.</p>
          <p>Regarding reversibility and sector trend, I mean, as you know, we have been talking about a potential antidote here for a while. We are in the process of working out what exactly it would take. We have several approaches, which we haven't been talking that much in detail yet in the past and we are still not prepared to do this. Obviously, it's a hot field, there's a lot of debate at the moment. But what I can say is that in addition to a more specific action, there is also consideration to go for more let's say product potential agent but that is something where I think that in the first half of next year we have more clarity on.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lutz Gr&#xFC;ten, Commerzbank. Thanks for taking my question. I want to come back to the first question of the conference call. And want to phrase it completely the opposite regarding the guidance on MaterialScience for the full year effect the numbers on the EBITDA line have been down now after six months and you're guiding for flat EBITDA adjusted on a full-year base which implies an increase in the second half. What makes you so confident in a softening environment overall? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding Bayer CropScience and you mentioned efficiency improvements you have achieved in the second quarter in the first half. Could you give us a number here, which was achieved after six months and could you confirm the &#x20AC;150 million to come on a full-year base? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll quickly answer the question because obviously, you can look at this from two sides but the bottom line is that we kept material guidance where it is because of uncertainty of the economy. The comment was made that Q4 last year was relatively weak maybe there's some self infliction there in terms of how we ran our capacity at the end of the year. So we think this is all going to sort of average out or we don't see any significant indications one way or the other to change our guidance at this point. With that Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as it relates to the efficiency question as you know at the end of 2010 we announced that &#x20AC;265 million cost take out program that was to be completed by the end of 2012. We are more than confident that we're going to hit that number. We're actually slightly ahead of plan in total and also in terms of this year's number. So we're tracking very well and that's part of why we're seeing the positive performance on our bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's no number you can give us for the first six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you the number for the overall company and that is that annualized by end of quarter two we have realized a little bit more than &#x20AC;700 million out of the &#x20AC;800 million overall for the company. So &#x20AC;720 out of &#x20AC;800.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Three questions for you if I may. Firstly, on the YAZ litigation I think you've been quoted on the wire to say you believe you've provided for the large part of liability. Will you just give us some comfort that you believe the bulk of claims and therein any color on the rate which you're receiving new claims now versus let's say six months ago?</p>
          <p>And secondly on Xarelto ACS, just any updates just as to how discussions with the FDA are going, any part of the market which we should be aware of this indication in the U.S.? And then thirdly, you commented on Xarelto AS in the U.S. and a continued market share pick up in cardiologists, wondered if you could just provide some color in the PCP space and whether the Eloquest delay has had any benefit at all? The background for that question is at the New York Analyst Day, I think there was a suggestion that some PCPs may have been delaying converting from Warfarin in anticipation of Eliquis? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sachin. Werner will answer your YAZ litigation question and then J&#xF6;rg to the Xarelto question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sachin, thanks for the question. More than happy to do so. The &#x20AC;496 million provision we have taken covers the exposure which goes beyond our insurance coverage and the deductible we have already taken and it addresses all cases we know as of basic, basically the close, which we consider adversely of settlement. And these are only the cases we have incidentals of venous clots.</p>
          <p>It does not include two other classes which we would not sell. One is gall bladder diseases and stones. We don't see based on the studies projected. We don't see any relation to drospirenone-containing COCs. The other one is actually from the other groups which we do not consider to be settled either. So these are the conditions under which the provision has been established. The provision also covers our ongoing legal and defense cost going forward until the end of 2015.</p>
          <p>Now we come to the number of cases we receive. We had quite a high number of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:08:39) cases in the peak. That has come down significantly. I call it somewhere in the area of maybe 20% to a third we currently see versus the peak and that is 30 to 35 cases per week. These are the claims and out of these claims, we will then have to analyze how many of those relate to venous clots, so these are the number of claims which are handed in, not necessarily the ones which have a, venous clots.</p>

          <p>So, Sachin, regarding Xarelto, well, I kind of think it's much too early to write ACS off in the U.S. as you just questioned. I first &#x2013; I'm actually quite confident that that's going to go well at the end of the day. But I don't want to comment and I can't comment on what exactly is ongoing at the moment. You can assume that our colleagues at J&amp;J are working very closely with the FDA and is addressing the questions that they have raised. And I can't give you exact date of when the re-filing is going to take place but I can reassure you that the colleagues are working very diligently in making this possible as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>Regarding AS, yeah, I said the same comment that it will, especially the primary care physicians might wait for another product to reach the market. If that would have been the case, then you might have expected some uptake which is not the case. I think neither for the bigger drawn nor for us market share with the primary care physicians are pretty stable for both compounds now since a number of weeks. Maybe there's a little bit of an improvement week after week but it's still at relatively low levels. That's different than with cardiologists where we are still gaining market share and we have the major share of new patients getting on the tracks. But regarding PCPs, it's still at low levels.</p>
