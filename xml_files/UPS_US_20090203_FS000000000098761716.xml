          <p>Good morning. My name is Shelly, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions.] Thank you.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I am here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our outlook for 2009. Before we begin however, I'll review the Safe Harbor Language.</p>
          <p>Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the company's future performance or results of operations. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2007 10-K and 2008 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will compare results for 2008 against 2007, excluding the effects of adjustments that occurred in both years. This comparison is more reflective of UPS' true performance. There were two adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. The first was a $548 million goodwill impairment charge in our UPS freight unit, which is part of the Supply Chain &amp; Freight segment. This charge resulted from a number of factors: We acquired Overnite in 2005 when the economy was much stronger and valuations were higher. We then invested in technology and operational improvements to enhance service and performance and expand product offerings.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the current freight environment has been a challenging one for new investments and customer focus is primarily on price. Long-term, we believe our strategy is sound and will be viable when market conditions improve, but we felt it prudent to reevaluate the goodwill associated with this acquisition and make a reduction based on current market comparisons and cash flow outlook.</p>
          <p>The second adjustment recorded in the quarter was a $27 million write-down of intangibles in the U.K. domestic operations, included in the International Package segment. This relates to a domestic customer list, which was part of an acquisition. With the weak conditions in the U.K. and our emphasis on the export market, this domestic customer has proved to be of less value than estimated.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, if you remember, we recognized a $6.1 billion charge in the U.S. Domestic Package segment to withdraw employees from the Central States Pension Plan as part of our long-term labor contract with the Teamsters.</p>
          <p>Any reference Scott and Kurt make to full-year results excludes the impact of these adjustments as well as other charges in 2007 totaling $335 million. A reconciliation of these results is included with our earnings announcement this morning and appears on UPS' IR website in the Financial Information tab.</p>
          <p>Just a quick reminder; in December, based on customer considerations, we decided to suspend pick-ups on the day after Christmas. So we had one less operating day in the quarter than we had originally planned. We believe there was little if any volume lost in total. That's why when we talk about volume today we're speaking about overall totals, not average daily.</p>
          <p>Now to begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>What a difference a year makes. A year ago on the heels of momentum from our historic contract with the Teamsters we were optimistic about our prospects. Economists were predicting slow but growing U.S. GDP and industrial production. It was debated whether we were in or headed into a recession. Globally, experts questioned the decoupling theory. Very few saw what was about to unfold.</p>
          <p>2008 was very difficult; however, we responded well. Our operations team in the U.S. continued to adjust the network as package volume deteriorated under worsening economic conditions. In our International segment, export volume increased 6.8% as we benefited from the industries most diversified global network. The Supply Chain &amp; Freight segment posted a 5% annual operating margin. This was at the top of the range we had provided at the beginning of the year. Our strong balance sheet and ability to generate cash enabled us to weather the financial market meltdown. Clearly, we didn't meet all the goals we had set at the beginning of 2008, yet we still finish the year with an industry leading small package operating margin of 13%.</p>
          <p>Conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 continued to worsen. Industrial production fell, consumer spending dried up and economic hardship spread throughout the world. In previous recessions consumer spending remained steady, helping keep recessionary periods relatively short. This time, however, the consumer is not spending. Consequently, experts predict that this recession will be worse than any we've seen in several decades.</p>
          <p>We are adapting our company to the current environment. We are looking at everything: organizational structure, compensation, network configurations, products and services, how we do business, why we do it that way, what do we really need, what can we do without. We've made changes in the last six months in the way in which we operate. One of those changes involves revenue enhancement initiatives. Perhaps the most significant revenue opportunity stems from DHL's departure from the U.S. domestic market. We went after that business vigorously with a well-executed plan. We gained significant new volume as a result, and we have more opportunities in 2009 as we compete globally with them, particularly on volumes in and out of the U.S. As for the airlift contract we and DHL have been working on, negotiations are continuing, but with the reduced scale of the airlift need we are finding it very difficult to reach an agreement.</p>
          <p>Other changes we've made include reduction of non-operating expenses through district and corporate consolidations, and we've made adjustments in our ground and air networks worldwide to reduce costs and adapt to the market conditions. These initiatives total over $500 million and will partially offset the impact of continued economic weakness. In addition, we are freezing management wages, reducing other forms of compensation and suspending the company's 401(k) match and other benefits. However, I want to be clear; we will still make strategic investments that provide worldwide opportunities to grow UPS and strengthen the services and solutions we bring to our customers.</p>
          <p>We believe our strategy and business model are sound, and that UPS offers a vastly better value proposition to the marketplace than any of our competitors. Plans are in place to manage our costs while ensuring that we maintain high-quality service to our customers. In times of economic difficulty like today's environment, there is one certainty in business: When trends improve and they will, the landscape will be different. Some companies will be gone. Others will still be viable but damaged and no longer competitive leaders. UPS will emerge stronger, leaner, and more customer focused and well prepared to benefit from improving trends.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Kurt for a review of fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. Well, in short, UPS' results clearly reflected the fourth quarter economic conditions. All of our businesses were negatively impacted.  Earnings per share of $0.83 for the quarter, however, did enable us to achieve overall EPS of $3.50 for the year, within the range we provided to you over six months ago.</p>
          <p>I'll begin today's review with the Domestic Package operations. The 4.4% decline in total quarterly volume reflected a worsening of the economic trends we saw last year. UPS captured significant new volume as a result of DHL's departure from the U.S. domestic market. That volume, however, was not enough to offset declines from the economy.</p>
          <p>Revenue per piece was up marginally at 0.6% because of the shift away from premium products and lower average weights. Weight per piece declined almost 10% for air products and over 5% for ground packages in the quarter. This is by far the largest decline in weight we've seen this decade. The benefit we realized from the two-month lag in the fuel surcharge was more than offset by reduced volumes, lighter weights and declines in premium products. When we provided guidance back in the third quarter, there was an implied fuel surcharge lag benefit based on the forward curve. This lag actually provided an additional benefit of $0.10 per share over what we had expected.</p>
          <p>During December, we experienced a peak season that was very similar to last year, with shipping concentrated during the last week-and-a-half prior to Christmas. Based on what we learned in 2007, we brought on peak season helpers later this year, which allowed us to better manage the process. Our operations continue to adapt to the new environment. For the quarter, block hours were down mid single-digits, direct labor hours were down over 5% and miles driven declined by 4.5%, while service metrics continued at all-time highs.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we proceeded with numerous restructuring and network changes. We announced the closure of six district offices and the elimination of night sort operations at our regional air hubs in Dallas, Texas, and Columbia, South Carolina. All as part of a rigorous realignment of our air network. We also announced the closure of a large office facility in Georgia in an effort to consolidate our corporate functions. These moves are a part of an ongoing program to resize the organization to match the changed business environment.</p>
          <p>Now for a look at the International business. UPS benefits from very strong regional networks in all major areas of the world tied together by a global air network. This balanced presence is a competitive differentiator and one that we will continue to nurture with future investments. Export volumes increased by 1.6%; this is significantly below the 5% growth we had anticipated for the quarter, but it remains market leading. We saw weakness in the U.S. with mid single-digit export volume declines. Asia was also down slightly, although China achieved double-digit growth. Europe posted a mid-single digit improvement based on continued strong intra-regional growth, and Latin America experienced a double-digit volume gain.</p>
          <p>International operations are experiencing the same impacts as the U.S. small package business: declining average weight per package and a shift away from premium products. This shift was much more pronounced in the fourth quarter than we'd seen in prior quarters, as we helped our customers trade down, not out, of our comprehensive portfolio. These factors, along with the currency impact, contributed to a revenue per piece decline of over 8%. Removing currency, revenue per piece was down 3%. International operating margins declined to 14.9%.</p>
          <p>The positive impact on operating profit from fuel was more than offset by weakening global economic activity. For the quarter, the fuel surcharge lag provided a benefit of $0.02 per share over what we had expected when we provided guidance.</p>
          <p>We pointed out in the past that there are higher fixed versus variable costs in our international network and we're addressing this issue vigorously. We've identified opportunities to reduce block hours in our worldwide air network during 2009 without sacrificing service or footprint. In Europe, we're optimizing our ground network opportunities and have identified changes to be implemented in management and compensation of our outside service providers.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we will continue to move forward. Non-U.S. domestic expansion will occur where there is minimal investment required. An example is our recently announced expansion of domestic express pickup and delivery service to 16 additional countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. In the quarter, UPS also continued investing to support long-term growth opportunities. We opened our air hub in Shanghai and broke ground on our new intra-Asian hub in Shenzhen, China, that will be operational in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the Supply Chain &amp; Freight segment. Revenue declined 6.5%, operating margin was 2.6% for the quarter, but came in at 5% for the year, at the high end of the range we had targeted at the beginning of 2008. As Andy mentioned, we did take a $548 million impairment charge in UPS Freight, which experienced a disappointing fourth quarter. Declines in revenue and shipments reflected the very slow environment in the LTL sector. This poor performance severely impacted the operating profit for the segment, but for the year, UPS Freight did post a slight profit.</p>
          <p>Weight per shipment improved slightly, although shipments per day were down, and price has become a major headwind today as excess capacity causes carriers to pull the pricing lever to defend share. Market watchers are of the opinion that this is one of the worst LTL environments ever. To combat this situation, we are intensifying our focus on cross-selling the freight portfolio to our small package customers. We have rolled out an enhanced WorldShip platform that allows customers to seamlessly optimize the selection between our 100-weight package service and LTL. This tool can help save a customer 10 to 15% in shipping costs.</p>
          <p>Global forwarding experienced a step-down decline in revenue in November and December, reflecting the economy-driven decreases in demand for customers' products. However, profitability for this unit improved in the quarter as compared to last year. Weight per shipment declined and lower fuel surcharges had a negative impact on revenue for the quarter, a trend that we expect to continue into 2009.</p>
          <p>Our logistics operation performed quite well. Revenue increased in hi-tech and healthcare but was down in retail and industrial sectors. Service levels in this business remained very high, and profits continue to improve. Over the past several years, UPS has built a comprehensive supply chain management capability focused on the healthcare industry. Merck's selection of UPS to operate a significant portion of its U.S. distribution demonstrates the success that we are achieving in this market sector.</p>
          <p>Now for a recap of our end-of-year financial position. Even in the midst of the toughest environment in our careers, UPS remains rock solid. UPS generated flow from operations of $8.5 billion for the year. Our capital expenditures for 2008 were 2.6 billion, about 400 million less than we'd anticipated at the beginning of the year. This equates to approximately 5% of revenue, at the low end of our historical range. We paid $2.2 billion in dividends and 3.6 billion to repurchase 53.6 million shares. We did slow our 2008 stock repurchase program when the long-term debt market became volatile. With the dramatic changes in the economy during the year and continuing economic uncertainty, we will be particularly prudent in our financial management. We will continue repurchases, but at a significantly reduced rate. One of the defining characteristics of our business has always been UPS' ability to generate cash flow, and 2008 was no exception, with free cash flow of $5.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now a quick update on our funds flow from operation to total debt metric. We targeted a range of 50 to 60% that we would reach by the end of 2009, and we finished 2008 at 68%. We'll continue working towards that range. As Scott said, everything is being evaluated, from a financial as well as an operational perspective. We will manage the business in light of today's realities, but also to make sure that we are in position to capitalize on opportunities as they materialize.</p>
          <p>Now for some insights into 2009. We have our work cut out for us this year, which will likely be even more difficult than 2008. With forecasters not anticipating any real economic recovery until 2010, UPS earnings for 2009 will suffer. Because of the amount of uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions, it is premature to give full-year guidance. If we did, it would have to be a very wide range, which in our opinion is not helpful. Instead, we will provide earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year, which we expect will be between $0.52 and $0.68 per share. The first quarter will be weak, with slight improvements later in the year as initiatives take hold.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2008 our pension plan funding levels were down substantially from the previous year in concert with the decline seen in the investment markets. Although these plans remain well funded, we will experience a pension expense increase that will have a drag of approximately $0.10 per share for the year. Another impact on the year involves fuel surcharges. When they were rapidly escalating, in some case we discounted base rates in order to preserve the surcharges. Now, as they have fallen, it will take time to cycle through the contract negotiation process to pull back some of those base rate discounts. We believe this will be an impact throughout 2009.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, average daily volume in the domestic operation is expected to decline between 3 to 5%. We anticipate package weight will remain lighter than our historical averages until the economy begins to rebound. International export volumes should be down somewhat for the quarter. The Supply Chain &amp; Freight segment should post an operating margin similar to that of the fourth quarter, with UPS Freight particularly challenged through 2009.</p>
          <p>Over the longer term, we are evaluating operational changes that would leverage our small package forwarding and freight ground assets in the U.S. in an effort to capitalize on network economies of scale. Ultimately it's our plan to generate operational changes through both better alignment of our networks and asset utilization. With respect to capital expenditures, our budget for 2009 will be $2.2 billion, some 400 million less than 2008's total. At less than 5% of revenue, this will be the lowest we've seen this decade.</p>
          <p>So while the current outlook is sobering, to say the least, we are taking measures to strengthen the company while focusing on helping our customers survive today's economic difficulties. These steps will help UPS preserve its financial strength and enhance its leadership position in the industry.</p>
          <p>Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we have a question from Justin Yagerman from Wachovia Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning guys. This is Rob Salmon on for Justin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And guys, could you guys give us a sense of the, in the prepared remarks you'd indicated that the pricing trends were stable in the small &#x2013; in the domestic small parcel. Could you give us a sense sort of how the pricing trends were throughout the quarter? Particularly after, you know, DHL had made their announcement, if you guys had seen a step-up in terms of pricing? And if you could give us the actual price per package for each month and as well as January, it would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I won't get into that granular of detail. But certainly we do see over time improved pricing power in the industry. At the same time the dramatic changes in fuel surcharges are creating a lot of moving parts. So it is going to be challenging I think externally to fully be able to map all of those factors. In general we do feel that the pricing environment is very rational. Certainly the DHL exit has a big impact on the market. Their volume is, however, lighter weight than average and most likely at a lower average revenue per piece, although clearly, as we have priced these DHL customers, we are extracting appropriate premium for UPS's service and quality.</p>
          <p>So it will be a year of transition, but overall we remain resolute in being disciplined for pricing, and as the fuel surcharge impact filters through we think it'll be evident that the market is very rational.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys, that's helpful. And then shifting gears a little bit to the capital expenditure side of things. Could you give us a sense, in terms of your share repurchase plan, you'd indicated that you would scale it back significantly, kind of what that means and how we should be thinking about the repurchase throughout 2009? As well as if you could give us a sense what your thoughts are on the dividend here as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll &#x2013; I'll talk a little bit about CapEx and then Scott will talk to divided policy. I mean right now, the mantra has been conserve capital. Given the current uncertainty, our balance sheet remains a thing of beauty and is an absolute strength for us that we intend to protect. So we are being prudent. We did slow the stock repurchases. We do remain committed to repurchasing and retiring shares over time, but we also want to make sure that we preserve our liquidity and flexibility. We did, as you could see, take aggressive steps to reduce capital expenditures, pulling back really to just committed deliveries of assets, completing our Worldport hub expansion, which is one of the things that's allowing us to make such dramatic improvements in our air network. So we will be very prudent and cautious on that. But still with a strong AA rating we've got plenty of horsepower and I'll turn it over to Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Kurt, you said it pretty well. We continue &#x2013; our chance to continue to reward our shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in 2009, even in this economic environment. I think Kurt said earlier that likely share repurchases will be a smaller amount. I think that is prudent based on what's gone on in the credit markets; we are seeing some stabilization in the credit markets recently.</p>
          <p>As far as dividend policy, it's determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors, but I will remind you that despite earnings being down about 15% in 2008 versus 2007 that our free cash flow was outstanding at $5.7 billion, so the cash position is great. We will take a look at that; the Board meets actually next week and normally it looks at dividend policy at that point in time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wondered if you could just shed a little bit more light on the change in weight per package. Kurt, you said it. DHL was a lower weight competitor. How much of what you're experiencing is just mix and picking up that volume and how much of it is customer mix and what should we expect looking forward? I mean, with industrial economy doing what it's doing, should we expect the weight problem to get worse during the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one of the first times I've heard a weight problem being losing weight, but in this case I guess it makes sense. The majority of it is the economic cycle, and we've been talking to that the last three or four quarters. So clearly in slow economic times, there are just plain less widgets per box, and so the average weight of each package does tend to drift down.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we did see an acceleration in that in the fourth quarter and certainly we think some of that acceleration is market share gain from DHL. It's still a moving target, DHL really is just &#x2013; has just wrapped up their domestic operations, so it's too soon for us really to characterize that or give you any specifics on the impact. But we do think that that will continue to bring volume to our network, but in some cases a lower weight than average. We did see the same trends internationally, where the weight shifts were substantial and certainly that's primarily economically driven right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then as you think about the actions that you're taking to resize the networks, segment reductions, compensation changes, et cetera. Is there a way for us to think about how much of that was completed and in place within the fourth quarter results that we've already seen and how much is yet to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the 500 million in network changes, operational changes and some of those, the majority of that is still rolling out. Certainly there was some portion of that towards the end of the year, but I would say the majority is still to be realized. The compensation changes that we announced that are in addition to that really don't begin to kick in until March, which is our normal annual pay cycle. So there's certainly still benefits to come from that and we will both extract the benefits out of that, and frankly, we're busy working on continued reviews of initiatives all across the company. It's a top priority for us and we're going to make sure the company stays in good shape.</p>

          <p>And we've had a hiring freeze on throughout most of 2008 and all that benefits with attrition, as people leave the payroll, we don't replace those people. And Kurt mentioned in his earlier comments that, remember, that we're managing our workforce every day and you saw that in the last quarter where direct labor hours were down more than volume, 5.1% versus 4.4%. So we'll continue to manage the variable cost on a daily basis. We are &#x2013; some of the organizational structure changes, we made some of them last year, we made some of them effective in January, where we took down six more district offices, which will help our organization moving forward. So I think that some of it you saw in 2008, but a lot of it is coming in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks. Scott, when you think about right sizing the network, and let's call it you're giving guidance of negative three to five in domestic and slightly negative in international, let's call it negative low something for the rest of the year. Can you catch up, I mean, by third, fourth quarter assuming we don't go from negative three or five to negative ten, if it just stays in that range? Can you start to see the margin year-over-year improve, or do you just, that's impossible the way the network is over that period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be very difficult to improve the margins, Ed, if we have a declining economy. We're going to do everything we can to hold the margins the best we can, but it's with a mix of the products, and as Kurt talked about the huge drop in weight in the products we saw in the fourth quarter it's likely to continue the first half of the year. I think it's going to be a challenge for us to do that. We are going to do everything in our power and we're going to presume the economy keeps getting worse. Frankly, I think the economy is going to &#x2013; you're going to see the biggest drop in the first quarter of '09, even worse than the down 3.8% and down 6% IP numbers we saw on the fourth quarter. Second quarter probably negative not quite as bad and it's not unrealistic to say it's going to flatten out at the end of the year, the economy, but we're going to manage it as if it's going to stay at the first and second quarter levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If domestic and international volume are both negative, should we assume international margins deteriorate more given the fixed cost nature of it and that they're coming from higher places?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, we're really not in a position to go too far on outlook right now. Clearly, there is a higher portion of fixed costs, but we're taking some pretty dramatic steps to take that cost out. I guess one silver lining, if you will, since you're pining for some good news I guess. The dramatic reduction in fuel surcharges from up in the 30% plus down to what will be only a 1% surcharge in February, we think will have a beneficial effect on our premium products. Certainly in a tough economy that's not going to come booming back, but we do think that we will begin to see more of a balanced growth between our ground and air and our deferred products and our premium air. So that will certainly be a positive as we begin to reverse some of those negative headwinds.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all. Can you talk about the balance sheet and primarily the shareholder equity? I'm assuming there is probably a pension hidden there and you got the write-down. But since your shareholder equity is down by about 4 million, 4 billion sequentially, can you walk me through the puts and takes there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, certainly the big factor on that was the declines in our pension. We did, we had a fairly substantial pension asset at the end of last year that basically has been eliminated; and actually we did show an increase in liability of a couple billion on that side. In addition, we did repurchase $3.6 billion of shares this year. So in aggregate, the combination of the loss on the pension, the repurchase of stock, and we did have one extra dividend payment in '08 due to us tightening up the calendar, so that we really paid the November dividend before the end of the year combine. So those are really the three primary factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pension thing was a difficult issue for all companies with defined benefits. What happens obviously everybody had investment losses in 2008, and then at the end of the year the discount rate actually came down, so it increased the liability. So it's one of those things that hopefully you can see that turn around in the next year or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we do, our pension plans are still in pretty good shape; they're about 90% funded. And that's with us coming in to the year with about 130% funding, something like that, the combination of investment reductions and expenses reduced that. So it is an issue for us; it is adding about $0.10 a share headwind on costs this year, but we're going to continue to manage that and we think the strength of our pension plan remains an asset for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely right. I think even in this environment where we saw that kind of drop in asset value of the pension plans we're still well funded. A lot of other companies in the U.S. are not well funded, and will use their free cash flow to fund pensions in future years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I would definitely agree. How big was the pension charge to shareholder equity in the quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the fuel side, you quantified it in the call relative to your expectations that it was $0.10 more, $0.02 more in domestic and international, but what was it in total, relative, just the total benefit, excluding your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a lot moving parts on that, Jon. We can't &#x2013; you have to factor in expenses direct and indirect and all of that, so we've, really the guidance we've been giving is the relative impact of the month over month changes with the two-month lag, so that's really all that we're comfortable saying today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but you had some expectations in your original guidance; the numbers you gave on the call were incremental to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely and that's what we tried to provide some clarity on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final question is on the international side. How much of the cost initiatives and revenue enhancement initiatives, two different things are targeted on the international side versus domestic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a significant amount of focus on the international; it is a &#x2013; it's maybe a half a step behind the domestic, frankly. Our growth has remained very strong just up until this fourth quarter, so we are digging in very heavily on that, looking at our air network, making sure that we are being prudent in the amount of capacity we have in the air. We are also looking at operational models. I mentioned our European ground network, looking for opportunities to better align our large forwarding operation in Europe and our package operations.</p>
          <p>So, there's plenty of opportunities. It is, as I said, a little behind the progress, the domestic, where we been facing reduced demand for some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good morning Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to try to get a sense of how you are thinking about the pace of operating expense increase when you look at 2009; you've got some pretty significant cost reduction actions. But, I know you have some inflation in your, in your Teamster labor contract and so forth. So, if you take out the impact of fuel and you consider some of the cost savings and maybe your volume outlook, what's the magnitude of operating expense change in 2009? Do you have any sense of that? Is it down a couple of percent, is it down mid-single digits, can it be down 10%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are, as you know we are very focused, really always focused, on making sure that we adjust our hours to match the demand. And our operations people I think did a superb job in the fourth quarter reducing direct labor hours in excess of volume. And so we're going to continue to have high expectations from them to adopt and react and make sure that we are eliminating and reducing hours wherever possible.</p>
          <p>Tom, as you correctly pointed out, we do have a labor increase that becomes a little more challenging in a no growth environment because the average seniority moves up, and with the very favorable contract we got we get the full benefit really with moderate growth. So there are some headwinds in that area. Pension expense, as we mentioned, will be up, but we are very focus across our company to right size and match. The management compensation and variable comp plans are changing, our operators are reinventing the wheel, as it is, to make sure that as volume continues to be down and this will really be two years as we ramp some of these other declines, those are substantial changes. We're re-jiggering the network and doing everything we can. So, the goal is to have our direct hours move in concert with the volume reductions and then we are working very hard on all the other expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if you consider the inflation and the union agreements and then you consider your cost reductions, are you essentially just kind offsetting the inflation in the union agreements with the specific cost reduction measures you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we can fully offset expense increases we are doing great. I mean we do expect real revenue per piece to continue to increase. So that would be an admirable goal if we can really hold cost per piece absolutely flat and in a tough economy with shrinking volumes. So I'm not sure we can get all the way there, but clearly that's the kind of thing we are working towards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one last one; I'll pass the line to someone else. On the pricing side, you sounded rational pricing which obviously is good, but you also said maybe base rate is down because the optics of what you had done to preserve field surcharge mechanism might hurt you going forward. So if you take out weight-per-piece impact and take out filed surcharge, do you think on a comparable basis that base rate is actually down in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. No, we &#x2013; we've gone back and done some extensive look at this over the last eight or nine years and there is clearly an inverse relationship between fuel surcharges and base rate retention. When fuel surcharges go up we do see a very clear reduction in our ability to keep of the base rate; conversely as that corrects we do see better base rate retention.</p>
          <p>So actually, over the course of '09 we should see better base rate retention than '08, but it does &#x2013; there is a little bit of a lag as we go back, renegotiate contracts, our air customers will see dramatic reductions in expense this year because of the precipitous declines in the fuel surcharge. We think that will allow over time better base rate keep. So it's a transition and it needs to be rational and sensitive to our customers' needs, but we do feel good over the longer term that you'll see solid and continued base rate retention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, just a follow-up on that actually. In the first quarter guidance how much have you assumed on a per share basis from fuel or from the squeeze on base rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at our fuel surcharges, you are going to see some pretty dramatic surcharge reductions versus last year. Ballpark for the quarter based on what's in the bank and where the forward curve looks at, we'll probably have about a 15% lower fuel surcharge Q1 of '09 versus Q8 on the air and probably a 3% headwind on the ground. So, those are some fairly significant shifts year-over-year. Now not all of that goes directly to what the overall revenue per piece will be; compliance is not 100% and we do think we'll have some compensation on the base rate side.</p>
          <p>So it will be a very volatile series for you to track as we have these very significant year-over-year changes. We will get a slight benefit of the fuel lag, certainly nowhere near what we saw in the fourth quarter. But the predominant issue we'll be facing is to make sure that we are working with our customers and beginning to balance the appropriate rates now that the fuel has come way back down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify, on a net basis then, has fuel, has it turned to a negative in Q1 or do you still have some lag benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is still &#x2013; there is still a slight benefit in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Net-net still a benefit in Q1, okay. What was the effect in Q4 of exchange at a total company level, both on revenue and on operating profit; can you break that out for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exchange rates were relatively neutral. We do fortunately have some favorable hedges in place that's actually cost us some profits as the euro and the pound were at very high rates because we sold away some of the top end. But now that they are plummeting, we are able to stabilize it. And that's really the intent of the hedges, to stabilize earnings volatility.</p>
          <p>So there was a benefit to the hedges and a slight benefit for some revaluation of assets, but you're talking small amounts, so we were very pleased for the international that the hedges worked as we expected. And we are well hedged through '09 for the euro and for the pound through the first half of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question. You are bringing down CapEx, you're slowing down the share repurchases, so I would assume you will still generate significant cash flow. Does, is this the first priority to start paying down some of the debt or where else would it go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well clearly UPS is always a company that generates great free-cash flow, you saw that in 2008 and you will see it again in 2009. No, we're going to, I'd say we are still going to make distributions to share owners via dividends and via the share repurchase. Share repurchase not at the same level probably as we saw in 2008.</p>
          <p>We are gonna be looking &#x2013; there will be opportunities out there for us too; we think great companies get stronger in down economies. And we think there will be opportunities for UPS to buy assets and/or companies at below market value in the year or two ahead of us. So we think this is a great opportunity to keep our powder dry and look for opportunities to make UPS a stronger company for the future.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Bill, it was an interesting quarter that way. We saw sequential worsening from October to November, and so the discussion we had in October, things were actually, began actually trending down even worse in November. There is the impact of when Thanksgiving fell that makes the November, December results a little tangled. But we actually were somewhat pleased by the way the holiday turned out; volume overall for the holiday season was close to flat with last year. Although as we mentioned earlier, it was a wait till the last week and a half syndrome that we've had that does make things a little challenging. So we did see firming up of our volume trends during the holidays. Certainly some of that is most likely customers that decided to jump over to UPS in light of the dramatic uncertainty at DHL during the holidays.</p>
          <p>So it &#x2013; trying to separate exactly what was that transition and what was true strength in the economy is tough. We do think though, based on our guidance we gave you that trends are going to return back closer to what they looked like in October and maybe November than what we had in December. One interesting note, on the Internet shipping this year we did see much more modest growth, and really the Internet shippers did not outperform the rest of the bricks and mortar this year. Although certainly there were a few notable exceptions, like Amazon, but it was a little different peak as far as the mix of customers.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, was your B to C trend, was it much slower than you've seen in the past? Because you had been I think adding a point or so in terms of total percentage of the domestic volume. I think we were around 30% or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly continued to outgrow, but we have seen big sequential changes, back to Scott's comments about the consumer, in B to C volume slowing. But the consumer did come through and we did see B to C increases in the fourth quarter, or at least in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in January the trends that you gave for the quarterly guidance January trends were roughly in line with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much. It's been a noisy January with substantial weather events, with the inauguration. So in general we think that based on what we're seeing in January that guidance is appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks for your help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question from the line of John Mims with BB&amp;T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning guys. Looking at that CapEx budget, what's your kind a minimum maintenance CapEx level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we've had a number of discussions on that; probably the best approximation we have for maintenance CapEx is our depreciation expense. And so we are still modestly above that. But we've been fairly rigorous this year in looking at CapEx, we do have some growth CapEx in for next year, the completion of the Worldport hub and additional receipts of some aircrafts, 767s, and 747s. But certainly we've tightened up in most areas and are really restricting to maintenance on our facilities and our vehicles at this point.</p>
          <p>Having said that, the Worldport expansion is both an expansion of capacity and also a tremendous efficiency move, as I mentioned earlier, where because of having such amount of capacity in one location, we are able to reduce the number of regional air sorts we have to make much better utilization of our aircraft. So we'll continue to invest where it makes sense. We definitely have the capital, but we're going to be prudent right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I guess where I was getting at is, if you break down stuff like the aircraft deliveries, what's scheduled for '09 of the 767s and the 400s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Three 767s and three 747s coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In '09, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the 24, or I guess 26 other planes are 2010 and beyond. I was trying to see if it's possible to push those back, especially with fuel, is not as big an issue now, if flying the 200s and some of the older planes is more attractive, if you can kind of hold off on those purchases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're looking at that. At the same time, we are &#x2013; we do intend over time to migrate the DC-8 fleet out with aging aircraft directives. It's likely in the next three to four years that most of those will become uneconomic. So we're just balancing that. We do have cash. We do &#x2013; we think we have got favorable terms and if it makes sense to defer out we'll certainly talk with Boeing and any other providers.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ken</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kurt, Scott, can you &#x2013; Kurt you kind of were talking a bit about pricing before and the contract, I guess I just want to understand that a little bit better. So if you've got contracts with customers, and as fuel was running up, did you go back to them and reduce the base rate in that in order to keep them, so obviously you felt some competitive pressure to do that, if that's exactly what you were highlighting? And then so, did the contract not kind of automatically revert if fuel fell as dramatically as it has? I just want to understand the process and the time that it's going to take to kind of retest some of those base rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ken maybe the simplest way to think of it is more that as we do our annual rate change and go to customers with a rate increase, we negotiate how much of that to retain in their expenses. When you've got fuel at 20-30 plus percent it's very difficult to retain much of that base rate increase. So it's more over the course of last year, in some cases we did sacrifice base rate increase because of the extreme costs that our customers were facing for fuel. As that moderates then we do begin to recover and get more back on to a normal approach of keeping the base rate increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that shouldn't really be a surprise, we have talked about that over the last two years, the impact that fuel had on base rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one of the reasons it's very difficult to just purely pull the fuel surcharge out of our overall rate changes as far as what the real pricing is going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fine. I just &#x2013; that's it, Scott. I was just trying to see if there was a timing impact on it. And just a follow-up, on the U.K., it sounded like on this write-down that you're taking, are you shifting from providing domestic services in the U.K.? Or is that, did I misinterpret what you were saying there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what that is is we did make a domestic acquisition in the U.K. several years ago, and over the last couple of years have been busy integrating that with expanded hub in the domestic area. As we reviewed the operations there and looked at the impact of the economy, most notably on the domestic U.K. business, it was clear that the value we had assigned to their existing customer base really was not appropriate. Some &#x2013; many of those customers had churned out, certainly we brought domestic services to a lot of our import, export customers, so in general the business is healthy. But as part of the acquisition we attributed a value to the customer base, and as we reviewed that it was clear given where the economy is and the migration in our customer base more from the ones we had from the acquisition to our existing customers would express, that it makes sense to adjust it.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Next we go to the line of David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. Question on UPS Freight.  It looks like you've lost some money there in the fourth quarter and it's a pretty challenging LTL environment out there as you mentioned. With the network you currently have in place after integrating Overnite and Motor Cargo, have you had to rationalize that at all? Have you closed any terminals or tweaking that network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we really did quite a bit of that as part of the integration of the Motor Cargo Group and the Overnite Group. So we don't see dramatic changes in the physical assets. We do believe we're going to continue to gain share. You can see that our growth did slow substantially; frankly some of that is in some cases losing some big customers that we have just decided not to chase. So we still feel pretty confident that we will get back on a very strong growth curve with market share gains, but it has been a tough year and we're still trying to strike that balance of helping our customers save money as we bring them more value.</p>
          <p>As I've said, though, one of the things that's proving most successful now is this what we call our freight rate calculator that allows shipping managers to see rates in an LTL format for both our small package and our freight services. So it's been very successful of us going to customers, helping them reduce their spend by 10 to 15%, frankly, without a lot of rate pressure because we can find the best mode for each shipment individually and show that in a way that's apples-to-apples.</p>
          <p>So we did &#x2013; we are going to continue to enhance service, invest in technology, but at the same time, in this environment, we've got to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves and we will continue to be cautious on that. Clearly UPS Freight is on a cost reduction campaign also, but long-term we're optimistic, but given the current environment we just thought it was prudent to take the impairment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow-up on that with the cross-sell between LTL and parcel. Where are you in penetration, I guess, of parcel customers with the LTL business? I know it's been targeted for a while, but any color on, is there, are you just scratching the surface or you have a ways to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still in the early innings. Frankly, we've been a little disappointed that that's taken us longer than we'd hoped. I think some of the economic uncertainty and chaos has distracted our customers and maybe even our sales people a little bit, but that is a priority for us this year and we are very confident it's a unique differentiator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I've just come back from visiting all of our domestic regional locations, and I'll make it clear that's a high topic, big priority for our company in 2009, and our people are going to pay a lot of attention to that cross-selling, the we want that opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question will come from Robin Byde with HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just on DHL and your Q1 earnings guidance, just to clarify, does the range you've given assume volume gains from the DHL shutdown or is this guidance just on the underlying business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Robin, this guidance is our best guess of what will come through in Q1. As I said it's still a little bit of a moving target as operations just ceased there, I think last week. So, we have a number of customers that came on board in the fourth quarter, certainly there is more that we're bringing on board in January. But until the dust settles, we're hesitant to give you any specific information. So, clearly we'll talk more about DHL in the next quarter's call.</p>
          <p>One note I do want to make though is that this is not just a domestic U.S. event. Within the U.S. we are also seeing a number of customers come to us related to their import, export needs as DHL reduces their service footprint. We think our value proposition for our international network is compelling and also we are seeing, frankly, increased interest outside the U.S. in customers coming to UPS. So we intend to press the advantage across the globe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, and can I just follow up with a question on your European forwarding operations? Could you just tell us what you're seeing in terms of slowdown on Asia to Europe trade, are market trends getting weaker or flattening out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're certainly getting much weaker. Yeah, I think the areas of continued strength, although maybe strength is stretching it. We're continuing to see intra-Europe trade remain more vibrant although that's primarily small package, and clearly Asia to Europe is close to flat now where we had seen very strong growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's probably the biggest change we saw in the fourth was that Asia to Europe was growing at a fast pace up until the fourth quarter and really moderated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question will come from the line of the David Campbell with Thompson, Davis, &amp; Co.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I'm surprised how much money you made internationally in the quarter given the fact that revenues, international revenues were down substantially from the third quarter. You made almost the same amount of money as the third quarter; in fact you made a little bit more on an adjusted basis. What is there, other than fuel consumption is there anything else going on there in the fuel prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, there is seasonality there, to a certain extent, and we expect to make normally more money in the fourth quarter than we do in the third. If you recall the third quarter in Europe there is so many holidays there in August that it almost shuts down; it's a tough quarter for us. So, we did a nice job internationally, we'd still like to see more profits in the fourth quarter made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but you wouldn't expect that same situation in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Q3 to Q4 is always an increase and as Scott said we're looking to continue to improve margins. We do see challenging comps Q1 over Q1 and that's built into our guidance. So the international, though, is changing more rapidly, frankly, than the domestic.  Domestic has been fairly stable over the last quarter or two, although month-to-month it can change. The international, we're staying on our high alert to make sure we right size the network.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just wrap up with a few comments. Nobody is escaping pain in this financial crisis. Our employees feel it, our customers feel it and certainly our shareowners feel it. But I want to remind you that we're a great company that is just operating in a bad economy right now. Great companies do weather the storm and they come out stronger. What it comes down to is the strength of our balance sheet, the power of our brand, the value of our services, the contributions of our people and the quality of our leadership. UPS has all of these strengths and we will prosper as we move in to the future. Thanks so much.</p>
