      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Let me take a few minutes just to provide some comments on the quarter and then we'll open it up for your questions. We're very pleased to report FFO for the fourth quarter of $1.76 per share, up 12.1% over the prior year. You should note that our 12.1% growth in FFO was achieved despite the fourth quarter impairment charge of $0.12 per share net of applicable tax benefit of about $19.5 million resulting in our tax benefit of 12.2 million. We had a tax expense of approximately 6.5 million so we netted those two.</p>
          <p>Related to the write-off of our equity investment in an Arizona land joint venture, excluding the impact of the impairment charge, diluted FFO per share increased 19.7% for the quarter to $1.88 per share. Positive factors contributing in the quarter include strong operating results for our regional mall and Premium Outlet platforms, positive net tenant recoveries related to our continued conversion to a fixed CAM program with effective cost control and lower costs related to our captive insurance program, continued integration of and positive impact from the Mills acquisition, including our benefit for managing the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We did experience a slowing of retail sales in the fourth quarter; in our regional mall portfolio comparable sales were $491 per square foot, up 3.2% for the year but flat in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 7% for the year to $504 per square foot in our US Premium Outlet Center portfolio and fourth quarter sales were up 5%. Comparable regional mall NOI growth was 6.3% for the quarter, 4.5% for the year. Comparable NOI growth for the outlet portfolio continues to be very strong at 11.1% for the quarter and 9.8% for the year. Occupancy increased 30 basis points in both the Premium Outlet portfolio and the mall portfolio.</p>
          <p>Re-leasing spreads for our mall portfolio contracted somewhat during the fourth quarter as a result of the opening of several big box and large restaurant tenants, in particular at our lifestyle expansions. For the year, spreads in the mall portfolio were $5.64 or 14.4%, which is somewhat lower than our historical average but if you take out the openings related to our lifestyle expansion, the re-leasing spread for the mall portfolio for the year would have been $7.00 and 21% or 18%, which is obviously slightly above our historical norm. Re-leasing spreads for our Premium Outlet portfolio were $7.79 for the year, representing a 33% increase. Excluding embedded renewal options in some of our older leases, the Premium Outlet portfolio re-leasing spreads were over 40%.</p>
          <p>Gift card sales in 2007 were relatively flat over 2006 at 516 million. We attribute that really to the proliferation of retailer gift cards throughout the nation.</p>
          <p>Based upon the results of '07 and our outlook for '08, in addition our Board of Directors yesterday increased our common stock dividend for the quarter of 7.1% from $0.84 to $0.90 for this quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me turn just briefly to talk about capital markets. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the real estate industry as evidenced by our A-/A3 ratings. We built our balance sheet so that we would be positioned at all times to access capital in multiple forms and I believe we are well-positioned to weather the continuing challenging capital market and credit market.</p>
          <p>Given the state of the capital markets, let me just walk through, just for your benefit what our 2008 plan is. We only have $350 million of unsecured bonds maturing in 2008. Our share of secured debt maturing in 2008 totals $1.7 billion, although almost 700 million of that total will be extended through pre-existing extension options. We also have a development/redevelopment pipeline that is not otherwise funded by construction debt of approximately 800 million in 2008. And in total when you add the unsecured maturing, our share of the mortgage debt and our pipeline that's not funded by construction debt, that's about $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>We anticipate funding this but I underline, but we're not limited to this. But here are the following sources that we have available to us. First the billion dollars of secured debt maturing has an aggregate loan-to-value of less than 40%, and the underlying assets generate sales per square foot of $555 per square foot. We expect to generate total proceeds of 1.5 billion or 500 million of excess proceeds from the refinance of these high-quality, low-levered assets. We don't expect any issue with that. We currently have 1.1 billion available on our revolving corporate credit facility. We have over 500 million of cash in the bank at year end, and we will generate over $400 million of free cash flow in 2008. Therefore, when you add it all up, we're not -- obviously we're very comfortable with how we're going to fund our business plan for '08.</p>
          <p>Finally in '07 we had a very good year for our company. We generated very strong FFO growth, continued to successfully execute our development and redevelopment pipeline in the US and abroad. We completed a strategic acquisition, again, very financially profitable with Mills. We fully integrated that portfolio and are now working to grow the cash flow of those assets.</p>
          <p>And while 2008 promises to be a challenging period because of the macro economic environment, we believe we're poised for success. Demand for space for our retailers continues to be solid. We will expect to get more space back than in recent years, however, much of that space comes from healthy retailers abandoning certain concepts and obviously they're going to have to negotiate with us to exit their corporate guaranteed leases. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Our development/redevelopment pipeline will continue to create value for us, and we'll also look for opportunities in this type of environment when they arise. And we also expect to continue to create value from the Mills portfolio as we work through the development and redevelopment pipeline associated with that.</p>
          <p>Based upon these factors, the results of our internal budgeting and planning process and our view of current market conditions, we've provided 2008 FFO guidance of $6.25 to $6.45 per share, representing per share growth of 6% to 9% for the 2008 time period.</p>
          <p>With this said, this concludes our prepared remarks. We're more than happy to open it up for questions. So Operator, we can begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with FBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. On the expense recovery rate, it continued to be high and you mentioned it contributing to the upside and it came up last quarter. But as I look into '08, what should we expect sort of the full year recovery rate to be versus the full year for '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, this is Steve. I think you have two things that really contributed to the improvement in the recovery ratio for the quarter. One, which is ongoing, is just our conversion to fixed CAM. We're north of 60% now. We'll be north of 70% by the end of '08. And so that improvement I would expect to continue. There was also an improvement in the quarter, which is related really to a bit of a catch up and that's in our insurance program. We had lowered insurance expenses in the quarter, which improved the profitability in the recovery. There is an element of that, that I do expect to continue on an ongoing basis but a part of it was clearly a bit of a catch up for activity that occurred throughout the year. So I think when you look at it on an annual basis, I think we're comfortable in telling you that the recovery -- the profitability in a recovery is there. We've probably got a little bit of an outsized performance in Q4 that in retrospect some of it could have been pushed back into the first three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add, Paul, that as we've said historically and I think we were one of the first companies to anticipate the fact that the macro economic and retail environment was going to slow, we have been very focused on our operating expenses so we have a pretty good plan for '08 and obviously we have to execute it but we have a pretty good plan for '08 to drive down our operating expenses. So we are enthusiastic about that opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And because Paul, over the course of the year, two thirds of our leases will be fixed CAM, two thirds of that benefit would inure to our bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay, David, last recession you guys dialed down development pretty meaningfully and given your outlook for sales and the overall environment, you have a bunch already under construction but if you think about your starts over the next 12 to 24 months, is there any moving pieces that you might push out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest focus we've had is on redevelopment and Paul I will tell you that that really has not changed. We're obviously very focused in terms of reaffirming the profit potential from the redevelopment given the current environment. Now on the new development side we have pushed a couple of the potential deals, like we have a site in West Houston. We think that's delayed a year or so. I wouldn't attribute that to the economic environment. I just think retail demand is not quite there yet but no real change in Chelsea at all. I think you know there's real demand there. We're very excited about opening Houston, New Jersey. We are very excited about getting the right to build in New Hampshire. They've got a couple of other sites that we're doing it so I would say no change in redevelopment, no change in new development on Chelsea and on the mall or the mall-side, we've pushed a couple of deals back but I wouldn't attribute that too much to the economic environment, more just feeling that the retail demand was not quite there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my last question for Rick, in terms of the composition of the store closings that have been announced over the past quarter or so, is there any color you could provide about the mix between top-tier properties versus lifestyle centers versus B malls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer that if I could Paul. The closings that have been announced, we're always going to have some closings every year. But the biggest closings that have been announced have been more concept oriented closings. So, just take an example, Jasmine Sola from New York &amp; Co., we have five stores, they're going to close it. They're in good centers, in fact, I think all five are in our New England area because that's where they wanted to start, and that's really a concept change. One of the problems we had, I still don't know how to pronounce it, Paiva, Paiva, The Finish Line concept again, those are in good centers but that women's oriented, Talbots Kids -- so right now the biggest potential closings are associated with the concept closings as opposed to closings associated with A, B or C malls. That's what we are seeing the most of; Sigrid Olsen with Liz Claiborne, you have chains going out of business like Bombay. I'd say that's across the board but most of the new closings that you've seen year to date have been associated with that kind of activity. We'll still see a Foot Locker shedding a few stores, KB shedding a few stores, Ann Taylor has announced shedding a few stores, but that's by and large happening year in and year out and that can happen basically across the board, A, B or C properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think on a net basis, you might not lose as much space if the retailers are maybe trying to put a different concept in that location?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well my guess is we'll end up making a deal to get them out of the space and re-leasing it. So we may have a down time but obviously we're going to be very focused on getting the appropriate value for letting them out of the lease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David, when you outlined your funding options I don't believe you mentioned potentially accessing the unsecured market. Do you see this as another option or is the pricing there too high and can you give us a sense for what the pricing potentially would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market is not &#x2013; I mean the market is there for us if we wanted it but the pricing's too high and we have no real need to go to that market. I will say that obviously we have got the liquidity to deal with our '08 plan and there's all sorts of other ways we could finance the business beyond what I just described but we are not &#x2013; there is just no motivation for us to go to that market, as choppy and as expensive as it is and there's no reason for us to do that. Now at some point it might calm down but if it doesn't -- we're assuming it does not calm down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly in the near to intermediate term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And where it would be, I mean it would be very wide of where we did our last big deal. Now our credit default swaps, I don't know if this is damning with faint praise, but this is what Steve and our treasurer tell me all the time. We are the lowest credit default swaps in the industry and much lower than a number of big well-known companies, but I think it's damning with faint praise at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are certainly much wider of where they were a year ago at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then who are the likely types of lenders for the refinancing of the billion of secured debt that you have coming due, whether it's life insurance companies or banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think you'll have that. I think you'll also have this, I mean I think you'll have the secured market as well; the CMBS market I think is still available for good quality stuff. I mean the mall product really hasn't experienced any kind of hiccup. I mean obviously spreads are a little wider but there's still demand out there for some financing on that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right and the life companies historically have always valued the mall product very highly, because of its stability, so I would expect them to be much more in the mix than they've been over the last three to five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the bank market for credits like us, companies like us, the bank market, to the extent that window's not there, to the extent the insurance window is not there, I don't expect that, but again with that market, the bank market is very strong for a company like us. So we can access basically whenever we need it, if we need it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. And then just lastly following up on the question before about the store closing announcements, what level of lease termination income are you currently assuming in your '08 guidance? And then I think you're forecasting roughly flat to down occupancy at year end. But can you give us a sense for what that should look like throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our historical run rate over the last three to four years has been in the 15 to $20 million a year range, and actually if you look at, I think '06 that's about where we were, in '07, that's where we were absent of the two or three large department store terminations that we did. And that's consistent with our plan for '08. If it exceeds that, you'll typical have an offset up in your minimum rent line somewhere, so the two tend to net out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point, it's no different than what we've historically budgeted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great, thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Litt with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi David, it's Jon, I'm here with Ambika.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very good. I was just curious; there's obviously been a lot of press about what's going on in the debt markets and discussions about the impact that's going to have on the pricing of real estate. What's your sense of what's happening in your space, and any large assets that you're seeing on the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well -- the big A quality malls are -- there just hasn't been any transactions. The last couple have been frankly, what we sold to Westfield and what I guess Maseridge bought recently, and my personal view is on that kind of quality asset if cap rates have moved they haven't moved all that much. Where, the lack of really understanding value is probably on the lower-quality product, where a lot of that was bought by entrepreneurs with cheap debt. And again that market is pretty much shut down for the time being. So it's hard to figure out where those cap rates are, but it's safe to say they've probably moved up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what would you peg -- if transactions came to market in the sort of class A space, do you think that's in the fives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no question about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And pension funds would probably do it with relatively low debt at those levels, or you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I think that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I think Ambika has a question as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, if we're thinking about the same store NOI guidance for the malls, you mentioned that Simon is really focusing on driving operating leverage, when you think about the guidance, what percentage, is it half of the growth is really going to be driven by driving operating leverage? And then could you kind of list the specific items that you're focused on to reduce operating expenses?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ambika, let me talk a little bit about the guidance. We are beholden to some degree to our lease expiration schedule. We ordinarily have 7, 8, 9% of our leases rolling a year. We have not seen any diminution in pricing power, so we would expect our leasing spreads as we noted in the guidance to be kind of in the historical range. If you've got 10% of your leases rolling and you are re-leasing them at up 20%, inherently that's 2% comp NOI growth and then the rest of it comes from either better recoveries or growth in the ancillary revenues, or as David mentioned, we may get more of a bump in '08 from driving down the operating cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then could you give more color on what specifically you're focused on, the operating cost side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say we have &#x2013; we are reviewing a number of our vendor relationships. We're also looking at how to take advantage of economies of scale in the field level, with personnel. We've got -- obviously we're very focused on increasing energy efficiency for a number of reasons, one of which obviously is we think it's the right corporate thing to do, in terms of trying to give back to the environment, but also because it makes good, sound business sense in terms of driving our operating expenses. So, I mean those are a few that jump out at me. We're using our economies of scale on purchasing, but we've grown a lot, we've been very income-oriented which is appropriate when you have a very strong economic environment. We are in a less-strong economic environment, and so it's always good every few years to take a step back and figure out how we become more efficient and more expense controlled. So I mean those are -- I could sit here and tell you a few that come out of the top of my head. Now when we budget, we do it by lease, by mall, by asset. We'd have to I guess spend some time to say this effort would get you 20 basis points or not, but basically when we roll it all up, even in a tough environment we think we can grow 3 to 4% comp NOI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great and then just one last question. Do you have an update on Gap and Limited and their strategy? Should we expect any store closures or a reduction in their size of their stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say Limited, just essentially Vickie's [Victoria's Secret] and Bath &amp; Body at this point, they're actually growing -- at least at Vickie's they're trying to grow their store size, and so there's no real change there. And on an Express, it's spun out now its own -- their actual results have been pretty good and I think they're -- it's interesting now that it's out of Limited, we're very excited about the prospects of that company going forward. On the Gap, you know it's early; I personally have not met with the new CEO, I think that's obviously one of my goals here in the next few months to get a better handle on the real estate. We are pretty well set on a real estate strategy for them through '08 and I think we'll be working on '09 here shortly, but not a material change in the '08 Gap plan for us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A lot of questions on store closings but I'm just curious as you look out 2009, 2010, is it too soon to have a sense of the new store openings or do we really have to wait until ICSC, and what sort of early read are you seeing at this point in terms of tenants that are pulling back on store &#x2013; in terms of new store openings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, Rick can answer this as well. I'll just say that most of the feeling that we get is a little bit of a hunkering down, but not a &#x2013; most of the retailers that we talk to are pretty bullish on their business, are pretty well capitalized; they understand that we're going through an economic cycle here, they are hunkering down for '08. It hasn't changed their long-term view on what they're able to do in '09 and '10, so assuming we get kind of back with some more economic growth in '09 and '10, I think we'll get back to the store openings that we've had historically. But that's more of a gut feel as opposed to specific data at this point. But, most of the retailers we're talking to understand these cycles happen, are pretty well capitalized and are just being extra cautious for '08. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing that I would add to that is there are several retailers that really look at this as an opportunity. They are hoping that there will be a little increase in supply and they are approaching us now opportunistically saying, I still have open-to-buys for '08. If you've got several spaces that open up, I want them and there are a number of examples like that that we're working with that are going counter to that trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's a good point. A great example of that is like a J.Crew that's &#x2013; they've called and said, I want to know who's on the ropes. I want to look at the space. So, you know Abercrombie is in that spot, too. So, I think that's a very good point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it sounds like it's not going to come so much from bankruptcies -- is it more of a case of just tenants not renewing so your renewal percentage drops this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest closings are going to be concepts where the tenant no longer wants to operate them. And for us right now it's like demo with Pac Sunwear and the rest are kind of not a big &#x2013; the only real bankruptcy liquidation that we're dealing with thus far in a material way is Bombay, where we have 35 stores. But you know, Talbots Kids and Mens is closing, that's seven stores. They're in -- going to be in good malls. That's not a big issue, so most of it's really just concepts not working quite the way they wanted to and going from there.</p>
          <p>Now, the KB Toys, the Trans World, RadioShack, they've been over a two or three year period kind of weaning down their portfolio and we'll always have a few of those, but I don't sense a huge change from the historical closures on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, Jay, if you look at our top 50 or 100 tenant relationships, the risk of bankruptcy of any of those is quite frankly not very high right now. I mean they're still in pretty good financial shape. I think we will always have some of the smaller tenants just by the nature of the beast, but as we kind of look out, I think bankruptcies will be relatively modest in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just on Mills, turning to that, could you provide &#x2013; is there any additional upside that you're expecting in terms of occupancy from the value centers? And I guess as well, can you provide cap rates on the assets sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the two that we sold to Westfield were about a 5 cap rate. And that's &#x2013; so that's that. There are &#x2013; there is &#x2013; we feel very good -- we're going to -- we think we'll have about 5+% growth in the Mills EBITDA this year and primarily that's a handful of better running of the portfolio, more efficiency, more lease-up, bringing outlet tenants there with -- given our relationships with those tenants through Chelsea, so it's really across the board in better -- in terms of better performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I'd also say, Jay, there's a significant opportunity to improve the occupancy in the regional mall side of The Mills, you know those malls are $450 a foot malls; they look and feel like ours, but they are 400 basis points lower occupied than our overall portfolio is, so that will be a clearly a point of focus in '08.</p>

          <p>Hey Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know in the past, you guys looked at the B mall thing and didn't take &#x2013; take it up in terms of adding to your portfolio, but from your comments and look at the public markets and from everything that people are talking about in the private markets it sounds like the only &#x2013; looking at it today, which could change, it seems like the only really obvious place where you might be able to put some opportunistic money out is in the B and C mall arena. And I guess I'm just wondering based on how things keep evolving here, is there sort of a price that makes sense for you? Are you waiting for a price? Or have you really made a strategic decision here that those operations are too challenging and the fundamentals may be too challenging, so you're just not interested in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean we never get &#x2013; I never get too worried about B classifying a mall. I frankly hate to classify malls A, B or C. To me, it's whether we can increase the cash flow and obviously what kind of return we would get based upon the price. I don't think our strategy is going to change in terms of what we've done over the last several years, Matt, in terms of, we want quality real estate. Now, if we think we can pick up a mall that people might think a B or C, but we think we can redevelop it and make it better real estate, and we can justify it on a risk adjusted basis, we'll do it. But I don't think you'll see us chase not such good real estate just to create short-term accretion. I think our strategy has been pretty consistent. We've flirted with the idea, but we felt at the end of the day we were going to chase not such great real estate and we didn't really want to do that. Mills, we felt hey, look, they have -- had some real estate that wasn't great but we felt hey, by and large, this was pretty good real estate in pretty good major markets and that's why we chased that deal. So, I'm rambling, but the bottom line is, I don't think our strategy will change, given the environment today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and then just on Mills. If I read it right, it looked like the average rents on the traditional Mills assets came down a little bit in the quarter. Did you comment on that already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing remarkable there, Matt. That may be as much as anything just a mix in terms of the space leasing, you know because that includes boxes, the size of the lease activity could move it. Quite frankly, it could also be just us continuing to refine the data. I mean, as you might imagine, we took our first stab at the end of the third quarter, I would tell you we are 99 44/100% pure but, give us a little wiggle room there. But there's nothing remarkable going on in that portfolio. [overlapping speakers]</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You might -- I mean I would just say you might have &#x2013; since you have 17 -- you may have a little more volatility in those numbers quarter-by-quarter, just because as Steve said, you do have boxes in there that are included in those numbers and if you sign two or three boxes in one quarter versus the next, you're going to get some volatility.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then finally just on the impairment charge, does that all flow through the way that you guys had projected in the press release that you put out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It did, pretty much. I think the press release, Matt, we said it was $0.11 a share, it ended up rounding up to 0.12 but it was a $55 million gross charge and then in our tax line in the P&amp;L there's a $20 million benefit against that charge, so the net's 35 on a SPG, LP basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you guys just talk a little bit about your development or redevelopment starts in '08 and what do you expect for volumes and give us a sense for &#x2013; in terms of mix, in terms of international, domestic, outlet center verses a redevelopment that was in the core mall portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me &#x2013; if I can turn to a page here, you may hear some rough numbers &#x2013; give me one second unless Rick you have it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the ones that are under construction for delivery in '08 are going to be Hamilton Town Center in Noblesville, Houston Premium Outlets in Houston, Jersey Shore in Tinton Falls and Pier Park in Panama City. Those are the new developments that are coming online in '08 and all those are in the 8-K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do it this way if I could. We have our share; again this is our share of about 1.37 billion, okay? So it's pretty specific here, but just to give you a sense. The regional malls are 611 &#x2013; we do it by platform and this does not include international, so &#x2013; but we do it by platform, so let me just walk you through it if you're interested.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; David, I was actually looking for the new activity for '08 in terms of the additions to the pipeline in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's pretty-- the pipeline is pretty much what we thought it was going to be. So it's 1.37 billion domestic. Of the new starts, again this doesn't include -- this kind of goes over periods of time, but we have 300 million in the Premium Outlet business new, in the mall business about 100 million new, and the lifestyle centers are about 70 new. The balance of that is basically redevelopment in the mall portfolio. A little bit of capital dedicated to the Mills portfolio and then we do have some asset intensification of about 50 million in terms of residential and hotel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so this would be new activity just to begin construction in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's the total spend, Lou, of everything, some of which will obviously start in '08 but some of which has been under construction and that's the '08 spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not looking for the spend, I'm looking for kind of what new projects do you expect to add to the list this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really in our 8-K. The best way to do that is go through the 8-K. The ones we may add that are not in there are, Chelsea has got two or three deals that are close to getting Board approval and close to getting permitting approval.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now beyond the Outlet Center expansions that you've listed in the 8-K, is there many more opportunities within the Outlet Center portfolio to expand existing centers say two to three years down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Rick, you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are -- just as we've created a number of expansions that really were not on the Chelsea radar screen before we started really focusing on how we can maximize returns and out of -- from our start we've expanded Orlando, we've expanded Las Vegas, and we're doing-- we're expanding Camarillo and we are working now on looking at at least three other expansions. And as we've pointed out previously, even in the Chelsea new product, we are now building in much larger pieces of land and master planning expansions so literally right now Rio Grande is already expanding and it is open a year. Philadelphia Premium Outlets was opened in November and it's got its phase 2 expansion opening in March, and we've got additional expansions built into Houston, another expansion for Rio Grande that are also building off of just the new product that's coming online. So there's going to be considerable activity in that portfolio, adding space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lou, let me also just see if I can round up the conversation here. When we announced kind of our $5 billion development/redevelopment pipeline, when we did that, we've probably spent -- by the end of '08, we will have spent probably $2.5 billion of that. And where some of it is kind of pushed out like a site in Houston, we had a site in North Atlanta that we don't think is ready. We've pushed a few deals out. I will tell you that Chelsea opportunities have probably increased, so the balance of that 5 billion is still pretty good. And we are more than halfway through that but we still anticipate kind of the billion a year. Again, it ebbs and flows but about a billion a year and I'd say we're well over half of that done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. And then one just small follow-up question for Steve with regards to the expense recoveries. Was there much in the way of capital recovery in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was. And the capital is a little bit of a wasting asset as you convert to fixed CAM. Now, some of that was not actual capital spending but it was capital that had been hung up on our balance sheet as deferred and we were able to accelerate the recovery of that while we're still fairly substantially pro rata. It's not a meaningful number and we moved a little bit of it.</p>

We did see some softness in Florida and California, more than what we would have thought ex whatever assets are that cater to the international tourist. And I guess that's really the color. I mean, Florida, if we had a regional mall in Florida that caters to the general marketplace, not the tourist, it was either flat or maybe even down a tick or two. Orange County was pretty soft. Midwest has been flat. I think Midwest has been flat for I don't know how many years, other than Indianapolis seems to be the best of the Midwest. But generally, I mean the thing about our numbers, our averages mean something because we have such a vast portfolio. I would say generally flat now and with respect to the specific retailers, there were some shining spots in each category but there was no great category at all when it came to results other than I'd say the electronic guys seemed to have the best performance. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything.</p>

          <p>Yes, the only other ones that -- I agree totally with the characterization. Accessories were also a little stronger, juniors were a little stronger, books and records continue to be a little weaker and the women's, I don't know how to phrase it politically correct, but the mature women's segment was softer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow up to Matt's question about B malls and where implied pricing, let's say cap rates are for those malls right now. Is there any institutional demand to partner with you? Previously you had talked about a B mall fund? Or is that -- in this market is that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is demand to partner for us with -- on new deals. It's always a little more challenging on existing assets because we always have to confront the issue, why are you selling X off this. In terms of new deals, new opportunities, we always have interest to partner with us. I mean, look at -- The Mills is a great example of that. And so that hasn't changed. It's a little tougher when we're trying to sell maybe half an asset but we really don't do that. I don't really like that strategy. If we're not comfortable operating it, we're better off just selling the asset. So we don't do that as a routine. When we do bring in partners, they tend to be for new opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are -- matter of fact, we're meeting next week with all of our regional teams to focus them, I was going through that. We today are probably 65 to 75% through the renewal process and we are now working on frankly starting on '09. And we've been pushing our leasing group to be more proactive in anticipating perhaps where there may be some renewals that won't come through. So we have other tenants already lined up that we can move in that space with a minimum of downtime.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Steve, if we think about kind of your normalized number for 2007, it's a little over $6. I know you mentioned the lease termination fees would maybe be cut in half. Is there anything else we should think about that was sort of non-recurring? I know you had the mezzanine loan to the Mills joint venture and I don't know from a profitability standpoint how much that contributed. But maybe outside of those two things is there anything else non-recurring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right in that Arizona obviously in the 20-millionish of lease terminations from the department store deals that we did. There was probably an accelerated amount of fee income primarily related to the financings that we did around the Mills transactions. So that would be non-recurring. That's -- the only other thing and it's a nuance, Steve, is that for the first half, actually the first three months of our loan, the mezzanine loan, we did not have an ownership interest in The Mills. If you recall, we made that loan before we closed the transaction, and under the accounting rules we could recognize 100% of the profit, where post closing because we own half the enterprise, we can only recognize half the profit. And that's probably $10 million. So, I mean -- but those would be the big items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear. So 10 million of sort of earnings in '07 that won't recur because of a change in ownership.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A decrease in lease termination fees and then an acceleration of other free income from the Mills deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have -- you know, part of that you're going to offset because you're going to have a full year of Mills and we'll have a full year of running the business, which is profitable. So the net-net of that probably is pretty close but we probably -- I mean, we can give you specifically -- we don't have that at our fingertips but it's probably going to make it a little bit lumpy quarter-by-quarter but from a year end, it's probably going to be pretty close...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we'll have the business longer. We'll run it longer and that may offset some of the extraordinary fee income that we got from the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the reason I'm asking is if you take kind of the 602, which I think would be sort of a normalized number and you look at the low end of your guidance, it's about 4% growth and given your expectations for NOI growth this year, even though you're cautious on retail sales, and given your leverage profile, one would think you'd get higher growth than 4%. So there's clearly something that's pulling that growth rate down at the low end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly you have to back out the $20 million of lease terminations that we got in the first quarter of '07. Those are as non-recurring as the Arizona write off was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you take that out, then you're back to the 6...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're basically back to 6% at the low end and 9% at the top.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, David, I guess from a big picture, you've obviously been I think appropriately cautious. But the NOI forecast that you've put out there, I guess are more optimistic than maybe your tone would be about sales. And is that just because -- if you will the spillover effect that happens from all the things that you did in '07 that just kind of carry over? And the real impact of this slowdown to the extent it continues would really be felt more in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, the mall product is very resilient. So even, if we get into a terrible recession, you know then that's a different issue right now. But we are thinking it's recession-like, but the mall product is very resilient and we're pretty confident that we ought to be able to grow our business 3 to 4% even in a tough economic environment. Now if it gets to where we're in a deep recession, all bets are off for us and anybody else. But I don't think we're going to change our tune in '09, given what we think the environment is now. If it gets worse, maybe but there's ways we're going to run the business so that we can create that kind of cash flow growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question on international. Can you remind me where you are and sort of your thought process on Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think Brazil -- we're not really active in Brazil. We think -- what I've seen, some of the recent deals, we think it's -- listen the growth there is pretty interesting. But we think clearly you're better off -- on a risk-adjusted basis, put capital in there at the valuations that are, talking about now and you contrast that to the US, the US is a no brainer. And I frankly feel that way in most developing countries right now because I think the growth expectations in a lot of the developing countries is probably overstated right now. So I think it's a no brainer in terms of putting capital there versus the US. I'd bet on the US right now.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to circle back on the re-leasing spread question. I'm a little confused about how the lifestyle center openings and re-leasing affect that number and pull it down from a run rate that had been more like 23% to 14% in one quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, if you recall and -- we've talked about it several times on recent calls. We are doing a fair bit of redevelopment at some of the old Federated boxes and several of those came online this year, fourth quarter. A lot of that was big box activity and those are 20, 30,000 square foot boxes where instead of getting 40 or $45 a foot we're getting 20 or $25 a foot. It's still a good re-utilization of the space, certainly more profitable than the original department store. But if you do enough of them, and there was 600,000 square foot of that stuff in the fourth quarter alone, that's enough to pull your spread down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look at &#x2013; again, quarter-to-quarter you've got to be careful I think year end is a pretty good number, but if you look at -- we were at 17.6% last year, 20.7%, when you take out, 17.1 in '04, and when you take out the boxes that Steve pointed to, you're at 18% so it's right on line and just to give you an example, we did a -- I don't want to quote the rent here, because hopefully it's a good rent, but we did a -- like an AMC at Castleton Square Mall, well that's well below our average but it's also 62,000 square feet, so we thought it would be appropriate just to subtract that out to give you a better sense of what the number is. And we did several Crate and Barrels a Boca Town Center, we did a Crate and Barrel at Burlington, so that just happened to be a lot of fourth-quarter openings.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way we look at re-leasing, which I think is pretty comparable with the way most of the industry looks at it, is what was the sum total of all your expirations and terminations and compare it to the sum total of all the space that you lease. We do look at it David, on a comparable space basis. And we look at only the leasing activity that we did in '07 and go back and look at what that identical expiring rent was for that same population of spaces; that number was over $9.00 a foot in 2007.</p>

          <p>That's a good question. Right now we have not modeled any stock buyback; we still have authorization to do it but it's not in our numbers. Obviously it would be accretive to do so. We have -- we feel right now, given the world that we want to keep our powder dry to be opportunistic but we don't rule changing out, changing that view on a day by day basis. So we'll just have to -- we've got the authorization. We didn't -- the fourth quarter was tumultuous. We don't -- I don't want to be one of these guys that read, I bought the stock at 100 and it's now trading at 80 which a lot of corporate America did frankly.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, its Greg Stuart here with Mike Mueller. I just had a couple of questions and the first one is relating to the guidance, I notice that the range seems pretty widened. I wanted to know what key concerns impacting the sensitivity of that range that will probably make you come out on the low-end versus the high-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I mean the world is a little wacky right now, so we tend to be when we do our guidance at the beginning of the year, we tend to be conservative. We also tend to narrow that range as we get through some of the operating months. We're taking the same strategy we've taken over the last few years; nothing has changed. When we roll up our budget, LIBOR had not materially moved. There's a lot of volatility in today's business world, so we felt like a higher or wider range was appropriate given the extreme volatility that's occurring with the economy, with job growth, with interest rates, with capital availability, etcetera. So that's really reflected in the wideness of the range. At the end of the day, we're very comfortable with our business and where we're positioned and we'll operate accordingly.</p>

          <p>As David mentioned earlier we're going to spend just a little bit over $1 billion in new developments, redevelopments here in the US. I think our spend internationally is a couple hundred million dollars. And in terms of just the operating CapEx, it won't be much different than we've seen in prior years. I think in '07 our share of operational CapEx looks like it was about $175 million and our tenant allowances were about 120 million, I think. So you're about $300 million in total, I think that's probably a fair number for '08 as well.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it and a final question here. Bigger picture, as you guys look at the world what will have to happen for you to have push back on your developments? Or what do you see for tenants &#x2013; what will have to happen for tenants to pull back on '08, '09 development pipelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I tell you -- with what we have right now in the pipeline, we feel pretty confident we're going to go ahead and execute that. There's a couple that are -- like for instance, we're going through the approval process on Copley to expand the retail as well as build a residential tower there. That's the one deal that we might be somewhat sensitive to in terms of timing but on the other hand, it is really -- assuming it's a 2.5, 3 year build, it's really given the quality of the real estate, you're really talking about what it's going to look like in '11 or '12. So I don't think there's much that's going to deter us with our existing pipeline based on '08, '09. We're very well-capitalized. We have our plan very well put together. Again on the margin, a few deals here and there but I would say the one that jumps out at me that we're very sensitive to the market would be the residential tower in Copley. But again, that's a judgment call in '12, or '11 depending on when &#x2013; when or if we get the approvals we need to build it.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing any concessions, any retailers asking for concessions from in-place retailers? I guess I'm looking for guys who aren't going bankrupt or necessarily closing stores but are looking for some kind of concession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always deal with that on a -- I mean there's always some retailers that do that. Nothing, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing, nothing -- and I underline this emphatically, nothing like what we had to deal with in -- I don't know -- it seemed like early '90s, mid '90s, nothing, nothing even close to that. There's always going to be a few tenants that are doing a horse trade on that stuff. But nothing out of the ordinary and nothing, nothing like what we've dealt with in prior economic slowdown. Rick, you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. We have not seen anyone coming in saying we want a wholesale renegotiation of our rent, and I think one of the things to underline is our retailers generally their balance sheet, notwithstanding their stock prices are really very good. And so I think that we really are not particularly seeing that at all and it's really just a case-by-case basis in ordinary course of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay good. Thank you. And if you did get any of that, the mechanics of that would be that they would actually renegotiate the lease? Is that how that works or would you just let them not pay a month or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We tend to say no first, okay. I can't give you my -- I don't want to give you my negotiating strategy over the phone. But it really -- ultimately our decision is if we don't work with the tenant, what's the ramifications of that? Are they going to go into Chapter 11? Do we believe in the long-term viability of the tenant, in the relationship? That kind of goes through and there is no one pat answer other than we always start with no, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's fair. That's good. Okay and then second thing, do you guys have any thoughts on what's going on with equity interest in the sector from private equity, from big pension funds? Any color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you mean on a direct investment basis Rich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I realize, Steve, that that's not so much what you guys are doing but have you got any feel for how many times your phone rings with requests or any color on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh -- the answer is a lot. I mean I think it has always been a product that the institutional quality investor has very much liked; now their interest tends to be skewed towards the A level assets but demand for space or demand to own the higher quality assets is very strong. And the phone rings a lot because quite frankly I think they all recognize they need an owner/operator partner because of the intensity in the management of the assets. But they're, it's an asset class that has always been very highly valued by the institutional community.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so you have not seen that slow as a result of what's been going on in the broader market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Obviously as David mentioned earlier, we don't have a lot of product but there is high interest out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just say that the interest tends to be for new opportunity just because that creates a level playing field. So if we were to go buy new mall or new company X, I think the interest on those kinds of deals is extremely high and unabated because then you can underwrite it together. Everybody is kind of on the same page etcetera versus if we were to sell a half interest on an existing asset, there is some concern as to why we would do that. We certainly don't need to do that from a capital point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Thanks, and then the last thing is the other subcategory under other income was a bit higher this time Steve, any thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Rich, I did mention that there was a little bit of Mills fee income, that was one of the drivers, financing fee related. That's pushing that number up because when you compare it to '06 obviously there was none. That's probably the only thing that's really remarkable in there. Simon Brand Ventures continues to grow and so to the extent that there is a component of income in there and some of it flows through that line item that's adding to some of the growth. Those are the two biggest drivers of the difference.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Question on lifestyle centers, David I'd love to get your opinion on how you think lifestyle centers are going to fare in a recessionary type situation? It seems like the retailers that you see so commonly at all lifestyle centers are the ones that are reporting already some pretty ugly same-store comps, same-store sales comps and when you think about the product type that they are in, the mature women's apparel, the national restaurant chains etc., what is your outlook on how lifestyle centers might fare in a recession? And is there much of a difference between say the lifestyle centers that are attached to your existing mall properties versus the stand alone lifestyle center that a private guy might've built across the street or down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question; let me take the last first. We've had great success in adding -- kind of doing the two-fer, which is adding some of those tenants and bookstores and restaurants, popping it out on the mall. There's a lot of, I hate using the word synergy, but there is just a lot of good that comes from it. It reinvigorates the mall, it gives the customer what it wants, so it's really a nice thing to do. And it seems to work for the tenant. It seems to work for the developer. So that seems to be continuing on unabated. Obviously some of those tenants are being more cautious as you point out because of the macro thing. We have not been a big believer in, other than there have been some that have been good, but we have never really been a big believer in the cutesy lifestyle center that has a couple hundred thousand square feet. We do think they have some long-term viability issues. The bigger ones &#x2013; the ones that we built and some of our colleagues, you've got to look at those as a mall, frankly without a roof. And again that ends up being, is it good real estate? Does it have the right tenant mix? Does it have the right anchors? We do think and we should ask Rick as well, but I do think that the cutesy ones that do rely certainly on, as Rick phrased it, the more mature woman are certainly going to fare poor in this environment for the next -- until those retailers turn around because that's what drawing the customer there in the first place. They don't have the diversity of mix to draw that customer. So those will suffer significantly. Rick, what do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree totally. I think the way to think about a lifestyle center is what's its franchise value? As David pointed out the properties we've built that are open-air are basically anchored by the department stores, restaurants, theaters, bookstores, and are upwards of a million square feet. They've created a franchise and a market share that's significant in their market. Where you have a project that doesn't have that market share and franchise value, I think it's going to be much more subject to losing its market share because there are many less reasons for any shopper to visit that particular location when you have a narrower mix and a narrower number of offerings and less square footage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say -- the only other point Jim is it's clear that -- at least what we're seeing is that there are a number that are being built that are going to have a hard time leasing. None of ours of course, okay, but there are, and a lot that's been on the drawing board I think obviously in this current environment both from a capital point of view mostly but also from a macro economic view, I think are going to have a very hard time getting off the ground.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful and David on your last call in response to a question regarding the state of the economy, and retailer bankruptcies you said, we actually embrace these kinds of economic changes. That's when we've done some of our best work. What did you mean by that? And did lifestyle centers perhaps represent the opportunity this time around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know I think they could. There's a few that again we would want them to have a certain critical mass. Because again I think generally the two hundred thousand square foot ones we're not that enamored with long-term. But they could and I think simply we have always &#x2013; we have conservatively financed our growth over, since being public. We've been criticized over how we did it but that's fine. That's what being public is all about. When the times are challenging is when we've done some good work. Look, it's challenging out there. We like that &#x2013; listen, I would rather have no bankruptcies, I'd rather have no leases turn over but on the other hand that's when you can make some hay and that's where -- great wealth in our industry has been created either through development or buying at the right price. And you tend to be able to buy at the right price when few can buy.</p>
