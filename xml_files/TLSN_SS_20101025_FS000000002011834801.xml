        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, Head of Investor Relations. Very warm welcome to this sunny, but cold Stockholm morning. We will start with Lars presenting the Q3 numbers, and then as usual Per-Arne Blomquist, our CFO, will go through the financials more in detail with you. After that, there will be a Q&amp;A session, both here from the floor and from you listening in over the web.</p>
          <p>And with that, I think I leave the floor over to Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Welcome. Happy to see so many of you here. In summary, I think we had a good quarter; growth of 4.3% local currency, we always talk local currency, in the quarter. Record high earnings in the history of the company, maybe that's nothing to boast about; should be every time record high earnings, I used to say to my friends. EBITDA 36.5%, and EPS of 1.33. I think personally the growth is the most encouraging thing. You might recall when we started the year, or maybe you might recall the last year when we had basically zero growth, which did put us as one of the best operators that year on the marketplace. But when we started this year, we thought we would get some growth but not much, maybe a percent or so. And already in the &#x2013; after the second quarter, we had to revise that outlook and say, no, it's not &#x2013; it's going to be like 2.9% growth for the full year. And now, we had 4.3 in the quarter and we have to revise it again. And we continue with the same approach, so we say whatever we had in the nine months, that will be the outlook for the year.</p>
          <p>Where is this growth coming from? Well, our growth engine, Eurasia, is doing very well again. The economies in that part of the world have improved after the financial crisis. And we reached nearly 18% growth in Eurasia, and I'll come back a little bit more and talk about it because it's quite interesting. Obviously, the data growth in the Mobile &#x2013; Nordic mobile markets, and I'll give you an example of that too, and very encouraging is the growth in Yoigo, Spain. If we're going to make the breakeven result this quarter, we need that kind of growth &#x2013; at least we needed that kind of growth in the third quarter, I'm not sure we want to have that kind of growth in the fourth quarter because of the SAC, but we grew 82% in Spain in Q3.</p>
          <p>If we look at Eurasia, the encouraging thing is that basically all markets are growing except Georgia. They are still suffering from the results of the war. But our biggest market here is Kazakhstan. And when Kazakhstan grows with 20%, that makes a big impact on the result. But also Nepal and Uzbekistan are growing and growing quite spectacular. You can see the growth rate from Q1, Q2 and Q3, the rate is improving.</p>
          <p>I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on the two investments we did three years ago and two years ago. We don't talk too open about them in any details. These are big investments, big decisions to enter a market like Nepal, or in this case, Uzbekistan. The top left picture shows the coverage we had in that market when we acquired this operator, very spotty, not a very good coverage. And below, you see the network coverage of today. That's where we spend all of the CapEx on, to increase coverage and to increase capacity. So we had a geographical coverage of 21%, and now it's 34. More important is the population coverage, it was 54 and is now 84. And we are clear number two in Uzbekistan, and our market share is 31%, increased from 12%. And this is basically more than three years. And look at the bottom right-hand, we have 6 million subscribers in Uzbekistan. We started with 500,000 three years ago. Only Kazakhstan is bigger. We have 7 million subscribers in Kazakhstan. ARPU is lower here, so obviously Kazakhstan is worth more to us, but there is still lot of growth in this market.</p>
          <p>And market-wise even more possible growth is Nepal. This acquisition we did exactly two years ago, and again fairly spotty coverage on the time of the acquisition. We have a much better coverage today. I think Lena asked me about why we invest much money in Nepal a couple of quarters ago, that's the reason. We have grown the subscriber base from 1.7 million to 3.4. In this country lives 28 million people, so the penetration is still low. And we've gone from 12% to 30% geographical coverage. 73% of the people in Nepal can now have a mobile phone and we re-branded this &#x2013; this outfit was called Spice Nepal recently, but we changed it to the same model as we had in the rest of the region and for Nepal Ncell. And we have a market share around 40%. There are two operators in this place.</p>
          <p>Another reason for growth is the mobile data, and particularly smart phones. It's really amazing, 70%, 7 out of every 10 mobile phone that we sell are now smart phones. These are totally dominating our deliveries. And I have said many times, I believe the telecom industry &#x2013; we will look at the industry say &#x2013; and say, the time before the smart phone and the industry after the smart phone, it changed everything, offer goes up, traffic explodes in our networks. It's really fascinating. And the interesting thing now, as you can see on the lower picture, it's not only iPhone anymore and &#x2013; it's also Symbian and Android. I will believe they will come up in more models and probably take a bigger share of the cake. Finland is somewhat behind, but the other three Nordic countries are fairly similar in the volume of smart phones.</p>
          <p>We had a great quarter I believe in Mobility. Net sales grew of 8.3% in Sweden, at the same time we improved EBITDA margin nearly 2 full points in the quarter. And when you look at this growth rate of 8.3, I think you need to understand what we compare to, we compare to third quarter of last year. Third quarter last year was a good quarter. We sold a lot of iPhones in the third quarter of last year. And of course some, of you might have seen, we are extremely happy with the SQI, Svensk Kvalitet Index, that measures the satisfaction among our customers and we top it again, both in consumer and even more, in business-to-business, very encouraging. Another encouraging fact is that we have growth in Finland in Mobility, 8.4% in local currency. And it's same there as here, it's mobile data and equipment sales. And finally, I think we're seeing some signs of becoming a stable situation in the Baltic &#x2013; in the Baltics. So, it's declining but the decline rate is going down. And I think other operators have seen the same thing. Very happy with Mobility service.</p>
          <p>And of course this is Spain, Yoigo. I said 82% revenue growth. We have 60% in subscriptions. We have now 4% market share and we still expect to make a breakeven result in this fourth quarter and thereafter. If that happens, then we will have done this in four years and I think nobody has started from Greenfield operator and reached an EBITDA breakeven in four years, not that I know of at least.</p>
          <p>We are the clear winner in number portability. You can see who we are winning from. I believe &#x2013; if there something that this is little bit weaker, it's Broadband. I believe the fixed network is an absolute crucial asset to our company. The appetite for bandwidth is unlimited, I've said that many times, and to deliver telecom services in the future where you demand 100 megabit or even gigabit per second, there is no technology better than the fixed network based on fiber of course. That's why we are rolling out fiber. I would wish we could roll it faster. So I think it's a crucial asset.</p>
          <p>The other challenge we have &#x2013; of course, we have seen for several years the number of fixed-line voice copper go down, that continues. And the challenge we have is then to offer other services like Broadband and TV. We are the biggest video rental organization in this country in Sweden. We have in the first nine months sold 1.5 million rentals compared to 1.2 for the full year of last year, because I think of the convenience of it. On top of that, we have the regulatory uncertainties in Sweden that makes this issue about rolling fiber an issue for us. On top of that, we have experienced this quarter but also earlier some tough times in it national carrier. There an enormous price pressure in the global market for transmission, and of course that shows up in our bottom line.</p>
          <p>So I think I'll stop there, and you comment. Then we'll take your Q&amp;As.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. I will start to look at the first nine months, the first three quarters this year, and comment upon some of these items that you see on this first slide. Net sales up 3.4%. We have kept the cost unchanged, or at zero. We have improved the EBITDA margin up to 35% and increased the EBITDA with 6.4% underlying. Earnings per share up 14% and free cash flow down, and I will comment upon that as well.</p>
          <p>If we start with the growth, Lars has talked very much about this in his presentation but what I think is encouraging to see is that we actually continued to increase the growth rate quarter-on-quarter, starting with 2.5% going up to 33 &#x2013; to 3.3 and up to 4.3 in the third quarter, which gives us the 3.4. At the same time, we have been able to also keep up the margins; 35% for the first nine months the rolling four-quarter 34.5, and what I think is encouraging here is that this is done by all the different business areas. If we take Mobility, they go from 29.2 up to 29.7. We have Broadband increasing up to 33.5 from 32.8. And we could also see Eurasia going up from 50.9 up to 51.4. So, all the different business areas are actually contributing to this.</p>
          <p>Cost is up, yes, if you look at the cost quarter-on-quarter. It's up with more than 5%. Do we see cost explosion in the group right now? No, I don't think so. If you take the last quarter here, 7.4 billion compared to 7.1 in Q3 last year, which was an extremely low quarter as such. So this is second lowest quarter, I would say, for the last two years anyway. So, we keep the cost under control in a good way. The cost increases we have had is very much connected to marketing activities, you can see here that marketing is going up and two-third of this is connected to Spain. If you take Spain, for example, they have increased the topline, which you can see before at 81%, increasing cost with 60%. So, I think that the balance is pretty good. If you take Mobility Sweden, they are increasing Broadband with more than 8% but the cost with 4%, coming up to more than close to 44%. So I think that we managed to balance this in a pretty good way, and this is also our ambition going forward.</p>
          <p>Another positive development is our associates. You can see now that we are increasing for the first time for couple of quarters upwards 16% in the result. And it's basically Russia growing 23% up compared to Turkey pretty flattish even though it's 1% up, which means then overall 16%. And what I also think is good to see is the movement that we have seen on the marketplace in Russia. MegaFon today is the second player with 26% of the subscriber market share, but they are the leader when it comes to the mobile data revenues, having 35% of that and I would say partly leading the 3G rollout and trying to take a position of the mobile data operator. Revenue now, growing with 15% and a substantial part actually going down here on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>We continue to review our different assets. We have been pretty active during the last quarter. We have sold Stofa with a gain of more than 800 million. This was done in Q3. We also sold some shares in Digitel in the Philippines. I don't know whether we &#x2013; you know that we had that, but we had a small share left and we sold it out and made a gain of 67 million. And we also looked at our Cambodia operation, as you know we moved it from Eurasia in the second quarter into our Other operations and we now decided to write down this asset close to 700 million. Tough market, lot of operators in place, and I think that we need to see some kind of consolidation going on. For us, we took the opportunity to write-down the value because we couldn't see that the value was sort fitting to the assets that we had on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Tax, you could see that from two different angles. We had low effective tax rate going down to 21.5%. At the same time, we have increased our tax payments and I have said this earlier this year that given that we paid a very, very low taxes in Sweden during 2009, you will see, paid out tax ratio going up to close 80%, 90%. That's where will be at the year-end. Now we are closed to 100%. These are some of the explanations also why cash flow then is going down in the third quarter. Taxes; we didn't pay more or less any tax last year. We also have a timing issue on account of dividends from our associates. We expect dividends to come in the third quarter instead of &#x2013; the fourth quarter instead of the third quarter. So, that is a timing issue. Taxes are really &#x2013; should end up paying more this year than we did last year. But still, I would say that we have a pretty descent cash flow.</p>
          <p>EPS increased with 19% in Q3, which is somewhat higher than for the first nine months, or we could see 14% of growth. Positive is that EBITDA is contributing with SEK0.39 out of the SEK0.44. That's coming from our majority owned operations. You could see that we have &#x2013; also a positive effect from non-recurring items, less this year. Meanwhile, FX is pretty negative with 19. So overall 44, or above 39 coming from our majority owned operations and then you could also see the different pluses and minuses to the EPS development.</p>
          <p>Well, finally, still very solid financial position. We are close to 1.2, 1.3 in net-debt-to-EBITDA. We made a Eurobond of 15 years, which we're pretty proud of. Good pricing, 3.93 for 15 years. I think that's a very, very good pricing, if you look also forward what might happen. And I think we partly opened up the market for longer tenures as one of the first companies, which shows the strength of our balance sheet and also the name of TeliaSonera in the debt market.</p>
          <p>CapEx, I got some comments whether we are not investing enough or not. I think &#x2013; I would prefer perhaps to invest a bit more. We haven't had sort of the speed that we expected to have on the CapEx side. Especially, Broadband has laid behind a bit on the fiber rollout but I will also claim that Mobility has partly been suffering from shortage of components in the &#x2013; within the telecom industry, which explains the pretty low CapEx-to-sales ratio this year, compared to what we actually said that we should do this year.</p>
          <p>This slow ratio that we have today means also that we have decided to change the outlook for 2010 when it comes not only to CapEx, but also to some other ratios, but CapEx now is expected to be 13.5, which means that we will have pretty heavy quarter when it comes to investment in the fourth quarter, given that we are at 11.4 right now. We have also said that we believe that we will be in line with the first nine months when it comes to growth, 3.4, addressable cost somewhat higher given the growth especially that we could see in Spain and also the EBITA margin higher compared to 2009 where we were at 33.6.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will start with the Q&amp;A session and we do like we always do. We take a couple of questions from the floor and then we go to the conference call. But we can start with maybe Stefan on the first row. Could we have a microphone, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Stefan Gauffin, [Nordea]. First of all, there was a large increase in marketing compared to last year and this was mitigated by FX effects. Marketing has been low for quite a while; and what do you expect going forward in terms of marketing spend? Secondly, really interesting to see the topline effect in the Nordic markets due to smart phone sales. Could you say anything about what percentage of your customer base in Sweden and in the Nordics that are currently having a smart phone? Then finally, given the CapEx that you &#x2013; that will come in a little bit low in 2010 and that this is also due to component shortage, i.e., not something that you were aiming for, will this roll over into 2011? Should we expect higher CapEx in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last question we will guide on after the fourth quarter, but as a principle we have sometimes discussions in the company where people say, if I don't spend the CapEx this year it's gone. I don't know why they think so because the money is still there, it does all the time. If you have a good investment, you can get the money in December and January and for us to communicate to the market what it means.</p>
          <p>When it comes to marketing, when we went in start of this year, I said the big programs are basically over, we have to execute a couple of more hundred people leaving the company, but the program is over. And I want to see the management taking care of the cost by themselves without help from a big program. The year hasn't finished yet, but so far I think I am pretty happy how they have managed the OpEx in the company. And if we can spend more money on marketing instead of spending it on back office cost, whatever, I am all for that, because I think market share and growth and defending the position is very important. What I don't like is people spending money like water without a message, without getting results. You take the &#x2013; we spent, if I remember right, &#x20AC;2.3 million in Spain for an advertisement, TV commercial, and the intake of subscriber thereafter was spectacular. So, yes, you want, please do that again when you make money, okay.</p>
          <p>You asked about the &#x2013; I don't know the number how many today, but actually when you're asking the question about smart phone and how many will be smart phone, I think the interesting answer is three years from now all of them will be smart phones. That's the issue and that's why I am arguing that this industry &#x2013; you should really look at the industry before the smart phone and after the smart phone, because the amount of traffic smart phone generates, the ARPU they generate are quite different from the traditional voice phones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can provide you with some data. Remember, where we stood at in Q2 where we showed the smart phone penetration in Sweden. It was 28% of that &#x2013; at that time, now it's up to 33 and as Lars showed you earlier, 7 out of 10 buying a smart phone today. So smart phones are 33%, not too different in Denmark and Norway. Finland is lagging a bit behind, as Lars touched upon; the figure there is around 20%.</p>

          <p>Back from paternity, Sven Sk&#xF6;ld, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Sven Sk&#xF6;ld from Swedbank. I noticed that the churn rate was &#x2013; mobile churn rate was up in nearly all markets in the Nordic area. Despite that, the margin for Mobility was relatively flat and in Sweden it is actually up significantly. So can you describe the fundamentals behind this, what is changing up, what is changing down? I also noticed that the gross margin for the group...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the group figure, but that was up. Is that related to Mobility Services or to Eurasia? Good day. I'd just like to have some flavor on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the last one, we have &#x2013; when I started two years ago, we were sort of totally driven by EBITDA and what we have tried to do then is to split the cost components in a different way. We started with the OpEx for making real clear you need to say there &#x2013; but you have a substantial amount of cost also on the cost of goods sold. So, I mean the improvement you see here is part of that, yes, we have improved the gross margin that helps. From a group perspective that has helped, and this is something that we're actually focusing on in all different business areas, not only the OpEx. I'm looking at gross margin, OpEx to sales ratios and so on &#x2013; EBITDA margin and so on. So that is actually helping to improve the margin, even though we have a higher churn rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a comment on the churn rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that, as Sven says, that is up basically normal, and especially in Finland as you might have noted. But I agree with Per-Arne's statement, it is the gross margin that is improving the EBITDA margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you take your churn rates, as well, if I remember this correct, is helpful 15% to 17%; so it's still on very, very low level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take the next question from Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, three questions if I may. Andreas Joelsson, Enskilda. First, Eurasia, very strong margins, is that seasonal effects or is it something other that is the reason for the strong margin? And then maybe some strategical questions; fiber you want to rollout faster, is it only PTS that may &#x2013; prevents you from rolling-out faster? And on mobile data, what challenges do you have in terms of pricing models when you see this growing so fast and maybe changes from the competitive environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start with the fiber, no, it's not only PTS but it is part of &#x2013; the challenge, is also availability of components and technology. But it is also a challenge on how to do this. I think maybe you thought and maybe I thought that we were really, really experienced in rolling out networks. But it was pretty long time ago we rolled out a fixed network in this country. So, I think we have actually had a couple of exercises that we've been discussing. How do we do this and how do we make sure that when we do it we get success in the marketplace, because the number of people who subscribe, who says I sign on is actually crucial. Is it 15, is it 35, is it 55, is it 75, makes all the difference on the return on the investment. So, it's a very important that we get the right number and we need to spend some more time to understand how you sell this, how you argue for it, so be it then. I can live with that.</p>
          <p>The margins in &#x2013; Q3 is always better margins in our industry, so &#x2013; also so in Eurasia. I think that also a reason is of course that I showed you the Uzbekistan numbers; obviously, Uzbekistan was in single digits or in the high teens or something like that in terms of EBITDA margin two years ago. When you grow like this and you go from 0.5 million subscribers to 6 million subscribers, you start making money. This industry is all about volume, it's all about volume. So of course, when Uzbekistan gets to the level where the group is or towards that level, of course it helps quite substantially Telia's results. Now, I don't think we should expect much more than 50% from Eurasia. I think that's sort of the number, and also realizing, now we talk maybe two or three or four years out, as the penetration goes up, competition will increase and I think it will be some pressure on the EBITDA margin in the mid to longer-term in Eurasia. But I will take that problem any day to be part of the growth race in this part of the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's also your favorite question when it comes to pricing models on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the industry is sort of getting its mind around this. At least a number of players are understanding that fundamentally if you have an exploding traffic volume in your network, you basically double the traffic every 12, 15 months and you can double the capacity and the network maybe every 18 months. You need to manage this very well. You can ask Verizon and AT&amp;T, I think they have realized it the hard way, especially AT&amp;T. And I am convinced that we will not have flat rates, we will have some sort of variable pay. But the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited, and we will be able to give so much more volume &#x2013; traffic volume to our consumers for basically the same cost as our upgrades go into our networks, because our suppliers can supply that to us.</p>
          <p>And we all can &#x2013; also when I described that last quarter report, how we believe Moore's Law is helping us to please our customers or satisfy the exploding need and the unlimited appetite for bandwidth. So I think we can manage this. And the flat rate I think is only important when you start this kind of service. So, if you start in Eurasia with this in a big time, I wouldn't be surprised at all if you went in the flat rate for 12 months or 18 months. The IPTV, if you remember, we gave that away for year which I thought was a bit luxurious, but it turned out that Erik Hallberg was right. It was really crucial to us to get the volume and get the momentum. It's a long answer, I am sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe, Per, on &#x2013; your net-debt-to-EBITDA is &#x2013; keeps down, very strong balance sheet. You have a 10% share buyback mandate. What do you tend to do with that? That's the first question. And also the addressable cost base, as you said, a large portion of the increase is related to Spain, but also the fixed Broadband side in Sweden and Finland you can see that margins are coming down. Do you &#x2013; are you happy with the bottom approach &#x2013; bottom-up approach on cost cutting in those areas or do you believe that something else will have to do be down there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as Lars said before, that is a question of balance, to say that if sort of income or topline is going up you could allow yourself to have a certain cost increase and if income is going down you need to do &#x2013; you work with efficiency. So I think that so far so good I would say, because they have done a great job within Broadband and are still negative in this quarter, if you look at the underlying cost development even though topline has fallen a bit quicker, but I think that they have to continue to work with the deficiency measurements and try to balance this as good as they can. But remember that they have also increased their margin pretty much also compared to last year, as I said before.</p>
          <p>The second question was balance sheet, yes, when you come back in &#x2013; yes, you are right, we have the mandate, and we have said that if we have excess cash we will look at that. And I think, it's the same answer as before and it's &#x2013; will come back sort of with the dividend policies and all the stuff at the fourth quarter results, we'll present it at that point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with the long list of questions from the conference call. Operator, could we have the first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question comes from Mr. Andrew Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of questions on Sweden, if I may. Firstly, on the Swedish retail Broadband market pressure, we're seeing Telenor come in with an aggressive triple-play offer and Com Hem follow suit. I wonder if you could give us some color on how you see competition in retail broadband playing out in 2011. And do you see competitive intensity holding at the current levels?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the international carrier part of your wholesale business, could you give us some more color on whether this is a structural down-shift or whether there is some cyclical pressure coming through here; and also that do you feel you have any significant cost flexibility in international carrier to offset any of that topline pressure into 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one. I think this is not seasonality. This is &#x2013; I won't call it structural, it's just price war, as simple as that, that normally could end sometimes, but I don't see the signs of it yet. And it is a business with low margins, let's not fool ourselves. So, it is a burden on our results. We can look at cost, we can look at other things and we're having a dialogue how we're going to handle this. But I have to live with what happens in the marketplace, I can't manage that.</p>
          <p>On retail Broadband in Sweden, competition is high. I think we have done a really good job. We have more IPTV customers now than ever. As I said before, we are the biggest rental movie organization in this country. We are growing VoIP by 40% from a low number, so it doesn't help enough but it certainly helps. Yes, you mentioned a couple of competitors; I think Com Hem by far is our biggest competitor on TV side because they are in so many places. I don't see the market changing in any dramatic way in next year. I think it's more of the same.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Operator, could we have the next question please?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. James Britton from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. Firstly, just on your gross margin performance, I wonder if you agree that gross margin should actually continue to increase pretty sharply for the medium term as Internet costs keep falling sharply out of the P&amp;L. And so, should we anticipate EBITDA margin growth is also very likely?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I guess handset sales &#x2013; some people look through that as it's not really a recurring sort of feature of results, in the sense they can be sort of up aggressively one year and down the following year. So, is there any way you could help us focus on underlying service revenue growth for the overall group? And the third question please, can you give us any idea of ARPU levels in Spain at the moment so that we can just understand the balance between network revenues and equipment sales? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start with the last one first, we don't disclose on our ARPU in Spain for the company...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not public. And if you want to say it, it's okay but we don't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's around &#x20AC;20.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we had a question about gross margin, and if I understood the question you were expecting a decline in gross margin or an increase, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean Internet cost will be falling very sharply as the termination rates keep falling, so gross margin should be continuing to climb quite significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, yeah, it's a decline. Yes, I think that &#x2013; yes, exactly. No, but I mean &#x2013; I think we have this every year. I mean you start also the year where perhaps having a decline or something, if you take Mobility something between 500 million, 600 million, 800 million in decline and &#x2013; I mean that we need to offset every year and so far we have been able to do that. So it's a question &#x2013; coming back to Sven's question about the gross margin, we're working with that all the time. But of course that's a challenge when you have this starting point every year. But that is not &#x2013; nothing new. That has been going on for many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Per, I think you misunderstood my question. As the interconnect costs fall &#x2013; as your interconnect costs fall very sharply, your gross margin should actually increase quite naturally. And therefore, would you agree that should drive an EBITDA margin increase into the medium-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Internet part of our cost of goods sold I think is very small compared to all the other sources of cost, so I don't think it has a big effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you have MTRs and other things I said, also I think this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think what we have done together in the company in the last the two years is, as Per-Arne, focused very much on the cost of goods sold. And I don't think we had enough or focus on that historically and it's &#x2013; purely that is the reason why we have improved the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you had a question on service revenue growth and &#x2013; just explain that to everyone. And that is if you exclude the effect from handset sales &#x2013; I don't have that number for the group, what it would be X that, but you can calculate the service revenue growth in Mobile Sweden, France, that's where you will see that went from 5% to 6% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And remember that handset sales is only in the mobile part of the business. In Eurasia we don't sell any handset and in Broadband we don't sell any handset. So, I will guess it's a minor effect on the topline, less than a percentage point, I would argue. But I haven't done the full calculation on it.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The next question is from Mr. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions please. Firstly, you talked about the smart phone penetration in the Nordic region and obviously it's broadly as high in Denmark and Norway as it is in Sweden. Nonetheless, the revenue trends are complete different. I'd appreciate any insight why that is the case you're not seeing the same mobile growth in Sweden and &#x2013; sorry, in Norway and Denmark as we are in Sweden and Finland? Secondly, Spain you're enjoying very good momentum here as you highlighted last, but it seems as if you are willing to sacrifice that momentum to meet your promise to the market of breaking even on EBITDA in Q4. Have you sort of considered whether it might be strategically wise to continue with &#x2013; or perhaps accept losses for a few more courses to fully capitalize on the momentum you are having in Spain? And thirdly, if I may ask you for an update on where we are currently at the sort of MegaFon and Turkcell situation and how you feel about that situation at the moment. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, the answer is yes. I have considered it and this is the decision. I want to see profits after four years, which I think is spectacular and not only for one quarter. The commitment is we should have profits or breakeven in this quarter and thereafter. I am happy with the 4%, I think we can continue to grow and still making black numbers.</p>
          <p>Very briefly on MegaFon and Turkcell, there's always happening something in those things. I am not unhappy &#x2013; I am not particularly happy. I think we are struggling or fighting like we expected us to do. I don't think anything has fundamentally moved. We lost a court case in Russia a month ago. The court case is from a legal perspective not important. I think it's more important from a PR perspective. To dwell upon it one second, we actually have &#x2013; in general agreement, we haven't agreed on all the details. And you have to agree on all the details, because that's what somebody, and it's actually not the court, it's the parliament, the Duma, and the committee there will have to look into the whole agreement and then judge whether this is in the interest of the Russian State or not. So if you look at the umbrella agreement, high level, and you go to a court and they say, no good after 10 minutes, so be it, it doesn't matter. What really matters is what happens when we apply for a verdict from the Duma, which we &#x2013; I've said all along, we won't apply before we make some progress in Turkey.</p>
          <p>And in Turkey, I think we are following plan. I think there are some discussions right now going on in Turkcell that I won't comment on because that's for the Board or the Chairman of the Turkcell Board to make comments on. Fundamentally nothing has changed. We have joined with Alfa to try to get control over Turkcell because Mehmet Karamehmet has sold the controlling shares twice, first to us and then refused to deliver them and he is in court in Switzerland ordered to deliver them, he ignores that. And then he sold the same shares, half of them to Friedman and pledged the other half for a loan he never repaid. So I think we believe we have both legal as well as moral right to get hold of those shares. And when we do, then together Alfa and TeliaSonera will control this company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first question about smart phones or wasn't it, and why the development looked a bit different in Denmark. Well, I think that first if you take Denmark it's &#x2013; I mean this is a slightly different market with the high churn rates and &#x2013; but still &#x2013; I mean, I think we are bit disappointed with the development there and we're looking into that to see what we could do to sort of coming to a better position. But we would &#x2013; you should perhaps expect a better growth in Denmark than we have seen in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and one thing &#x2013; if you look at Sweden, one thing that we have done very well I think is that we kept voice revenues flat and that is something that we have been unable to do in the other two countries that you mentioned.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. We see if there are some more questions on &#x2013; from the floor. We have one from Jan at the front row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan Dworsky from Handelsbanken. Coming back to Finland, margins seem under pressure in Broadband and also in mobile and we saw from Elisa the other day a similar kind of pattern. Do you see some more &#x2013; more intensified competition in Finland or is it more sort of temporary impacts on cost allocation, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not temporary cost allocations but it's also not the beginning of a price war that we saw four or five years ago, I don't think so at least. We will try to do everything to avoid it, but we did something we called restart Finland 18 months ago. We had a customer event last week which was spectacular, business-to-business customers, 700 there. And we had a speakers list that were like who is who in Finland and then plus me. I think we have a momentum in Sonera. If you look at Sonera &#x2013; I said it in my speech, if you look at Sonera over the past 10 years, it's been extremely turbulent and I think they lost focus occasionally during that 10-year journey. And 18 months ago we sat together, the whole group management of the company and the Finnish management, and said, yes, restart Finland.</p>
          <p>And I think we start seeing some signs of success here; yes, we are more aggressive. We are pushing harder because we want to regain the number one position in the mobile. We are one point behind Elisa in mobile in Finland and we don't like that. No, not at any price, but if we could get the same customer satisfaction in Finland we have here in Sweden business-to-business where we are an ocean or a mile ahead of competition, we are 69% and the next guy is at 63, if we could get that kind of advantage in Finland we will regain the number one position. And that's what it is all about.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are right. It's not unusual that we have different termination rates in different markets, but it's a complex issue and it's really the regulator in the end who makes those calls. I know there are discussions going on and this discussion going on about 3G, we still don't have 3G in Kazakhstan, which is for me even a much bigger issue. And I'm a member of the President's Foreign Investment Council. I go there twice a year and the only thing I say to him every time is, we need a 3G license, we need to get going. Kazakhstan wants to be the hub of Eurasia and is the only country together with Azerbaijan not having 3G. Sorry, but that's for me a much bigger issue than the termination rate, whatever they think is...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. It's Barry Zeitoune from Berenberg here. A few questions, if I may. The first is on Norway; I was wondering whether you could give us some color on what impact MTR cuts will have on absolute EBITDA going into 2011? The second question is on Swedish mobile, very interesting development in terms of the uptake of smart phones. I would be quite interested to know how the conversion rate of somebody taking a smart phone to somebody subscribing to a data package is developing and where it currently stands.</p>
          <p>And then a couple of big picture questions as well; just in terms of the situation with MegaFon and Turkcell I was wondering whether you believe you still have an opportunity to buy the Fintur minority from Turkcell, and if there isn't a favorable development in the current situation whether you would still be interested in buying the Fintur minority? And then finally, you mentioned Cambodia on the call and that you would expect to see consolidation. Do you think you would be actively involved in that consolidation? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Turkcell, yes, we have an agreement with Alfa when everything is done and executed both in Russia as well as in Turkey then we have agreed that they were support our wish to buy Fintur &#x2013; the minority of Fintur. That's &#x2013; so this is the last thing we will do. So a lot of other things will have to happen before we get there.</p>

          <p>Much lower because there would be &#x2013; there is symmetry between us and Telenor, as you know. So, we will have &#x2013; be offset by lower cost as well, so much lower on EBITDA.</p>

          <p>No worries. The other question was to do with the smart phone development. I am interested to know that, I think previously you mentioned the take for the data package from the smart phone is increasing. So I don't know whether it's kind of at around &#x2013; for me to take the smart phone today, what proportion of those people will take the data package and what was that previously? So, how much better are you at converting a smart phone to a data package?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Laurie Fitzjohn from Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Laurie Fitzjohn from Citigroup. Three questions, if I can. Firstly, on Spain, given the significant contribution to the group growth and a very successful last quarter, are you now starting to view this as a core asset as opposed to past? Secondly, on the cash flow, on my calculations there was a 3 billion reduction in net debt not attributable to cash flows. And I was just wondering, is this mainly due to FX, foreign exchange, translation? And lastly, on other EBITDA line, you state there is improvements in the head office cost and associates, given you saw there was quite a significant jump up in the other EBITDA line. I was wanting to know if you see this as a sustainable improvement or is there some one-off transitions within the other cost lines? Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first one. With these kinds of results, obviously the urgency to do something or find a solution is not as high as it was two years ago. I will come back and make a more of the comment when we finish the year. I really want to see the fourth quarter, and I want to have agreed the plan for '11 before I make any other comments on that topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the cost on the corporate side, as you asked about, I think we've had a pretty aggressive cost-cutting program down in the headquarter, and if you look at this quarter, I think we are down with close to 20% on the cost side. Now, that can't be standard over time but we will gain from this another couple of quarters going forward perhaps, but not to the same extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Yeah, we have the discussion in the Board of MegaFon, which I'm not part of. But there are TeliaSonera representatives, Tero Kivisaari is one of them, and they have the discussion. I mean historically, there are three parties &#x2013; it has always been one party who is against for I think negotiation tactics. I think it was Alfa and now it's Elisa who is one of them. We've always been for it, so we will see maybe one day we will agree. The company certainly has the resources.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maurice from Barclays; couple of quick questions. You're seeing in Sweden mobile topline growth with expanding margins and you talked about the change in handsets, less iPhones, more Android. Is your overall direction of marketing and the subsidy cost changing much because of that change in split? And the second question, on mobile data you talked about handling the exponential growth of traffic and obviously you have caps and you throttled speed as well. Are you seeing any anecdotal evidence from consumers in terms of the impact of throttling caps on the usage or churn, at least on these data points? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last question, I don't think you see any signs. I mean the caps are affecting very few people. So, I think it's a hygiene factor for the industry to have that tool and I've explained that before. But I don't think we have any anecdotal evidence that has affected our market share or market position or whatever. I just conclude this morning that we have the most satisfied mobile customers in this country. Halebop is beating us a little bit, but Halebop is also Telia and then is us. So, I think we're pretty happy with that. And you heard me talk about the three focus area of which the most important one is world class customer experience, that is world class customer experience what we measure, 69 is not world class but we're trying to measure that. The first question...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that you referred to the slide that the Lars showed, Maurice, if I am right, showing the split of iPhone and other operating system. Is that right? If we have shifted focus...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, and the impacts on overall spend or subsidiary spend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have changed our focus. I think some of &#x2013; I think Nokia is trying to position their terminals lower price level than the iPhone. You look at Samsung Galaxy, it's sort of the same price level as iPhone. So I mean, iPhone &#x2013; Apple was an early entrant to this market. They created the market more or less. Now there is followers coming in and they are trying to position themselves in a different position to Apple, which I think is good for us. I think it's good for our company that our customers have a choice between many different kind of mobile phones and price points.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Andy Parnis from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Andy Parnis at UBS. I've just two questions actually. The first question was just on Norway, I think we touched on this, but mobile EBITDA was down 5%. I was wondering if you could give bit more detail what you are seeing in Norway and why particularly you are seeing, first, pressure on the EBITDA margin. And then secondly, in the Baltic Region, I know you mentioned that you are seeing some sort of improvement. Are you &#x2013; what are you seeing on the competitive side there? Are you seeing the competitors becoming more aggressive as the overall market environment improves or has competition stayed broadly the same? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the last one again. I think the people at TeliaSonera's operations in the Baltic have done a really good job in defending the EBITDA margin and in most cases the market share. I think clearly the market is recovering. What we see is the decline is slowing down. So hopefully, it will turn this quarter or next quarter into actually a growth. I am not unhappy with our performances in the Baltic in general. There are some areas where I think we could have done even a little bit better than we did. But the most important thing is the market and hopefully, and I believe actually the market is stabilizing and probably will go back to growth hopefully over the next year. Norway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, I can answer question on Norway. As you know, from the 1st of January, there is a relatively substantial cap in MTR that Per-Arne has described earlier and that has led to some more activities on competition and that has also forced us to be a bit more active on the subscriber acquisition cost, as Per-Arne also mentioned, when it comes to marketing activities. So, it is a little bit more active on the competition side ahead of the MTR cap from the 1st of January next year.</p>
          <p>I guess he is happy with that answer, so we take the next one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Dominik Klarmann from HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, everyone. Just a clarification on your lower CapEx; the driver is mainly delays due to the component shortage rather than equipment pricing falling quicker than you expected, is that the right understanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it could be a combination. I mean we have seen price pressure on the equipment prices, but there has been sort of delays and I think the biggest delay we ever had is actually in the fiber rollout and that's not so much connected to the component shortage and more that it has been perhaps more complicated than we thought to roll it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks to Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have two more questions. So, let's take them before we sum up here. Operator, can we have the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just two questions please. Firstly, on Swedish fixed line, your loan loss widened quite a bit. And I was just wondering if &#x2013; can you tell us, is that driven more by some of the competitive pressures you mentioned earlier, or is that more pressure from substitution to mobile? And then secondly, are you able to share anything regarding any discussions you've had with the government about buying stock from them? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's more substitution &#x2013; clearly, more substitution to not mobile. And we actually get our fair share on that substitution. It goes to Telia, not everyone though. Somebody goes to our mobile competitors. That has been the case now for, I don't know, five, six years or something like that and it continues. And as I said before, what we need to do is to get the speed up on those fixed networks via fiber, VDSL 2 and provide not only voice, because I think voice is not the most important going forward, it is really the TV and the internet is going to drive the need for a fixed network because of the appetite being unlimited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can just follow-up there. There is a smaller one-time correction in the line loss of 43,000 customers. So you have to adjust for that, and if you do that you will see that it's fairly in line with previous quarter, maybe a touch higher this quarter. The second question was on buyback and discussions with the Swedish government.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's &#x2013; the Chairman of the Board has those discussions and obviously this is a Board decision. I have an opinion and I wouldn't mind buying back shares, but I like to buy back shares also then from the two major owners, the Finnish and the Swedish stake, because otherwise if we didn't, their ownership will go up, which I don't think is wished by anybody I hope. When I say that I also want to underline how valuable they are to us. To have the Swedish and the Finnish stake as owner &#x2013; part owner of this company is really helpful when you deal with Eurasia or Russia or Turkey. Now, whether the Board will decide this or that, we will come back to when they have had the discussion and we normally do that when we come with the fourth quarter results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, operator, let's see who the last person to ask the question for the day is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mr. David Wright from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's David here. Lars, I know you don't normally like to be pushed too much on questions, but I might try my look a little on Spain. Your businesses &#x2013; the TeliaSonera Group in general is in great shape, great cash flows, low gearing, yet Spain now seems to be hitting its absolute top form and top momentum. Why cut it short with a focus on EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, because I think it's an important commitment they made to the Board when they got their money. And they have got all the money and we have reached now the lowest level of the cash flow and I want to see some money come back. I think it's a very principal issue. If I say, guys, you can go spend more money, then they will send the message in the whole company as well. Three focus areas, quality in networks, cost; we have to watch cost all the time and I'll tell you, when I came here and Per-Arne came here, I don't think we were that focused on cost.</p>
          <p>I think cost was sort of automatic sometimes. And we've changed that culture and I &#x2013; if I should start saying, spend the money, you don't have to make the profit commitment you made to the Board, I send the wrong message, not only in Spain but in the whole company. So that's why I didn't want to &#x2013; because &#x2013; I will say we did talk about it and I think there were some people not too far away who thought we should maybe invest, but in the end, Per-Arne and I said, no, we're not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Super, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, David. Lars, do you want to say some concluding remarks or should we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I think thanks for all the questions. There were lots of questions today. I think we're happy with this quarter. It's not spectacular, but the growth is the encouraging thing. I think we missed that when we started the year. If you would have asked me and I were totally honest with you, I never thought we would have 4.3% growth in the third quarter of this year. I wasn't even sure of that when we ended the second quarter with 2.9 for the first six months.</p>
          <p>So, the growth is really good. Eurasia is back, it feels really good. When I came here there was like 20% growth, and then this went down to 2% or 3% or 4% or 5% because of the financial crisis and the oil prices, et cetera. Back to 18, 53% EBITDA margin, it's great. We have a challenging role there. There's nothing new. We have known that for five years. I think as I wrote &#x2013; I think we believe we can manage that transition. It's going to be difficult because there are so many unknowns, but we have confidence that we will do a good job in managing that transition.</p>
          <p>So, thank you for coming.</p>
