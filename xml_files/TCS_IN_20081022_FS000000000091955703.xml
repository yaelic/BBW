          <p>Ram, Maha, and Chandra will each give us a brief overview of the company's performance, followed by a Q&amp;A session.  As you are aware, TCS does not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance.  Furthermore, anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as forward-looking statements must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces.  These risks are outlined in the second slide of our results presentation.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar.  TCS performance in quarter two and the first half of '09 has been satisfactory.  Revenues for the quarter were Rs 6,953 crores; in U.S. dollar, 1.574 billion, a growth of 8.5% in Rupee terms and 3.2% in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I must add that despite the turmoil, international revenues grew by 9.5% sequentially.  We've always said our focus has been on sustaining long-term growth organically and inorganically, balancing growth across markets and verticals, improving productivity of all resources, and ensuring a sustainable margin scenario.</p>
          <p>Our drive towards tightening operations is reaping benefits. And the highlight of this quarter has been our operating performance.  Going forward, this will be our focus area.  In an environment that has been far from easy, we had strong plant additions, 51 new plants have been added, significant improvement in gross margin, 366 basis points through improved offshore mix, stable to better pricing, increased productivity, exchange gain, and a great project execution.</p>
          <p>Offshore mix per se improved by 187 basis points; utilization went up to 81.1%.  Overall, our operating margin improved by 217 basis points.  We also reduced our overall debtor days outstanding.  On a half yearly basis, TCS revenues grew by 24.8% and over U.S. $3 billion and brokerage grew 3% to $567 million.</p>
          <p>As you all know, the volatility of the rupee this quarter, and this impacted our numbers on a net basis.  We always said that our hedging program was to protect revenues at a certain rupee dollar rate, but there has been a significant hedging impact given the sharp depreciation of the rupee in quarter two, after having appreciated earlier.  Even so, net income in quarter two has grown by 144 basis points over quarter one because we have delivered on our core operating parameters.  We remain focused on improving and optimizing our operational performance and continue to focus on margin improvement opportunity.</p>
          <p>A few comments about our recent acquisition of the Citigroup Global Services. It's a very strategic acquisition and will also bring immediate benefits.  The accompanying $2.5 billion contract, which is a take-or-pay nine and a half year contract, is insurance in the current scenario.  Also, I believe that not everybody has grasped the strategic significance of the deal.  The domain-led banking process expertise we'll acquire through this deal gives us a unique strategic advantage going forward.  It allows us to offer banks an outsourcing solution for their core operations and offer this core domain intensive BPO.  This will allow clients to derive much more value from their technology spend in addition to their IT service spends.</p>
          <p>Overall, our deal pipeline is healthy. And on the people side, we have recruited 18,664 people in the first half of the year to be ahead of our annual hiring target.  We will achieve our target for FY'09 between 30 and 35,000 gross additions.  In addition, we also made almost 25,000 offers to engineering graduates to join us next financial year.  As you can see, we are continuing to make investments for our growth in terms of employee addition investments in sales and creation of infrastructure.</p>
          <p>We believe that even in the current situation, there are significant opportunities in the process of financial sector consolidation and other business trends.  As an agile organization, we are ready to mobilize the resources, domain and technical capabilities to grab opportunities as they arrive.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now hand over to Chandra to talk about the demand scenario and provide a perspective on operations.  After that, Maha, our CFO will talk about the financials.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ram.  Operationally, this quarter has been an excellent quarter for us.  We have done very well considering the circumstances.  I would like to summarize the performance of this quarter by covering four important themes; growth, margins, what is happening in the BFSI sector, and finally the deal flow.</p>
          <p>First, growth.  The growth has been very robust this quarter.  We had a volume growth of 6% and it was accompanied by a 30 basis point increase in the pricing realization on strong plant additions.  All international markets and most industry verticals, that is all industry verticals except one, have posted positive growth in constant currency terms.</p>
          <p>From a sustainability perspective, we added 51 new clients and most importantly, moved 32 new clients into the one to 10 million annual revenue category.  This has been the highest number in the recent quarters.  In terms of large deals, we closed four large deals in the quarter; in banking, retail, pharma, and public services one each, and these deals came from U.S., U.K., and India.  Further, the pipeline of 20 deals is well distributed, both across verticals as well as across geographic markets.</p>
          <p>Second, in terms of margins.  From a margin perspectives, we manage to provide an improvement sequentially on all key operating levers resulting in a 366 basis point improvement in gross margin and 217 basis point improvement in operating margin.  The important numbers are, the offshore leverage went up by 187 basis points, and we drove the better productivity on pricing.  Utilization, excluding trainees, cost 80%, which I had also talked about as a possibility during the earnings call last quarter.</p>
          <p>Third, in terms of the BFSI sector.  Revenue from the BFSI sector continued to grow in spite of the current financial industry situation.  Specifically, six of the TCS's financial services customers went through difficulties in the global industry crisis.  We have carefully analyzed them and have looked at both the revenue side and the receivables exposure.  From a receivables perspective, we have made provisions in this quarter on a conservative basis on whatever we think we have to do.</p>
          <p>From a revenue perspective, most of the revenue is not likely to be impacted.  Additionally, we have most of our clients on the other side of the problem, in the sense that these are the large banks, which have acquired some of the other institutions and we are seeing growth with those clients.</p>
          <p>Specifically in terms of deals in the banking and financial services sector, the product implementations have been delayed, but we continue to see demand for our services business in the BFSI clients.  Trend in client additions indicate that the near term neo costs are likely to come up with additional growth.</p>
          <p>Now, no significant impact has been felt on other verticals. And we continue to see robust revenue growth from manufacturing and retail.</p>
          <p>In terms of deals, we signed four large deals excluding the Citigroup Global Services Limited deal, which we talked about during the quarter. And these four deals have come across BFS, retail, government and pharma vertical.  We continue to believe that the current economic environment is an opportunity for our clients and for us to streamline operations, drive sequential productivity gains, and to overall setup our organizations for the next phase of growth.</p>
          <p>As for the outlook, that's a practice we do not give guidance.  I would like to simply say that we are confident of growth and our focus on the following four aspects.  One, improving various operational parameters continuously.  Second, our deal pipeline is healthy.  Third, client additions are good.  And fourth, we are continuing to invest for future growth as you can see in the head count additions during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And over to Maha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra.  I would also repeat that TCS performance has been satisfactory as already articulated.  In an environment full of uncertainty and turmoil, we recorded revenue of Rs 69.53 billion corresponding to U.S.$1.574 billion for the quarter.  We have recorded a strong operational performance in Q2.  We have delivered sequential growth and improved the quality of revenue as well by shifting work offshore.  Revenue increased 8.47% Q-on-Q and 25.29% year-on-year in rupee terms that is 3.21% and 14.72%, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
          <p>The following is a breakdown of revenue growth quarter-over-quarter; volume 6%, pricing 30 basis point, effort mix that is on-site to offshore, since that moved to offshore there has been a decline in revenue to the extent of 99 basis points, foreign exchange positive 3.16 and this totaled to 8.47%.  We grew our gross margin by 366 basis points this quarter to 45.71%, primarily, by improving our offshore leverage 55 basis points, productivity 165 basis points and Forex gains 146 basis points.</p>
          <p>Cost management continues as a program. And by increasing utilization rate, improving project management and through continuing focus on each item of cost, we have been able to achieve a significant improvement in operating margin by 217 basis points sequentially.  This improvement has come despite headwinds of provisions for a few BFS accounts, which have been under stress and also in the news.  Our provision for bad and doubtful debts have been high and has taken a bit incrementally 55 basis points from our margin.</p>
          <p>The breakdown of various items that impacted margins quarter-over-quarter are as follows. Q1 operating margin was 22.06%, Forex impact on this has been a positive 1.46%.  Effort mix was a positive 0.55%. Improvement in realization and productivity was a positive 1.65%. Bad debts provisions was a negative 0.55%. And other SG&amp;A was a negative 0.94%.  And this totaled 2.17% and we reached the Q2 '09 operating margin of 24.23%.</p>
          <p>I'll deal with foreign exchange now.  In such volatile times, one must stay focused on the basic objective of the hedging program and not be duly -- unduly concerned about foregoing short-term risky opportunities to profit from a volatile exchange rate.  Q2 was one of the most challenging quarters in terms of Forex volatility.  U.S. dollar, which is the level of Rs 40 in April witnessed a sharp movement between 41.80 and Rs 47 during quarter two.  The cross currency rates between USD and GBP euro also moved in a volatile manner.  Volatility index of USD, for instance, was at 14% in Q2 as against 6% in the prior quarter.  It is in times like this we need a strong and consistent hedging program.  As against average rate of Rs 42.03 to the U.S. dollar in Q1, we have realized revenues at Rs 44.17 in Q2.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q1, we had kept you informed that our existing hedge position of $276 million at 43 would have been -- would have meant a loss of Rs 50 crores this quarter.  When the rupee appreciated once again at the beginning of quarter two, we added to our hedges because of the need to protect our revenues as normal.  The surprising u-turn in the Indian currency because of added volatility has resulted in a hedging loss of 261 crores or Rs 2.61 billion under other income.</p>
          <p>We have said that the hedging operation is designed to protect budgeted rates of exchange so that our performance measures up to our budget.  We do not bet on different scenarios, but examine what needs protection and take necessary action.  We have done this since last year and then it benefited us extensively.</p>
          <p>From a risk reduction perspective, it is not only important to hedge dollar revenues to protect the conversion rates, but also hedge the dollars against GBP and euro.  Our decision to cover crosses has also helped and have we not hedged this, the impact would have been much higher.</p>
          <p>As far as Q3 is concerned, we have hedged $180 million in the range of 39 to Rs 41.82. That means that we do not participate on those 180 million about Rs 41.82. And we have hedged another 300 million in the range of 43.15 to 46.50, which means that beyond 46.50 we do not participate.  Overall, we expect the currency volatility to continue on looking at the scenario that changes rapidly.</p>
          <p>At the net income level, we have grown to 1,262 crores or Rs 12.62 billion in Q2 over 1,244 crores or Rs 12.44 billion. Despite the hedging headwinds, our EPS for the quarter is Rs 12.89 as against 12.71 in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to recap, we had an outstanding quarter in terms of operations and execution.  All our profit levers worked in tandem to produce the 217 basis point improvement in operating margin.  We have our share of the problems caused by external environment and have made adequate provisions for any debt considered doubtful.  We are in a challenging environment, and our focus has to be on managing risk, continued growth, and delivering margins.  Our efforts to create a resilient long-term business model is working well, and we expect to continue on this path of operational efficiencies going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you very much.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  The first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello guys.  I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more. I know you covered it pretty extensively in the intro. On the demand environment -- and I guess I am looking for two particular areas maybe you could talk about. One, if you could talk about what you are seeing from your present client base, in the sense that, have they halted specific programs? Are they stopping specific programs? Are they not willing to talk about discretionary spending? And then on the flip side, obviously, you've had some new signings. I am wondering if you could talk about what's pushing those people to do this work now even though it's sort of a tough time to be spending money.  I am wondering if you could talk about both of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I would like to answer this question in two dimensions.  One is with the current clients, we've have not seen any specific cancellation of projects at this time.  Specifically, in the financial services industry, as I've said, we are seeing traction in the services business. And also especially with some of the institutions going through mergers, we are seeing opportunities for us in the integration activities.  Then in terms of new signings, these deals have come from multiple sectors. We have signed deals in financial services, retail, government sector as well as pharma. And the deals pipeline price are spread out across different geography locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, I guess, with the Citigroup acquisition, do you expect to maybe gain market share from some of your competitors and some of these accounts where there is some mergers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Citigroup acquisition brings us a unique capability.  If you really look at your services portfolio, to serve large and mid-sized financial services firms you need three capabilities; the technology in terms of application, technology in terms of infrastructure, third is operations.  We have a very strong application and infrastructure portfolio. On the operation side, we had a lot of capability in the horizontal services.  The Citigroup acquisition brings in a unique domain-based crossing capability and positions TCS uniquely among all service providers across the globe to do this for different financial services institutions.  So we believe this will in near term or medium term &#x2013; if not in near term, in medium term, will position us very well to serve the clients worldwide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just secondly, I am wondering if you could talk about maybe some of the metrics. It sounds &#x2013; it seems like utilization is obviously hitting a high level here. What &#x2013; do you have any headroom on that? And also on the pricing front, are you seeing any renegotiations in pricing and pricing coming down at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the utilization, I had answered in the same question in the last quarter earnings call.  We have said that on our base of 120,000 people plus, we have definitely headroom to improve the utilization, which we used to maintain between 77 to 79%. We said that we will probably move it up 80 to 81%.  We saw that as a lever. And we used it. If there is a need we can push it up a little more. But our intent is not to only work on utilization higher and higher, but in the case of increasing demand that is the lever that we will exercise on a need basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the pricing side, we have improvement of about 30 basis point this quarter. And by and large, we are stable on pricing. We are not seeing down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Rochelle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from the line of Mr. George Price of Stifel Nicholas. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question.  Just to follow up on the pricing, things appear to be stable, relatively stable at this point.  I guess, I'd like to hear your perspective on what you think the outlook for pricing is maybe over the next two to four quarters. Maybe drawing back on your experience in the last downturn, what do you see as the puts and takes? What's similar or what could be similar in terms of impacts to pricing this time around versus last downturn?  And what's different that might not be the same? And net-net, how do you see that impacting pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think based on the situation that exists today we can say that the pricing will be stable.  That's what we expect. And the focus for us is on execution, timely completion of projects and quality of deliverables.  And as long as we continue to focus and bring those range of capabilities and deliver well, we think we can maintain the pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on the &#x2013; one other question on the integration work that you discussed, is &#x2013; where are you do you think in terms of that ramping up? And how big do you think or how sizeable do you think it could be? Is this a modest bit of incremental work? And is the timing more likely a year from now or could it be larger, could it be sooner, if you could give us your perspectives on that?  And I thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the terms of integration work we are in the early days.  At this point in time, the plans are being drawn and analysis is being done and specific project discussions are happening.  And I would say that this will happen in the coming quarters during the calendar year 2009.  In terms of volumes, whether it will be a very heavily intensive, so far we've got to wait. But the important point is, in the financial services sector all our key clients present opportunities for us. And we expect to do work in this area apart from any other area in terms of developmental work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question Rochelle.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And just on the Forex, I guess, you mentioned that, last time you said the loss in this quarter at HTM at around 43, it would be roughly 50 crores. And last time, the rupee has depreciated by Rs 3 on a end to end quarter basis. This time it has been depreciated by around Rs 4.  But this 50 crores has almost become four times.  So is there something which is happened during Q2 which was not there at the time of discussion of the Q1 results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is that &#x2013; that was at the rate of 43. And if you really look at it, the range has moved from 41.80 to 47. So that has been a phenomenal movement and lots of revenues are also coming at 46.98, which was the closing rate.  And therefore, we do talk in terms of averages of 44 and so on. But we're looking at different positions at the month end and so when the revenue accrues.  And that is a substantial one.  So that would be the one movement.  The other movements have also been in terms of certain losses in other subsidiaries and so on.  Some of the other currencies like Brazilian reals have moved up.</p>
          <p>The third one is, we had also taken additional positions during the quarter when the rupee had moved down to about 41.80, 42 range, and we had protected our revenues in order that we would realize higher than the quarter one average rate and so on.  So that again was another factor which essentially resulted at an overall level of Rs 261 crores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the outstanding hedge and what is the average realized rate on that hedge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the outstanding hedges as far as &#x2013; let me give you some figures, as you know, we do essentially lots of lien options and so on.  So as far as Q3 is concerned, we've got $480 million where the maximum participation is at 44.75.  There are combined &#x2013; there are a number of options, but this is the weighted average of it.  In Q4, we've got $190 million where the participation will be limited to 41.90.  And in 2009, 2010, we've got $349 million, but the participation is limited to 41, and beyond that we have $231 million where the participation is limited to 41.50.  So these are the various hedges and OCI figure is already there in the website, and totally you'll find that 6.742 billion is being shown in OCI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And as you have given the breakup of this OCI, can you share that breakup of OCI to be debited to P&amp;L in the next three to four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the things is you are essentially working on the basis of say rates that are prevailing at various points of time.  In fact at the end of last quarter, we have run series of lectures on how the foreign exchange accounting is done.  And if you just go through, and I think some of them are at the website, you should be able to figure that out. It's not that the same figure will come in because if the rates turns out to be different, whether it is appreciating or depreciating, it would be different.  Just as an example, last quarter we said that Rs 500 million would come in, as far as Q2 is concerned if the rate of 43; had it been 42, it would have been much less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And the next question is in terms of the demand trends in the verticals beyond BFSI, so is there any indication that there the clients are asking for some kind of a IT spend cut? Or is there a indication of a billing rate pressure in that verticals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I already covered it.  From our point of view, we are not seeing any impact on other verticals. We are also seeing growth opportunities in manufacturing, retail, pharma, and other sectors.  So that's our take at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks, and all the best.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah.  The next question is from the line of Kanchana Vydianathan of Pacific Crest Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my question.  I guess my first question is, looking at the offshore percentage of revenue that's been increasing, can you help us understand, how much of that is actually been driven by your clients, who are pushing you to do more work offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the offshore leverage target is always a known -- we were collaborated with the clients and we have been seeing for sometime that the offshore leverage is something that we'll be pushing.  And in this environment, I can tell you that clients also like it.  That's the general way I can answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. And I guess one question with regards to the pricing as a follow-up. As you've already mentioned that the pricing is stable, but can you help us understand are you seeing any sporadic renegotiations of contracts at this point where clients not just in BFSI, but as in other verticals are going back and re-looking at their existing contracts and trying to have discussions with you on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have not had a renegotiation of any price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And one final question, I guess, you've seen good growth in Europe this quarter, in U.K. and in Continental Europe.  With respect to the wide concern out there is, are we going to see a slowdown in Europe as we have been seeing in the North America.  Can you help us understanding what is your confidence level, I guess, going into the next two quarters that you'll be able to sustain the growth that you've seen in Europe? Or are you seeing early signs of weakness there?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we don't give guidance. And while we are confident of growth, I would always say in this current environment, you have to be cautious.  But currently, the deal pipe is good. And we are focused on improving operational parameters and also investing in adding people.  So that's the indication that I can give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Vydianathan.  The next question is from the line of Mr. Anthony Miller of TechMarketView.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you, gentlemen.  I wonder if you could give us please an update on Diligenta.  There is three or four things I'm particularly interested in.  Firstly, how are you progressing with the platform transformation.  In other words, when will that platform be complete?  Related to that, when do you hope to bring on the next client on to that platform?  Can you also give us a sense of what you think the impact will be if HCL's acquisition of Liberata, which operates in that space?  And finally, can you just tell us what the margins are please for Diligenta?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  In respect of the platform, we are pretty much on track.  We have made two deliveries out of four that are scheduled and our key typical delivery will be completed in February '09.  And so far, everything that we've seen and heard seems to indicate that the platform will be life changing as far as the L&amp;T business is concerned.</p>
          <p>We have added one more client, that we had, to the Perl group. And clearly, our focus is when we enter this business not to have a lift and drop model.  So we are clearly waiting patiently till we have our new platform, after which we will aggressively pursue opportunities in the marketplace, so that gives us an opportunity to move directly to the new platform do the offshoring and everything else that we were looking at.</p>
          <p>I don't want to comment on the HCL Liberata situation.  If you've been tracking the industry, you would know what the state of the Liberata and their clients is.  So that's something that you should take a call on.  And on the marketing side, as I said, we are reasonably confident that once we have the new platform, we will be in a much better shape to make sure that we will be in a position to win most of the business that would be on the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it, but that last question was actually what the margin is for Diligenta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, I heard marketing so.  As far margin is concerned, we are on track. And clearly, we'll see a significant improvement once we have the transformation completed.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just to clarify, what you just said before, you said you had another client after Perl.  Are you referring to Sun Life Canada</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...which is not actually operating on the Diligenta platform.  That's right.  There is no new client yet on the Perl platform, is there? The Diligenta platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, the platform will be ready to take the substantial portion of that business post February 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Miller.  The next question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks.  It seems like there is a pretty big change in tone regarding the outlook while compared to your tone on conference calls in the past few quarters, can you kind of address that? Have we seen anything specific that happened during the quarter, maybe did you feel that you're better positioned than where you were a quarter, maybe two quarters ago?  You had strong client additions, are you gaining share from some of the competitors? Maybe you can kind of address that because again it just feels that your tone seems a bit more positive than previous conference calls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all I can say is that I don't know whether it's a big difference in tone, but I can tell you the key facts.  First, is that on the financial services industry, we looked at the clients who are in trouble.  As I said, there are six clients from our list of clients in the financial service industry who had difficulties.  And we looked at the receivables situation and then whatever we feel has to be provided for has been more than provided for in this quarter.  That's one side of the equation.</p>
          <p>And on the growth side, we believe that the kind of clients we have, we are planning to gain from the current situation and we expect growth in the coming &#x2013; in the next fiscal year you can say.  That's the financial study of the industry situation.</p>
          <p>And then, we've not seen any project cancellation in any of the other sectors and we are seeing a healthy deal pipeline.  So that's what we are reflecting.  As Ram articulated, having said all of this, the environment in which we are operating has been extremely a turbulent one.  That was the only fact which was putting the caution and that we're going to watch. Otherwise, all the things that we are seeing, I've articulated to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Chandra, when you talk to customers do you feel that you are going to see the '09 budget cycle kind of on time compared to previous years, or you think it's going to be pushed out by a couple of months, which is really what happened in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to be very client-specific.  I think what is going to happen is that &#x2013; see, look at like this, there are going to be clients who are highly leveraged in terms of the global network delivery model.  And there two things can happen; if there is additional things we leverage, they will push back very quickly because they know the model.  And if there are any transformation projects they want to do, then they will leverage the global delivery model, that's one thing that'll happen.  And the clients who are not fully leveraged will leverage the global delivery model definitely for cost efficiencies and their IT set up efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Specifically, from the budget's point of view, some clients who are in the middle of the situation may take longer to finalize the budget.  They may be incrementally awarding the budgets so that whatever essential has to happen will happen.  But I don't see a broad industry trend where the budgets will be postponed.  That is not what I'm hearing.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.  The next question is from the line of Divya Nagarajan of JM Financial.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I notice there was a strong addition in the lower end of your client base this quarter.  Could you give us length of the mix of the clients that you've got here, from what verticals do you finally had these clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We have, as I said, added about 32 clients into the 1, 5, 10 million category, which I think is very, very positive one from our point of view.  And the mix of these clients are across verticals, good bit of clients in manufacturing, retail, travel sectors, utility sectors as well as financial services sector, and also in the U.S. and outside U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  We've also seen a very sharp increase in your application, development and maintenance this quarter, which seems to be blocking the trend, which we're seeing with other players so far.  Is this because of some large deals coming on scene in this quarter?  What's happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think that is a trend that may continue because in situations where clients want to get optimized, I think there is an opportunity for increasing the ADM work.  The second is that, that's also reflected in the volume growth you saw.  And again, it may be very specific to clients. Sometimes you are working with a client who has not leveraged the global delivery model, then there is a good ramp up happening in the application and development and maintenance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I know you don't give guidance, but if you look at the other, your peers in the sector, they've all guided for flat to negative volume growth for the next question, and there's also being some impact that they've guided for the cross currency movements.  Are you confident of this volume growth trend continuing into the second half, I mean so as to speak blocking the trends so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't give guidance definitely.  And then, all I can tell you is that because I don't have a specific number and I can't tell you whether this is sustainable or not.  But in overall we are looking at some kind of a growth over the coming quarters.  That's what I can tell you, but I don't have any numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks, and all the best.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Nagarajan.  The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan of Centrum Broking.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello.  I just had a clarification, if you look at the change in tone this quarter.  Is it because you're seeing that existing clients that you have at this point of time are actually coming out and are looking at large ramp-ups? Or is that in terms of new clients, for those, restructuring the sales force, you are seeing a lot of new opportunities that are out there in terms of new client adds that are available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a lot of people are referring to tones.  But all we are saying is that we're taking what we are see and we're giving it data points.  And, as I said, the new clients adds have been good. And more importantly, the clients adds at the lower end of the revenue bands, 1 million, 5 million, 10 million have been good.  So we need to see how we can convert them and ramp-up. That is something that we'll have to work on.  As you know ramp ups take time and 1 million client doesn't translate to 5 million client overnight.  It takes a few quarters.  So from a long-term point of view, it is a good indication. I can't tell you what will happen in the near-term quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Now, the clients that we have got in this quarter, it's significantly much better than that what we saw last quarter.  So, I think we are seeing that restructuring really play out pretty well.  But overall, these clients that have early come through, is there any specific trend there in terms of, is it coming from some sort of vendor consolidation, are these first-time offshorers? Or is there something specific as a trend that you might have noticed there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no specific trend there that we can find.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just one last thing is, if you look at BFSI per se, you did mention that the merger and acquisition, integration kind of projects would take some time, probably sometime &#x2013; maybe sometime later next year.  But overall if you were to sequence the kind of projects that would come out, let's say, one in terms of integration and maybe few other possible kind of projects that could come out from these guys, what would those be and in what order could they flow? Maybe just a thought process that you would follow basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, it's very difficult to say. It could be consolidation of an application, it could be building up of a new platform, it could be rationalization of a large application portfolio for a particular vertical, when I say a vertical, it's something a particular domain in the banking and financial services, it could be infrastructure consolidation.  I mean there are a variety of opportunities, and you just need to work with the clients and see and what kind of opportunities they are able to capture, and then be proactive about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is your filler in terms of when we would really see a large chunk of RSPs really coming out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Mangal Keshav Securities.  I had a question regarding telecom, which seems to be underperforming even BFSI across the sector.  What are you seeing there in terms of demand?  And secondly, in terms of enterprise solutions, we seem to be lagging our competitors with absolute decline over the last two quarters in both BI as well as in enterprise solutions, what are we seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of telecom, we are having a slowdown in the &#x2013; when I say a slowdown in the established markets, major markets as we call it, but we are seeing opportunities in the emerging markets in telecom.  So I think overall it'll get balanced is what we feel. What we are not seeing huge ramp-up opportunities.  We are seeing transformation kind of opportunities in the emerging markets in telecom.</p>
          <p>Yet, in the transformation deals, I think, it all depends on how you define transformation deals.  When we define transformation deals, we really look at how you are going to transform something else -- something end-to-end.  We talked about the Nielsen deal. We have signed about two or three other deals. Now even the passport deal this quarter we've signed, these are massive transformation deals.  Transformation deals, the sizes are large and we are making a huge difference in the way the business process is laid out for the company.</p>
          <p>Smaller implementation of ERPs, et cetera, we don't generally consider as large scale transformations, and there what we see is that lot of application support kind of deals may happen, implementation of large ERP applications, et cetera.  Yes, there is a, what you call drop in those kind of deals.</p>

          <p>Okay.  And just one data point, in terms of revenue impact of hedging this quarter, what was the amount we experienced?  We were expecting 50 crores if the rupee were to stay at 43, what was the amount this quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The rupee did not stay at 43.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But this quarter what was the revenue impact of hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no revenue impact.  We have already announced that as far as the hedging loss is concerned it was 261.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Sure.  So my question is what is the value of contracts that you're bidding for in the next three to six months and the strike rate that you are looking for in these bids?  Also, what are you currently seeing in market in terms of prerequisites that your clients are asking for, especially when it comes to big transformational deals and how your new acquisition might have given you an edge in the market vis-&#xE0;-vis some of your smaller competition?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the size of the deals, we normally don't say what size it is.  In general, when we say large deals, they are deals spread over multiple years with material revenue.  So we'll leave it at that.  And in terms of transformation deals what our clients are looking for?  Our clients are looking for big changes in business processes in terms of digitalization, in terms of IT optimization, how we can bring the infrastructure operations and application know-how together.  Those are all the things the clients look for.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, sir.  You've talked of seeing robustness in manufacturing retail verticals and other verticals, so is it company specific? When I mean to say company specific, is it TCS specific, or the similar kind of growth rate is also seen among offshore vendors, like all of them are getting business from those client base which you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've not studied other company results.  If you look at our results for manufacturing and retail, we have seen growth both in this quarter and as well as the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. You are talking of outlook in terms of robustness for next coming quarters in manufacturing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can only talk about TCS.  I can't talk about other companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Second thing, you also have done some cost containments stuff, which is more of the P&amp;L line item. And when I mean to say P&amp;L, it's more of operating expenditure.  Have you done a similar stuff in CapEx side of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx, we go through a fairly rigorous budgeting, and certainly we try and figure if there is any value engineering possibilities introduced that.  But to answer the question as to whether that has had any impact on the operating margin this quarter?  No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But have you changed your plan in the CapEx side compared to six months back, two quarters back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. we have not changed. And in fact, we continue with our budgeting as per our budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I need one clarification. If I see Q2 '08 numbers, there is some revision, is there any specific reason for that kind of revision in year ago?</p>

          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year, when we moved over to the USD figures and so on, we said that we would not be putting in any of the hedging figures in the revenue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that is the reason. And correspondingly that Forex loss or Forex gain would be also adjusted in other income item?</p>
