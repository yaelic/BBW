          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to the First Quarter Telephone Conference of BMW AG in 2009. With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner our CFO.</p>
          <p>Norbert Reithofer and Friedrich Eichiner will give a brief overview of the first quarter of 2009. Afterwards, we will have time for a question-and-answer session. Dr. Reithofer, the mic is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we told you that we would fight for every customer and every cent. And you will see that this fighting spirit is now paying off. In the first quarter of 2009, the BMW Group managed to stand its ground, despite the significant challenges in the business environment.</p>
          <p>Our Group EBIT stood at minus &#x20AC;55 million, an only slightly negative result. As we all know, at the beginning of 2008, the global economy was in a much better condition than it is today. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, our revenues declined by 13.4% to &#x20AC;11.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We managed to improve Group liquidity, again from the end of last year, to a new total of around &#x20AC;10 billion. We generated positive free cash flow. As you can see in our industry right now, a sound financial footing is the key to success in difficult economic times. Without liquidity, a company is not able to invest in its future.</p>
          <p>As of March, our deliveries, on Group level decreased by around 21%. Despite this, we still outperformed the global premium segment. For the total year, we do not expect to match the high retail volume achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>We anticipate a decline of 10 to 20% for the whole global automotive market in 2009. The figures show that it is much too early to give a definite forecast. You are familiar with the spring forecasts presented by the economic research institutes. Obviously, there seems to be no end in sight of this recession.</p>
          <p>The President of the German Institute for Economic Research recently pointed out that longer-term forecasts did not make any sense due to the continuing uncertainty of the markets. Therefore, we will continue to act with the here and now.</p>
          <p>What's most important is that we make best use of this time to prepare our company for the business and economic upturn. Allow me to pose the following three questions. What are we doing right now? Why have we chosen this approach? And what is our outlook for the future?</p>
          <p>First, how are we managing the current situation? We are countering the economic crisis with a comprehensive set of measures. We continue to adjust production to correspond with demand. In the first quarter, we produced fewer units than we delivered. By the end of March, we had greatly reduced Group inventory. In other words, we act with foresight and do not waste money.</p>
          <p>The efficiency enhancement program set out in our strategy number one is yielding positive results. In the first quarter of 2009, we managed to reduce costs below the level of the respective quarter of 2008. However, we are not only optimizing our current cost structures. We are also creating the solid foundation for future profitability.</p>
          <p>Currently, we are benefiting from a more stable used-car market in the US and the UK. Mr. Eichiner will tell you more about that in a moment. Let's move on to my second point, why have we chosen this approach.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our strong liquidity position, we have plenty of room to maneuver. That is, to take strategic decisions and charts across for the future, which gives us a competitive advantage. Another important aspect is that we will be in a very strong position once the markets begin to experience an upturn.</p>
          <p>Let's take the US market as an example. We continue to believe in the great potential of this major car market. This is why we are spending $750 million on the expansion of our plant in Spartanburg. This is why we are going to produce the X3 successor there, and this is why our American BMW dealerships plan to invest a total of $300 million this year.</p>
          <p>And we are benefiting from this commitment. For the very first time, the BMW brand outsold Lexus on the U.S. market in the first quarter of 2009. So since March, BMW has been the segment leader in the US, ahead of Lexus and Mercedes. We also increased our market share and recorded higher growth rates than the competition in the first three months of the year.</p>
          <p>BMW continues to be number one in the global premium market segment, and our lead over competitors is considerable. As of March, BMW's share of the global premium segment stood at over 20%. We are making the most of these difficult times to improve our strategic position in key markets.</p>
          <p>We managed to retain our total market share in major markets. In some countries-such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Russia, we were even able to improve slightly. In China, we increased retail by almost 14% in the first three months. In Germany, our first-quarter decrease in sales was lower than in other markets, minus 7% despite the fact that we benefit very little from the scrapping program.</p>
          <p>Actually, we expect positive effects from the introduction of the new CO2 based motor vehicle tax, as people will pay less tax on many BMW and MINI models. This is an additional purchasing incentive. Efficient dynamics gives us a major competitive advantage here. Our average fleet consumption is only 5.9 liters per 100 kilometers. This is much less than the average fleet consumption of all other premium car companies, as well as Germany's number one mass manufacturer.</p>
          <p>With efficient dynamics, we not only contribute significantly in supporting Germany to meet its ambitious environmental targets, but also in Europe and the rest of the world. Our model line-up is more appealing than ever. The new BMW 7 Series is the segment leader in Europe. In March, our</p>
          <p>flagship model was also launched in the United States and in Japan.</p>
          <p>As of March, sales of the BMW 1 Series decreased only slightly compared to last year's reference period. This model is more strongly positioned than its competitors. The BMW brand's new entry-level model, the 116d, was launched a few weeks ago. The revised BMW 3 Series Sedan is also more successful than its more recently launched competitors.</p>
          <p>Despite the economic crisis, sales of the BMW X5 and X6 remained more or less stable. Ten years ago, BMW's X5, as the first SAV on the market, redefined the entire SUV segment. In the first quarter of this year, our global sales of X5 and X6 vehicles were higher than those of comparable models by all other premium car companies combined. We expect the new models, due out this year, to further stimulate growth. More than ever, they represent trend setting design and our leadership and innovation.</p>
          <p>The new MINI Convertible was launched in March. And the new BMW Z4 arrives at the dealerships this Saturday. The initial media response has been very positive. In November, our X model series will be completed by the BMW X1. This vehicle will help us address new customers and meet new demands.</p>
          <p>The same is true for the BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo, a contemporary interpretation of the sedan concept. Once again, this car is going to define a completely new segment. Its unique versatility will attract new customer groups.</p>
          <p>At the Shanghai Auto Show, we celebrated the world premieres of the BMW X5 and BMW X6 in their M versions. These are the first M models of the BMW X series and equipped with Efficient Dynamics. There is still demand for high performance cars, provided they are efficient and fuel-economic. The considerable growth in sales of our M division by the way, over 50% last year, is proof of this.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, this year, we are taking our achievements in the field of new technologies to a new level. The fully-electric MINI E is being tested this year. Pilot projects are planned for the U.S., Germany and in the UK, and the BMW X6 and the new BMW 7 Series will be equipped with a hybrid drive. Our strategic focus is always on the long-term. In the next few years in particular, we will benefit from the introduction of new models, including our three top-selling model series.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea of what this entails. Between 2010 and 2012, we will update more than half of our entire product range. Our product portfolio will be completely different from the current one, and it could very well be to our advantage that these model changes of high volume model series will be parallel to the expected economic recovery.</p>
          <p>This leads directly to my third and last point, what is our outlook for the future? Due to the new models, our sales will gain even more momentum from 2010 on. Therefore, with these new models, our profitability will improve through the reduction of manufacturing costs and better capital efficiency. Our strategy number one includes specific growth and profitability targets for the year 2012.</p>
          <p>Our "Project I" team is a dedicated unit which develops new solutions for future sustainable mobility. The changing environment requires us, and every car company, to rethink the way we operate. We are shaping our future. This makes change inevitable. Therefore, despite the steps for more efficiency, we decided to increase the training budget for executives, and we have initiated a change process to further the spirit of looking ahead.</p>
          <p>Our strategy number one gives all of us at the BMW Group the confidence and the fortitude to take on and overcome the current challenges we face. And this fighting spirit helps us to look beyond and prepare to look for the future. We are convinced that we have set the right course. What we are doing now will pay off in the long-term. Initial results can already be seen. My colleagues and I will ensure that this company stays on course in the months to come.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to address in further detail the following three topics from the first quarter 2009, our finance and cost management, the situation of BMW Financial Services, and the challenges in the markets.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter performance reflects the operative progress made in the still difficult economic environment. This is also the result of our resolute financial and cost management, which we implemented early on. We greatly reduced auto production again in the first three months. We reduced inventories further, and fine tuned our receivables and payables in line with our targets.</p>
          <p>Our working capital in the Automobile segment declined by more than &#x20AC;1 billion. Cash flows from operating activities in this segment rose by 5.6% to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Unlike many competitors, we recorded a positive free cash flow of &#x20AC;220 million in the first quarter. We were extremely disciplined in a series of measures we took in light of the market declines. Fixed costs were decreased even further throughout the Group. Processes were made leaner in administration and production. In addition, further steps were taken to tap long-term cost potential.</p>
          <p>For example, continuation of the industrial construction kit, as well as various management initiatives. This enabled us to reduce material costs even further in the first quarter. Moreover, we benefited from lower raw material prices. Increased efficiency and strict cost discipline are fundamental in everything we do this year. Another goal we are pursuing for 2009 is to improve capital efficiency. We will reduce capital expenditure by some 10% as compared to 2008. This will not affect the expenditure necessary for future technologies, as for the development of innovations.</p>
          <p>We continue to manage our business with foresight. By the end of the quarter we had increased our liquidity position to a total of &#x20AC;10 billion. Our prudent use of funds is reflected by the net financial assets in the Automobile segment. Net financial assets were up &#x20AC;119 million to nearly &#x20AC;9.2 billion compared with the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We took account of your feedback in our most recent conversations with analysts and investors. The interim report includes a table showing the model used to calculate net financial assets did not change per se. What did change were the segments, which replaced the former subgroups. If you have any detailed questions in this regard, please get in touch with our experts after this conference call.</p>
          <p>Our finance management proves that the BMW Group is better equipped than many of its competitors. We are coping with the challenges we are facing this year with good measure. By doing so, we are putting ourselves in a strong position to fully harness the economic upturn when it happens. This brings me to the Financial Services segment. In light of the persistently difficult economic environment, the overall residual value risk situation is not expected to experience any relief in the foreseeable future. Developments currently differ substantially from one region to the next.</p>
          <p>In the US, used car residual values recovered in the first three months. According to the Manheim Index, the average price for CPO BMW automobiles on our most important market rose by more than 15 -- 14% between December and March. Increased demand for our premium used cars through the Certified Pre-Owned Program also contributed to stabilizing second-hand car prices in the US. CPO vehicle retail in the first quarter was nearly 14% higher than in the same quarter 2008. A total of almost 29,000 CPO automobiles were sold.</p>
          <p>We also saw the UK and Canadian markets post a marginal recovery. In contrast, used car prices in Germany continued to drop as a result of the scrapping incentives. In light of the negative economic environment, credit risk continued to affect earnings as well. The credit loss ratio for customer and dealership financing increased to 0.77% in the first quarter. We are countering this development by stepping up our receivables management even further. We do not expect this business area to experience relief in the short-term.</p>
          <p>Eliminations improved to &#x20AC;151 million, primarily due to the reduction in new businesses in the field of leasing as a result of positive effects from the reversal of intra-group profits. For further key figures by segment, please consult our interim report. The high level of sales incentives on key markets is currently a challenge. Our competitors had to reduce surplus inventories significantly in the first three months. This depressed prices, and prices will remain under considerable pressure. This translates into earnings risks, both for us and other manufacturers. We are working on stabilizing profit margins, and to this end, we have launched several initiatives in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We consider the reduction of these substantial incentives to be a major step towards normalizing the situation on the market, and a factor that will influence our earnings significantly. Our earnings prospects for the year as a whole depend on this.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter earnings demonstrate that we have succeeded in adapting the company to the slowdown in retail. We will act with the here and now for the rest of the year. The markets have failed to embark on a stable upward trend, despite the first positive signals.</p>
          <p>Naturally, we hope that they will recover in the second half of the year, but we will not take this for granted. We are braced for sustained volatility on the markets, to which we will react flexibly. Our goal is to gain market share in a shrinking market segment.</p>
          <p>As announced at our press conference on annual results, we are prepared for the whole automotive market to contract by 10 to 20%. The measures we have taken give us a stable position on the market, which is currently shrinking. Preparations for the future upward trend are in progress. Management is confident that the BMW Group will remain at the very top of the league when the upturn happens.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. We are now starting the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Horst Schneider from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Quickly, two questions. The first one relates to the development of trade payables. I realize that they have increased here relatively significantly versus year-end. So I would be interested, is that a structural change? Can that be maintained or is it just a temporary effect? And also how has that happened? So have you maybe here renegotiated the terms with your suppliers?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to the visibility in your order book, so maybe you can give us on the back of that visibility here some statement what you expect for the second quarter and if the decline of your car sales in the second quarter will be similar here to the run-rate of the first quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Horst. The questions will be answered by Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the trade payables increase is also determined by the situation of the year-end results made, which was characterized by production cuts. So less the material deliveries, due to temporary plant closures were the major effect. Now we are more or less in a balanced situation, and though we had this increase again, which is a normal situation for the time being. The question, the second part...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert Reithofer, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question was our outlook for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said during my short speech, we at BMW Group, we expect the entire industry global sales to drop by 10 to 20% in 2009. And we cannot &#x2013; we at the BMW Group, we cannot escape this trend.</p>
          <p>So at the moment it is really too early and difficult to forecast, let me say, for the second half of the year. We think we will be in better market conditions from 2010 on, and to give you an indicator of our April figures, we will end roughly with minus 23, minus 24%, in April. And what does it mean for our brands?</p>
          <p>MINI will be below 20% and BMW will be above 20%. That means you can see we introduced, for example, the new MINI Convertible. It is in the meantime an advantage for us, and you can see it in the March figures, if you look into the MINI figures and you can see it already in April.</p>
          <p>And we will introduce now the Z4 in May, and at the end of the year, the X1, for us a volume model, and the 5 Series GT, but as I said, between 2010 and 2012, we will have new models, and it will be 50% of our total volume. That means we will gear up between 2010 and 2012, and as I said, I think it will then be an advantage if we launch all our new models and economy will recover at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three questions if I may, first of all on working capital. Obviously you improved working capital, 1.3 billion in the first quarter. What is the full year number that we foresee on that level? Is this roughly the full year number we should expect, or do you think you can do more?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on your provision release that you showed in the automotive cash flow, out of the &#x20AC;560 million that we saw, how much of that was actually absorption of provisions and how much of that impacted the P&amp;L positively?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, more strategic, Mr. Reithofer, in your short speech this morning you mentioned that after the crisis, you expect the premium segment to reach its prior size.</p>
          <p>Looking at your capacity expansion plans in Spartanburg, is there any delay in the plans, and if not, should we read into this that you actually expect the premium market to show a very rapid acceleration and snap back once this crisis is over? Or is this more your expectation due to BMW's product cadence? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Jochen. We start with Norbert Reithofer, and then Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Gehrke, we don't expect a rapid better market for the premium products. We think, from a market point of view, that we will be in a better situation from 2010 on, and as I said, we will launch between 2010 and 2012 our volume products. That means all 1 Series products, all 3 Series products and all 5 Series products. And for us, a very important aspect for the time between 2010 and 2012, aside from the volume situation, is all these models will have a healthier situation from a manufacturing cost point of view, and will be much healthier from a capital expenditure point of view. That means we will have two steps.</p>
          <p>The first one will be, we will be in a better situation from a volume point of view, and the second, we will be in a better situation from a cost point of view. And you asked me of premium in the future. I said during the journalists' conference, I think the premium segment will definitely recover, but in my opinion, it will go up slowly. It will not be a rapid process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer, and then Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now your question about the working capital development, I have to tell a little bit about our philosophy to steer working capital, especially inventories, in line with the retail sales. So we adjust our production plan every month based on the latest retail forecast. So we are absolutely decided to keep the balance between production and retail. I mean, we will not build up any inventories. So this will always be in line. This is our philosophy over years, and we run through this year as well. So it depends now where the retail is going to. And one thing is for sure. With the introduction of the new models at the end of the year we have to fill pipeline, so we cannot expect at the end of the year further reduction in working capital because of this development.</p>
          <p>So that's the first one. The second point, the provision relief. We use provisions to make severance payments to our employees. This does not only apply to employees who left the company just in 2009, on the basis of 2008 termination agreements. Many employees that had already left in 2008 opted to defer payment of their packages. Those effects together are really the major influence on this position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Hi, thanks and good afternoon. I just have two questions if I may. The first is an accounting question. Now, I know you made it clear that you don't expect an immediate improvement in the residuals and the risk environment on your asset portfolio in the finance side, that you've been clear that you're still cautious about that, but when that does come one day, and you do start to get enough of an improvement in both the residuals and the risk that you can maybe be in a position where the 2 billion of provisions that you took last year looked too conservative, if you do reach that point, or if and when you reach that point, will you count the gains as one-off gains? Or would it run through your P&amp;L as if it were normal profit in the system? I just ask if the treatment will be the same when it's positive as it was last year when you were marking them off as negative. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the intra-company loan, which has decreased from 8.2 billion to 6.6 on the Auto business to the other entities into the finance co. Is that a cyclical movement? Is there some seasonality to it? Or is there genuinely a trend that you're trying to produce here where you are trying to reduce that to a lower level? So is it just a random movement? Is it seasonal? Or are you actually &#x2013; is this a trend or you're actually reducing it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Adam. This question will be answered by Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Now, our residual values, as I explained in my speech, so actually we see some relief in the U.S., a positive trend in the U.K. but unfortunately in other, especially European markets, we have the opposite development, so coming out of the scrapping allowances, there's big pressure on used car prices. So we see that is all in balance now. We don't have to accrue further provisions. So we now wait for further relief, and this will &#x2013; if this would really happen, we clearly would run those improvements through our P&amp;L. That is how we are prepared to handle this. And we will explain it to you, of course, when we see the positive exacts. So that is one thing.</p>
          <p>The other about the receivables. Well, it's &#x2013; I mean, it depends on our refinancing decisions. Actually, we tried &#x2013; we repaid back loans, right? And that was really done via the reduction of first inter-company loans, so we paid back some loans to the Automotive segment, and then some external loans, and that was done in the context of our refinancing strategy for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So sorry to add, so then we can expect similar movements, or are you done? Was this more of a one-off payment of the loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that is too early to say. Actually we have no plans to bring it further down. That's now the level we wanted to achieve, and there are no further plans now to have a further significant reduction in place in the context of our financing strategy.</p>

          <p>Thank you our next question is from Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. And I've a question on leasing. And I think your leasing penetration came down from 27.6% last year to 24.6% this year. Do you believe that this is a sustainable level, or do you expect leasing penetration to still come down for BMW? Then also on leasing, how can it really be that in the U.S. you're selling a 1 Series, roughly on the same leasing rate as a 5 Series, if I look at your offers on your balance sheet. So isn't it really still the case that you're selling, especially the more premium, the more you get a great leasing deal from BMW?</p>
          <p>And on your point regarding the recovery of the premium market really, I think we agree that there is demand for great cars. We always love to have one. But what's the price, really? So please talk about the leading penetration that you feel comfortable with. And could you also give us a clue of how much you expect your leading rates would have to come up in order to be in a more sustainable level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Mr. Ellinghorst, I mean, you can see it if you watch our figures very closely that we use the one or the other month for a test run. And, for example, in April we used the tool cost of retail. And we reduced our cost of retails, especially in some European markets. And then we look what happens. And if you see what happens, then you can see one thing at the moment. And I hope you agree that the markets are still not in a very good condition. If you reduce at the moment cost of retail under a certain level, you will feel it immediately on the volume side. So &#x2013; and at the end of 2008 I think we all know we had heavy over-production in the premium segment. I did not say BMW, I said in the premium segment. And all these models and all the over-production went into the market in the first three, four months of 2009. And it was not good for the incentive level of the premium car market.</p>
          <p>So, and in my opinion, we have to change that in the future, otherwise it will not be good for the premium segment. So do I believe that the premium segment will again have good growth rates? Yes, of course. But I think you know me in the meantime, a very realistic person, so in my opinion it will take time. It will not happen in the year 2009. And if then in the year 2010 and the process will be slowly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm sorry, just to follow up there, what's your pricing assumption on this growth really? Just on that topic. And then also as a follow-up on scrapping incentives in Germany. Isn't it really true that premium makers are benefiting from it? Because the scrapping incentives are also valid for young used cars. And what we're hearing is that quite a lot of young used cars are being sold off. Couldn't that be really major positive for your company that you could sell into your dealer showrooms much more easily because the pressure from used cars is diminishing? Thanks for the follow-up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Ellinghorst, you're absolutely right. And it's my straight answer. To give you a rough figure, we were able to sell about 15,000 BMW and MINI automobiles via the bonus, via the scrapping allowance. And we can say, and you see your question was absolutely right. These are often buyers who've never owned a BMW or MINI vehicle before. And so they represent real gains for us, rather than purchases that have just been brought forward. That is my answer to your question.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question is from Daniel Schwarz from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. My first question is on the positive 500 million impact on cost of personnel in 2009. You said the main part of impact comes in the second half. This means the positive impact from short-time work, that's not included in the 500 million. Is that right? And how much was the positive impact from short-time work? And the second question is, are you able, or will you be able to use the increased deposits at BMW Bank as a source of refinancing? And the third question is, the lower raw material prices, and you said you only started to benefit from that in Q1, plus the lower cost of personnel which is coming in the P&amp;L &#x2013; mainly in the second half. It seems to be very sure that second half at least should be much more profitable than the first half. Would you agree on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we understand. Thank you very much. Daniel, the answer will come from Fried Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now your question about the personnel costs relief we got out of our measures of 2008 in '09, clearly the 500 million, that is what we expect. And further benefits are of short-time work are not included in this figure. That's the first answer.</p>
          <p>Then the second, your question about raw material prices. We expect a relief coming from a lower raw material prices. It will be in order of magnitude of three-digit million number. So this is some tailwind that we will get in a course of the year. And I agree should have a positive effect on our profit.</p>
          <p>But the question, whether really I get the boost on a profit side in the second half, I think it's more related to the question where the sales are going to. We really can if the markets can really recover. Just to remind you, the premium segment actually in the first quarter is down 25%. So we have to recover from this low level. And then we see more chances to increase profit.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is that the high incentive level, that is now in the market, has to be reduced because of the over production we've seen in this market from few competitors therefore the high pressure in the first quarter. And this has to come down again. So it would be for me the real important elements that would be very supportive if they change in the second half. Will it come? Actually, we don't know. All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the question is, if volumes stay on the low levels that they are, and incentives stay on the high level where they are, the two intakes from material costs and from cost of personnel, this would come on top then in the second half and should automatically improve your profitability in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will help to compensate these negative effects, that's &#x2013; clearly it would help. What then the balance is, that is open, because actually we don't know where the spending, especially on the incentive side, how much we can really bring it down. So it is part of our strategy. We work in this direction, but this is always a question whether the other competitors &#x2013; the other market players are working in the same direction. If not, then we have to consider that this level of high spending will remain in the market, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas. Could you share with us the &#x2013; or give us magnitude of the price pressure you are experiencing in the German market? This is the first question. The second one relates to the release of some provisions already mentioned by one of my colleague. I'm not sure that I've correctly understood if there were &#x2013; there was or not any positive impact on the P&amp;L during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And the last question is about the CPOs in the U.S. If we look what happened during the first quarter, we could see a kind of hydraulics between CPOs and new car business. If I'm right, does that mean that we should need to see the CPOs getting down before seeing the new car business going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Thierry. Yes, Mr. Eichiner &#x2013; the answer will come from Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, in the first quarter the level of the sales support was more or less on a high level we experienced at the end of 2008. So what we've seen in December, where everybody tried to support sales, these levels did not come down in the first three months of this year. And it's clearly &#x2013; if you look at the past, it's historical very high &#x2013; historically a very high level that we have to say so, which usually you only see in run-out situations but not for the whole portfolio in place. And it's not what I would say something we would expect to be maintained in the future. Now the relief of provisions. As I explained, it has to do with the severance package and with the program that's been running in 2008. And clearly the majority of those provisions released are not in the P&amp;L. There's a smaller part in, but the actual figure is now not available. If you need more information on this, please contact our experts later on.</p>
          <p>And the CPO sales was the third question. Now, I mean, our strategy was and is in the U.S. to really stabilize receivable values, because this is very important for the attractiveness of our lease rates. And as you know, we had to take a big hit last year, and it was one &#x2013; clearly one of our strategies to stabilize this business. So that two things where important. First, to really market the used cars in a very professional way, and I think we've been very successful doing it. The CPO program is part of it. And so we cleaned up our stock situation without having to increase further receive value losses. So we could reduce the losses and clean up some stocks with the program. I think it was very successful. So this is the first direction.</p>
          <p>And then the second was, and a question was referred to this earlier, that we reduced our lease volume, especially in the U.S., to a lower level. So we did it also in order to get some relief on used car markets later on when the maturities are coming back. So that we have not so much volume pressure coming out of the leasing business and which would enable us to stabilize our used car prices. Those strategies now seem to work out because we see some positive results now. If you look at the Manheim Index, you can see that we could increase our used car prices by 14%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much Mr. Eichiner. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Punzet from DZ Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Michael Punzet, good afternoon. I have two questions. First on your financial service business. In Q1, you posted a margin of only 1.75% after adjusted margin of 5.2%. Maybe you can explain to us the main reasons for the sharp dropping in margins? And the second question is on your interest result in the automobile division. Because when I look to your presentation, you show nearly stable cash figures, okay, a slight decrease in financial liabilities. But the interest result dropped by 140 million. And maybe you can explain also on that issue and could answer the question if this could be the run rate for the full year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Michael. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, coming back to the question about the financial results. Clearly, you have to consider that we always have a negative inference coming out from these spends from reversing the discounting offer, pension obligations and expense from reversing, of discounting of long-term provisions. But this is always something that brings us to a negative net interest result, and it was the case this time as well. So we had to consider this, and I think it was the same in the last year and the year before. So there's nothing extraordinary. Then we look at the earnings of the financing conditions, so we see deterioration in financing conditions due to large credit spreads caused by the confidence crisis on international credit markets. And this clearly has an influence on the margins we have in the financial services business for the time being. So now as we see some relief on the credit spreads, we hope that this is something we can improve in the future. But basically we don't know. The next bank is going down and pop up again when we are back in the same mess, right? But that's part of the crisis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think we have time for two more questions. Please next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Alexis Albert from Natixis. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Alexis Albert, Natixis. I have three questions, if I may. The first one is regarding the scrapping incentive in Germany &#x2013; not in Germany, in the U.S. But you said the scrapping incentive in Germany is hurting residual values. So I would like to have your opinion on the scrapping incentive that might arrive in the U.S. I'd like to know if that can have an impact on the residual value in the U.S. This is my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the savings you expect to get, the &#x20AC;500 million you expect to get in 2009. I'd like to know if you can get &#x2013; if you can be more precise about what you achieved during the Q1. And the last question is regarding the currency effect. What currency effect did you experience over the Q1 and what did you see for the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think the right questions for our CFO, Mr. Eichiner, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, scrapping incentives. Clearly, there's only the lower segment of the market is really benefiting from the scrapping incentives. And as those scrapping incentives are combined with sales incentives that are really nearly every manufacturer and competitor in this market segment is bringing forward, this is one of the reasons why there's such a pressure on those used cars, who are not benefiting from this program.</p>
          <p>And that is the reason why we'll see the pressure on used cars, especially on premium used cars in this market. Basically, and I would expect the same development in other markets, if the program is similar. It depends on the program. And actually, the determined broker has really focused on small cars, small segment, very old, right? And this is not so much relevant for the premium market, because usually our customers, they are not owner of a small, old car, ten years old. So that's why we are not so much benefiting from this development more the importers with really cheap cars. They are the ones who benefit most.</p>
          <p>Then your question about the benefits from our last year's program, the severance packages we offered. Clearly, the major part of this program will come in the second part because we have some deferred payments and we still have 300 people only leaving now in the first quarter. So the full benefit will come in the second, third, fourth quarter, that we see in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And the &#x2013; on the currency side, clearly we don't have the headwinds. We don't expect the headwinds we've seen in 2008, because we &#x2013; in the big currencies, so U.S. dollar, yen and in the British pound we're fully hedged. But there is some risk in smaller markets and currencies where hedging is not so much possible. So the Russian currency, even the Chinese are in this category. And so we are expecting in the smaller currencies some headwind, right? But after all the balance, the thing will at least be a low three digit million number, that is what we are expecting from the currency. So I think that was the question, right?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jose Asumendi from Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions, please. The first one, I was wondering if you could please quantify or if you could share with us a figure on the efficiency enhancement you have recorded in Q1? And if you could also share with us a figure for the savings you're going to be getting from the short time week that is going to be coming especially on the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And the last point will be on refinancing needs. If you could please walk us through your assumptions for the refinancing in relation to maturities within one year for categories like banks, commercial paper and ABS? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Jose. The answer will come from Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. So, I mean, the efficient &#x2013; the efficiency gains we made out of our programs last year you can see if you look at the developments in different cost categories. So cost for sales, administrative cost, even cost for R&amp;D are reduced heavily by 14% in average. So this is something you can really see in each cost category, that it's now going down with a two digit number. And as I explained already, in the second, third and fourth quarter we will get more headwind out of the head count reduction from last year. Another 500 million that we expect for the total year to be improved coming out of this program that we had in the last year.</p>
          <p>Now short time work. It clearly has a certain influence, it is as far as I'm informed actually, it is a two digit million number that we can expect from this. So it's not such a big improvement by the tops and is in this order of magnitude.</p>
          <p>Now when it comes to refinancing needs, we see now excluding these deposits, bank loans and commercial papers, only so we have ten billion, which will mature within the next 12 months, right? So that is what we expect, and what we have to refinance then. And since the start of 2009, we have raised approximately 5.3 billion in funds from bonds and private placements, of which &#x20AC;3.25 billion have been public bonds and the remainder in private placement. And that's already covered approximately 80% of our maturities from the bonds and private placements for the year 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. I think we have time for one more question please, last question?</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on Financial Services. I guess if you could talk about the risk provisions. You took a higher level of risk provisions, I guess relating to credit loss in this quarter. How do you feel about the level of provisioning that you've taken on credit losses, both on the dealer side as well as on customers? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And I guess my second question is, how do you think about financial services equity to assets? I mean historically, this is a number that for BMW has ranged between nine to 10%. It's now I guess a little over five. And I know you've changed your presentation a little bit. But if you can help clarify how you think about the adequate equity ratio for the financial services business, that would be great, thanks.</p>

          <p>First, the risk provision for let me see, as I explained already, we see increasing level of credit losses, especially in the U.S. market. This was not unexpected. So in our budgets we planned for this. We think from today's perspective that we have the right approach to this, but we don't know if this will level out or where it will end. That's very clear. It's because it would mean I would know how this crisis would work out in 2009. And we have to look at this step by step. But as I said, we have planned for this, because we have seen it coming. And we think that we, especially for the next quarter we should be fine. But that is actually our thinking.</p>
          <p>Now on the equity ratio, one of the issues is that in the other segment, there are financing companies, group financing companies that have a higher equity ratio, right? Those companies really have approximately &#x20AC;1 billion equity. They are related to the financial services business clearly because their job is to manage the funds, the funding for this business. And if you would allocate those companies or the equity into this segment then we would be just around 7% equity ratio. I think that's how we have to see it. And this is a ratio from our viewpoint that is really in balance with the risk we take.</p>
