          <p>Good day and welcome to Kraft Foods' Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Kraft management and the question-and-answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations for Kraft.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us on our conference call.  I'm Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations.  With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Tim McLevish, our Chief Financial Officer.  Our earnings release was sent out earlier today and is available on our website, kraft.com.  Also available on our website are slides that we will refer to during our opening comments.</p>
          <p>As you know, during this call we may make forward-looking statements about the company's performance.  These statements are based on how we see things today, so they contain an element of uncertainty.  Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.  So please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Some of today's prepared comments will exclude those items that affect comparability.  These excluded items are captured in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release.  They are also available on our website.</p>
          <p>We'll begin the call today with Irene providing her perspective on our second quarter and our outlook for 2008.  Then Tim will highlight our financials and review the results for each of our business segments, and after that we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand it off to Irene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris.  Good morning, everyone.  As most of you have already seen, we just reported strong second quarter revenue and earnings growth.  There are a few puts and takes in the numbers that Tim will review in a minute.  But even excluding those factors, we delivered very strong financial performance.  More importantly we're demonstrating that despite very challenging economic conditions, we can and we will cover input cost inflation while building our brand equities and delivering improved financial results.</p>
          <p>In terms with input costs, our new decentralized structure is effectively dealing with an environment of escalating costs while protecting investments for long-term growth.  This is coming through in two ways.  First, our business leaders are reacting faster to changes in the marketplace.  This means quickly taking the lead on cost-driven price increases.  And as we enter Q3 we've had to take additional pricing to offset continued increases in input costs, especially grain and dairy.  It also means taking decisive actions like cutting inefficient trade spending or giving up unprofitable volume.  Although some of these actions may result in near-term share loss, they are the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business.</p>
          <p>Second, our decentralized structure is also delivering cost savings.  Our managers are generating significant manufacturing productivity, and they're hitting their targets for restructuring savings and cash flow.  They fully understand that these savings are the key to their ability to continue to make the necessary investments in building their brands while delivering profitable growth.</p>
          <p>More specifically, in terms of building our brand equities, our investments in product quality, marketing, and innovation continue to pay off.  We're seeing it in several categories including these:  salad dressing, where despite a slow start in April, our reinvention of this business has led to share gains in each of the last two months; mainstream coffee, where our restaging of Maxwell House drove over 1 point of share gain this quarter; Cakesters, which is on its way to $100 million in revenue this year, driven by the recent launch of Nilla Cakesters; European chocolate, where new products and significantly higher marketing spending behind Milka and Toblerone drove another quarter up double-digit growth; and in developing markets, where Jacobs Coffee is the number one coffee in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>In this difficult economic environment, our reframing efforts across the portfolio have further demonstrated the value proposition of our brands.  For instance, Mac &amp; Cheese, our icon of value-oriented meal solutions, grew nearly 20% in the quarter, and it delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of market share gains, fueled by our investments in quality and innovation.  Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh Cold Cuts remain on fire.  Positioned against more expenses deli counter meats, they just delivered their 21st consecutive quarter of share and volume growth.  Consumers are also finding that our Oscar Mayer Deli Creation sandwiches represent a significant value compared with takeout sandwiches.  They're highly incremental to our base cold cuts business and are on their way to reaching the $100 million mark.</p>
          <p>In pizza, where we've framed against pizzeria offerings, we're growing volume in the mid single digits and our share is up over a point.  We've also reframed our marketing of Jell-O dry packaged desserts and Kool-Aid and Country Time powdered soft drinks.  We've done this by emphasizing their value-oriented positions versus higher cost per serving alternatives.  As a result, we're seeing renewed growth in these high margin businesses.</p>
          <p>Having said that, during the quarter our market shares were under pressure for two reasons.  First, as I mentioned, we took out inefficient trade spending to improve the return on our trade investments.  We expected this to have a short-term share impact, particularly in ready-to-drink beverages and snacks.  And second, while we've acted decisively with cost-driven pricing actions, a number of competitors lagged us.  As a result, we saw some temporary dislocation that affected both our 13-week and our 52-week market shares.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we'll continue to invest in our brand equities and in the value positioning of key brands.  We'll benefit further from product news in core categories like crackers, pourable salad dressings, single-serve pizza, and cheese.  And as a result, we expect to see our market shares rebound in the back half of the year, which brings me to our financial results.</p>
          <p>Our business continues to strengthen and performance is exceeding our expectations.  In fact organic revenue and operating income grew in all segments for the first time in many years.  On the revenue front, our Q2 volume held up well, even in the face of our unprecedented pricing actions.  As a result of our underlying momentum and the expectation of additional pricing, we've raised our guidance for 2008 organic revenue growth to at least 6% from at least 5%.  Below the revenue line, during the second quarter we booked some gains from hedging activities.  However, even excluding these gains, we're exceeding our expectations, while continuing to invest for future growth.  For the full year we expect our operating momentum to continue, and so we've raised our EPS guidance to at least $1.92 from at least $1.90.</p>
          <p>In sum, our second quarter results were strong, in fact even stronger than we expected, and a significant indication that our business continues to gain momentum.  Our results, despite very challenging economic conditions, show that we can and we are covering input cost inflation while building our brand equities and delivering improved financial results.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Irene, and good morning.  Please keep in mind that unless otherwise noted, my comments will exclude the items affecting comparability that were highlighted in our press release.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at Q2 results, starting with revenues.  Our Q2 net revenues increased almost 7% on an organic basis.  As expected, net pricing was the key contributor, as we increased prices to cover higher input costs.  It was up 7.2 percentage points versus about 4 points in Q1 and less than 2 points in all of 2007.  Despite significant pricing, we're encouraged by our overall volume and mix performance.  It held up better than expected, reflecting the benefits of our investments in quality, marketing and innovation.  However, as anticipated, our second quarter volume comparisons were down in some categories.  This is especially true in ready-to-drink beverages, cheese, and our spoonable dressings and enhancers businesses.  In all of them we took significant cost-driven price increases.</p>
          <p>Near-term, pricing will remain the primary driver of revenue growth, as input costs continue to escalate and volume comparisons will remain difficult.  However, we'll continue to invest behind a strong pipeline of innovations.  We expect them to drive solid volume and mix performance in the second half of the year and to set the stage for 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to margin performance, our gross margins was up 40 basis points versus Q2 last year.  However, this included approximately $150 million of realized and unrealized gains from hedging activities related to requirements for future quarters.  Excluding these gains, gross margins would have been approximately 35%.  We have called out these gains because we see them as a timing issue, effectively pulling cost protection benefit we would have had in the second half into the second quarter.  Early recognition of these gains will result in higher reported cost of goods sold in the second half of the year.  While this means our gross margins would have been down 80 basis points year-over-year, it was up 130 basis points over Q1, as the effect of improved price realization began to come through.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on input costs and the magnitude of increases we're facing in 2008.  This chart shows prices by year versus the 10-year average for each of our 11 key commodity inputs.  Compared to numbers as recently as April, you can see that the prices of many commodities have increased.  To put this in context for Kraft, in Q2 our input costs were up about $400 million over last year, and through the first six months, our input costs were up about $800 million.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we now expect them to be up about $2 billion or about 13% over 2007.  That's higher than we anticipated in January or even in April.  That means that more than half of the increase will come in the back half of this year.  Because of these significant cost pressures, we've taken additional pricing actions in Q3.  While we're pricing to cover costs and grow profits in dollar terms, it's proving difficult in this environment to grow margin percentages.  However, this pricing, together with the further productivity savings and overhead leverage, will still deliver our expected earnings dollars.  Despite the challenging cost environment, we'll continue to invest in our growth and we'll deliver ahead of our previous expectations.  We've raised our guidance accordingly.</p>
          <p>Turning to Q2 earnings per share, the strong contribution from operations just discussed was partially offset by a few factors below the line.  Higher interest expense was a $0.07 headwind versus the prior year, and we currently expect interest expense for the year to be roughly $1.3 billion.  In addition, a higher year-over-year tax rate was a $0.03 headwind.  Our effective tax rate excluding items was 36.1% in the second quarter.  This was higher than our full year forecast due to the timing of several discrete items.  However, we continue to expect an average rate of 33.5% for all of 2008, with some variation quarter-to-quarter depending upon when the anticipated discrete items fall.</p>
          <p>Finally, the interest and tax headwinds were partially offset by $0.03 from lower shares outstanding.   And I'd note here that between our usual blackout for earnings and a blackout related to the Post transaction, we are prevented from repurchasing any shares during the quarter.  However, we still expect to complete our share repurchase authorization before it expires in March 2009.</p>
          <p>I'll take a few minutes now to share some highlights of our business segment results.  I'll start with US Beverages, where organic revenues grew 3.4%.  Ready-to-drink beverages, powdered beverages and coffee all contributed to growth in the quarter.  In ready-to-drink a big factor was our successful effort to reduce inefficient trade spending on Capri Sun.  In Q2 revenue was up in the mid-single digit range and profitability improved significantly.  At the same time volume was down.  As we discussed last quarter, the heavy nature of ready-to-drink beverages weighed on the volume performance of our entire US Beverage business.  This quarter it was a 9 percentage point drag on volume.  Excluding ready-to-drink, our beverage segment volume was up 4.6%.</p>
          <p>In coffee, our investments to restage the business are paying off.  We posted double-digit growth in both Maxwell House and Tassimo.  Maxwell House drove a market share gain in the mainstream segment for the second quarter in a row, and our new Starbucks branded T DISCs produced revenue growths of more than 30% in our premium on-demand Tassimo platform.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, powered beverages also delivered solid growth.  This was driven by double-digit volume gains in Kool-Aid and Country Time, as we've improved our marketing and as consumers seek lower-cost alternatives to soft drinks.</p>
          <p>At the profit line, Beverages' operating income grew 6% and margin increased 100 basis points.  Here the benefits from cost-driven price increases, especially in ready-to-drink beverages, more than offset higher input costs.</p>
          <p>In US Cheese, organic net revenues were up 10%.  This was due entirely to price increases in response to higher dairy costs.  Compared to a year ago, these prices are up 6% to 33% across our cheese categories, with the largest in natural cheese.  Overall, vol-mix in cheese was down about 5% versus the prior year.  Innovation such as Bagel-fuls, Singles Select and LiveActive continued to deliver solid benefits in both volume and mix.  However, this was offset by volume weakness, particularly in natural cheese and cultured products, as consumers continue to adjust to higher absolute price points.</p>
          <p>We also chose not to chase unprofitable volume, as private label ran some deep discounts during the quarter.  During Q2 we announced further pricing actions covering 90% of the portfolio.  We expect this pricing to pressure volume comparisons in the near term, however, as we continue to invest in innovation, we'll see further growth from Bagel-fuls, which is running well ahead of trial and repeat expectations, and we'll complete the launch of our 2% milk rBST-free cheese products in the second half of the year.  And so going forward we expect solid revenue growth to continue.</p>
          <p>Turning to operating income, it was up 7.3% versus Q2 2007.  Pricing and lower overhead expenses more than offset the impact of higher input costs and lower volume.  And consistent with our guidance, our cheese margin was up again sequentially from the prior quarter &#x2013; 13.6% versus 12.9% in Q1.  As the gains from innovation and price realization continue, we expect further sequential improvement in operating margins.</p>
          <p>Moving on to US Convenient Meals, our team delivered another quarter of strong performance.  Our investments in quality, base marketing and new products drove 7.6% organic revenue growth, with 5.1 points due to volume and mix gains.</p>
          <p>In Oscar Mayer, the strength of our Deli Fresh Cold Cuts platform continued, with strong double-digit revenue growth and about 2 points of share gain in the overall cold cuts category.  Our Deli Creation sandwiches also grew strongly in Q2, driven by the new Flatbreads line.  This is proving to be highly incremental to our base business.</p>
          <p>Finally, strong volume growth in pizza continued, not only from our base DiGiorno and California Pizza Kitchen offerings, but also from the rollout of our new line of single-serve offerings under the For One banner.  This drove more than a point of market share gain in frozen pizza during the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the operating income line, we grew roughly 3% versus the prior year.  Here, our strong growth was partly offset by two factors, the launch costs of our Pizza For One initiative and price increases lagging higher costs, particularly cheese.  As we move forward, we expect our year-over-year profit performance to improve as well.</p>
          <p>On to US Grocery where organic net revenues were up 4.5% and operating income grew 30 basis points.  Here, our investments to contemporize the portfolio are paying off.  Two of our early investments, Jell-O and Mac &amp; Cheese, again delivered a combination of pricing, market share gains, and higher operating income margins in the quarter.  Both categories are benefiting from the current economic environment, as consumer search for value-oriented meal solutions.  Our pourable salad dressing investment is contributing to the improvement as well.  The launch of our new line of Kraft pure salad dressings led to strong volume growth in the quarter.  This came despite considerable cost-driven price increases.  These gains were partially offset by declines in other parts of the business, including enhancers like barbecue sauce and spoonable dressings, as pricing actions led to volume declines.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we're making to grow our high margin Grocery portfolio.  In the third quarter, we expect to gain even more traction from our investments, which will lead to continued growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>Looking at US Snacks &amp; Cereals, organic net revenues were up 5.1% in Q2.  That was entirely due to pricing.  At the category level, solid gains in biscuits and pricing in nuts were partially offset by a decline in snacks bars.  In biscuits, 100 Calorie Pack cookies and crackers were up a double-digit rate again, as the momentum from that platform continues.  The addition of Nilla Cakesters and the ongoing growth of Oreo Cakesters pushed the Cakesters platform further towards the $100 million mark.  Investments in product quality and marketing led to strong growth in three of our five largest brands &#x2013; Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Ritz.</p>
          <p>However, our overall performance in crackers was weak in the quarter, for two reasons, both related to timing.  One was the fact that our key cracker competitors lagged our price increases, resulting in larger than normal price gaps during the quarter.  Second, the product news and marketing programs for two of our cracker brands, Triscuit and Wheat Thins, are more back half weighted.  Going forward, we expect our cracker performance to improve and lead to even better biscuit performance in the second half.</p>
          <p>Turning to snack bars, our business was down significantly in the quarter.  This was mainly due to the timing of new product announcements as well as our rationalizing SKUs.  However, the trend should improve in the second half as we invest in quality upgrades and marketing.</p>
          <p>At the operating income line, strong growth and margin gains were offset by a $50 million realized gain from hedging activity.  Excluding this factor, operating income was down approximately 8%.  Price increases and cost &#x2013; and cutting inefficient trade spending were offset by three things, higher input costs, unfavorable product mix from lower cracker volume and higher marketing and overhead costs.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the realized gain in this quarter will essentially be given back in the form of higher input costs flowing through our P&amp;L in Q3 and Q4.  Nonetheless, we will continue to invest in innovation and base brand support, and we expect our snacks business to deliver mid single-digit profit growth for the full year.</p>
          <p>Finally, it's noteworthy that our cereal business grew in the quarter despite difficult comparisons with the re-launch of our kids' cereal business in Q2 last year and significant pricing this year.  Top line growth in the quarter was driven by both pricing and ongoing growth of the flagship Honey Bunches of Oats adult cereal business.  We remain on track to complete the transaction to exit our Post cereal business in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada &amp; North America Foodservice, organic net revenue growth was up 4.4% versus last year.  We had another solid quarter in Canada.  It was driven by strong volume and share growth from increased investments in marketing and innovation across all categories.  And the implementation of improved customer plans as we leveraged our scale with the reestablishment of Canada as a standalone business.</p>
          <p>In North America Foodservice, growth came from a combination of pricing and to a lesser extent volume.  The effects of lower consumer restaurant traffic were offset by strong response to our quality improvements and innovation.</p>
          <p>At the operating income line, margin was up 290 basis points, top line growth, manufacturing efficiencies, and overhead cost leverage more than offset higher input costs.  Going forward, both Canada and Foodservice will benefit from announced price increases to cover significant commodity cost increases.  Volumes may soften in the near-term, but given the base business gains from marketing and innovation, we expect solid year-over-year margin improvement to continue in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to our International business, where we continued to show good organic growth by focusing our investments on our core brands, core categories, and in key markets.  In the EU, this resulted in 3.4% organic revenue growth.  We delivered double-digit growth in chocolates from the ongoing success of our investments behind core brands Milka, Toblerone, and C&#xF4;te d'Or.  Cheese also grew at double-digit rates from both pricing and improved marketing behind Philadelphia.  In coffee, revenue declined slightly.  This was due to pricing-related volume weakness in our roast and ground business, and it offset the growth we're realizing from investments to trade consumers up to our on-demand and soluble coffee offerings.</p>
          <p>At the profit line, in line with our forecast, EU operating margins declined slightly versus last year, but they improved sequentially from Q1.  Versus prior year, pricing and favorable product mix were offset by higher input costs.  Going forward, as our price realization and product mix further improve and the benefits of integrating the LU biscuit business come to fruition, we expect our EU margins to show year-over-year improvement.</p>
          <p>In Developing Markets, we had organic growth of 17%.  It was driven by solid volume and mix gains, despite more than 12 points of pricing.  We're continuing to see payoff from our focus on and investments in core categories, core brands and in key markets.  Here's what drove Q2 growth.  Jacobs coffee in Ukraine and Milka and Alpen Gold chocolates in Russia, further gains from Club Social and Oreo biscuits in Latin America and consumption and distribution gains in our Asia Pacific region, particularly Oreo in China.</p>
          <p>At the operating income line, margin was up 170 basis points.  This resulted from a combination of top line growth and the acquisition of the LU biscuit business and it more than offset input costs and investments in marketing and distribution infrastructure.  Looking forward, while input costs continue to be a challenge, as consumers adjust to higher prices, our profit margins in the second half should remain stable year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Finally, before we take your questions, a few notes on cash flow.  Capital expenditures through six months were $590 million.  That's up from 506 million through six months last year, but on pace to spend just over 3% of net revenue for the year.  I'd also note that we continue to make solid progress on our working capital program, despite the rise in input costs.  And our cash convergence cycle was reduced by two days versus the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, we've had a strong first half and we remain confident that our strengthening brand equity, our investments and cost reductions will maintain our operating momentum, increase margins over time and deliver a raised guidance of at least $1.92 per share, ex items in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to hear a little bit about I guess two things, one in several categories you mentioned that the competitors have lagged on pricing, is that something you're worried about on a go-forward basis, or have those competitors already put those price increases through now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we're starting to see those gaps narrow, and in fact if you look at our market shares, we're starting to see even through the data in June &#x2013; the last five weeks, our shares are improving sequentially relative to the April-May period.  So, I think everybody is dealing with the same input cost situation, and we are gradually seeing the entire market respond to that situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But since you had to implement another round of price increases in the third quarter, are we set up for another quarter of lagging price increases and are we going to see the same dynamic in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually I think as you look across the landscape, everybody is dealing with the same input costs, and I think they're all coming to understand that this isn't going away anytime soon.  And so the actions that we're seeing in the marketplace, as I said, is that most of our price gaps are narrowing, and I think a number of other companies are looking out to Q3 the same way that we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So in other words there will be a little more of a catch-up from the competitor perspective in Q3 relative to the actions you're going to take.  Is that a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe so, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then from a volume perspective, volume was only down 1% in the quarter, despite all the pricing.  How do you see volume trending for the rest of the year, especially because you're going to take another set of price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have to tell you, Q2 held up better than we had expected, and we feel quite good about that.  I think the investments that we've made in our brands is certainly paying off, and the fact that we have a number of brands in the portfolio that play well in the current environment from a value perspective.  As we go forward, though, we are heading into some uncharted territory as additional pricing actions hit the marketplace, and so we have to see how it will play out.  But I think we are well staged to be able to weather the storm.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then quickly on market share, you've traditionally said that your goal is to grow share, I believe, in greater than 60% of categories.  It sounds like you fell below that goal in the quarter, and I don't know if you're backing away from that in the near-term just because of the pricing dynamics?  Any comments related to market share goals would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're clearly disappointed by our share performance this quarter, but we're certainly not surprised, given the significant pricing out in the marketplace and the fact that, as we've said, a number of our key competitors lagged our actions, as well as there was a couple of cases of some deep retailer discounting that we chose not to chase.  As I said, the good news is that these price gaps are starting to narrow.  We're seeing sequential improvement in our shares, and I expect that we will gain or hold share and the majority of our revenue in the back half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick ones.  In terms of the dimension of the hedging offset in the back half, Tim, can we assume that's roughly kind of equal to what it was in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we experienced about $150 million in total of recognition of mark-to-market hedge gains in the second quarter that essentially will be offsetting in the back half of the year, spread between third and fourth quarter, a little bit more heavily in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Terry, I think I'd just add to that, as Tim was talking about in his opening comments, our costs are expected to be up about 2 billion.  From a P&amp;L perspective, you had about 800 million flow through in the first half, so the second half's going to be a little bit heavier.</p>

          <p>Okay, got it.  And one last one, on the salad dressings, I think the performance there surprised us a little bit according to the data we were looking at.  Irene, could you give us a little more color there, do you think there was a pipeline fill element to that, or if you could add a little color as to the market dynamics on that one?</p>

          <p>Just on your outlook for commodity costs for the second half, you'd obviously mentioned that you're expecting costs to go up, but there is a number of areas, specifically dairy and pork, that look like at this point they're going to be a little beneficial to you in the second half, given what's happening right now.  Is that playing into your increased guidance at all, and maybe you can talk, given the magnitude of those two specific areas to your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well -- first I would say, Christine, we're very confident in our ability, with the strengthening of our brands, to match cost increases through pricing and productivity, and we're committed to that.  Overall, we're seeing considerable commodity cost increases.  There are a couple of offsets.  I'm not sure what's going to happen in dairy.  Pork seems to see a little bit of a come-off, but it looks like it's tipping back up again.  Our expectations are, I mean, you can see from the future markets what is expected.  We are hedged across a good deal of our portfolio for the second half of the year.  So we're just going to deal with the cost situation through pricing and productivity as we go forward through the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>As costs decline, do you get any, I guess, cost, or pricing, do you adjust your pricing &#x2013; I mean you've done that in coffee now as costs came down.  Is that something you'd look at in cheese or in cold cuts?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions here, advertising spending or brand support, how did that trend this quarter?  I don't know how the comps were year-on-year.  Could you give us any clarity into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our spending was up in the quarter, and it will be on the year.  As we've said, I feel very good about our ability to continue to make the necessary investments in the brand, even in the face of a challenging cost environment.  So, you will see our spending up both &#x2013; you did see it in the quarter and you'll see it up for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spending in dollar terms clearly is up as we continue to invest in our brands.  On a percentage basis, with the very high increase in pricing and therefore revenue, you'll see that the percentage is not up quite as much as we had expected, but up nonetheless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.  And then on the European Union, seems to me that the Danone cookies business, the LU business, was a 16% margin business I think last year.  Obviously Europe was in the single digits on a recurring basis last year.  You're expecting a couple of $100 million in cost synergies, and yet we're still seeing the margins drift away for the six months after that acquisition was completed.  Can you talk about sort of how the integration process is proceeding and how you expect the margins to develop in the EU going forward, as you start to realize those cost synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alexia, I can tell you, the LU business has turned out to be everything we thought it would be, and in fact more.  The business is growing strongly.  If we look at the like-for-like growth, we see it up 6% in the EU and up about 27% in developing markets.  So we are on track to deliver all the savings than we forecast.  I -- even more confident today that it will be a significant platform for our future growth and in fact for the profitability of our international business in general and for the EU in particular, and we certainly continue to expect it to be accretive in 2008.  Some of those margin impacts are related to the significant pricing that's going on, on a number of those businesses in response to input costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I look at the contribution on the top line from mix, up 0.7%, I know that it's been staying that 2, 3, or even 4% range over the last sort of two years or so.  I'm curious if there's anything that happened versus, on mix, just specifically in the quarter or is that something that we're likely to see at a somewhat slower pace that we have as obviously the pricing piece really ramps up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what you're seeing is just the temporary dislocation driven by the pricing impact, and we expect that mix going forward will continue to play an important role.  But as Tim said, for the balance of this year, the major factor driving our revenue will in fact be pricing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, okay.  And then, is there anyway to think about what overall corporate volume was ex the 9% decline in ready-to-drink, because I know the weight of that product kind of impacts the overall volume number pretty dramatically?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just a last thing on take away, is there anyway to gauge, we only have what we have in terms of data, IRI, Nielsen, etcetera, which I know is limited in lot of ways, but obviously looking at the big difference between what we've seen let's say over the past quarter in terms of volume for Kraft versus the volume that you posted, is that merely just what we're seeing in terms of trade-down, in terms of channel shift and such, or just any comments you have on helping reconcile that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to say what exactly is going on.  You're seeing lots of dynamics in the marketplace with lots of pricing, and that has had some volume impact, there maybe in some new categories where we're introducing and building a little bit of the pipeline.  But again, we're encouraged as we go into the third quarter that we're feeling strong about our brands.  We'll continue to realize the pricing and think we can pass that through.</p>

          <p>One quick one, and then I'll ask a little bit bigger question.  Just a housekeeping, you have $150 million of hedging, 78 out of corporate, 50 out of the snacks, where'd the other 22 come out of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other 22 is really spread across the rest of the segments.  The 50 that you identified is specifically in snacks, and we called that out because of the significant magnitude of it.  The rest of it is spread, and that's probably about proportional to what we usually see in any given quarter.  The reason we called it out this quarter is because of the magnitude of it, but any given quarter, we always have some realized gains in the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my other question is in terms of private label, can you talk about your trends relative to private label and how you are positioning yourself for the future relative to private label, given the potential trade-down in some of your more important categories &#x2013; that would be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Ken, I think there's no question that we're seeing our investments paying off.  We are experiencing some temporary dislocation in a couple of categories due to the significant pricing actions that we've taken in response to costs.  And as we've said, private label lagged in a couple of these categories, and in some cases we actually saw them doing some deep discounting in the face of these &#x2013; the high cost environment.  In fact I think you're seeing some retailers reporting lower margins due to some of their pricing activities.</p>
          <p>In addition, in a couple of our categories, we've chosen not to chase unprofitable volume in the short-term.  So, it's a number of factors that are contributing, I feel very good though about our ability to continue to grow share in the current environment.  And as I said earlier, the good news is that our price gaps are starting to narrow, and we are seeing sequential improvement in the five-week shares through June, and we do expect to gain or hold share in a majority of all the categories in the back half of the year.</p>

          <p>I wanted to follow up on Andrew's question about mix a little bit, when you dig into this -- and by the way, thank you for this mix disclosure.  I think this is excellent.  When you look at the different segments, yeah, despite -- whether you took really substantial pricing or not in these different segments, you did see a deceleration in that.  And I guess I wonder if it's possible, but is there any impact in there away from just sticker shock that consumers are maybe looking for less expensive ways to buy Kraft Foods within these categories?  Could that be sort of going on across the grocery store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, it's hard to say.  As Tim said, I do think that some of what we're seeing is just the mathematical impact of what's happening on the volume front, and therefore mix becomes less of a factor in a number of our core categories.  I remain very comfortable that the investments that we have made in quality and marketing and innovation in each of our core categories will continue to buoy our brands and enable us to maintain our strong shares in our core categories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess as -- when you think about volumes being flat, I mean is there -- I mean it would seem to me that -- that the data I've seen take-home food volumes are up a little bit ahead of population for the second quarter, up 2, 3%.  I mean do you think with your current category spread, if you weren't taking price in this quarter, should you be at a volume growth that's in line with that 2 or 3%?</p>

          <p>Oh, without a doubt.  I mean there's no question that we have seen tremendous strength in our base businesses as a result of the investments that we've made, and, but most important, I think the results are showing that despite the challenging economic conditions, we're able to cover input costs while still building our brands and staging them for the future.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple questions.  The first one, I want to come back to the volume question, so our Nielsen data had unit volumes down something on the magnitude of 6%.  You reported down 1 for the full company.  Irene, can you give us a little bit more color on the channel split?  How are these non-measured channels performing, I mean are the numbers at double-digit, is there, what color can you give us here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're fabulous.  We're having a &#x2013; there's no question that some of the volume difference that you're seeing is due to the channel shifts, but we're having a tremendous quarter and year with Wal-Mart, and we believe that the outlook there continues to be strong, as our brands and our value positioning is exceptionally well aligned with where they're going for their shoppers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Staying with the volumes, is there any delay effect here on how the pricing affects volumes as you report them?  Meaning does the &#x2013; do volumes in the quarter reflect the largest impact from higher pricing, or would we really see that next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to say.  As we've said, we're taking additional price, and certainly the pricing that we took so far through Q2, most of that is reflected in the numbers that you see, but Q3 will continue to be a challenge, we make no bones about that, and there's a number of factors at work.  We start with the fact that we are taking some additional pricing in response to continued escalation in costs, and in some of our categories, we're in some uncharted territory.  At the same time, we'll also see the reversal of our commodity hedging gains in the third quarter.  But I continue to be encouraged by the volume performance to date, and as I look at the programming and the innovation pipeline that we've got in the back half of the year, I'm quite confident that we will be able to weather the storm, and as we've said, we expect to gain or hold share in the majority of our revenue in the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a final question.  Can you, Tim, can you just run us through your eight division lines and tell us what those price increases were by division?  It doesn't have to be exact here, but I want to get a sense of magnitude.  I think you said in the prepared comments that 90% of the portfolio had announced price increases in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We announced price increases over much of our portfolio in the last quarter and last several months.  Much of it is already in the marketplace.  Some of it is announced, but it's not effective yet at retail.  I can't go through the specifics of each of the businesses and the categories.  Perhaps we can take it offline and Chris will share some of that with you if you're interested.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks like through the first half your organic top line growth was up about 7.5%, and for the full year you're guiding to at least 6% &#x2013; realize 7.5 is greater than 6.  But it would seem that you're looking for some slowdown in organic revenue growth in the second half.  Just wondering how much of that is related to the tougher comps as you started to take, as pricing started to accelerate in the second half of last year, versus this additional pricing you're taking, maybe some conservatism around the volume outlook, any color you could give on that would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Eric, I think it's all of the above actually.  I come back to the fact that as we've said, Q2 volumes held up better than we had expected.  We have announced some pricing that hasn't yet hit the marketplace and we are contemplating some additional pricing, and it's a challenging environment.  Obviously that has both positives and negatives for our business.  The fact that people are eating at home more is certainly a positive.  The fact that they continue to look for value, we've got to make sure that our brands are delivering that value.  Most importantly though, I feel really confident that our investments in quality and in marketing innovation will keep the brands strong and enable us to improve our year-over-year performance in the second half, despite the pricing that we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And Irene, you mentioned some exciting programming and new products for the second half &#x2013; or you mentioned that there would be some, could you briefly run down what some of those large needle-moving things could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, some of the biggest needle movers are some of the items that we just launched that will play through in a much bigger way in the second half.  So for example, the pure salad dressing re-launch will play through.  Our Bagel-fuls products are now fully at retail and we've started to advertise them, our Pizza For One.  We also have a number of new items.  As we mentioned, we've got our natural, 2% natural cheese coming out with &#x2013; as a hormone-free product, we're the first national brand to do that.  We expect that to be a strong item.  We've got 100 Calorie Oreo Snack Cakes.  I mean, if you look at each of our categories we have a number of items coming out in the back half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of quick questions for you, with respect to the Ralcorp transaction, the spinning-off of Post, can you confirm that you're still planning to see about $900 million of debt travel with that transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct, Todd. We, as you know, we've made a tender offer for a split transaction that should be priced actually later on this week.  We're expecting a closing of the transaction in the coming weeks.  And yes, there is about, a little over $900 million of debt that's expected to come with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  And then just a final second question.  With respect to terming out debt in the capital markets, you've made a lot of progress over the last year.  You do have a $750 million note that matures in October.  But it seems you've got plenty of availability with your credit facility to refinance that with short-term debt.  Do you expect to tap the debt capital markets again this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we do have, you're right, we have about $700 million maturing in, and I believe it's in September.  As we get closer to that, we'll communicate what our intent is to do with regard to terming out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just had two follow-ups for you.  The first one is relative to the question earlier about private label, and I'm just curious, as I look at some of the categories where you did see a decelerating trend in market share, can you say whether private label was the beneficiary of that?  Was that where you're seeing the share go, or is it really category by category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really varies category by category, Chris.  But, again what I'm most encouraged by is the fact that we are seeing those price gaps narrow.  We've got very strong marketing programs and A&amp;C [Advertising and Consumer] investment behind our brands.  And I am confident that we will gain or hold share in a majority of the revenue in the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then another clarification point.  On the increase in marketing, you've talked earlier in the year about a 50 basis point increase in marketing as you define it, and that would be around $200 million.  Is the dollar number still a good number to use for the year, but percentages are changing because of the increased sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Directionally, that's correct.  I mean we can't say precisely, but directionally $200 million would be a good number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just the last question, the share repurchase, can that restart after &#x2013; does it restart right after the Post transaction closes, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will go back into open market conditions after the Post transaction closes.  That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  Not to pick on one division, because I thought the numbers showed overall some improvement, but Snacks &amp; Cereals, it sounds like you were a little disappointed in the second quarter results, because, maybe it's just because your competitors didn't take the pricing that you took right away.  But I thought I heard in your guidance that you think that the full year would be up mid-single digit in profits, and I think you're down in the first half, even with the $50 million benefit on the mark-to-market hedging, and then that's going to reverse.  So, doesn't that require like a pretty radical improvement in the back half in order to meet that guidance for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, Robert, we did see sequential improvement from Q1 in our margins, even if we exclude the hedge gains.  As we've said, we expect the full 2008 margins to be flat with 2007.  We have enormous strength in our five -- top five core brands: Oreo, Chips Ahoy! Ritz, Triscuit and Wheat Thins.  Some of those businesses have programming -- significant programming, that will hit in the back half of the year, and that's what makes us confident that we will be able to deliver that margin performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did I misunderstand the guidance, so you think that the margin will be flat for the year, what does that mean for, does that mean profit...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The profit will be up.  Again, we have this denominator effect due to the significant pricing that we've taken, but the profit dollars will be up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're expecting margins to be comparable to last year, which obviously is going to reflect improved profit dollars, with the higher pricing-driven revenue, we'll see margins hold about flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that guidance exclude the cereal business or include the cereal business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That includes the cereal business at this point.  Once we complete the transaction, we'll update the numbers and give you more clarity on that.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you feel about energy-related versus agriculture-related inflation as you head into '09?  And in particular, I wonder if it becomes more difficult pricing conversations, saying you're going to increase price in your products due to those sort of costs, energy and packaging-related, in particular, or do your customers not really care about where you're seeing the pressure and just think about these pressures equally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reality is that it's certainly easier to price for agricultural increases.  But the facts are, they're quite interrelated as you know right now, and we anticipate that they will continue to be so into the future.  So, I think the best thing that we can do is to make sure that we're able to add value to our categories and price our businesses closer to the marketplace, and that's what we've been engaged in.  And so, I feel very comfortable that despite the challenging economic conditions, we will continue to be able to cover input cost inflation while building the brand equities and delivering solid financial performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second and last question, related to channel growth.  If we assume that your inventory levels didn't really change, it does seem like your volume trends accelerated in unmeasured channels.  Can you give us maybe a little color on that, are you seeing evidence of channel switching or are your share trends improving in these unmeasured channels?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually, David, it's both &#x2013; it's what I said earlier.  We have a very strong relationship with all of our customers.  We certainly are seeing some channel shifts, and we have very, a lot of confidence that the value positioning of our brands is playing quite well in customers like Wal-Mart.  So that is a key piece of our stronger volume performance, and we anticipate that that will continue for the balance of the year.</p>
