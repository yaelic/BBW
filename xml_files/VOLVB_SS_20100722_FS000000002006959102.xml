          <p>Welcome to the Volvo Report for the First 6 Months 2010 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, CEO Leif Johansson. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, good morning and good evening to all of you listening out in the world on this Volvo Group's second quarter conference call. Most welcome to the call, we have our CFO and we have business area presidents as well as our IR people in the conference call in the room with us here. We have made slides for you available on our Internet site and we will try to name them as we go through the presentations and make sure that you know which slides we are speaking to.</p>
          <p>Again most welcome. Let's go to slide 2 and Group Highlights there. We had an underlying operating income of 5 billion, cash flow of 8.5 and that was based on sales numbers growing quarter-on-quarter comparison quarter 2 '09, quarter 2 '10 on 31%. So very good sales growth and with that an underlying operating income of 5 billion and cash flow of 8.5.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we also made and announced an important decision to start engine production in India, medium duty engine production in India based on our Japanese design but with the intent to make that a medium duty engine platform and architecture for the whole of the Group's need for 47-liter engines.</p>
          <p>If we look at the business environment, we have some good news there. First of all you can say outside of Europe and North America, Asia and South America continued strong and even strong growth. And of course as the Group has a much better footprint now, global footprint, we were able to benefit from that.</p>
          <p>But this time around it's also good news to note that Europe and North America, there we are registering gradually improving demand and in the case of North America, especially for on-highway products and trucks, increased market activity. And that's as we see what we have characterized as a moderate, stable and broad recovery in Europe and North America which, as you can say, we have speculated a little bit about in quarter 1 but which I think we can confirm in quarter 2.</p>
          <p>If you flip with us to page 3, headline then the Volvo Group, there you see net sales developing, coming in now at 60 almost 69 billion and the operating income then at almost 5 billion, 7.3% margin and including then the Volvo Aero Services write down, 6.9% margin. And really good growth there on the net sales numbers.</p>
          <p>If you look to the second quarter footprint, geographical footprint there, you see North America and Western Europe now about 50% of our sales and then 50% of our sales represented in non-North American and Western European market, and of course driven by both South America now and Asia into very good numbers. And of course we were able to benefit from the strength of those markets and now representing 50% of sales. And again, we saw for the first time in some time, we saw growth in North America and Western Europe also, but off of very low levels.</p>
          <p>That operating income improvement of course was driven much by increased volumes, but we are also happy to note that what we set out to do in terms of productivity and capacity utilization, but also cost control have been pluses and adding operating income effects in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We go to slide 4, we have a new slide there and that's a good slide because it represents a little of how different, different parts of the world is actually developing. If you look at the left side of that slide, you see 2008 and 2007, Japan, North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and you see how big the downturn really was between 2008 and 2009, and then you remember that the first half of 2008 was even stronger, 2008 second half came down lower. And then we dropped a fearful amount both in North America and Western Europe, but as you see also in Japan.</p>
          <p>Now for the first time in the second quarter of 2010 we actually see growth there, but as you can see also at very low, historically very low levels, so far from the trend lines or far from the historic good level that we had in that part of the world or those parts of the world.</p>
          <p>If you look at, on the other hand, in high sales levels in Brazil, India and China in the right of that slide, you see Other Asia was much impacted in 2009. To some extent as was South America, but much less so than in the left side of that picture, and there you see really good growth and in historically high levels in the whole of that part of the diagram. Of course, representing the fact that we have these markets at high levels of sales and high growth levels, as you can see, while we have, even though we now have moderate growth levels in U.S., Europe and Japan, they are actually at at historically very low numbers.</p>
          <p>So that's I think a good slide to add, and give you a feeling for how our sales have jumped and the footprint that we have established in &#x2013; especially in Asia, have served us well as those parts of the world are gaining in share of the world economy.</p>
          <p>Now, let me switch to slide 5, and we have our CFO, Mikael Bratt, with us here to talk us through a couple of slides on cash flows and other financial matters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Leif. And as you have seen, we have presented a very strong second quarter from a cash flow perspective here, and I would say also it was seasonally a very strong second quarter. That together with a strong first quarter which we had this year, we are now back on a rolling 12-month cash flow on the levels where we should be, and a very steep recovery here from the low levels of the second half of '09 here.</p>
          <p>And it's very clear when you look at this slide, I think, and also when you're diving through the numbers that it's very obvious that 2009 is certainly an exceptional year, and we are now back on where we should be, on historical perspective. The driving forces behind these improvements is of course the improved profitability, but also the fact that we have been working hard with the working capital, and inside the quarter here we have a contribution of 3.3 billion from working capital improvements.</p>
          <p>On the inventory side I would say that as we have very good control over finished product, the slight increase you see in the inventory in the quarter comes from work in progress and incoming material, and that is not strange since we are increasing our production in the second quarter here, and then of course you get that effect. So I would say overall the inventory is in a good shape here.</p>
          <p>The big contribution is coming from accounts payable, and when we have these loan &#x2013; striving for these loan payment terms, we have a good leverage on the way up here as we start to ramp up production. At the same time we had the big negative effect of that in 2009, and that's why we had the drop in capital performance also last year. So that is coming back on the payables side as we ramp up here.</p>
          <p>On the accounts receivable side, I would say that's nothing special to report there. We are following of course the relationship with the improved top line here. On the overdue side, however, we are reporting there record low overdues. So good work done throughout the whole company to collect cash that were due to be paid to us, so good performance there. And you know also that we have on the cash promotion cycle side high ambitions to reach the 20 days levels, and we are good way towards the 20 here. And we are now back on what you could call pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to page 6 and the net financial debt, and as a consequence of the improved cash flow and also the improved profitability here, we now see that the net financial debt in relation to equity is coming down. We peaked during 2009 on 86% ratio and we are now on a good way towards the 40, which is our ambition to be over time here, and we are currently then on the 63% as you can see on the slide here.</p>
          <p>With this strong cash flow, you may have expected to see either stronger improvement in the net debt to equity ratio, but since we have portions of our debt in other currencies than in our home currency, we have a currency effect of 3.3 billion in the quarter, which basically takes away the working capital improvements you can say on the same amount here. So only 5.1 billion have an impact on the net financial position here.</p>
          <p>And I think I spoke before about our allocations here of our net &#x2013; our debt throughout the Group, and of course the yen, dollar and so forth are important currencies for us, as we have big operations in those country, and inside the quarter we have seen primarily the yen strengthening, but also the dollar towards the Swedish kronor, and that's where you get the effect.</p>
          <p>We have also maintained a conservative position I would say when it comes to our liquidity, and we have 74 billion available and about half is in cash equivalents and the other half is unutilized credit facilities, and that combined with limited or basically no maturities during 2010 and 2011, we are in a very good shape from a liquidity standpoint.</p>
          <p>Let's then move on to page 7 and the debt update here. And inside the quarter we have conducted a number of transactions. We have first, a bilateral transaction together with Swedish SHB here in Sweden and it's backed up then with an EKN guarantee. And then we have also concluded the EIB loan of 400 million euros where about half has been drawn down by now and the rest are available for future needs here.</p>
          <p>We have also for the first time in many, many years done an asset backed securitization in the U.S. of $606 (sic) [$616] million. It was very well received in the market here and it's something that has &#x2013; meaning that we have opened up a new funding source also for the Financial Services operation. As well as in Brazil where we have done a credit portfolio syndication of 4 billion which will free up our line to meet higher demands in Brazil from our customers here. And I believe Marty will speak more to later transaction here from a more credit perspective later in the presentation here.</p>
          <p>Moving then onto rating, we have 2 global rating agencies as you know, Moody's and S&amp;P, and on that side we have, during July, received a confirmation from Moody's on the rating we have and maintaining a stable outlook on our Baa2 long-term rating. Also on the 2 local rating agencies, the DBRS of Canada and R&amp;I Japan we have received a confirmation in July for our BBB high stable outlook rating. Our ambition here is of course to get to a level of strong and stable rating for our Group here.</p>
          <p>On page 8 under the headline Upturn Management, and really the way for us, for the group here, is to continue to focus on what we have been focusing during the past year here, and that is to &#x2013; of course to secure that we get operating leverage as we start to increase our sales.</p>
          <p>And I think the first point here, hold on to implemented cost reduction, has been partly proven in the second quarter here, where we see good leverage when we talk about full time (14.34) operation, OpEx expenses, that went up 3% between Q1 and Q2. And on the sale side we saw an increase of 18%, so a good leverage there, where we demonstrate that we can hold on to the OpEx between the quarters here. And that is of course high on the agenda going forward.</p>
          <p>Increased focus on efficiency and this goes through basically all activities inside the companies &#x2013; company and on the capital markets day earlier here in summer we talked for example about R&amp;D 30 projects and also gave you some input regarding IT expenses, et cetera. So focus on synergies, on our synergies centers that will continue to be optimized here.</p>
          <p>Build flexibility in order to meet and follow the demand side here, we are aiming on a 20, 25% cost flexibility inside the group. Supply chain as well as on the way into recession here, we are keeping a task force intact to monitor the suppliers and to make sure that we deal with any potential issues that may rise as our production rates are increasing here.</p>
          <p>Capital turnover I think we talked about the cash flow and the challenges on the tied-up capital we have there. And then finally on price management, we have seen good behavior in our industries and also from our various companies around the world here on price management during the tough times and we also now see opportunities to continue with improving price management and work on the top line as we move into a more stable situation here.</p>
          <p>So I think I'm going to stop there and hand over back to you, Leif. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And I'll be starting to speak on the trucks slide on page nine. You see net sales there improving by as much as 28% which of course is good news and again on the basis of, by comparison with the second quarter of '09 we are looking at an improvement and a recovery in all of the markets and growth where we have seen it coming from Asia and Brazil.</p>
          <p>Operating margins there at 6% driven obviously by the improvements in volume and then I should say also good productivity. We had a messy quarter in the U.S. as we expected and as we have talked about before. Some competitors are still selling U.S. '07 products there that it's a cost associated with ramping up production for EPA 2010. We are very happy with our own product range there. We were the first to be certified EPA 2010 without using credit and we see a very good pickup among customers and acceptance of technology with more than 10,000 orders booked for U.S '10 products. So all in all, a messy and somewhat difficult quarter but we think towards the end here coming out quite well out of that messy couple of quarters perhaps we should say.</p>
          <p>And then we are right now in the mode of gradually increasing production as we come through the different continents here, Europe and North America that's certainly true, and it is also still true when it comes to Asia, more so in India and China and less so in Japan even though Japan at least now is heading in the right direction off of very low numbers.</p>
          <p>On the operating income side you see there, 6%, and then you see in focus we would like to maintain the good performance and productivity in the upturn. We are aware of the fact that our supply chain have gone with us through the downturn and now through the upturn. We are grateful for much of the good work being done in the supply chain, and I would say generally so far so good, but every here and there we have sometimes issues that we need to be clearing out, and we are doing that as we ramp up production.</p>
          <p>We also have a fair amount of product introduction, and I showed a slide at the press conference there with a number of introductions made in 2010; just to remind you that we have, due to the combination of high R&amp;D spending through the past couple of years, but also with the emission controls legislation changing in 2013 &#x2013; 2012-2013 for Euro VI product, we have a number of product introductions ahead of us, and important to deliver on those projects as efficiently as we ever can. And so far, again, so far so good.</p>
          <p>If you look at the development of the markets, and here you see on slide ten, the heavy-duty truck market in Europe, E.U. plus Switzerland, and Norway and you see truck registrations there having coming down to 164 and we had a little of discussion in the morning here between registration and deliveries and these are registration numbers to us so we can get to. As you see there, towards the right side of that slide, you see year-to-date May numbers being down by 22% and we are still holding onto our forecast of 2010 being up to 10%, and that, of course, means that we are expecting a considerably stronger second half of 2010 than what we have seen in the beginning of 2010. So a good improvement. As is also evidenced in the order intake rates for Europe.</p>
          <p>In North America, we have said earlier in the day that we are maintaining our forecast, but we are focusing more on the 30% number than the 20% number, and again, here we have a year-to-date growth, but we also have very good order intake in North America compared again, and you can really see that compared to low levels of the market in Q2 '09, so off of low numbers. And again, let me make the point here that North America and Europe, while we are saying that they are growing, they are certainly not growing at &#x2013; off of any high numbers or high levels.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide 12 you see an interesting slide that does two things for you. One is to compare quarter two to quarter two and there you see an 82% improvement in order intake. And you see Europe and North America very strong there, South America and Asia still strong and other markets also in clear double-digit territory, all combine to be 82% up compared to Q2 '09.</p>
          <p>Now it is true and you can see that on the graph to the side there, it is true that Q2 in '09 was not much to write home about also. You see the depth or the bottom really in the Q1 '09, so very close to the bottom as we went through the crisis. But, of course, good news and comparison to that quarter while it is easy, it still shows a broad and solid recovery across the whole of the world.</p>
          <p>Also take a look at the farther right column there that compares Q1 to Q2. Normally we would have a stronger Q1 for deliveries in Q2 and then a slower order intake in Q2 or lower order intake in comparison as we come into a slower Q3 with the season of deliveries being delivered them in &#x2013; the seasonality of deliveries being delivered in Q2. In this case we actually have a plus progression there also at 10% and as you can see for example in North America by quite big numbers there.</p>
          <p>So we think also, if you do the comparison and the sequence shows process between Q1 and Q2, those numbers look quite reasonably good and would not indicate that we have any kind of double dip or any other type of scenario like that ahead of us. I understand there is quite a lot of discussion about that but basically with the data we have and always to remember that usually that represents a quarter or possibly slightly more than that, two quarters perhaps outlook, we certainly have not seen any double dip evidence by those numbers.</p>
          <p>With that let me have you switch slides to slide 13, that slide that's headlined Construction Equipment and we have Olof Persson, our President of Construction Equipment Group to talk to that slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. We have a good momentum in almost all markets now when we talk about the construction equipment world markets. You can see the total was up 43% quarter-over-quarter and the numbers on the different markets is listed here.</p>
          <p>When we do our normal review quarter by quarter, we have done &#x2013; gone through the different market and we have updated and also upped the market forecast for the full year. We will now talk about Asia being in the range of 30 to 40% on the full year. Other markets 40%. Europe up 10%, and North America up 5 to 10%. I think this shows that we, despite of course the difficulties, is forecasting half a year, we show confidence in the different markets that they will continue to grow and show a full-year growth. That goes also for Europe, which has done a market where we've seen an uptick now on 20% for the first half year, and we say that on the full-year basis we have a 10%, which is basically more positive than we had forecasted last quarter.</p>
          <p>These good market trends have then resulted in good sales for Volvo CE. If you FX adjust it, it's up 73% quarter over quarter, and it's of course particularly a good momentum in our Asian business, and in particular in China but also in Brazil, that helps driving those numbers and making sure that we get those kind of growth numbers.</p>
          <p>If we look at the operating income side, 13.6 operating margin is driven primarily of course by the sales, but also by our cost reductions. And we are very careful now when we have established our new structural cost space that we really make sure that we keep that cost space despite the increase in turnover. These kinds of volumes also are very healthy for our production network, and that means that we have a much better cost absorption, but we also see that we during the quarter have had good productivity development in our industrial system that also helped producing these kind of operating profits.</p>
          <p>And focus going forward now, of course, continue to capitalize on old investments and good things we have done in the BRIC countries to continue that, focus on cost control again to make sure that we don't let go on our structural cost reduction and continue to work on that. And I think it's very important also making sure that we now, for the second half and going forward, keep our flexibility in the industrial system. We still have, we need to be fast in responding to market movements, and I think we do that together with our suppliers and our industrial system that we now have respond to that.</p>
          <p>Now finally giving our strategy, global strategy when it comes to our BRIC country presence, we have developed in the quarter an extensive product plan to make sure that we take care of our strategic directions going forward here, and those will be executed now over the next three to four years. When we're done we'll come out with products and models that support the strategic directions that we have in place. And with that I round off VCE for this time, Leif?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Olof, thank you. Good quarter there. We go to Slide 14 and buses and we have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson, President of our Bus Operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Leif. In buses, I would say we see a mixed market development. On the positive side, we can see South America and Asia continue strong development, but on the negative side then the North America coach is I will say in the record-low level. Hopefully we can see some signs of improvements in the second half of the year. Also, the city bus market in North America seems to be soft, and we have a slight negative trend there.</p>
          <p>In Europe, when we look for the registration up to May, we can see a drop of the market in total with 10% compared to last year. So I will say we are in the range of six to eight months behind the Truck group. So my estimate is that 2010 will be fairly soft market or us but the real recovery will come in 2011.</p>
          <p>Despite the market conditions then, we were able to increase our sales up to 5.3 billion, with a better market mix I will say compared to last year, mainly driven that we have taken fairly big amount of market shares in North America and South America and that's high valued VW and Daimler; they contributed a lot to the sales increase.</p>
          <p>The operating income shows a good leverage compared to last year and last quarter and we reached almost 5% operating margin with a strong cash flow. The main reason for this improvement of profitability is a significant lower cost structure, more efficient production of complete buses, and also then a better market mix compared to last year.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter we reached an important milestone then when we started the serial production of our hybrid and today in Europe we have 125 units in order bank, and I will say this will have a good contribution on Europe's profitability going forward.</p>
          <p>In focus, we see that we have to counteract the very low level of coach activity in North America. So we have and are in the middle of rightsizing the Prevost operation there really to handle these low volumes. And hopefully then when the volumes picks up in the end of year we will be in a better position.</p>
          <p>We are also then working hard to win business both in Europe and North America. It's a tough competition out there because all the manufacturing sees some lower volumes there. But we have been successful so far during Q2, and have a fairly good order bank going forward. But still cost focus is number one priority for buses.</p>
          <p>And over to you, Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And that takes us to Slide 15, headline Volvo Penta, and G&#xF6;ran Gummeson, who's our President of Volvo Penta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Leif. The world market for Marine Leisure engines is currently recovering at the slow pace. People are still hesitating to buy new boats, and the leading boat builders in both Europe and North America do not see any clear signs of an upturn.</p>
          <p>On the Industrial Engine side the situation is more positive, with a relative stable recovery in most parts of the world. Volvo Penta has continued to gain market shares, especially on the marine side, and we have managed to increase our total sales with around 20% compared to the corresponding bad quarter last year, of course. So thanks to the increased sales, better capacity utilization and also lower operating costs, we have improved our operating income, and Volvo Penta, if I feel it right now, we are back on good probability levels.</p>
          <p>In focus, going forward, we will, after the holiday season, introduce an upgraded order to delivery process in Europe, which will enable us to increase flexibility and efficiency in our production and logistic systems. We will continue to have a strict cost control with a strong ambition to continue to deliver good operating levels also in the future; and capital efficiency and to secure positive cash flow is also of course in focus going forward.</p>
          <p>On the product side you have many times heard me talk about the successes for our IPS systems, and I'm happy now to do it once again. Recently we have received the prestigious award from the Swedish Coast Guard for the largest version of the IPS system based on the Group's 13-liter engine. It has been clearly stated by the Coast Guard that the outstanding environmental features have been key arguments when taking the decision. So the Coast Guard will get around 30% fuel savings with the IPS, and for us this is important of course, and as more and more customers, commercial shipping customers are starting to realize these facts.</p>
          <p>So good momentum for the IPS, and I might come back to you on the subject again, but this is all for now. So, Leif</p>

          <p>Thank you, Leif. If you look on the basic market, the air traffic for the airline industry, it continues to recover, and it's already above the levels for pre-recession. The numbers are really strong for passengers, it's been for the first half year or five months 7%, and cargo it's been really high, a 30% increase. Airlines are now estimated to make money in 2010 and that has been recently changed by IATA, their forecast from being minus above $2.5 billion and now being forecasted to be positive $2.5 billion instead; a swing of $5 billion and that's due to the volume of course but it's also improved yields.</p>
          <p>Airbus and Boeing has reported many new orders; more than 80% up versus the last year's six months. But what is notable also is that the leasing companies are coming back and they placed order of more than 300 aircrafts during the Air Show that is going on this week.</p>
          <p>Our sales at Volvo Aero was up 5% and if we do adjustments for currency that means a 10% volume increase. Our result in this quarter is of course very much affected by the divestiture of Volvo Aero Services. That meant in itself is 630 million and minus on our result and that's making us an all-in-all loss for the quarter of 372 million. At the same time our rest of our operation, that means the component business is doing very well and made a positive of 241 million which is a double-digit margin. And this is due to high sales, lower cost and high productivity.</p>
          <p>In focus of course the cost management and the product cost is the center of management's &#x2013; team's attention. And the second bullet for us is execution on new contracts. In the aerospace industry now there is a number of new platforms coming forward and they are in their testing period to make these flight safety issues solved so that they can be taken into service and we are both in ramp up for deliveries as well as going into product development testing.</p>
          <p>And that concludes the report from Volvo Aero Services, Volvo Aero.</p>

          <p>Good. We have Page 17, Financial Services, and we have our new President of Financial Services, Marty Weissburg. Marty came from within VFS having run our North American operations, and I should say very well for us through the crisis here. So Marty, you're welcome to represent the whole of Financial Services there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. For VFS in the second quarter we had good growth in financial transactions completed for both new and existing customers with 8.9 billion Swedish crowns funded for the quarter. Of course this was closely tagged and linked to the strong Group unit sales for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In markets where we provide financing our share, also called penetration, was 24% of the Group unit sales for the quarter. We are working to increase our finance share in markets and in segments that are improving from their low points in their respective economic cycles. And as demand for transport and construction increases, customer credit profiles will continue to improve as well. All these trends combined, will allow us to prudently grow the portfolio.</p>
          <p>For the quarter I would say operating income was difficult with a result of seven million. Impacting this result is the continued depressed conditions in much of Eastern Europe for Financial Services. Many of our customers, a good number of our customers, still continue to struggle, and a lot of the economic rebounds we've seen in our other regions aren't taking as strong of a hold in Eastern Europe yet with the result for VFS of continued high credit provisions. In our other regions, however, I'm pleased to report that the quality of the portfolios and the repayment performance of the portfolios continue to demonstrate positive trending with noted improvements in the U.S. and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Also still impacting profitability for Financial Services is the portfolio side given that our earning assets are smaller than prior year and prior quarter. However, again, the good Group unit sales increases couples with what I would call stable to increasing penetration and general recoveries will allow us to regain portfolio critical mass, and over time this will have a positive impact on profitability.</p>
          <p>Also a highlight from the quarter, as Mikael Bratt mentioned, is that we completed in the U.S. an asset-backed securitization transaction in which we issued about US$616 million of securities, these securities backed by truck and construction equipment loan receivables from the VFS portfolio. The issuance was well oversubscribed with a broad investor base. This ABS is very much in keeping with the Group strategy, as Mikael said, of alternative and well-priced sources of funding.</p>
          <p>In focus for Financial Services is of course the continuation of business cycle management. There's many aspects to this including growth, portfolio control and risk mitigation, funding strategies, et cetera. And business cycle management varies by region and where that region is in its respective economic cycle. For example, in Brazil we continue to experience strong portfolio growth as expected.</p>
          <p>In this quarter that just ended, we syndicated in Brazil approximately 35% of our customer finance portfolio, approximately four billion Swedish. With this portfolio sale, we retain account servicing and customer relationship management, and it has allowed us to create additional capacity, as Mikael said, for the financing of strong Group customers as they seek to purchase additional Group products over time.</p>
          <p>Also in focus for Financial Services and mentioned, is portfolio growth generally, and with well-defined commercial strategies and risk strategies, all of which well aligned with our sister business areas.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in focus, operational efficiency remains a top focus as we continue to gain global synergies and operational leverage, which are very important to financial services as we grow again our portfolio in existing markets and even as we enter new markets over time.</p>
          <p>So that's a report from Financial Services, Leif.</p>

          <p>Great, sir. Well, that's okay, Marty. Thank you.</p>
          <p>We have the group summery on Slide 18 there. If you look at earnings per share, we made a Swedish kroner 155 versus 0.83 in Q1 '10. Operating cash flow in good numbers at 8.5% and perhaps the best news, 31% growth in sales, off of high &#x2013; in high level sales in Brazil, India and China. Low level sales but improving in the U.S., Europe and Japan. And all of that of course combines into an operating &#x2013; cost reductions, execute and operating cash flow well in line with expectations of that to happen.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we have in focus then, we are increasing production now. We have said that we are putting on some shifts in certain parts of the group, most notably so on the engines side. As we do that, we have made sure that we can hold on to productivity and cost control and try to develop a good leverage on what we now consider to be an upturn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to ask three questions, please. First of all, how should we think about Asian construction equipment going forward? Olof, perhaps you could help me here. Normally a very strong seasonal effect of H1 versus H2. What are your customers indicating at the moment? Let me try to clarify it. Sales in H1 were about 12.5 billion roughly. Last year, you did about 13 billion. Do you expect 35% of your sales to be produced in H2 of this year? Or is it going to be down 25% year on year in the second half? Perhaps I'm missing something here but that's what I'd like to understand.</p>
          <p>Second, in trucks, how are your customers feeling about the future at the moment? What are you seeing in terms of your freight-forwarding trends? Are they a tick more positive than they were in Q1, or are they a tick more negative than in Q1? So I'd like to get a bit of a feeling here. Lastly, Mikael, you've highlighted that you'd like to reduce the cash conversion cycle further to about 20 days. I would like to know where the leverage is. Is that mainly on the inventory side? Or is that perhaps sort of coming from something else? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think on the Asian construction equipment side, Olof, are you prepared to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What we have said, and what we have said before as well is that first of all, in China it's very seasonable with a strong spring season and then a more slowed down autumn season. And then we also see that trend coming this year. We should remember that Asia and China in particular came out of the recession last year early, which meant that there was a very high autumn season last year in Asia and in particular in China.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think we are seeing a more normal seasonability in China this year. But there is nothing that indicates that there would be any sort of a major slowdown or cool down or anything like that.</p>
          <p>It also represents, if you look at the market numbers, the growth numbers, is of course that as we progress here, the comparable numbers will be tougher and tougher just because of what I said there.</p>
          <p>So I hope that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do the trucks there. I think it's fair to say that if you're asking us to put a plus or minus sign Q1 compared to Q2, Q2 must be better than Q1. I think we are seeing gradual confidence increasing by our customers, most notably so in Europe and North America, as is evidenced also by the order intake.</p>
          <p>I think to qualify that a little, I think we've probably seen more optimism and more intent to buy, even putting orders in on the large fleets, and slightly less on the owner operators. I think the owner operators were more hit with the liquidity crisis and their ability to gain good support from the financial sector more so than the large fleets.</p>
          <p>But that's a qualifying statement. I would have, I think, if I put them in progression between Q1 and Q2, to say that both of those two groups, large lease and owner operators, are more positive now than they were in Q1.</p>
          <p>Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash conversion cycle and our target there of 20 days, and I would say that of course we are not leaving any of the components aside here. All the components need to be worked through here. But of course, you offer the biggest opportunity inside the inventories and also on the payables side. And I would say none of them are really back to where we were in our past here.</p>
          <p>So there's further opportunities, certainly in those areas. For example, on the accounts receivable side as I said there, we are very much looking to reduce and getting that down as well.</p>
          <p>So solid working in all areas of the cash conversion cycle is needed in order to reach the 20 days.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you there. I just wanted to have one clarification question. If I do the numbers correctly, I understand that Asia in construction equipment is going to be down about 25% in the second half of this year. Or is there something with the registration data or a market share shift? Is that a correct understanding, that it's going to be down 25%?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Could you please tell me what the proportion of service revenues are in construction equipment overall to date, roughly speaking? And what the equivalent number is for the Asian business there? Secondly, I just want a clarification on the &#x2013; when you talk about a messy quarter in the U.S. truck business. Is that in terms of sales, because your competitors are still selling the old engines? Or is it because you had additional costs in the quarter? So maybe if you could clarify that. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we don't split that normally, the service and the new build turnover. What we can say in terms of the differences between Europe and Asia, for instance, is of course that we have a much higher historical installed base in Europe and in our so-called traditional markets like North America than we have in Asia, where we are now heftily building up our base of machines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk to you about the so-called messy quarters. I think name any aspect of the business in North American trucks and you would consider to be messy there. It is certainly messy in terms of sales. There is still cuts &#x2013; some of our competitors are taking even orders in Q2 for '07 products. So that's a difficult situation.</p>
          <p>Then obviously you have the cost of introduction in terms of both ramping up production, but also in terms of getting all the new technologies into a good, productive manufacturing situation.</p>
          <p>Then of course we have customer acceptance of EPA '10 product. And getting for them to be comfortable with the technologies, how they work, how they should be operated and what they mean for them in their normal day of doing their business. All of which I think as we have progressed through the quarter, are becoming quite good.</p>
          <p>I think it would surprise me, even though I have been surprised before, whether there would be still any U.S. '07 orders placed in Q3. But that might happen. We don't know that. Obviously, we are running in our own business and doing that better as we progress through the ramp up, so I think that's basically beginning to have been taken care of.</p>
          <p>Customer acceptance is very good as is evidenced by the strong order intake there, and I think especially customers are pleased with the environmentally sound technology that makes them drive the world's cleanest trucks. But they're also quite pleased with the fuel efficiency that's coming out of those trucks.</p>
          <p>I think that combination there will bode for a good acceptance of Volvo EPA '10 technology in the next couple of quarters here. But it has been, as we say, any aspect of the business, it's a messy situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that. Is it possible to estimate the additional costs for introducing these products and introducing the technologies? So leaving the sales patterns aside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. At least not that I would be capable of doing here in a catchall number. I think we have spoken about this at some length both in Q1 and Q2 and there are lots of moving parts there. So I think I'd stop short of doing that and say let's look into the next couple of quarters instead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse in London. A couple of questions. Could you just update us where you stand on raw materials? I think you had a 100 million tailwind in the second quarter. When is that, or is it and when will it turn into a headwind? And how much could that be for the rest of the year, as far as you can see right now?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on Euro VI, I mean, obviously we talk lot about EPA '10. We know that these engines are roughly eight to $10,000 more expensive. Euro VI is not that far away. Could you give us some insight in how much the Euro VI engines could cost more than Euro V? And when you will start selling the Euro VI in Europe?</p>
          <p>And then just more strategically, maybe comparing Volvo's Truck business to Daimler, I think it's fair to say that your businesses are relatively similar, at least from a global footprint and size. And Daimler has a cycle average 8% EBIT margin target. Now you at least currently appear to be running a more profitable truck operation, and just conceptually, I mean, can we look at your truck operation after the cycle now what you have done on costs and everything, is that a business that can across the cycle generate something like a 10% return? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I think on the raw materials side, I'm looking at Christer here. Do we have any catchall numbers for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair to say neutral in this quarter, and then we &#x2013; if it continues as it is, we would have an increase on raw materials over the next couple of quarters here as we ramp up production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have said earlier here that it is clearly our intention to need to get that across to the marketplace in terms of pricing, and we think that is doable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not expecting a dramatic impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're also not expecting any dramatic impact there. On the Euro VI and EPA, a couple of questions there. One was the cost associated with Euro VI and the other one was when would we introduce versus 2013. I think you can say the good thing with running global architectures is that the EPA products, EPA '10 product, and Euro VI products will over time become more and more similar.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we were not able to convince the authorities there to have a global harmonized Euro VI/EPA '10 situation. So they're still different, but they are much more similar than for example a U.S. '07 and Euro IV, Euro V. So that's good news. It will mean that we can benefit from the introduction of EPA '10 into Euro VI. It's early in the day to really say how much the Euro VI will cost, and one of the reasons is that the language from the Europe Commission is still not ready, especially as it relates to on the type of electronics that we need to have for onboard diagnostics there. So I think it's too early in the day. But just as a very round number, similar cost to EPA '10.</p>
          <p>Then on this introduction I think the last time around we had a situation where incentive programs in different countries, most notably so in Germany, fragmented the market in such a way that it was a good financial deal for our customers to buy Euro V products earlier than what was necessary coming with the legislation. We don't really see any room for incentive programs &#x2013; costly incentive programs, for individual European countries to promote that.</p>
          <p>So, I think, what's going to happen here is that we will see a, as you know, gradual then on new products, 2012, and on all products, 2013, phase in of Euro VI products, but not skewed with incentive programs coming from individual countries in Europe. That's still an assessment we're making. Things can happen there, but any which way you can say, given our position on EPA '10, we are in good position to deliver good on Euro VI also. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may step in here, excuse me, thank you. Well, that's exactly the point, right? Residual values might be impacted if people are saying, should I really buy a Euro V engine in 2011, 2012, if Euro VI is coming? And the industry might decide &#x2013; might not be you, might be some of your competitors, to push on with some incentive programs to push out Euro V engines. I mean, is that really a big issue or should we be completely relaxed here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not consider it to be a big issue today. Last time around, which is what you are alluding to, the incentive programs, especially then in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were fairly strong. And making it justifiable to buy the new truck and making a financially sound decision to have it run even though it was much costlier because the incentive programs for running that Euro V truck was there.</p>
          <p>And as I said, I don't expect that to be happening. You could speculate a little whether there would be a pre-buy effect Euro V, but we also don't think that that's an issue. So in &#x2013; I think you will see the combination of '12 and '13, a fairly orderly introduction of new products. And historically, you can say we have not had much of pre-buy effects in the European markets, and I don't really expect that to happen here. So to us, at least this point in time, some will need to be followed. Not a major concern or issue.</p>
          <p>Then we have this issue of could we have higher expectations than 7% cycle average. And you said Daimler has 8%, which is probably about the same. And obviously, our &#x2013; our intention and our ambition is to try to beat this cycle average. But I think in general, we are also taking a view of having gone through one of the worst loss years in 2009 that we would like to have that solidly behind us and make sure that we have a genuine upturn and recovery to be talking about a normal cycle. You know today we are not even looking at 2008 and 2009 as a normal cycle.</p>
          <p>If we can do better I will &#x2013; I can assure you we will attempt to do better there. And if we want to change that guidance then the Board will do so and we'll let you know when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you benchmark your business to Daimler, is there anything where you would say that stands out where you're better or worse than your key competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think a comparison between us and Daimler I think is probably the best comparison in terms of looking at companies that have very similar footprints and opportunities and sites. So that's probably about right.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. This is Patrik Sjoblom from Cheuvreux. Just a question on VFS. You talk about in the presentation that Eastern European customers are still a bit problematic for you. And I just wanted to ask what portion or what proportion of the credit portfolio is in Eastern Europe? And then also if you could comment upon sort of the trends, if I look sort of over time on your credit provision expenses, you sort of peaked basically a year ago at kind of, call it seven, 800 million per quarter. And now you come down to about 400 million per quarter, which is of course an improvement, but if you compare with history you were doing like say 30 to 50 per quarter in history. So you are sort of 10 times there, the historical level. Is this all due to Eastern Europe?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; to answer your first question. Eastern Europe today represents approximately 8% of the global portfolio, down from closer to 11, 12% a year ago. So just as a percent of the total, it's reducing. There's two issues in Eastern Europe. And then I'll &#x2013; hopefully, this will answer your question. The first is that the &#x2013; a lot of our customer segments just aren't seeing the general recovery that we're seeing in our other regions. So there's this lack of good cash flowing into them. There's more idle equipment.</p>
          <p>The second, and this is more of a timing issue that you've asked about a little bit, is around the globe, with defaulted accounts, we utilize legal processes and remedies with these defaulted accounts to gain possession, re-market, and realize and liquidate our issues. In Eastern Europe &#x2013; in many of the Eastern Europe countries, this legal process takes more time. So I would say that it's not necessarily new issues that are coming up in Eastern Europe. It's the same customer problems that just perhaps are getting a little worse or not getting better as quickly. But it's well-controlled and it's stable, and again, as a percent of the global portfolio for the group, is shrinking.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it would be fair to say that credit provisions should hopefully quite soon start to become much less pronounced in the P&amp;L of VFS and, hopefully, we should see that also in the write-off?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're pleased with the trends in all of our regions. And of course, we feel we're adequately reserved in all of our regions. And I would say that the worst of Eastern Europe is behind us. We look forward to the return of that market quite frankly. It's very important for the group. And VFS has an important operating platform there that we're continuing to utilize.</p>

          <p>Patrik, do you remember that a couple of years ago, we had &#x2013; we were making great speeches about Greater Europe and pointed to the fact that we had a couple of hundred million people coming into markets in Eastern Europe, Russia, Turkey, et cetera, included, coming in and expecting to buy the same types of products that we sell in Western Europe and we had a very good effect of Greater Europe happening. We still think that that is the case. We've seen a real crisis here. But couple of years out, we expect the Greater European market to be just as great as it used to be before the crisis.</p>

          <p>Roddy Bridge from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes, Roddy Bridge here from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Just a couple of things. Firstly, just to sort of straighten out in my own mind what you're really saying about production and deliveries, I mean we've seen sequential improvement in the order book Q2 on Q1, and in my reckoning, Q3 is usually a bit quieter due to people taking holidays, et cetera. But I think this morning, did you say that production would actually up in Q3 on Q2, and you meant that in real terms rather than seasonally adjusted terms? So just some clarification there.</p>
          <p>Second thing was really just on the sort of technology in North America. I saw Navistar putting out a big press release yesterday saying that in total, sort of liquid terms, the Advanced EGR route was better. I was wondering if you cared at this stage to sort of make any comment about how you see the technology debate developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we did say or intended to say at least in Q2 was that production pace is going up in Q3 compared to Q2. So we are adding, for example, capacity, shift some people in Q3 versus Q2. But as you say we have also the vacation period in July in Scandinavia and in August in most of the other places. So I don't think that total output will actually go up. Then as we come into quarter four then we will see again the same pace. So you have the seasonality between Q1 -- Q3 in the same way that we have expressed before.</p>
          <p>On the EGR and SCR technology debate there, I think it's &#x2013; we are following with some interest Navistar's comments here about technology that they don't have and commenting on that rather than the technology that they claim to be having somewhere down the road here, which is EGR instead. Our selection of SCR compared to EGR was driven really by the much better fuel efficiency on SCR, and we should also say, a well and tested and proven technology that we have run many thousands of trucks on in Europe for quite some time.</p>
          <p>EGR at these levels are &#x2013; at the EPA'10 levels is difficult to achieve and from what I understand, Navistar does not &#x2013; do not intend to reach the '02 levels, the certified EPA'10. They plan to reach the '05 levels but with the credits then of other engines that they manufacture. And obviously those credits will run out. Somewhere down the road Navistar is going to have to find a way how to make '02 certifiable engines instead of only '05 certifiable engines. Those are NOx statements.</p>
          <p>An interesting discussion, more so from a media point of view than from technology point of view. I think we made the right choice. And we will continue to convince customers about that, seeing the cleanest trucks in the world but also in our case certified without credits but also very fuel efficient trucks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks very much. Jose Asumendi, RBS. Three questions please. The first one for Mikael, I was just wondering if you could comment how you see CapEx and depreciation in the second half of the year, and especially, if you see any acceleration of CapEx in the second half? Second one on pricing in Construction Equipment, if you could just give us some light into how successful have you been passing on price increases across the regions? Maybe you can make some comments across regions and I will be especially interested in Europe and U.S. And third, last question on the Brazilian truck market, I mean incentives are going to be fading out towards the end of the year. I'm just wondering whether you already have in your plans some planned shutdowns towards end of Q3 or beginning of Q4, and how many months of visibility have you got right now on your book in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Should we start with CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In the quarter here, you had a fairly well balanced proportion between capitalization and depreciation, around 500, you could say, between &#x2013; yeah, around 500 on both sides there, so a good balance there. Going forward, we will probably see that the capitalization will start to increase there. So I think you should expect to have a net around &#x2013; let's say, between 500 and 1 billion Swedish going forward here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Pricing on CE, Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We can say that in the first half year, we had in general, total, about a 2% increase if you take average around the globe. And that is of course due to the fact that we try to stay ahead of the curve on cost increases. And we will continue to try to do so. And I would say that if you look at it, it's rather evenly spread around the world with some small differences between the Asia and the European and the North America region.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering as a follow-up on the pricing, do you have like a thumb rule of &#x2013; for every percentage point, how much does it help on your EBIT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we don't have that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Different on different products there. Aside from the obvious one that if you get 1% better pay then the cost is the same than if they have 1% better EBIT one. But I guess you're after the mix more there? Then we have this visibility in Brazil. And I'll ask you, Mikael, to speak to that. You're our expert on the Brazilian market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think when you look at Brazil there are some stimulus in the Brazilian market at the moment, which are expected to cease towards the end of the year. So looking forward into 2011, we expect to see a slight drop. But I think for the full year 2011, we will still see 2011 as one of the best years in total volume going forward. And so in short-term, in early 2011 somewhat of a drop, but for the full year, I would say still a very strong 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This is Alexis Albert from Nomura in London. Just two questions, the first one is that could you share with us the gross &#x2013; the increase of production you had during the Q2 for trucks and CE? This is my first question. And the second one is that it's more your view about what you intend to do in China; we know that MAN has a strong JV with truck, Daimler just announced a couple of agreements last week, so just wondering what is your &#x2013; what do you intend to do to grow in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I think the comparison of production output in Q2 compared to Q1 if that's what you're asking, I think compared to Q2 '09 then you have a 31% improvement and basically we were &#x2013; in Q2 '09 we were selling out of inventory, which meant the production rate was much lower than the 31% comparison would indicate. If you do Q1 to Q2 and you remember that we put only 1.5 billion in inventory in Q2 compared to Q1. It means that we were basically manufacturing what we were selling so there I think you have the comparison there between Q1 basically and Q2 there. Anything you want to add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look on the &#x2013; For VC we had a, you can say, almost 60% capacity utilization throughout the system, 58 to be exact and that is up from around 40 that we had in Q1; and same comment as from Leif, we were still not done taking down inventory not to a great extent. And also I can add that in Q2 we had no stoppage states in production so we were running for all day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, excuse me to interrupt, just to be sure I understood. So Q2 for trucks, Q2 2010 versus Q2 2009 up 31% and Q2 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales up 31%, but production much more. I think you were asking production rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was asking production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but you remember that in Q2 '09 we were actually selling out of inventory quite a lot. We were reducing inventories by billions I think in the second quarter of '09. We have those numbers to go back for you if you want to. But it really meant that in Q2 we were basically manufacturing what we were selling. In the second quarter Mikael shows me here that we had a change of inventories. We took SEK 5.8 billion out of inventory in Q2 '09 which you should then deduct from the sales numbers to get those right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. On this Chinese situation, you know, in China, and as you can see here in our growth rates in China we are doing quite well on Volvo Construction Equipment. Lingong has been growing very well and giving us a very good position in the Chinese construction equipment market. It used to be wheel loaders only but now expanding into also other products. On the bus side, we have two bus joint ventures, one with Shanghai Automotive in Shanghai, and one with Xian Aircraft of Silver Bus's; both of which are doing very well. And I should say, <mark type="inaudible" /> perhaps most notably so Shanghai and the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I think ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sunwin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, number 3 in the Chinese city bus market, above 10 meter buses, to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So doing very well there. On the truck side, we have a couple of different set-ups. First of all we are selling, and I should say reasonably well, in the so-called European segment with &#x2013; basically with Volvo brands but also Renault brands. And then we also have a joint venture that we came into through the acquisition of UD Trucks and it's on diesel where we are manufacturing UD Trucks for the Chinese market together with the alliance with Dongfeng. And as you know, over the years here we have tested different ways to see how we could expand that business and obviously there's a couple of different avenues to go. One is to continue to grow with Dongfeng as we are. That's certainly viable. Other ways would be to set up own operations in certain parts of our different business. Penta, I should say, is also doing very well here and have own operations in China. So we're looking at different alternatives. And in the meanwhile, we enjoy the position we have.</p>
