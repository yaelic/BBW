          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q1 2009 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'd now like turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am joined today by our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; by our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Steve Paul; and by Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemon from the IR department.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 2 and those outlined in our latest 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. You can access the earnings press release and supporting materials, a live webcast, an Internet-based replay, and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The replay, the supporting materials, and the podcast will be available on our website through May 20, 2009.</p>
          <p>We're off to strong start in 2009. In the first quarter, we continued to generate volume-driven revenue growth, leverage between growth in revenue and operating expense, an increase in gross margin percent, and strong operating cash flow. This type of financial performance provides the resources necessary to build a robust pipeline to drive future growth, to effectively deal with the patent expirations coming in the next decade, and to respond from a position of strength to an increasingly challenging healthcare environment.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Derica to kick off our discussion of our Q1 results, I will quickly run through some of the key events of the past three months.</p>
          <p>On the legal front, a bench trial was held in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana regarding patent litigation for Evista. A temporary restraining order currently prohibits the launch of a generic version of Evista by Teva Pharmaceuticals. We expect a ruling on our request for a preliminary injunction by April 23, 2009. If granted, the preliminary injunction would enjoin Teva from launching prior to a final ruling.</p>
          <p>The Court of Appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, D.C. overturned a lower court decision and ruled in our favor in the case of Ariad Pharmaceuticals versus Eli Lilly and Company, holding that Ariad's patent claims purporting to cover Evista and Xigris are invalid.</p>
          <p>In terms of data releases, along with Amylin and Alkermes, we released topline data from the DURATION-2 study of exenatide once weekly. In this study, patients taking exenatide once weekly showed a greater reduction in HbA1c and a greater reduction in weight in patients taking either sitagliptin or pioglitazone. We also announced that a meta-analysis of primary cardiovascular events across controlled clinical trials of three months or more showed no increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with exenatide use.</p>
          <p>For our top priority of advancing the pipeline, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for prasugrel for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. The product has now been launched in both Germany and the United Kingdom. We also launched Zypadhera in the European Union.</p>
          <p>The FDA approved a new indication for Symbyax for the acute treatment of treatment-resistant depression, or TRD, in adults. The FDA also approved two new combination indications for Zyprexa and fluoxetine in adult for the acute treatment of bipolar depression and for TRD. Zyprexa remains under review for use in adolescents aged 13 to 17 for the acute treatment of schizophrenia and acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Lilly has been asked by the FDA to review our data at a Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting scheduled in June.</p>
          <p>We submitted our reply to the FDA regarding the Agency's complete response letter for Zyprexa long-acting injection. The Agency has designated a six-month review period. We received a complete response letter from the FDA for the first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck sBLA for Erbitux. And finally, the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted 9 to 0 that prasugrel should be approved for the treatment of patients with ACS undergoing PCI.</p>
          <p>Later in the call, Steve will share with you few more detailed review of our pipeline as well as key upcoming clinical and regulatory events.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to Derica.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil.</p>
          <p>As I have done on previous calls, I will focus my comments on pro forma non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insight into the underlying trends in the business. This view assumes we owned ImClone as of January 1, 2008, and it excludes certain items. We had no such items this quarter, but we did in Q1 of last year.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows that first-quarter revenue grew 3%, while operating expense, defined as the sum of SG&amp;A and R&amp;D, was flat. Again, we delivered positive operating leverage.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you've noticed in our press release that the cost of sales decreased 29% compared to Q1 2008. This decrease is due to the impact on international inventories of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, principally versus the euro, resulted in a substantial benefit to the cost of sales. This pushed gross margin as a percent of revenue to nearly 84%. As a result of the large increase in gross margin percent, as well as revenues growth outpacing operating expense growth, we reported earnings of -- per share of $1.20, an increase of 36% on a pro forma non-GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>Now, let me take a moment to explain our operational performance versus the impact of foreign exchange. Clearly, the 36% growth rate in EPS benefited from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales. One would typically expect weakening foreign currencies to decrease the U.S. dollar value of margins earned internationally. We did see a negative impact in the first quarter of foreign exchange on the U.S. dollar value of margins earned overseas. However, as we've discussed in the past, the accounting for our international inventories provides a natural hedge of sorts, particularly when the exchange rates move substantially, as they have since mid-2008. I want to make sure you understand that, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates on both our international earnings and on our international inventories, we still registered strong underlying performance growth in revenue and EPS in Q1.</p>
          <p>Let's walk through what's going on one step at a time, starting with revenue. As shown in the Price/Rate/Volume table in slide 8, we saw volume growth in total revenue of 5% on a pro forma basis. The graph on the right illustrates that this continues a trend of strong volume growth we've seen since 2003.</p>
          <p>Returning to the table on the left, you will notice that our underlying performance growth in revenue of 8% is currently being masked by the significant 5% negative impact of weaker foreign currencies. This effect is pronounced in nearly all international markets, with the one notable exception of Japan.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the rest of income statement. The table on slide 9 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our income statement, both with and without the impact of foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the middle column are straight from our pro forma non-GAAP income statement we just reviewed. The third column of numbers strips out the impact of foreign exchange rates. Walking through this column, you can see the 8% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. Absence the impact of FX, cost of sales increased, but at a slower rate than revenue. Removing FX from operating expenses shows underlying performance growth of about 3%, well below our 8% revenue growth.</p>
          <p>So, on a performance basis, we generated 19% growth in operating income, driven primarily by a leverage between revenue and operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, due to operational improvements in the gross margin percent. Hopefully, this provides you with a better understanding of the impact foreign exchange had on our Q1 results. I also hope that it underscores the strong underlying operating and financial performance we generated in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, what do our Q1 financial results mean for the rest of 2009, and therefore, for our 2009 financial guidance?</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, let's first discuss the impact of foreign exchange rates. Going forward, if exchange rates remain at current levels, the negative impact we saw in Q1 on international revenue and margins is likely to persist for Q2 and Q3, and moderate in Q4. The substantial benefit seen in Q1 from FX related to international inventories will not sustain itself through the remaining three quarters of 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of operational performance, we expect to see continued volume-driven revenue growth. However, we may see more significant erosion of Gemzar sales, as generics penetrate international markets. Similar to Q1, growth of cost of products sold may be relatively close to revenue growth. We expect to see an impact on our operating expense growth due to the ramp-up of international Efient launches and the advancement of our pipeline.</p>
          <p>With this context, let's move to slide 11, and I will summarize our 2009 guidance.</p>
          <p>The operative word here is "unchanged." Given the dynamics I've described, we reconfirm our previously-issued 2009 earnings per share guidance range of $4 to $4.25. We also reconfirm our line item guidance on both a pro forma non-GAAP and reported basis. We expect volume growth in revenues driven by Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis, Humalog, and the launches of prasugrel as well as by the Elanco Animal Health division.</p>
          <p>However, the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies and the impact of generic competition at certain markets for Gemzar are anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts. As a result, we expect low single-digit revenue growth on a pro forma non-GAAP basis, and mid single-digit revenue growth on a reported basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue is expected to increase, driven by the strengthening dollar. This increase is expected to be more pronounced in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are projected to show a flat to low single-digit growth. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the high single-digits on a pro forma non-GAAP basis and in the low double-digits on a reported basis</p>
          <p>Due primarily to higher interest expense and lower interest income as a result of the ImClone acquisition, we expect other income for 2009 to be a net loss of between 200 and $250 million, and the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect continued strong operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to Ronika and Nick for a more detailed review of our financial results, starting with a review of sales performance by key products. Nick?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Derica.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows worldwide Zyprexa sales totaled $1.123 billion in Q1, which was essentially flat compared with the first quarter of 2008. Sales in the U.S. increased 7% to $535 million, driven by higher prices and the favorable impact of wholesaler buying patterns, partially offset by lower demand. International sales were down 5% to $588 million, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably impacted by the withdrawal of generic competition in Germany.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14. Cymbalta sales in the first quarter were $709 million, up 17% compared with the first quarter 2008. U.S. sales increased 17% to $597 million, driven by higher demand, increased prices, and the favorable impact of wholesaler buying patterns. International sales totaled $112 million, an increase of 19%, driven primarily by higher demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, Humalog sales grew 11% to $451 million. U.S. sales increased 20% to $286 million, driven by increased prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 3% to $164 million, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows Cialis sales were up 6% in the quarter, reaching $359 million. Sales in the U.S. were up 21% to $149 million, driven by higher prices, increased demand, and the favorable impact of wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside of the U.S. decreased 2% to $210 million, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand and higher prices.</p>
          <p>Moving to side 17, Alimta sales in the first quarter continued to be strong, coming in at $335 million, an increase of 36% over Q1 2008. U.S. sales increased 42% to $173 million, due to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. were up 30% to $162 million, due to increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, Humulin sales for the quarter were down 7% to $241 million. U.S. sales increased 6% to $99 million, due primarily to higher net effective selling prices. International sales decreased 14% to $142 million, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower prices.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows quarterly Forteo sales of $187 million, up 1% over Q1 of last year. U.S. sales increased 3% to $122 million, driven by increased net effective selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. International sales of Forteo decreased by 1% to $66 million due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher demand.</p>
          <p>Slides 20 shows worldwide Byetta sales for the quarter were $181 million, a 7% increase. U.S. Byetta sales were essentially flat at $158 million, while O-U.S. Byetta sales were $24 million, compared to $10 million in Q1 2008. Lilly reports half of the gross margin for U.S. sales of Byetta plus sales of pens to Amylin, and 100% of international sales. Total Byetta revenue recognized in Lilly's income statement was $98 million, an 18% increase.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Before looking at the rest of the income statement, let's look at slide 21, which shows the impact of price, exchange rates, and volume on revenue, presented on a pro forma non-GAAP basis as if we owned ImClone for all of 2008.</p>
          <p>Please note that, beginning with this quarter, we are adopting a new accounting pronouncement to break out total revenue into two distinct elements: product sales, and collaboration and other revenue. Product sales will consist of sales of pharmaceutical and animal health products, as well as third-party sales of manufactured products, such as sales of Erbitux to Bristol-Myers Squibb and of Byetta pens to Amylin. Collaboration and other revenue includes payments from our partners such as royalties and profit-sharing arrangements. The largest component included in this classification are the Byetta gross margin share in the U.S. and the Erbitux net royalty received from our collaboration partners.</p>
          <p>As Derica mentioned earlier, in Q1, our 3% increase in total revenue is driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 3% increase in net effective selling prices, partially offset by the negative foreign exchange impact of 5%.</p>
          <p>Q1 volume growth in Japan was impacted by the last year's April 1 price decrease, while in Europe, we began to see the positive impact of reclaiming exclusivity of Zyprexa in Germany.</p>
          <p>Animal Health year-on-year volume benefited from the inclusion of the U.S. Posilac sales acquired from Monsanto in Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>The reduction in collaboration and other revenue was driven primarily by the step-down in the residual royalty from Takeda for U.S. Actos, and to a lesser extent by lower net Erbitux royalties.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 presents the price-rate-volume analysis on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 shows the income statement for Q1 2009. Worldwide pro forma total revenue for the first quarter of 2009 was $5.047 billion, an increase of 3% compared with the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 7.3 percentage points, to 83.8%. This increase was due to the impact of the decline in foreign exchange currencies compared to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a benefit to cost of sales.</p>
          <p>Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 3% to $1.529 billion. The decrease was due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a reduction in expenses related to U.S. marketing programs, partially offset by the increased prasugrel pre-launch activities.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses were $947 million, or 19% of sales. Compared with the first quarter of 2008, research and development expenses grew by 4% due to increased late-stage clinical trial and discovery research costs, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>You can see that the expansion of our gross margin percentage drove a robust 38% increase in operating income.</p>
          <p>The adjusted effective tax rate on a pro forma non-GAAP basis was 22% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income and fully-diluted earnings per share showed growth of 37 and 36%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 shows first quarter and other income and deductions which decreased by $25 million to $71 million of net expense, primarily due to lower business development income.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows our reported EPS as well as significant items affecting net income and earnings per share. There were no significant items affecting net income for the first quarter of 2009. However, the reported earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 were favorably affected by significant items netting to $0.05 per share.</p>
          <p>To reflect the impact of ImClone acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008, first quarter 2008 pro forma non-GAAP earnings per share have been reduced by $0.04. For additional information, we have provided a reported earnings statement on slide 26. Details about our reported earnings are available on our earnings press release dated today, April 20, 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Steve to update you on our pipeline and key events for the rest of 2009.</p>
          <p>&lt;&lt;Steven M. Paul, M.D., Executive Vice President, Science and Technology;</p>
          <p>President, Lilly Research Laboratories&gt;&gt;</p>
          <p>Thanks, Ronika.</p>
          <p>During the past few years, we've substantially increased the number of new chemical entities and new biologic entities in clinical development. Owing both to the increased productivity of our own labs and to acquisitions, the current list of compounds in some stage of human testing at Lilly is larger and more exciting than at any time in the history of the company. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 61 distinct entities, double the number we had at the end of 2006, including a record 26 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. And we continue to build a robust biotech portfolio. In fact, biotech molecules represent almost half of our late stage Phase II and Phase III assets and now represent over 40% of our overall clinical portfolio.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed in the past, we are squarely focused on advancing our pipeline. As you can see reflected by the arrows on slide 27, since our last formal portfolio update in New York this past December, we've received approval for and launched prasugrel in the European Union. We've moved four more compounds into Phase II testing, and we've moved four more compounds into Phase I testing. We are implementing a strategy and making the investments to build Lilly's position as a biotech and oncology powerhouse.</p>
          <p>We are also increasing the productivity of our small molecule research and are strengthening our therapeutic presence in neuroscience and diabetes, as well as musculoskeletal and osteoporosis. We're building a pipeline that we believe will meet the challenges of the next decade, providing a continues flow, two launches per year of high-value medicines by 2013.</p>
          <p>To this end, we now estimate that of the 61 new chemical entities and new biologic entities in clinical development, 15 to 20 may reach the market as either best-in-class or first-in-class medicines over the next five to ten years.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, I have listed compounds that could launch during the years YZ. Of course, while a number of these may undoubtedly not make it to market, we are optimistic, given the number and quality, that sustaining two good launches per year by 2013 is well within our grasp.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to slide 29 to highlight upcoming regulatory and clinical milestones. As we know you do, we eagerly await FDA action on the prasugrel NDA. FDA action is also pending on the Byetta monotherapy indication and on Byetta labeling. We recently submitted our reply to the complete response letter we received from the FDA on Zyprexa LAI late last year and have received a six-month review.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, the FDA raised concerns about pharmacokinetic comparability data in our sBLAs for Erbitux in first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. We anticipate resubmitting the non-small cell lung cancer sBLA and responding to the head and neck cancer complete response letter in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Other potential milestones this year include: submission to the FDA for exenatide once weekly, and resubmission of Cymbalta for chronic pain in the U.S., both in this quarter; submitting arzoxifene to the FDA and presenting data from our large Phase III GENERATIONS trial; reporting Phase III results for dirucotide in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; reporting Phase III results from the DURATION-3 head-to-head superiority study of exenatide once weekly versus insulin glargine; initiating Phase III trials for our A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's disease; moving into the Phase III portion of our Phase II/III seamless, adaptive trial of our GLP-1 and presenting results from a separate Phase II study of the drug; and initiation of Phase III trials for ImClone's 11F8 and A12 for cancer.</p>
          <p>2009 is shaping up to be in an eventful year and one we are particularly excited about in the Lilly Research Laboratories and across our company.</p>
          <p>This concludes our prepared remarks, and now I will turn the call over to Phil for the question-and-answer session. Phil?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Steve, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the Byetta LAR filing, post the liraglutide panel. If you could talk about if the FDA has requested any incremental data or studies, if your filing is still on for the second quarter? And with that, assuming that's the case, when will your meeting be with the FDA in terms of finalizing that filing?</p>
          <p>And then I would -- also wanted to just follow up on the mGlu program and if you could talk about if you have a backup to 023, if that might be advancing at the same time as your plans to sort of do another Phase II program for 023. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Catherine, in response to your first question, on Byetta LAR, we have every intention of filing, on track. We are not in any way we believe impacted at this point by the liraglutide advisory committee meeting. These drugs need to be thought of separately. They're different. We will base our case on our clinical data as well as our pre-clinical tox data as that FNDA becomes adjudicated. So we don't see anything there. Obviously we can't anticipate what the FDA's thinking at this point, and clearly, there may be an impact, but at this point, we don't anticipate one. So we're on track there.</p>
          <p>With respect to -- and again, I point your attention to the robustness of the clinical data, the safety package that we've accumulated with Byetta itself, as well as the safety package on LAR.</p>

          <p>You were not asked to do anything further on carcinogenicity before the panel, nor have you been asked since the panel has concluded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The carcinogenicity studies on drugs are pretty pro forma. You do two-year tox studies, et cetera, and we're on track.</p>
          <p>With respect to mGluR, we certainly have a very robust backup program in this area. This is a platform. But I'd just remind you, we haven't given up by any means on the first molecule that's in clinical development. We did have a busted trial. We could not interpret the results because our positive comparator, in this case a very good drug called Zyprexa, did not separate adequately. This happens not infrequently in neuroscience trials, and I'd be glad to tell you why if you want to talk offline.</p>
          <p>We still believe in this molecule. It's very unique. It's hard to reconcile our initial Phase II data with the fact that this compound would not work. It does seem to be efficacious, and obviously we need to gather more data on both efficacy and safety. So we're still very enthusiastic about this molecule, and need to come back and do a good study.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just on Efient. I think you mentioned a couple times pre-launch expenses and pre-launch plans. First off, on the U.S., can you just comment as to whether the U.S. sales force has been fully trained and are you ready to launch it at any time?</p>
          <p>And can we just get an update on where you're at on enrollment in TRILOGY and timing for TRILOGY? And then just on the EU with Efient, can you just comment about the rollout? And then any kind of pricing benefit or premium pricing that you might have been able to attain in Germany and the UK market?</p>
          <p>And then since we do have Steve on the line, can you just provide some commentary on your own GLP-1, the long-acting GLP-1, and tox data on that? I think Roche commented earlier that some of the carcinogenicity data that has been seen with other compounds have not been seen with its own compound. Can you just comment maybe more specifically about your own fully-humanized compound? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Okay. John, this is Derica. In regards to our preparation for launch in the U.S., yes. The -- as soon as we receive approval, we are prepared to launch this product. The sales force has been fully trained. In regards to the EU, as you know, we've received approval there. We have launched in Germany and the UK, but it's still early to really comment on that in terms of results.</p>

          <p>With regard to your TRILOGY question, John, we have no plans, nor do we -- are we prepared to give updates with regards to the TRILOGYs trial in terms of enrollment largely due to competitive reasons. We choose not to give updates with regard to that trial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, on GLP-Fc, let me just make a couple of comments. First of all, we're not prepared to discuss our toxicology profile on that molecule. But I want to make one comment that relates both to it and exenatide LAR, and that is that when you do a two-year toxicology study, you do it at multiple, multiple doses and you usually try to get doses that are far in excess of what you would anticipate in human testing or human clinical use. That's to figure out exactly what your margin of safety is. Very carefully you have to then look at the exposures. Remember, two years in a rat or a mouse is equivalent to about three-quarters of a lifetime of a human being. And then extrapolate on exposures, blood levels, et cetera, to what your margin of safety might be.</p>
          <p>So until you see that data -- and this would apply for LAR, et cetera, as I've indicated earlier, and any of our GLP follow-up molecules -- you really don't know exactly what you have. But so far, GLP-Fc and our other GLP programs are on track. The clinical data is -- we're accumulating clinical data, and we're still very optimistic about this platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, really quickly, on your question on pricing in the EU, we definitely feel like the TRITON trial gave us a very strong package to have discussions with payers on the value that prasugrel can offer compared to current standard of care, particularly from savings that would accrue from having fewer heart attacks and things like stent thrombosis.</p>
          <p>So I think you're aware, we have launched at a premium, in both the UK and Germany, to the Plavix price. I think you're going to find as we have future launches overseas, there's a huge disparity in actual Plavix pricing market by market. So you're likely to see that you're going to have different percent premiums at which we launch prasugrel. Much of this is due to changes in exchange rate, for example, between the pound and the euro over the last couple of years. Also, things like the PPRS system in the UK, where companies essentially provide monies back to the government through price decreases on products that they select.</p>
          <p>So you may actually see in this case, I don't have the numbers with me for exact numbers, John, but the actual price, if you convert at current euro-pound exchange rates, is actually higher in Germany than it is in the UK for prasugrel, but the premiums to Plavix is actually less in that market.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a little bit more on the GLP-1s in the wake of liraglutide. Have you been able to -- have you assessed calcitonin status, or based on calcitonin levels, and then with the additional long-acting GLP-1 programs? And if you have, could you share with us that data?</p>
          <p>And secondly, maybe I missed it, but how much was Humalog, the international revenue impacted by foreign exchange specifically?</p>
          <p>And then just a quick one, on the pipeline chart. You have -- I noticed that these -- with the green arrows -- that the compounds have achieved milestones. Does that mean that we should be expecting a phase movement with those particular compounds in the not-too-distant future? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bert, I'll go ahead and try to handle your questions, and ask Steve and/or Derica to chime in as appropriate. My understanding is, for our GLP-1 program, that we'll be building in some of these measurements into the trials that we conduct, but I don't believe we have any data at this point in time to report out with calcitonin levels for our GLP-1-Fc, the lead GLP that we have.</p>
          <p>The Humalog FX impact, I can't provide that by specific product, but certainly I can say that if you look at the 5% negative FX impact that we had corporately, essentially that's all coming obviously from overseas, and a little less than half our sales overseas. So the actual overseas impact you can assume is a little more than double the 5%. That would be up or down depending on specific products, whether there's slightly more international sales, but roughly you're looking at that sort of low double-digit negative impact that we just had on the vast majority of our products.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. My questions relate to foreign exchange. I was hoping that you could talk on a little bit more detail about the gross margin benefit in the quarter and how we should think about gross margin progressing over the next couple of quarters sequentially? Should we assume that the gross margin declined sequentially from the peak in the first quarter of '09 because the benefit from FX will diminish as the inventory is sold through? So that's, I guess, my first question.</p>
          <p>And then separately, in terms of calculating the benefit to EPS, was basically half of the year-over-year EPS gain due to FX, and how should we think about FX next quarter? Should we be expecting a gain or a loss from FX on the earnings per share line in the second quarter of '09? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. David, this is Derica. Let me try to respond to your question. In regards to the FX impact and gross margin, let me just remind you that even without FX, at constant rates, we still had gross margin improvement or gross margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Now, it was further accelerated due to the benefit of FX in terms of our reevaluation of inventories. With you trying to project out for the remainder of the year, we do believe that Q1 represents a peak in terms of the gross margin improvement. We do not anticipate that we'll be able to sustain that level of gross margin for the remaining three quarters of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, in regards to trying to project forward on a quarter-by-quarter basis, as you're aware, remember we've moved away from giving quarterly guidance and so we -- I'm not prepared to break it down on a Q2 versus remainder of the year. What I can say also to your question about, if you look at the Q1 results, I think your question was about, did FX drive about half of the EPS improvement year over year? That's about -- you're in the ballpark there.</p>
          <p>We did highlight however on the slide that if you look at our business at constant rates, we had operating income growth of 19% in the quarter, based off of 8% revenue growth at constant rates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. So a couple of questions, just to follow up on Dave's question is, specifically with regard to the sequence, you didn't raise the guidance obviously. I guess the implied spending increases would be fairly dramatic relative to those changes. So again, even if half of the spend was coming from the gross margin, or the improvement came from the gross margin, it seems to me that only the upper end of that guidance could be achieved. So, I guess the question is, is why won't you at least raised the lower end of your guidance for the $4? To get to $4, it would almost imply you would have to do a major acquisition in order to drive that kind of a change.</p>
          <p>Also, just separately, a bigger-picture question related to corporate tax rate changes and some of the rumblings that we're getting out of Washington. I'm just wondering, John, if you can comment on the impact of -- or basically the potential impact on Lilly that changes to foreign tax deferrals and a foreign tax structure in terms of the -- where the -- where profits are domiciled? If you can comment on that? I know that there's a bill upcoming that may be introduced by Representative Rangel, and obviously the Administration has sort of suggested some guidelines to Congress. Just wondering how you see that progressing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seamus, this is Derica. Let me try to address both your questions. Coming back to your follow-up question around FX and how to look at our guidance for the year, we still feel very good about the $4 to $4.25 guidance range that we provided, and we still believe it's relevant for our business at this time. As you've heard from our call text that we reiterated earlier, if you look, going forward, some events that we expect to happen in the last nine months of year is, one, we do not believe that the FX benefit that we saw in gross margin in Q1 will sustain itself for the remaining nine quarters -- remaining nine months.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we also have the generic Gemzar erosion that we're anticipating for markets, key markets, outside of the U.S. The generic primarily came on the market in Europe on March 9. So, you get to see the full effect of that in Q1. And then yes, we also are planning for the continual launches of prasugrel, both in the U.S. as we receive approval, as well as within Europe and key international markets.</p>
          <p>And, as Steve talked about, we've got 61 medicines in clinical stage of development, and we're still planning on progressing those medicines through our development cycle. So all of that added up says that we believe we'll be somewhere in the range that we've provided.</p>
          <p>Now regards to your second question, in terms of corporate tax rate. Yes, we're very aware of the discussions that are being had around the outlook, and everything that we've heard, or at least up to this date, is that it looks like it's less of possibility in '09, but maybe more of a possibility of some type of tax reform in 2010.</p>
          <p>That being said, the current proposal that's on the table, if deferral was repealed and removed, yes, it would have a detrimental impact on the -- both the cash flows and the bottom line of Lilly. But that would also be true for all U.S. multinationals that are operating on a global basis. So we are actively discussing this and providing our input where we can on what we think is -- that would be the proper tax reform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seamus, a couple of comments quickly as well on Gemzar, both in Europe as well as internationally. As Derica mentioned, we did lose our patent exclusivity on the 6th of March. Generics came into some of the European markets on the 9th. So right now it's not clear to us exactly how much volume the generics have in total to be able to penetrate the European market, let alone the international market. So we're monitoring that situation pretty closely as you would imagine.</p>
          <p>We have seen more significant price erosion than we would have anticipated in the markets where the generics have come in. So again, it's very early days, both in Europe and internationally. but to give you an idea of what we have at stake, to a certain extent, you had about $600 million in European sales last year of Gemzar, and about 1 billion internationally.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. First, on the wholesaler impact on the quarter, I think for a number of products you mentioned a favorable benefit. Can you just talk about the net impact on wholesaler moves in the quarter? And maybe more importantly, heading out to next quarter, is this stuff we expect to come out next quarter, or are we at normal levels at this point?</p>
          <p>And then a second question, animal health. I'm just thinking about the economic sensitivity of that business, ex-U.S. I know currency was a factor there, but seems like you're seeing limited organic growth for that business. Just any color there might be great? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Chris, this is Derica. I'll take both of those. The wholesaler inventory stock, we referenced in call text was pretty much, for the most part, immaterial in the quarter. So it's not really driving the 5% volume growth or the 3% overall performance sales growth. So I don't anticipate there being a shift in the remaining quarters of the year. We have seen, even going back to 2008, the -- at least in the U.S., the wholesalers working to carry lower levels of inventory. Okay?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in regard to your question regarding animal health and any sensitivity to the current economic conditions, we still feel very good about that the growth we're getting out of animal health, and our companion animal business is doing very well. We also are seeing good growth at our food animal business, but that, from an economic standpoint, that's where we are tending to see the bigger impact, and that impact has been seen more by the producers reducing the size of their herd. And so therefore, in some cases showing the need to use less product in terms of productivity enhancement products. But for the most part, it's been managed well at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, this is Ronika. Just to add a little bit more to Derica's commentary. With regards to our O-U.S. side, we did start to see a bit of a downturn relative to the global downturn in our sales there, and also regards to our O-U.S. -- or excuse -- our U.S. sales, we actually saw it impact from the Q4 buy-ahead. We had mentioned last call that we had a Q3 benefit, a buy-ahead benefit, and we saw a downturn in Q4. Not all products were allowed to buy ahead in that Q3 timeframe. Some were bought ahead in Q4. That then negatively impacted our Q1 '09 numbers as well.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple product-specific questions, if I may. So Gemzar was also off in the U.S., in the single-digit range. Can you explain why that product may be declining?</p>
          <p>And on the wholesaler buying patterns, you guys mentioned it in relation to Cialis, that product's showing 21% U.S. growth. Given that that's a real consumer-sensitive product, could you talk about how much Cialis was related to wholesaler buying, and how much was related to actual underlying demand?</p>
          <p>And just a quick follow-up, on the cost of goods. I think about the base of COGS, it's somewhere around a billion dollars. It looked like you had about a $200 million benefit in the quarter. Again, that's based off of my assumptions. That's 20%. So you guys talked about -- Derica, you talked about improvement in cost of goods despite favorable foreign exchange. Can you piece that out a little bit for us? Can you talk about how much of the benefit, and whether or not my baseline $200 million assumption is about correct? How much of that benefit was actual cost of goods improvement versus foreign exchange? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me -- David, try to -- I'll start with the COGS and I'll work my way back the other way. In regards to the COGS, if I -- if you look at a constant FX view that we've provided in the slide, where we had 8% revenue growth, our COGS grew about 7%. So you can do the calculation there in terms of trying to weed out the net FX benefit there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you look at Gemzar and your question about Gemzar performance in the U.S., Gemzar we actually saw the effect the other way. We actually saw a de-stocking for Gemzar in the U.S., and that's deflated the growth for Gemzar sales in the U.S. in Q1.</p>
          <p>For Cialis, in regards to the underlying trends there, it really wasn't driven by wholesaler buying patterns. If you look at Cialis over the last 12 months, we've gained in the U.S. about 2.3 percentage points of market share improvement versus our competitors. And so, we've had really good strong underlying demand, and we continue to gain share against our competitors.</p>

          <p>Okay. Let me -- hopefully I got all the questions down right, so if I miss one, Roopesh, let me know. Once again, we're not providing quarterly guidance. But if you look at our guidance for the total year, what we've stated is that, even on a total-year basis, we still expect expanding or improving gross margin, and that outlook has not changed. We do not believe, once again, that the benefit seen in Q1 will last for the remaining nine months. Part of this is also trying to predict what FX rates are for the last nine months, and who -- I don't have that crystal ball here today.</p>
          <p>In regards to your last question around the bottom-line impact, what we've stated is that, if you look at on the slide, at constant rates, we had 19% improvement in operating income. And I think there was a previous question and we said, well, if look at the total growth of the bottom line, about half of that you could attribute to FX benefit. I'd say that puts you somewhere in the right ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roopesh, another way to think of FX, if in fact, as you suggest, we're in a scenario where rates stay where they are, essentially you would never have a negative impact coming from the foreign inventory, those international inventories. What you would see is the benefit that we had to cost of sales this quarter would go down rather quickly and then essentially stay at zero. Okay?</p>
          <p>The other piece then is the FX impact on our international income, or margin, that piece, as you would expect, as you would have seen also in the topline results, was actually negative in Q1, and based on current rates, if we were to stay here, you'd probably have a relatively similar impact in Qs 2 and 3 before it would moderate pretty substantially in Q4, based on how quickly rates moved in the last part of last year. Does that help a little bit?</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Related to the big favorable foreign exchange impact on inventories, I'm presuming that you fully expected this to occur when you gave your 2009 guidance back in December. If you can confirm that, please.</p>
          <p>And then an R&amp;D question. On slide 28, you showed 19 products that could launch between 2012 and 2015. We haven't seen data on many of these compounds. So it would be very helpful if you could focus our attention on the two to three compounds that you're most excited about or that you have the highest confidence in.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tim, for -- in terms of the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year, we did anticipate some benefit from FX, and that was based upon where we saw rates emerging as we went through the fourth quarter. But we did not anticipate this magnitude, because at that point in time, the dollar wasn't trading where it is today. So the dollar has moved beyond what we initially had estimated back in November and December timeframe, when we initially provided our guidance in New York.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tim, I'll point your attention to a number of molecules. Let me remind that we've established proof of concept in Phase II for the vast majority of our compounds, whether you've seen or not. So we're quite encouraged by the probabilities, given that this is principally a game of attrition. But you've seen data on the BAFF antibody, that's LA-294. IL-17, both those look really good.</p>
          <p>We're still very excited about the GLP platform. The once-weekly GLP-1 type compounds including LAR and our next generation molecules. The ImClone 1121b and 11F8. I think the VEGFR2 compound is a very exciting molecule where we've seen hints of efficacy, if you will, that are quite encouraging. I'm not at all discouraged by mGluR23, even though we had a busted trial, as I indicated earlier. And again, I'd point your attentions to the two soon-to-be Phase III molecules in the area of Alzheimer's disease, our gamma secretase inhibitor and our A-beta antibody.</p>
          <p>Others on there look pretty interesting to us. Hopefully we'll be presenting some data soon on Tasisulam, iGluR5, and our sleep-promoting agent, the Hypnion molecule. I'm pretty excited about most of them, and again, the data will tell the story.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Derica, I'm just wondering if you could comment on the U.S. price increases which were 7% overall this quarter, compared to 4% overall for 2008, and just -- if you can just sort of talk about strategically what's going on? I'm just wondering if that is an offset to -- perhaps are you seeing significant changes at national plan level or PBMs with respect to biological and specialty drugs which you are highly exposed to? Just, if you could talk about what's going there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jami. Our price increases that you saw in the first quarter results, in terms of list price, is pretty much consistent with what the level of price increases that you -- actual list price increases that you've seen over the last four quarters. So there really was no change there.</p>
          <p>The primary driver behind the 7% versus what you've seen historically is that, as we have various plans, with managed care as well as Medicaid and Medicare, we're constantly having to true up our accrual balances, our provisions on our balance sheet for those ongoing liabilities, and as we do that, sometimes, if we have to adjust those accruals down, that results in terms of a benefit to pricing, and that's what you're seeing in the 7% in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jami, a couple of things to keep in mind. In Q4 2007, we began to have additional accruals for the impact of a final rule that came through on DRA. We quantified that as about a 1% of sales in the U.S. impact. That would have been a negative drag essentially for Q4 '07 through Q3 of '08. That's now essentially come off with Q4 of '08 and Q1 of this year.</p>
          <p>We also started in February of 2008 to have some accruals for additional rebates that we anticipated would need to be paid to TRICARE beneficiaries, as they have their prescriptions filled at off-base essentially types of pharmacies, retail pharmacies. That started in February of '08. You're beginning to see that come out essentially of the pricing deduction.</p>
          <p>So, as Derica mentioned, not a fundamental shift at all in the underlying list prices, but some of the other dynamics are actually letting a bit more of those list price increases come through in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>We'll go ahead and take one more caller, and then I'll turn it over to Derica to wrap up the earnings call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Regarding the 2009 guidance range, among the factors to consider, you did not mention at-risk launches of either Evista and/or Gemzar in the U.S. Is that a factor why you have not changed the range, or would an at-risk launch lead to a cut in the guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, this is Derica. The -- an at-risk launch of Evista is not built into the guidance that we provided of $4 to $4.25, nor have we also built anything in for the pending Gemzar trial in the U.S. as well. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With that being as the final question, maybe you'd let me try to close off the call here. And I want to begin by first thanking you for taking your time this morning for this update on Eli Lilly and Company. We appreciate your interest in our company. Now let me close by emphasizing a few key points.</p>
          <p>I believe we are off to a strong start for 2009. For the quarter, we delivered strong operating financial results, with volume-driven revenue growth, continued leverage between growth and revenue and operating expenses, an increase in gross margin percent, and strong operating cash flows. We remain confident that this type of financial performance provides the resources necessary to build a robust pipeline to drive future growth, to effectively deal with the patent expirations coming in the next decade, and to respond to a increasingly challenging healthcare environment.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we have staked our future on innovation, leveraging our 2007 and 2008 pipeline progression with a strong 2009 start as we move four compounds into Phase II testing, and we move four compounds into Phase I testing.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we at Lilly are excited about the remainder of 2009. It should be an eventful year, with a number significant milestones and decisions. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Thank you.</p>
