          <p>Dear, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to E.ON First Quarter Results 2012. At our customer's request, this conference will be recorded. As a reminder all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>May I now hand you over to Mr. Sascha Bibert, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead this conference. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter results. Today, we have reported a good set of numbers, confirming the headline earnings we have pre-released a few days ago. The pre-release was due to our interpretation of the German Ad Hoc Regulation. In general, all relevant information which might have a significant influence on the share price need to be published immediately. Criteria that are used in such an assessment include deviations against expectations but also against prior year. With underlying net income up 27%, and a similar gap against the first market expectations we had at that point in time, we decided that the criteria was fulfilled and an ad hoc release was necessary.</p>
          <p>With respect to the presentation, you would have noticed a slight change in the order of the slides used for this conference call. During his comments, Marcus will focus on the key developments for the group, while the detailed segment discussion has been moved into the backup.</p>
          <p>At the same time, two new slides has been added giving some color on our operating environment, as well as key developments we expect to be relevant in the further development of the year.</p>
          <p>With that I hand over to our CFO, Marcus Schenck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, also from my side. Thank you for joining Sascha and myself to this quarterly results call. As Sascha said, the first quarter 2012 was a good start into the year for our company with EBITDA up 9% to &#x20AC;3.8 billion, underpinning our basic stance that we have passed through the trough in 2011.</p>
          <p>On a constant portfolio basis, i.e. adjusting basically for the disposal of UK Central Networks last year, the increase is even more pronounced, namely about 15%. I will run you through the detail drivers of Group EBITDA at a later stage.</p>
          <p>Underlying EPS increased by 27% to almost $0.90 for this first quarter. Operating cash flow was down 51% to &#x20AC;0.4 billion, however, this is solely driven by a single technical effect. I will as usual explain this position in more detail later on, however, just one remark already at this stage. This development is a result of an extraordinary withholding tax payment, which we have to make in the first quarter. We expect to fully recoup it in the second half of the year with subsequent positive implications for operating cash flow and of course also net debt.</p>
          <p>As usual, Q1 was characterized by relatively muted investment activity, with group CapEx unchanged at &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Hence, the main reason for the increase in economic net debt was the weaker operating cash flow, driven by the aforementioned tax payment and also by increased pension provisions. In light of this positive first quarter, we confirm our outlook for the full year 2012.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, commodity and power prices were moved by essentially two key events. First of all, the cold spell in Europe and then secondly continued tensions in the Middle East. The latter, had an especially pronounced impact on the oil markets with a barrel of oil, which started the year at around $110 peaking at $125, with the climax of the tensions with Iran.</p>
          <p>Core markets were not impacted by the political situation in the Middle East. A ton of API2 started the year at $117 heading down to the low U.S. $111 in sync with the initially warm winter in Europe. At the end of the quarter, prices were back at levels as of early January.</p>
          <p>These overall relatively low coal prices, from our perceptive, can be explained mainly by volumes coming from the U.S. where cheap shale gas makes gas-fire generation more competitive, leading to less coal-based power generation and consequently excess coal volumes being pushed into the Atlantic basin.</p>
          <p>European gas in the forward markets showed a clear upward trend in the first quarter, starting the year at &#x20AC;26 per megawatt hour, the one year forward increased to over &#x20AC;28 in March. The drivers that we see for this development were the cold spell in February in Europe, the continued tight situation in Japan, reduced LNG availability and then finally also the Elgin-Franklin outage in the British North Sea.</p>
          <p>CO2 showed an interim rally in anticipation of positive results from political process around the introduction of an EU-wide energy efficiency directive. The initial plan of the Commission was to include a CO2 set aside for the third phase of the trading into the overall package. Positive sentiment, therefore, moved the price up to &#x20AC;10 per ton, only to end the quarter at the level where it started the year when it became clear that your position against the directive is currently too strong.</p>
          <p>In the Central European power markets, power prices also saw an interim rally, fueled by the cold spell in February. This did not have a lasting impact on prices for 2013 where the quarter then ended where it started, basically, at a price below &#x20AC;52 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Now some words on the cold spell that I mentioned several times so far. During the first two weeks in February, Europe was hit by a period of cold weather, with temperatures being 5 to 7 degrees Celsius below average for several days. In particular, in France, we saw the highest demand ever, more than 100 gigawatts. During these days, the supply situation has been extremely tight.</p>
          <p>According to our analysis, Europe could cope with the situation only due to the extremely high availability of power plants. In average we experienced a higher degree of unplanned outages to the cold weather and prudent behavior of the market operators.</p>
          <p>At E.ON, for example, we managed to switch some of our gas plants to oil in order to cope with a gas import shortage from Russia that was announced at the same time. In a nutshell, Europe managed to keep lights on and houses warm but in the last decade the supply situation was never as tight as in February.</p>
          <p>In the Nordic markets, area prices moved down &#x20AC;1 per megawatt hour in the course of the quarter to end up at around &#x20AC;40 per megawatt hour for the 2013 delivery, also with the interim peak on the back of the cold spell. The hydro situation by now is extremely good this year, with reservoir levels being at peak levels.</p>
          <p>So finally to our hedging. As you will notice, not a lot happens for the years 2012 and 2013 as we were already well hedged both in Nordic as well as Central Europe for those years. This is different for the year 2014. Sufficient liquidity allowed us to advance our hedge ratios in both market areas. The increase, for example, in the Central European region from 20% to 30% hedged as per year end 2011 to 60% to 70% hedged as per end of the quarter. While this has led to a slight reduction of the average key price from &#x20AC;55 down to &#x20AC;54, I would consider this a very good result, compared to currently traded forward prices.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn over to our operations. Exploration and production is one of the key earnings drivers for the coming years. In the current year, we are however experiencing challenges in our North Sea operations. As I'm sure you have heard, the last UK field Elgin-Franklin, which is operated by Total and which is 5.2% co-owned by E.ON, the field had to stop production due to a gas leak. Total is the final stages of preparing the kill well operation. Execution of the relief wells is progressing according to plan but the completion of these wells will take several months.</p>
          <p>We are also experiencing challenges with our participation in the new oil and gas field, Skarv in Norway, which we are developing with BP as the operator. Weather conditions in the winter and early spring have not been favorable and made the installation of the risers basically impossible. Risers are those pipes connecting the wellheads on the sea floor with the FPSO. By now, eight out of the required 13 risers have been installed. There are also problems with getting government approval for use of planned staff capacity offshore during the installation phase.</p>
          <p>We're now hoping for more stable, i.e. quiet weather conditions in the spring and summer months and are actively trying to solve the staff capacity issue. This mentioned problems are the main reason for the delay of the planned operation start of Skarv into the fourth quarter, according to the operator BP.</p>
          <p>L&#xFC;bz is one of our key strategic growth areas and an area where we are committing substantial amount of new capital. Therefore, I'm happy to report that we saw very good first quarter, in terms of wind load factors across the board. The net load factor of our whole wind fleet improved from 30.4% to 36.8%. This was a result of good wind availability but also of further improved average availability. The contribution to this performance also came from offshore wind in Europe. Here we registered good net load factors improving from 39.3% to numbers as high as 45.1%. For instance, the availability of our Nordic offshore fleet was almost 99% in this period.</p>
          <p>In our conventional Generation business, we have been experiencing problems with our Brokdorf nuclear power plant, which is currently in an unplanned extended maintenance shutdown. After finding some broken fuel rod springs in one of the cooling ponds of our Brokdorf nuclear power station, we are currently checking the situation regarding the condition of these fuel rod springs in the reactor's core. While the situation did not have an impact on the first quarter results, we're expecting the full year impact of this to be in the range of low to mid-double digit million euros.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, I would like to talk about another important pillar of our strategy, which is the outside Europe expansion. Here we have made a significant step ahead with the signing of the deal with MPX on the creation of a joint venture company, which is foreseen to build 11 gigawatt of new capacity for the Brazilian market in this decade. After the initial basic agreement from January, this marks the conclusion of the negotiations, including an agreement on the organizational structure.</p>
          <p>At this stage, we can confirm all the operational principles outlined at the start of the year. To finalize the establishment of the joint venture some financial and legal steps will have to be concluded. The strategic work has already started and the two companies expect all outstanding actions to be completed by June 2012, hence, we do expect the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the developments of group EBITDA in the first quarter and compare it to the first quarter of 2011. And let's start with the negatives. The largest negative impact was in our nuclear power portfolio. Here we have to differentiate between two effects: Firstly, we saw the impact of last year's shutdowns of the power plant Isar 1 and Unterweser, which were still producing in Q1 of 2011.  These 4 terawatt hours that now fell away in Q1 of 2012 and that basically leads to a loss in margins in Q1 of this year. Secondly, we mainly saw the impact of falling average achieved power prices for the Central European outright portfolio.</p>
          <p>The second negative, albeit far not so prominent, is the expected reduction of Q1 profitability at our E&amp;P operation. Here, mainly the low availability of the Njord and Rita fields takes its toll.</p>
          <p>Now to the positives. The by far biggest swing comes from our Supply and Sales business, which manages the long-term gas contracts. Last year's first quarter was severely burdened by this business because at that time we did not have any renegotiation success in the numbers.</p>
          <p>Supply and Sales lost around &#x20AC;470 million in Q1 of 2011 as basically 100% of the non-spot related volumes sourced from our long-term contracts were based on too high oil-linked prices. Since then, we have successfully renegotiated roughly two-thirds of these volumes. The reflection of these renegotiations is the &#x20AC;340 million improvement of EBITDA at Supply and Sales.</p>
          <p>In this context, please remember that our renegotiation with Statoil became effective as of January 1 this year. And, again, to avoid misunderstanding we are reporting Supply and Sales now within the optimization line in the segment Optimization and Trading.</p>
          <p>Also within the gas business, we recorded a one-off gain from the revaluation of three participations in the context of separating Open Grid Europe. Proprietary trading improved compared to the weak first quarter of 2011. And in the UK we saw a net positive effect of &#x20AC;20 million. This is essentially the net result of two bigger movements.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we observed the deconsolidation of UK Central Networks, which had contributed a positive &#x20AC;170 million still through the first quarter of last year. Remember, it was deconsolidated with the effect from 1 of April 2011 on.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we saw a slightly higher positive effect from the improvement of margins in our UK sales business. This peak year-on-year delta was the result of a weak first quarter at UK sales in 2011 and price increases, which took effect later on in this year &#x2013; later on in the year.</p>
          <p>These higher prices positively impacted two of the three months of this year's first quarter. Our 6% cut of electricity prices took effect as per end of February. Therefore, the remainder of the year is expected to be far less outstanding in terms of year-on-year performance. Also, we will see additional cost for energy efficiency measures during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Russia profited mainly from the contribution of new power plants, which were commissioned in the later course of 2011. The remaining positive delta is mainly related to an improvement of the other consolidation position at group level.</p>
          <p>On the following Slides 5 and 6, we reconcile as usual the net income starting from EBITDA. Our economic net interest expense was basically unchanged. Net book gains came down strongly compared to last year. Last the position benefited predominantly from the disposal of the remaining Gazprom shares.</p>
          <p>Restructuring improved compared to Q1 of 2011 and in this context please remember that we booked a large restructuring provision in the fourth quarter last year. Our reported tax rate of 20%, compared to 22% in Q1 of 2011, came down slightly. This is mainly a reflection of the weaker earnings development especially related to the situation in exploration and production.</p>
          <p>Just like in Q1 2011, nothing to comment on for this quarter in terms of discontinued operations. Central Networks are larger &#x2013; or last larger disposal was still fully reflected in last year's first quarter results and deconsolidated quickly as the deal closed very fast.</p>
          <p>Moving on the reconciliation of underlying net income. In the underlying net income the positive impact of the EBITDA improvement feeds through fully to the net income line, with depreciation and net interest basically unchanged. The additional improvement at the net income level is driven by the lower taxes.</p>
          <p>Let me now run you through the development of our operating cash flow on Chart number 8. Starting from the &#x20AC;900 million of operating cash flow in Q1 2011, the first effect is the higher cash-effective EBITDA. Then we see a group of working capital effects, partially related to the current period, partially to developments in Q1 of last year.</p>
          <p>Let me take them one by one. In the UK we reduced our coal inventories. This is driven by the biomass conversion of the plant Ironbridge and lower production at the Kingsnorth plant. Then at Optimization and Trading, we reduced coal as well as gas inventories and we also increased the payables in gas procurement.</p>
          <p>In Russia and Czechia we had negative working capital effects last year, which we mentioned in previous calls caused by regulatory changes which were not repeated this year.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we have a timing issue with passing on higher EEG costs to the final customer. The UK pension funding effect also relates to last year where we have to put additional cash into the fund. The lower interest payments relate mostly to the early redemption fees, which we paid for the buyback of E.ON bonds last year.</p>
          <p>So before I come to the &#x20AC;1.6 billion tax effect, we observed a quite material improvement in operating cash flow to a level of &#x20AC;2.1 million, which is roughly a 130% increase over the Q1 2011 number.</p>
          <p>Now, what is this &#x20AC;1.6 billion tax payment? In the context of our 2011 full year accounts of the E.ON AG, we distributed dividend from certain subsidiaries to the AG. This causes a prepayment on E.ON's overall tax declaration for 2011. We expect to fully recoup these payments in the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Now to our debt situation on Chart number 9. Compared to the position shown for fiscal year-end 2011, our economic net debt has increased by &#x20AC;1.2 billion. And here are the key moving parts. Group CapEx was unchanged compared to the prior year's first quarter at a level of &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Over 50% of the quarter's investments came from Renewables and Generation with Renewables responsible for 30% of Q1 CapEx. We currently have almost 1.8 gigawatt of capacity under construction in our Renewables business.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow for the reasons I mentioned, came in 51% below the Q1 2011 figure and only contributed &#x20AC;0.4 billion to the debt reduction. Divestments amounted to a positive &#x20AC;0.2 billion, pension provisions increased by &#x20AC;0.7 billion, with the main drivers here being the reduction of the benchmark bond yields, leading to a lower discount rate in Germany, where we see a 50 basis point reduction. Other effects added up to a positive of &#x20AC;0.1 billion.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight again at this stage that the very negative development of the operating cash flow, which is a main factor behind the overall net debt increase, is driven by factors that we expect to reverse in the course of the remainder of the year, putting the net debt development on a clear downwards trends.</p>
          <p>Now finally to the outlook. We are confirming our 2012 EBITDA and underlying net income outlook. We continued to see EBITDA to come out in the flat &#x20AC;9.6 billion to &#x20AC;10.2 billion range and we also confirmed the &#x20AC;2.3 billion to &#x20AC;2.7 billion range for the underlying net income for 2012.</p>
          <p>With regard to the individual segment outlook, I would like to highlight that we do see a certain risk for E&amp;P. The reasons behind this uncertainty I have explained earlier in the call. Just to remind you we have uncertainty on the timing of the restart of Elgin, as well as the actual start of production at Skarv.</p>
          <p>For both cases, we expect more clarity by August when we comment on our half year numbers. By then it should be clear if Total was successful with the top kill of the leaking well at Elgin and further progress on the completion of Skarv including the situation regarding utilization of the planned staff capacity at Skarv.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we have decided to provide you with a worst case indication. Should both fields not produce at all in the remainder of 2012, our total 2012 North Sea oil and gas production is expected at around 7 million barrels of oil equivalent. The planned production of around 38 MBOE from Yuzhno Russkoye in Russia remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks and I will now hand back to Sascha.</p>

          <p>Thanks Marcus. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&amp;A, so please register the questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now being our question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Vincent Gilles from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions and a request. I'll start with the request to make myself popular. Can you please make sure you don't change the reporting in the next quarter? It would be nice because it's all a bit complex to understand where your gas earnings are going.</p>
          <p>But assuming I understand what you talked about, my question is could you help us extend to the full year the delta of &#x20AC;340 million that you talked about for the first quarter in terms of renegotiation of gas contract. And maybe extend the discussion a bit on the real impact of if you succeed or do not succeed in renegotiating your contract with Gazprom? And then, maybe update us a bit on the amount of loss we should expect for 2012 and 2013? So that's a long question but I guess it's a simple one.</p>
          <p>The second one is on &#x2013; very simple on the tax rate. Given the very low tax rate in the first quarter, should we assume that you will be below the 30%, 31% you indicated at the fiscal year 2011? Or should we assume that it's going to still stay as close to the 30%? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the second question. I could not understand the first question acoustically. But Sascha believes he understood what you were asking. On the tax rate, in our outlook we still assume a tax rate at around 30%. The one item I would like to highlight is that if some of the risk on the E&amp;P side materializes that will of course have some negative impact on EBITDA but it's at the same time will most likely have a positive effect on the tax rate. So on an EPS basis, a negative development on the E&amp;P side is slightly dampened.</p>
          <p>The first question I believe was related to gas but I just couldn't understand it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Then &#x2013; so I give it a start and then Marcus puts the finishing points to it. You started by talking about the EBITDA delta for Supply and Sales, which is indeed to the tune of &#x20AC;340 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we told you that our expectations for gas Supply and Sales 2012 is inline with what we have reported in 2011, i.e. negative to the tune of &#x20AC;700 million to 800 million absolute, i.e. a delta of zero, which means that if you want to align the first quarter with full year that delta of positive &#x20AC;340 million will level out to zero in the full year. And then to the Gazprom negotiations, Marcus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe just a bit. Please bear in mind that last year we recouped in the second quarter some of the losses that we had incurred earlier. The situation with Gazprom is I would say as we reported in the context of our pre-results we still have sort of two routes that are being pursued. One is the arbitration proceedings, which we expect to come to an end around the end of the year or early next year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are continuing to have discussions with Gazprom outside arbitration proceedings. These discussions are constructive whether or not they will lead to an outcome we will have to see. And I think this is what we can &#x2013; only thing we can continue to reiterate at this stage. Ex, of course, to the point and for sake of clarity, in our outlook, we are &#x2013; segment &#x2013; not assuming any result from an arbitration or a negotiated solution with Gazprom.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Now we can hear you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry about that. I beg your pardon. And just a follow-up on gas, if the gas price worsened, what will be impact on the profitability of the two-thirds of the contracts, which are already re-negotiated? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, as you point out, you dramatically increased your hedging for 2014, both in Central Europe and Nordic. Am I right in deducing that you've done that because you are bearish on coal prices and/or you believe there is no chance for carbon set aside? So if that's correct, can you enlighten us to why you are bearish on coal prices? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On your first question, basically the development of the gas oil spreads during the remainder of the year has hardly any material impact for us. We only have a very small two digits terawatts our open position there. So it's no meaningful impact. On the power hedging for 2014, quite frankly, what happened here was we observed and to a large extent that was in January and then also partially in the context of the coal spread quite a lot of liquidity in the markets, and we just took advantage of that. Now I would say by now, from my perspective, that looks not to unintelligent what we did during that time, but it was really not that much driven by us taking kind of a very bearish view on the developments, we just saw the liquidity and took advantage of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you should not interpret this is us being bearish on the coal price that would be a wrong interpretation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good, can I just pick you up on one thing you had mentioned before to Vincent? You said you expect the arbitration to be through by the end of this year, beginning next year. Is that &#x2013; is there a specific date or something you can hang your hat on there? Or is it just sort of general feel? Because there's always seemed to be a sort of loose interpretation there will be arbitration which finishes some time in 2013, but now you seem to be a bit more specific on timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, I mean, first of all, there is an understanding between the two parties as to how long its supposed to take and then by now it is driven by the time table that the three arbitrators are setting and that is pointing to a resolution in this time window that I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everybody, two questions please. A couple of weeks ago you gave an interview to the German Boersen-Zeitung and you were saying or you were quoted saying that you have identified further potential asset disposal candidates and that the &#x20AC;15 billion target could well be exceeded. Could you just add a bit more color on that? What kind of assets you're thinking about? And what order of magnitude we're talking about here?</p>
          <p>And second question you probably have already met the analysts from the rating and credit rating agencies in the past few weeks and might have a certain feel what could happen and what is unlikely to happen. Could you just share with us your latest thoughts on your credit rating and the meeting you have had so far? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on your first question regarding the &#x20AC;15 billion, basically I made that statement in the context of the observation that when you actually look at what is publicly known by now, namely that, yes, indeed, we are working on a disposal of Open Grid Europe, yes, we are working on disposal of Energy from Waste; and yes, we are having discussions on E.ON Westfalen Weser and there's maybe also a few other things, if you add up all of that that was in the observation of the journalist, which was not entirely incorrect, you might very well end up north &#x20AC;15 billion. And that's the only thing that I confirmed; that indeed it might be that we end up north of &#x20AC;15 billion.</p>
          <p>This is not a function of us now having gone out and we sort of proactively look for more things. We have always said that we will achieve the &#x20AC;15 billion and we also always said that we also feel comfortable about this because we have multiple options, in terms of what we can do. Now if we see attractive opportunities, strategically and financially, to exit an asset, we will pursue this. And by now, I would say I can't rule out that we might exceed the &#x20AC;15 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But there's nothing that has basically of the &#x2013; another portfolio read you whatsoever would have become on top on your disposal list or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, yeah, so this is how I think you should think about the &#x20AC;15 billion. Now, as it relates to the conservations with the rating agencies, we are basically in the process of the normal annual conservation with them. There is nothing spectacular to report about this. We made it clear that we are comfortable to be able to achieve the disposal program. Clearly, an important topic in the discussion is our ability to execute our cost-cutting program, which we laid out in more detail to them, gave them an update on where that stands. And clearly, I think what also matters here is our continued commitments to take the debt factor down to a level below three times. And so I have nothing spectacular to report about this.</p>
          <p>I mean, it's clear from the discussion with the rating agencies that during the last 12, 18 months their assessment of the sector as such has gone in a direction where they look at it in a sort of more careful way, let me put it this way. You've seen it recently and it was also a case for E.ON that, in particular, when they think about the business profile of a company in our sector they tend to take a sort of a more cautious perspective here, but this is something that I would say we have already been impacted by that. Others have more recently been impacted by that, so, again nothing exciting to be reported about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would add in terms of the risk assessment what is obviously also supporting the discussions that we have with them is any progress we have made or we will make in the future when it comes to the gas renegotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you and good afternoon. Two questions, please. First one, back to Gazprom, do you still view the recovery of the past losses since Q4 2010 as a pre-condition for any deal with Gazprom?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to the still quite weak situation on the key spots pricing at Continental Europe, can you update to us on your plans to do some power plants mothballing is in your future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The answer to your first question is, yes, of course. We clearly see the recovery of past losses as a core, if not the core ingredient to any solution there.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the development, I mean, the poor development of the spec portfolio and more specifically there certain power plants, which by now don't look really profitable, basically, I can only reiterate what we have been saying, namely we are now &#x2013; we are doing analysis on a plant-by-plant basis. And I would expect that in a number of markets that will lead to specific actions. But we will of course first discuss this or communicate this to the relevant authorities and inform them. But that is kind of the normal process that we are now entering into. And of course, I will not speculate here about how many and which power plants; that would not be a smart and might also lead the market in a certain direction, which of course we can't do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions from me, firstly, on your E&amp;P business. Could you give some indications of how you expect profitability at Yuzhno Russkoye to develop this year, given higher oil indexed pricing in the pricing formula? And also if you &#x2013; once you renegotiate your Gazprom contract, would that have a negative impact on profitability at Yuzhno? So that's kind of question, number one. And question number two was could you just remind us what the benefits of going from an AG to an SE are please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, well, first of all, on Yuzhno Russkoye, production volumes we expect to be at last year's level. And as it relates to profitability for the full year, last year, we were around &#x20AC;460 million and we would expect that to slightly improve on the back of better prices. And the negotiations on the long-term contracts with Gazprom have nothing to do with Yuzhno Russkoye. They are absolutely not correlated and as actually never been mentioned by anyone in the conversations.</p>
          <p>Now the advantages from moving from an AG to an SE, I mean, in the main advantage that we see is that it is much better reflection of who we really are. You will see this, for example, when you just will observe who will be represented in our Supervisory Board, where we will continue to have also employee representatives but they will now be sourced, not just from one country, but from basically all the countries that represent E.ON. We find this way more appropriate because we are no longer just a German company. When you look at actually where the growth is coming from it is clearly predominantly from outside this country. So that's one of the big points that we see. There is no real cost in establishing the SE. We think it also allows us to create a Supervisory Board size, which we think will be more effective going forward in its discussion and challenging of the Management board and those I would say are the main reasons.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Mr. Alexander Karnick  from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just following onto the Skarv and Eglin problems, I mean, you gave a number of volume downside, which you can make a calculation; it's maybe &#x20AC;300 million on the top line. But what I was after is what sort of this top-line effect, whatever you come out in your calculation, would that be fully an effect on EBITDA? Or could you confirm that part of the costs at this year are related to actual production, so that the EBITDA impact is probably lower than the top line? And may be as a follow-up in that context, could you be more specific on the reduction of the group tax ratio, which sort of your worse case scenario would imply?</p>
          <p>And then, I would just ask the second question is on sort of your mothballing strategy. I appreciate you don't want to be specific for the obvious reasons, but would you confirm a view to say, look, if you're on the one-hand side trying to save &#x20AC;1.5 billion of cost through 2015, you would probably refrain from running stations that are clearly cash loss making and are far from returning into the money any time soon? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, on the last one, yes, I mean, that's the key driver of the analysis now and we will take action on those plans that we really see deeply out of the money.</p>
          <p>On your first question regarding Skarv, as you I think are indicating indeed the revenue loss will not be the same as the EBITDA loss. I mean, essence there was going to be a substantial delta between the two numbers, which is, yeah, 50% or so of that, not more.</p>
          <p>And then, as it relates to the group tax ratio, honestly speaking, here I prefer to really give an update when we have the clarity on the specific fields and we can do a reliable math. We depend &#x2013; I mean, the worst case scenario that I mentioned if that's really happens then the impact will be north of one percentage point, yeah, but whether it's then two or three percentage points here we still need to do the analysis.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I had a really follow-up on Skarv and Elgin-Franklin. The first question relates to some of the details you gave on Skarv with the riser issues and accommodation and government approval issues. First of all, can you confirm that you have enough capacity with contractors and the necessary vessels to meet the timetable to your satisfaction? And can you give a bit more color on what the issues with the government approvals are?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is just to clarify, you helpfully gave a worst case scenario for Skarv and Elgin-Franklin production. Am I right to assume that worst case scenario is included within the bottom end of your guidance range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Again, let me start with your last question. Yes, that is absolutely correct that is included in our range, which is why we see no reason to adjust our target range. We will in any case come out there when I look at the risk position in E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Now on the specific Skarv situation availability of vessels and what exactly the issues, with regard to governmental approval processes are here, I would actually prefer to refer you to BP. They are closer to this. I mean, we do understand that vessels are available. The other issue is under negotiation, but it's exclusively been dealt by British Petroleum. So before I do any speculation there and given we're not &#x2013; and particularly myself &#x2013; I'm not enough informed about this approval process there, I'd rather shy away from giving you an answer. And...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As a follow-up on that Skarv issue, I mean, in general, are you comfortable with the ratio of fields which you are the operator in to fields which you're not the operator in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, when you include Yuzhno Russkoye then, clearly, the vast majority of what we have we're not an operator, when we look at the &#x2013; when we carve out Yuzhno Russkoye, which is a bit of its own animal, I would say that's a mix that we feel comfortable with. Don't forget we are working in Algeria as well and we have the Huntington platform where we operate. So we &#x2013; if your question is do we feel confident enough as an operator, the clear answer to that is, absolutely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Martin Young from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a couple of questions, the first relates to your guidance, if we take the midpoint of the net income guidance for the full year, so &#x20AC;2.5 billion and we look at what you achieved in the nine months of the last year, quarter two, three to quarter four, you are going to have to come in effectively under what can you delivered last year to get to the midpoint of the range. Now I appreciate there are a number of items in the first quarter that could be regarded as one-offs that we shouldn't extrapolate, but given that you are suggesting that you have come through the worst and things are getting better and that they were negative in second quarter of last year, surely the guidance that you have for the net income is very, very conservative for the 2012?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, and it's related to the first question, it's around the tax issue we talk a lot about, where the tax rate could go in the worst case for the North Sea oil production, but surely given that it's 20% now, this notion of it being 30% for the full year is overly prudent and there could be upside risk there. So what your thoughts were? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Several observations, we do have a number of positive effects in the first quarter, which hopefully we made clear enough, let me just mention two: the specific situation around our UK sales business, where clearly when I look at the remaining three quarters, they will definitely come out weaker than was the case last year, but it was a big driver in the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, when I look at the situation in our gas Supply and Sales business, where Sascha highlighted in the context of the very first question we had, here we are quite substantially ahead of where we were last year in the first quarter, however, we then, last year, had a number also of recoveries of losses that we had incurred in Q1 of 2011, as well as Q4 of 2010 that will not repeat itself, unless we get through the resolution with Gazprom, which is not included in our forecast. So there are a number of specific reasons why the first quarter came out nicely this year and why we think it is still in line, however, with the overall guidance that we're giving for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now on the tax rates, clearly, that is one of the reasons why last year when you compare it with our guidance that we're giving for the full year 2012, last year, we compared to the 30% number I mentioned had ultimately a lower tax rate, implicit tax rate, imputed in our underlying net income. Whether the 30% is ultimately going to be a prudent number, whether we may come out slightly better again I would there like to stick to what I said before that is quite substantially going to be driven by what really will be the outcome on the E&amp;P side. And as I said, if the productions come out a little later, i.e. some of the risk that we highlight materializes then, yes, the tax rate will be lower.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Mr. John Musk from RBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Actually it's a bit of follow-up to Martin's. I may be taking it too literally but at the beginning of the call you said that you believed you were through trough. And, if that is the case, does that not mean that the net income guidance for this year should be a bottom end of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, which was your net income of last year, rather than the &#x20AC;2.3 billion?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, can you just indicate in the Q1 position for the Supply and Sales business the positive result that you show, was there any compensation in there in regards to the Statoil contract? And if not, what makes the Gazprom contract so different that you are certain or at least confident that there will be compensation coming back on that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Why are we saying we're through trough? Clearly, as you know our key reporting metric is the EBITDA and there indeed we are very comfortable that we are through the trough, as it relates to net income. There is a scenario where we come out at last year's level because that is included in our guided range. But on an EBITDA basis, we expect to come out better. That's why we're saying 2011 has been the down point, at least for the foreseeable future, meaning the next several years.</p>
          <p>There is a big difference between Statoil and Gazprom. With Statoil in December of 2009, we had an explicit agreement that covered the 2010 and 2011, where we were granted a material reduction of our procurement cost and against that we had accepted to not ask for any compensation payments for this time period. So in a way the clock only started ticking with Statoil on January 1 of 2012.</p>
          <p>The situation with Gazprom is very different. Here, as part of the ordinary contracts we have, we requested price review in October of 2010. And, hence, any losses we are incurring since then are part of the negotiation, respectively, the arbitration proceedings that we are having at this stage. So you just can't compare the two contracts.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The question comes from Mr. Vincent De Blic from JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions please. The first one is on your 2012 guidance. Can you give us maybe two or three items which, explain why you keep the guidance unchanged despite the weaker E&amp;P earnings. Is it something which has crystallized in the Q1 numbers already? Or was there something which you expect to improve your situation plans over the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the UK supply on the new reporting I understand the number of &#x20AC;221 million of EBITDA for UK is adjusted for supply. Could you give us a feel of normalized level for a full year basically because that's quite a high number. I mean what would you expect a typical year to be in UK supply? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sascha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question related to up and down sides for the remainder of the year. When we highlighted, yes, that on the gas side, there is a certain risk and you might as well actually add Brokdorf to that, which we have also mentioned to you. At the same time, we also always see certain things developing slightly more favorably. We might experience indeed that for example our UK results may be a little bit better than what we thought for the full year. We are seeing some minor positive developments also in our German business. But honestly speaking these are all moving parts. They all together give us absolutely sufficient comfort that even if the worst case happens on E&amp;P, we will come out in this range. So even if Skarv and Elgin don't produce at all during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>As it relates to our UK business, I mean look I mean, we are essentially like other players in that market targeting return on sales somewhere in the 3%, 4% range. This year this could translate into something like &#x20AC;300 million plus or minus for the full year, and we would say that's kind of what a normal year should look like. As you know from the past, there have been weaker years, sometimes stronger years. That's driven by the specific developments, but that's where we would see it's kind of on a &#x2013; as you call it &#x2013; a normalized basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Marcus. Hi Sascha.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick questions, one, is if you could comment on the tax and gas production in Russia, if you could give us an update? And the second thing is, yeah, overall about the guidance. Not only the UK you just mentioned could be a bit better but I looked in the back-up slides and you are also hinting to better margins in Italy and Spain, which with the full-year results you indicated were &#x2013; would have been down. And also the reservoir are at &#x2013; full at the moment, so there could be a recovery bit or probably even better results in terms of EBITDA for hydro generation for the full year, so what's you view on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I am not sure I understand the first question, you asked for, could you repeat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax situation regarding Yuzhno Russkoye. I think, Alberto, you are referring to the MET, what is it called Mineral and Extraction Tax or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a number which will change over time. It builds up but the impact especially in the year 2012 is minor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the guidance, I mean, were you essentially asking the same question that Vincent was just asking or did I misinterpret?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, on top of that there is better EBITDA in hydro perhaps and also spreads in the Italian and Spanish gas and coal units that have improved in the first quarter. But in with the full year results, you are hinting would have been down this year. So it seems to me like a change in the trend here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, on the hydro side we have assumed a decline in the profitability. I mean, as we highlighted in the context of our full year guidance, we already back in March, we said that we do expect a negative development in our power portfolio in particular on the outright side. And clearly hydro being one of the two outright positions we have, we'll see a negative impact. But within our guidance that's part of what we have assumed.</p>
          <p>Yeah, so, I mean, yes, I see all the negative points that you are mentioning but these are not recent developments. These are things that we have captured in our guidance and also in how we describe the effects to you. Remember, we said for the full year we do expect around a material negative effect from the development in the power prices where we said that's around &#x20AC;400 million reduction compared to prior year. So we are &#x2013; and this is still fully in line with what we see today in the markets. And when you look at what happened in the first quarter in a way you have almost a quarter of that baked into our Q1 numbers, a quarter of this &#x20AC;400 million that I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that answer? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Christopher Kuplent from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on your hedging question, you referred to liquidity, you're taking advantage of that. I understand you no longer publish quantified data on your thermal volumes, but can you confirm whether you also took advantage of liquidity? Or whether there was any additional liquidity that you could take advantage of in locking in also spreads in your thermal Generation business?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question just a more general one on your cost-cutting plans. I think you said half of that &#x20AC;1.5 billion you expect to achieve in 2013. Can you make any additional comments about 2012? Will that be close to nothing? Or will it be a linear progression? Do you know more about that by now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean for 2012, the objective we have is that we manage to offset inflation, so there will not be material effect from the E.ON 2.0 program this year, which is &#x2013; I mean, it should not come as a surprise because it just takes some time before you can really start to implement measures.</p>
          <p>As with regard to the hedging, clearly, the activities that we have observed were mainly centered around our outright position. We did not take a lot of action on our spreads portfolio during those months, but please also bear in mind here that it is very normal that we hedge our outright position with a longer time perspective, whilst the spread position is always typically optimized in a shorter time period. So we would normally not hedge a lot of the spread portfolio three years ahead of delivery.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mrs. Deborah Wilkens from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three quick questions for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Debbie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. First of all, you mentioned you provided the rating agencies with the cost control update. Just wondering if there is any progress worth highlighting to us in terms of that program? Also in terms of possible decisions on the power station closures, could announcements come within this year? And then, finally, you mentioned additional costs for efficiency &#x2013; energy efficiency initiatives in the UK, is it possible to provide us within order of magnitude that you're expecting for those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. I think the difference probably in terms of level of detail that we have provided to you and that we have provided to the rating agencies is that we had a session with them, with the program manager for this, where we went through a number of the 53 specific projects that we have to give them just a better feeling on how tangible are the things that we're doing. We gave some examples. We have by now identified some 3,000 individual measures and we walk them through our &#x2013; the way how we track those measures. It is just to also give them a sense for this is not just some top-down target and then hope that the managers will get it done.</p>
          <p>But it's items that are worth sometimes just several &#x20AC;100,000, sometimes its maybe &#x20AC;5 million that there is a responsible person for the measure, the measure is well described. That it's all put now into a tracking tool that we have a team that is monitoring this tracking tool and those &#x2013; that was the discussion we have with them. What I mean when I said we gave them a better insight into the overall program. That's on your first question.</p>
          <p>On your second question, with regards to the announcements, I mean, you know this is a delicate issue, but let me put it this way, I do expect us to talk to authorities, the relevant authorities this year. And I would not rule out that this will also lead to implementation of measures this year. I hope that's clear enough.</p>
          <p>And then, on your third question with regard to energy efficiency investments, we expect them to be sort of in the &#x2013; around &#x20AC;70-plus-minus million range, seven-zero.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, so I speak only to one question, can you give us a number or a feeling what the power trading figure was in the first quarter? And maybe would you expect seeing you're hedging MD trends in Germany for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. Most of my questions are answered already and so I stick to one only and that relates to the confirmation of your 2013 and 2015 earnings target. In the context of the recent pressure on commodity price, i.e. power and also the fuel, as well as oil and gas, have you updated the assumptions which led to your 2013 or 2015 earnings target? Or is it basically on the same assumptions you had when you presented the full year 2011 results? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still stick to the same assumptions that we showed to you essentially two months ago. We also today are still comfortable, as I mentioned, with of course with our 2013 guidance, where clearly the price movements no longer have such a material impact. As it relates to 2015, I think we also said it in our full year results call, we actually do not need a big improvement in power prices to get to the levels that we see there. So we would also confirm that we are still comfortable with the numbers we put forward for 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and as a reminder Herr Heck, don't forget that 2013 is on an achieved disposal basis, i.e. including disposals worth.</p>

          <p>&#x20AC;9.1 billion, while 2015 is on a fully diluted basis, you can say, i.e. it includes all disposals, i.e. the entire &#x20AC;15 billion pack. So from a scope basis, it is a pretty bottom number anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. On your planned closes, do you expect to permanently close plants? One of your competitors in a different market suggested so recently? Or would you think you'd rather mothball facilities? And do you expect to employ a different strategy in your different markets like UK, Central Europe and Nordic? And lastly, are you perfectly free to close plants? Or do you need any kind of regulatory approval?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question both is possible, both permanent and mothballing. Some plants, I would dare to say it's more a permanent shut down. The strategy that we are pursuing is not &#x2013; not only is a sort of country specific, but it's all market specific. It's also really just plant specific. So there is not a kind of general rule and then we apply that all across the board. We, of course, look into &#x2013; I mean, the UK market looks different as compared to the Italian markets and just to give some examples. Also, again, please always bear in mind some of the decommissioning of course will still be driven by LCPD, as you know. And there was so first, mothballing, permanent, and.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regulatory approvals, we &#x2013; I mean, I don't see a market where we are thinking about this where we will be bound by someone to finally take that decision. And &#x2013; but there are information obligations, of course, that we have and I believe I mentioned that before. And we will, of course, follow that. There is a &#x2013; the market where it's more difficult to close a plant clearly is France, but this is by now a very public debate and I'm sure you are following this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask do you expect closures in the Nordic market as well? In Sweden?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not expect closures when I look into our portfolio in the Nordic markets. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this basically, I'm &#x2013; I mean, I know there will still be a number of additional questions that you have. As you know, I mean, you have both Sascha's, my, and the Investor Relations phone numbers, so I suggest whatever we have not yet answered or any more details that you'd like, give us a shout, send us an email or give us call.</p>
          <p>And I would like to essentially conclude this call by again highlighting that we are &#x2013; management is pleased with the first quarter. We think that was a good result, first point. Second point, we are &#x2013; we remain very comfortable that the guidance for the full year, also in light of the risk we mentioned for E&amp;P, will be achieved. And third point, clearly, we also see that there is the possibility for more progress on the side of the discussions as it relates to the long-term gas contracts, which is number one priority for us at this stage.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, I think all of that translates into what we &#x2013; I think it was mentioned &#x2013; what we've now been saying for a number of times in public, namely that 2011 was the trough. We do expect improvement already this year and we expect that to continue going forward. And hopefully, you share that comfort with us that we see for this year and the future.</p>
          <p>Again, all other remaining questions, please address them to Investor Relations or myself. And we then expect to talk to you again latest by early August. Thanks a lot for dialing-in and have a good rest of the day. Bye, bye.</p>
