          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for waiting. Welcome to Banco do Brasil's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After this, there will be a question-and-answer session, and at that time further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>This event is also being broadcast live via webcast and may be accessed through Banco do Brasil's website at www.bb.com.br/ir where the presentation is also available. Participants may view the slides in any order they wish. The replay will be available shortly after the event is concluded. Those following the presentation via the webcast may post their questions in the website. They will be answered in the Q&amp;A session or by e-mail.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that this presentation may include reference and statements, planned synergies, increasing estimates, projections of results, and future strategy for Banco do Brasil, and its associated and affiliated companies and subsidiaries. Those expectations are highly dependent on market conditions on Brazil's economics and banking system performance, as well as an international market one. Banco do Brasil is not responsible for bringing up to date any estimate in this presentation.</p>
          <p>With us today are Mr. Ivan de Souza Monteiro, CFO, and Mr. Gustavo Sousa, Head of IR. Now, I want to turn the conference over to Mr. Gustavo. Mr. Gustavo, you may now begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Starting the presentation on page three, we have the highlights of Banco do Brasil's earnings on the second quarter. As you can see, NII grew at 16.4% over the second quarter of 2011. The loan portfolio in what we call the broad concept grew at 20.3% in 12 months and by broad concept, we mean the loan portfolio under Resolution 2682 by the Brazilian Central Bank with the addition of corporate bonds and guarantees. We also see that delinquency ratio in Banco do Brasil at 2.1% still the lowest in the Brazilian banking industry and an improvement in our cost income ratio.</p>
          <p>Moving to page four of this presentation other highlights of Banco do Brasil's earnings, we can see the expansion of NII as I had previously mentioned. The expansion in fee income of 19.8%, the item Previ at a lower amount and Banco do Brasil still maintaining a sizable earnings and ROE.</p>
          <p>I also highlight the growth in admin expenses. We will touch on these items in the upcoming slides, to mention how we'll bring this item into our guidance. And I would highlight here the adjusted net income of Banco do Brasil of R$2.986 billion, a 10.4% increase over the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to page five of the presentation we show you the one-off items, a total effect of R$22 million related to economic plans of R$184 million and a reversion of additional allowances for loan losses.</p>
          <p>Our net income was up R$3.008 billion and the adjusted net income at R$2.986 million. On page six of this presentation we see the growth in sources and uses of Banco do Brasil. The deposits still are the most relevant source for Banco do Brasil with a 71.7% share in our total sources and a growth in 12 months of 17.9%.</p>
          <p>I also highlight here what we are naming commercial papers but we are referring to specific funding items in Brazil called letras financeiras and LCA Letra de Cr&#xE9;dito do Agroneg&#xF3;cio. These items grew at a pace of 181% over the past 12 months. And naturally, Banco do Brasil invests those sources in the loan portfolio that presented a growth in this concept here of 19.9%.</p>
          <p>Moving to page seven, we see Banco do Brasil's foreign borrowings reaching R$37.9 billion. It is a record amount for Banco do Brasil and this item is with the significant contributions from our bond issuance abroad. Over the second quarter of this year, we issued R$750 million in a Tier II subordinated ten-year security and also other issuances in our CG program.</p>
          <p>On page eight of this presentation, a view of Banco do Brasil's NII. The graph of the NIM shows that Banco do Brasil's global NIM on this graph on the left is stable at 5.5% and the risk-adjusted NIM has a pick up to 3.8%. The net interest margin by segment, this is a managerial spread calculation that we do in different credit portfolios also shows a stable trend with a number at 9.2% of the spread for the total credit operations of Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On the table below, we show the breakdown of Banco do Brasil's NII where I highlight the growth in revenues from loan operations and a growth in funding expenses, much lower than the growth that we had in the funding items.</p>
          <p>Moving to the slide nine of this presentation, we have a breakdown of Banco do Brasil's loan portfolio. We reached R$508 billion at the end of June, a 20.3% growth. And I would highlight here that the agri book is now 18.8% of Banco do Brasil's total book.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 10 of the presentation, we show Banco do Brasil's total individual loan book. We draw this yellow rectangle around some items here. They represent credit items with a lower risk and they comprise nearly 80% of Banco do Brasil's loans to individuals. We're specifically referring to salary loans, payroll loans, also finance and mortgage.</p>
          <p>On the next page on slide 11, we show you the loan portfolio in an organic concept, loans that were originated inside of the Banco do Brasil branch network. We see also an expansion of the items with lower risk such as payroll credit growing at a pace of 20.6%. Salary loans, here expressed as backed by direct deposits, they grew at 16.8%. Car financing grew at 35.1% year-on-year and 45.4% quarter-on-quarter and the significant growth that we saw in our mortgage portfolio, for a total growth of our organic portfolio with individuals of 20.7% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 12, we show you some lines that comprise Banco do Brasil's BOMPRATODOS program, a strategy that was announced on the second quarter. As you can see there, we see growth in most of the items related to BOMPRATODOS such as payroll loans for retirees; salary loans; BB Credi&#xE1;rio, a product that is available at big retailers in Brazil; and auto financing.</p>
          <p>Particularly talking about auto financing on Banco do Brasil's organic strategy, that strategy that is done at Banco do Brasil's branch network. Banco do Brasil is very confident that this strategy represents a growth with solid quality because we are doing operations with clients that we know very well. One of these metrics showed us that 76.4% of the clients that these auto loans with Banco do Brasil on the second quarter have at least five years of credit history with Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 14, we see a breakdown of our company's loans portfolios and I highlight here the participation of working capital lines, still the most relevant item with a 53.5% share of Banco do Brasil's total portfolio with the company. On page 15, we show you the breakdown of the growth in loans to companies. Loans to micro and small enterprises grew at 25.8%, while loans to medium and large-sized companies grew at 20.8%. I highlight on this graph on the right that loans to micro and small enterprises rely more and more on the usage of a guarantee fund called FGO.</p>
          <p>On page 16, we also show you some items related to BOMPRATODOS and how they grew over the period. We show you the growth in working capital lines, investment lines. We also show you the risk levels in the loans in the portfolio for micro and small enterprises and the growth in the percentage usage of the FGO funds.</p>
          <p>On page 17, we show you a view of Banco do Brasil's Agribusiness loan book. Banco do Brasil is the absolute leader on this category with a 63.8% market share. This book totaled 95.7% and it is Banco do Brasil's segment with the best delinquency ratio at 0.5%.</p>
          <p>On page 18, we start to talk about loan quality at Banco do Brasil. Banco do Brasil's loans per risk level are still at a level much better than the Brazilian banking industry as we see on slide 18.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we show you the NPLs plus 90 days where Banco do Brasil consolidated on its consolidated numbers that show a ratio of 2.15%. If we were to take the consolidation of Banco Votorantim out of Banco do Brasil's numbers we will show an improvement at 1.77% and those metrics are much better than what we see in the industry.</p>
          <p>On the right, we show you Banco Votorantim NPL ratios. The NPLs plus 90 days already show deceleration while the early indicators, the NPLs between 15 and 90 days, already show a decrease.</p>
          <p>On page 20, we see Banco do Brasil's credit quality in different segments, loans to individuals, companies and agribusiness. And we can see the stability and improvements in across the different sectors of Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On page 21, we specifically show Banco Votorantim's loan portfolio. Just to give you one of the metrics here, the loans past due over 90 days after four months of when the loan was granted also shows a significant improvement at 0.6% on the loans that were granted in December 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 22, we see the monthly origination also launched at Banco Votorantim and how we have a specific vintage between June 2010 and September 2011. We have talked about this with the market in the past. This is the period when we saw the increase in delinquencies of Banco Votorantim. We took fierce measures to deal with it and now, as you can see on the blue line, the early delinquencies indicators, the NPLs at 30 days are already back at historical levels.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 23, we show you a view of Banco do Brasil's credit provision expenses. We are on the first &#x2013; on the second quarter, we had a R$3.6 billion in credit provision expenses inside of our guidance of between R$3.6 billion and R$3.8 billion. I will just highlight here that even though it says 1H12 exactly second Q12. We will correct this on our website. And when we break this number down into credit positions of Banco do Brasil and credit positions of Banco Votorantim, we see that Banco Votorantim has an improvement of 9.4% versus the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 24, we have the coverage ratio of Banco do Brasil. We are at 206% and if we were to do this calculation without Banco Votorantim, we are at 238%. Again, both metrics considerably above what we see on the Brazilian banking Industry and in our peers.</p>
          <p>On page 25, we have the growth in admin expenses. They grew 18% year-on-year, but I would skip to page 26 to do a calculation that shows that most of this growth is driven by the consolidation of recent investments that we have made such as Patagonia, Mapfre and Banco Postal. If we were to do an adjusted calculation, this growth would be at 12.3%. We are confident that Banco do Brasil's admin expenses growth will be within the guidance for the year 2012, which is of a growth between 8% and 12%.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 27, we have Banco do Brasil's fee income, still being driven by the traditional items such as credit and debit cards, account fees, asset management fees and loan fees. We are also investing heavily in other assets such as insurance and capital market fees.</p>
          <p>On page 28, we see Banco do Brasil's cost to income ratio and the relative improvement that we had on the second quarter in the comparison with the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 29, we show you Banco do Brasil's BIS ratio. We reached 14.6%. This is a pro forma number because on the second quarter we did several Tier II issuances that were already approved by the Brazilian Central Bank, but not in time to be included in our accounting statements that were released. The numbers in our accounting statements is at 14.22% and the pro forma number, again, including instruments that were already approved by the Central Bank is at 14.6%.</p>
          <p>Finally on page 30, we show you a view of Banco do Brasil's guidance for 2012. On the first column, we had what was the previous guidance; on the second column, the performance on the first half; and on the third column, the reviewed guidance. So, on the ROE items we reviewed the guidance to a range of between 17% and 20% and we have an actual performance of 19.9% on the first half.</p>
          <p>On the NII growth item, we had a performance of a growth of 14.1%. Our guidance is between -was between 11% and 15% and we are adjusting this guidance to between 10% and 14%. We are adjusting these two items because of the movement on the basic interest rate in Brazil.</p>
          <p>On the total deposits item, we grew at 17.9% within our guidance. On the domestic loan portfolio on the total number, we grew within our guidance. On the individuals, we are a little below our guidance but we will reach the guidance until the end of this year. On the loans to companies, we are within the guidance. On the loans to Agribusiness, we have been consistently performing above the guidance, which is why we are reviewing this guidance item as well.</p>
          <p>On the allowance for loan losses we are at 3.2%, within our guidance of between 3.1% and 3.5%. On fee income, we are above the guidance at 21.3%. On admin expenses, as we saw in the previous slides, we are above the guidance but we will bring this number to our guidance range. And on the tax rate, we are a little above the guidance and it's likely that we'll bring it to the low end of the guidance for the fiscal year 2012.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. We'll now open for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from Mr. Marcelo Telles with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello, everyone, once again. I have a follow-up question on my margin question in the Portuguese call. I mean, given that you granted significant discounts on credit cards and overdraft loan rates, I think that started in the beginning of July. I mean do you think &#x2013; and combining, of course, with the fact that you probably have some gains related to the renegotiation of loans in the second quarter. Do you think that &#x2013; can you expect, let's say, a bigger margin drop in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding Votorantim. There was a capital injection that you and the other shareholders did in the bank. Are you happy with the current capital position of Votorantim and do you anticipate future capital injections? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcelo. Starting with the margin question, on the slide eight of this presentation, you have a view of consolidated NIM and NIM by segment. This is the best information that we have for you. The only projection that we can give you is the one that is comprised in our guidance. As you saw, we reviewed the guidance for NII growth. This is the best information that I can give you related to margin.</p>
          <p>And related to Banco Votorantim, both shareholders are probably not on Banco Votorantim's capital structure very closely and at this point, they see no need to plan any other action.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the first question, is it possible, I mean, to give more detail to say what was the amount of credits that were actually renegotiated, the credits that were, let's say, performing that were renegotiated in the quarter. I just want to try to estimate in some way what sort of the impact of those credits was when I bring them to present value and try to estimate the potential gain that you had in refinancing these credits going forward. And I'm talking about just the &#x2013; out of the R$11 billion that you renegotiated in the quarter, how much of that was related to these performing loans? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, we don't have these numbers here for you of the amount that was of normal operations that were renegotiated and that generated that gain, as you mentioned, right? We'll go after this information and try to include it in our presentations and report. And the reason why we don't have it here is because the calculation is not straightforward.</p>
          <p>There is one calculation that is very objective, which is the actual revenue amount that derived from loans that were renegotiated in a normal status. However, we would have to break down this early payment of loan into what is the normal flow and what would be an extraordinary flow during periods of interest rate reductions. We don't have this at this point. We'll do our best to provide these numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions as well. First, on the renegotiated credits and I think Marcelo has the follow-up to an earlier call in the Portuguese conference call. But there's obviously a lot of question marks about the increase in the volume as per footnote 10-K on renegotiated credits. They went from R$6 billion in 1Q to R$11 billion in 2Q.</p>
          <p>And if you can just talk a little bit to us about the extent to which &#x2013; and obviously there are concerns that this renegotiation may be masking underlying asset quality deterioration. Can you talk a little bit more about the extent to which the renegotiations were driven by lower interest rates and individuals looking to improve the terms of their credit and to what extent it may be masking credit quality deteriorations consumers may be feeling strained and hence, increasing the pace of renegotiations? So, just more of a conceptual question but if you can talk to that that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Secondly on your ROE guidance it's a pretty broad range, 17% to 20%. By my calculations, which are a little different than yours, the ROE was 18.9% in the first half. The low end of the range kind of implies that the second half will be much more difficult, that ROEs would be in the mid-teen range, which given obviously spread pressures and lower rates, that's one thing, but you also have potentially improving results at Votorantim, good credit quality metrics and better volumes.</p>
          <p>Are you being &#x2013; how likely is the scenario where you'll be at the lower end of the range because on the surface at least, given your results in this quarter and even considering that low interest environment, it seems awfully conservative. So, just kind of curious whether you think that's a realistic scenario and what's really behind that very broad range you gave for ROE guidance for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, thank you for the question. For the first topic, I can tell you there is table in the MD&amp;A that shows the information about the renegotiations related to past due loans, that is the only source and that is the only reason for this number is these past due loans that are renegotiated, that is going down Q by Q. For the second part, Gustavo will address it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question related to ROE, yes, we understand it is a broad range. We are also working to &#x2013; I'm afraid I'll start by saying that I'm afraid I don't have an objective question to answer for you, sorry. But it is a broad number, we are working naturally to keep this number on the top end, but as we expanded on the current quarterly, the scenario that was in our guidance basically interest rates and other items, they were prepared in November last year. As we work with lower basic interest rates and the competitive landscape on the second half, we are seeing that it is prudent to adjust this guidance item. However, it's still hard to say where our real actual number will land. It's very hard for us to point that out right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A follow-up on the first question, my question is more on the flow of renegotiated credits and the balance of renegotiated credits that were non-performing. As per footnote to 10-K it was over R$11 billion in the quarter, it was R$6 billion in the first quarter, it's a big increase. Can you talk about whether market participants should be concerned that that reflects or that's masking some underlying credit quality deterioration or can you talk or is that really individuals seeking better terms because you have been lowering rates aggressively on some of your loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right in the end of your question. We are only talking about the payroll, refinancing loan loss because the interest rate is going down. That's the only reason. And I'd like to show you the table that I mentioned in the first question is, what's the name?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Table 77 on page 61. So, thank you for your question. So, renegotiation because of credit quality, please use the information on table 77 page 61. On the pace of renegotiations, clients seeking better terms, we will work on providing you a quarterly flow, as also suggested by Marcelo Telles, in order not to have one number interfering with the other and causing a possible mix-up. We will try to make expenses in our 10-K, which is provided to you on a quarterly review and breaking it down into loans with a normal status and loans that were delinquent, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple of questions. On the revision of your ROE guidance to 17%, 20%, you mentioned in slide four that a key component of why the ROE was affected in the first half of the year was that Previ gains were only R$390 million per quarter, R$781 for the cap. What are you assuming for the second half of the year in terms of Previ gains embedded in this new ROE guidance that you have given for the year as a whole? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>And question number two is related to capital. You explained that pro forma to this so that issuance that are part of Tier II you are at 14.6%. So it's been increasing for the past couple of quarters. So you are comfortable with the current rules of the game. But you have done an exercise not so long ago anticipating the adoption of Basel III in which you demonstrated that you feel comfortable you wouldn't need to issue capital until 2014 at the earlier. How comfortable are you now with that exercise that you did considering that since they have changed in terms of your expected asset growth, which probably is a bit faster than it was at the time you did that exercise that you have to inject capital at Votorantim and you have now a better understanding of how the timetable for Basel III will apply. Is it still a fair assumption that no capital rates until 2014 or that growth potential will be revived?</p>

          <p>It's still a fair statement. The projections that you mentioned that we released in early March will likely be updated and released again very soon. We are very comfortable with that statement. And the items that are affected, as you mentioned, asset growth, it was within our guidance so it is what we had projected at first, and the capital injection at Banco Votorantim. Granted that this wasn't in our projections but it's a small number when compared with the big picture of capital equity for Brazilian banks as a whole. So, on the capital issue, you will likely see an updated version of that statement very soon plus you will see that we are comfortable with what we have said in the past.</p>

          <p>You were working with an assumption of 15.3% risk-weighted asset growth and loans of this company now a 20% base. So, is the 3.3% growth rate for risk-weighted assets still a good assumption?</p>

          <p>Daniel, I'm afraid that I'll have to seek this number for you because the number that I have in front of me for credit growth is still the guidance. I'll seek the risk-weighted credit growth &#x2013; asset growth for you, okay?</p>

          <p>R$95 million per month. We had R$130 million per month on the first half; for the second half, R$95 million per month. That's the projection that we have made when closing the statement for this half.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, yes. It has nothing to do with 2013 because this is, as you know every half we stop and we look again at the actuarial assets, the actuarial liabilities and we redo the projections. So, this is not an indicator of any type of trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Let me ask you two questions as well. The first one is kind of a follow-up to Daniel's question on your own capital. It seems to us that you are a lot more comfortable with your own capital ratio than the market is. And the indication of this is that you have made this capital infusion Votorantim, you announced a very big buyback program, you are growing your loan book well in excess of the industry. So, do you expect the Brazilian Central Bank to make any changes to the regulations of Basel III? We all know that they announced the preliminary guidelines for the introduction of Basel III at the beginning of the year, but when they make a final announcements, do you expect the guidelines to be the same or do you expect any changes in the guideline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect the same. Our projections are based on this, our best knowledge about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that the banks everybody have been talking about maybe how to treat the deferred tax credits. Have the banks made any progress on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some discussions on the Central Bank about this but that there is no &#x2013; still effect that I could tell to you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question then is with regards to your net interest margin and you reduced your net interest income growth. So let me ask you a two-part question here. The first one is related to the big increase in NIMs in the individuals portfolio and as you explained, that was related to some renegotiations. Should we expect a NIM in the individual portfolio to already move back to first quarter levels already in the third quarter and how much of your lower net interest income growth guidance is related to a lower interest rate environment in Brazil and how much of it is related to you charging lower spreads, especially related to the BOMPRATODOS program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the second part of your question. We can't break that down. We don't have a metric that would decouple that into lower rates in the banking industry and lower interests in our strategy. I'm afraid I don't have that number for you.</p>
          <p>Regarding NIM, yes, you're right in your explanation of the pick-up that we had on the second quarter. It's likely that we'll have some flow of renegotiations of client seeking better terms on the third quarter as well but it's very hard to project this number. So, I'm afraid that the best information that I can give you on NIM and on NII is our new guidance for NII. I know it's not a lot, Mario, but that's the best information I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Ms. Regina Sanchez with Ita&#xFA; BBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. My question is regarding this prepayment of loans to refinance at lower rates. I saw that on page 13 of the MD&amp;A, table number eight. You showed the annualized spreads for individual transactions that went up from 15.3% in the first quarter of 2012 to 16.5%. And you also mentioned in this page that it was an impact of this prepayment that actually increases this spread. Is it fair to make this calculation that maybe just around 100 basis points increase over the average portfolio of individual loans is a good proxy of how much was the impact in net interest income in the second quarter. I did this calculation and I reached something between R$300 million and R$400 million, I mean &#x2013; or do you think that if this impact have not occurred, we would see actually even a slightly decline on the average spread in the second quarter of this year? And then I have a second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In this calculation here this is a managerial calculation that we do that based on the group consideration, the actual rates being charged from clients and also the fund cost, our controlling department calculates the opportunity cost and also charges, the different credit products, the opportunity cost per item.</p>
          <p>In a way what you're saying is correct. If we didn't have this effect of this immediate gain that we have once a client re-negotiates the loan and the rates are favoring the client, we would likely see a decrease on the spread. However, we're not taking under consideration the decrease that we have on the funding cost as well, so it's very hard to give you a number. You're right on the dynamics but there's another factor to be taken under consideration which is the funding cost and, unfortunately, I don't have all these variables here to calculate that for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now, thanks. And my second question, I apologize that I would come back to that point because I have seen many investors with this doubt and for me it was clear that on table 77 page 61 of the MD&amp;A that the renegotiations of non-performing loans actually declined year-over-year and declined in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I want then if you could confirm that actually if it was not a decline and it was following the same running rate of renegotiations of nonperforming loans, actually you could have posted a decline in NPL ratio in the quarter instead of being flat. I mean, overall, I mean I want you to confirm that even refinancing at lower rates at least marginally should lead to better asset quality. So, can we expect asset quality trend to improve, I mean, in the coming quarters considering also that the problematic loans at Banco Votorantim will be written off in coming quarters. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regina, can you repeat the first part of the question about the impact of renegotiation on the NIMs? Can you &#x2013; I'm afraid I didn't get that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'll repeat. It's that because we saw that actually the renegotiations of nonperforming loans declined quarter-over-quarter. Is it have been flat, for instance, or even as a percentage of the total loans? I was saying that if you're renegotiating more non-performing loans and they become performing loans, actually you could have even posted an improvement in NPL ratio instead of showing a flat figure, which was the case in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And then I also wanted to know the trend going forward for NPL ratios considering that probably the problematic loans at Banco Votorantim are now being written off from the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I got it now, Regina. Thank you. I'll have to run the calculation for you. What you're saying makes sense but I have to plug these numbers and do the calculation for you, okay? I'll do that and come back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the second part, the view from our credit department is that delinquency rates are likely to remain stable. We are at levels that are already so low that even though we would very much appreciate to see improvement, it's very hard to improve from such low levels, but what you're saying is also true. We are expecting improvements specifically from Banco Votorantim. Naturally, they will affect our numbers but we prefer to be cautious on this projection and forecast stable delinquency rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But then in terms of provision for loan losses expenses then we can see an improvement, as Ivan mentioned in the Portuguese conference call, especially at Banco Votorantim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we confirm this, Regine. We will see an improvement quarter-by-quarter and as I mentioned to you the important decrease, especially in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Regina, just going back to that absolute number credit provisions expenses guidance that we gave, for the second quarter, we projected a number between R$3.6 billion and R$3.8 billion. We were at R$3.677 billion. And for the third and fourth quarters, we are forecasting a number lower than that. The range is lower than the previous range, which is between R$3.5 billion and 3.7 billion. So, yes, we are forecasting a slight improvement.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I have actually one question in two parts. It's related to expenses. I understand that to strip away these non-recurring items or at least these additional items from acquisitions that you factor in, that 12% year-on-year growth but your guidance is for overall expenses.</p>
          <p>And if you look at that, the 12% to 18%, the 8% to 12% level that you put in, to reach that 12% level means you're going to have to grow your expenses in the second half of the year only 4% over the first. Banco do Brasil has only done that once in the last 10 years. I just want to understand exactly if we were to expect a much weaker seasonality in the second half of the year or if there are other efficiency improvements that you're working on that will help you reach that guidance given that the second half of the year tends to be very seasonal and higher in expenses?</p>
          <p>The second question or the second part of this question is more of a longer-term question, yesterday when your CEO was talking to the press, he mentioned that he believes that spreads will go down to around 4%. I'm not sure if that's the official outlook for the bank, but it is lower than what it is now.</p>
          <p>Is there anything the bank is doing on the expense side to offset those lower spreads? Both of your large competitors in Brazil, Bradesco and Ita&#xFA;, have launched significant expense control programs and use that as a basis for one of the ways they're going to support their profitability going forward. Is Banco do Brasil engaging in something similar. Is that something we could expect to see or are you going to try to match or overcome the lower spreads with volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. I think the answer sort of answers both questions. We are not announcing a cost control or efficiency gain program because we have an ongoing one but what we did recently is that we revamped it and we have so &#x2013; we have a serious cost control initiative for the second half. This plan was presented to Banco do Brasil's board very recently and we are counting on it. We are counting on this cost control plan to achieve the guidance and also to extract gains from efficiency, right, so in a way, to offset spread reduction with cost control as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any specific metrics that you're targeting from an efficiency standpoint or efficiency ratio standpoint or expenses to assets or something like that that you can share?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and if you can give us &#x2013; I mean, the other banks are talking about growing admin expenses at inflation for next year. Is that something that we should expect Banco do Brasil to do as well or will it come at a higher level?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just I mean my questions have been largely answered but just to follow up and maybe stay with the Votorantim credit quality, what we saw is an over 50% increase in charge-offs, quarter-on-quarter. Do you think in Q2 now we're kind of reaching a peak here or is this something that could continue to rise in terms of charge-offs into Q3? The sense that I'm getting from your comments is that real relief will not come until Q4 and on that basis, what sort of capital burn can we expect in Q3? Are we looking at losses again in the range of around R$500 million per quarter or would you expect that number to come down in Q3?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The provisional charge we will reduce in the third and fourth quarter and even for 2013, it would be an important reduction in this item in Banco Votorantim, as we mentioned before. And talking about the second part, Gustavo will address it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are likely to see, as you called, a capital burn similar to what you saw on the first half in magnitude but improving. So, a R$500 million per quarter number but improving on the third quarter and also improving on the fourth quarter is a reasonable number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I mean would that &#x2013; just a follow-up on that, I mean if you have R$500 million and R$500 million you're getting your &#x2013; you're probably going to get your Tier 1 ratio down into the 9%, 9.5% range. Is that a number that you would still be comfortable with for capital for Votorantim looking into 2013?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for hosting this call. My question really can relate back to the net interest income guidance that you've announced and lowered.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking the question and sorry for coming back on this point, Ivan. I know that you addressed part of it in the Brazilian conference call. But, still planning a point to me on the equalization revenues that you renegotiated with the treasury administered this year.</p>
          <p>I know that tide is running at record levels. And I know the director of Agribusiness explained while in the Brazilian call that the basis of the negotiation was concluded and it considered the policy rates coming down. Having said that and looking to the number that you posted in the last quarter of approximately R$800 million, would it be reasonable to expect at least a gradual decline of the figure on top of lower Selic rates as well?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As our Agribusiness Director mentioned, the parameters of equalization negotiations were in line with what we had on the last period. So it would be fair to expect something similar in terms of equalization volumes as we had in the previous period. And related to the specifics of this negotiation, we are not actually disclosing the numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, but I know it would be, let's say, similar in absolute numbers which is more than R$2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the disbursement in, if I may call it, equalizable, right, in loan that would qualify for equalization is the same.</p>
