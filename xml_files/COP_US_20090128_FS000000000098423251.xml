          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ConocoPhillips Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Jen and I will be your coordinator for today.  At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.  We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of today's conference.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Gary Russell, General Manager of Investor Relations.  Please proceed sir.</p>

          <p>Thanks Jen , and welcome to everybody on our fourth quarter fourth quarter conference call.  Joining me today are Jim Mulva, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Carrig, our President and Chief Operating Officer as well as Sig Cornelius, our Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.  Jim will be taking you through a presentation today that's been prepared and intended to help you with your understanding of our financial and operating performance in the fourth quarter of '08.  This presentation along with other information regarding the fourth quarter performance can be found on our website, conocophillips.com</p>
          <p>Now if you turn to page two, you'll find our Safe Harbor statement, which simply says that forward-looking statements made in our presentation today and in the conference call today represent our management's current expectations.  Actual results could materially differ from what those expectations and you can find in our SEC filings information on items that could cause material differences.</p>
          <p>Now this presentation today also contains non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles measure either in the appendix of this presentation or in the Investor Relation's section of our website.</p>
          <p>So I will now turn this call over to Jim Mulva.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay Gary, thank you, and I appreciate those who are participating in this conference call.  Before I begin going through the slides, I'd like to briefly review the significant changes we encountered in the fourth quarter.  As you know, commodity prices, crack spreads experienced sharp declines.  Early in the quarter we came to the conclusion we would experience a significant multi-year recession.</p>
          <p>We suspended our share repurchase program in mid-October and commenced downsizing our 2009 and 2010 operating and capital investment programs in a way that's consistent with the anticipated business environment.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, our share price experienced a sharp decline, and the resulting decrease in market capitalization along with lower expected prices led to large impairments, which I will discuss in the slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Our capital investment plans have been adjusted, so we continue with our committed and strategic key projects while deferring other investment opportunities.  We are planning for a prolonged and difficult business environment.  2009 and 2010 will be very challenging for our global economy and the energy business. We believe our decisions, actions and plans will enable us to live within our means, that is, generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital investment program and fund our dividends.</p>
          <p>So, with those opening comments, I am moving now on to slide 3.  As you can see on slide 3, our adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 1.9 billion, that excludes 33.7 billion of adjustments, and I'll discuss those in more detail in the following slides.  So, with these adjustments, our reported -- we reported a loss of 31.8 billion.  We generated 3.1 billion of cash from operations and our debt-to-capital ratio increased to 33%.</p>
          <p>Now, in the E&amp;P business, we produced 2.32 million BOE a day and that includes an estimated 451,000 BOE a day from our LUKOIL segment.  So if you exclude LUKOIL, our production was near 1.8 million BOE a day.  In the downstream, our crude processing utilization was 93% and in fourth quarter we completed our Origin transaction.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 4, fourth quarter adjusted earnings were 1.9 billion; you can see that sort of in the middle of the slide.  So, we start with gold bar on the far left of the chart, you see third quarter net income was 5.2 billion and then as we move to the right, prices, margin, and other market impacts reduced fourth quarter net income.  Higher volumes increased income 743 million.  There was a benefit in the fourth quarter of 1.1 billion from lower taxes, predominantly lower production tax in Alaska and the Lower 48.</p>
          <p>And we also saw lower estimated extraction and export taxes in our LUKOIL segment.  This was expected given the sharply lower price environment in the fourth quarter, but these taxes in our LUKOIL segment were much higher than would be implied by the price environment because of the lag effect.  Other things in the aggregate in the fourth quarter improved income by 11 million, that brings us to our adjusted earnings of 1.9 billion and we recorded the adjustments of 33.7 billion as we previously outlined.</p>
          <p>Most of our adjustments were the result of a sharp decline in global equity markets, commodity prices, margins and then, as well as a revised capital program that we announced on the 16th of January.  And you'll see the segment impact of these items as we go through each of the segments on the slides.  So, with these adjustments, we had a net loss in the fourth quarter of 31.8 billion shown by the gold bar on the far right of the slide.</p>
          <p>I'll go to the next slide, 5, total company cash flow, start on the left.  We started the quarter with a cash balance of 1.1 billion, generated 3.1 billion of cash from operations.  Then moving to the right, you see we had proceeds from dispositions of 911 million, 5.4 billion increase in debt due primarily to the Origin transaction and working capital needs.  So with these resources, we funded 8.7 billion of our capital program, paid nearly 700 million in dividends, and purchased about 750 million of our shares.  And there are some other items in the aggregate that provide an additional $392 million, leaving us with a cash balance of 755 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 6, the pie chart on the left shows the cash available during the year was 31 billion, 22.7 billion or 73% came from operations, the remaining 8.3 billion or 27% was generated from a combination of debt increase and proceeds from asset sales.  And as you look on the right, you can see how we used the 31 billion.  We spent nearly 20 billion in our capital investment program including the Origin transaction. We purchased a little more than 8 billion of our common stock and paid 2.9 billion in dividends.</p>
          <p>So, I'll now move to page 7.  Looking at a capital structure of the Company, you can see the chart on the left; our equity at the end of '08 was 56 billion.  That reflects the impact of the impairments recorded in the fourth quarter.  With debt at 27.5 billion at the end of the year, that's shown in the middle part of the slide, our debt-to-capital ratio at year-end was 33%, which is 14% higher than at the end of the third quarter shown on the chart on the right.  So, of this increase of 14%, 10% is due to the adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter and 4% was due to the increase in debt.</p>
          <p>And you could see in all the charts, the year-end balances since 2003 and we're confident that we manage our financial position going forward in a way that returns our debt-to-capital ratio back to our target of 20% to 25%.  Also I'd like to point out that the rating agencies just confirmed our AA1 credit ratings.</p>
          <p>Moving on to E&amp;P, page 8.  As mentioned earlier, our E&amp;P segment was significantly impacted by impairment adjustment of $26 billion in the fourth quarter.  Crude oil prices were significantly lower during the fourth quarter as our realized crude price was $52.82 a barrel.  Now that is $59.37 a barrel lower than the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to natural gas.  As gas prices were lower, our realized natural gas price was $6.32 an Mcf and that's $2.59 per Mcf lower than the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter production volumes were higher than the previous quarter, and that's consistent with our guidance, and you'll see more about this in details on the next slide.</p>
          <p>So I am on slide number 9.  You can see production from our E&amp;P segment in the fourth quarter was 1.867 million BOE a day, that's 119,000 BOE a day higher than in the third quarter.  And you can see this in the gold bar on the left of this chart.  So, if we move across on the right.  Production in the UK was 53,000 BOE a day higher and that's due to the ramp up of production from the Britannia satellites and then we also had lower planned and unplanned downtime.</p>
          <p>With respect to Alaska, production improved 44,000 BOE a day and this is due to less planned downtime and seasonality and then we also had improved drilling and well performance.</p>
          <p>In the Lower 48 we had improved drilling and well performance somewhat offset by unplanned downtime and normal decline but yet it was an improvement of 9,000 BOE a day.  And then, we had some other small variances that in total improved production 13,000 BOE a day.  Then we add the segment from LUKOIL, and the total was 2.318 million BOE a day in the fourth quarter.  So for the full year, our production average excluding LUKOIL 1.79 million BOE a day which includes the effect of hurricanes and production-sharing contract impacts.</p>
          <p>If you adjust for these, then 2008 average production would have been 1.81 million BOE a day and that compares to 2007 full year average production of 1.88 million BOE a day which includes two quarters of production from our expropriated Venezuelan assets.  When averaged over the year, that impact was 42,000 barrels per day.  So if you look at this, as we said early in 2008, our production excluding the LUKOIL segment would be about 1.8 million BOE a day and that's what we essentially did in 2008.</p>
          <p>So, moving on to slide 10, E&amp;P's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, you can see toward the middle or a little bit to the right, $1.4 billion.  To start with the gold bar on the far left, income in the third quarter was 3.9 billion. Then you move to the right, prices, margin, and other impacts reduced fourth quarter income by 3.4 billion.  We have higher sales volume to help us, 432 million, and with significantly lower crude oil prices and lower natural gas prices and production taxes, essentially in Alaska and the Lower 48, improved income 505 million compared to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now we have some other items which in the aggregate improved earnings 41 million and that includes lower DD&amp;A, operating, core operating costs, higher equity earnings somewhat offset by higher dry hole expenses mainly in the Gulf of Mexico and South America.  We had some lease impairments and severance accruals.  That brings us to our adjusted earnings to 1.4 billion.  There were impairment adjustments in the fourth quarter, as you can see, 25.7 billion, bringing our total reported net loss to 24.3 billion shown in the gold bar on the far right.</p>
          <p>Now moving from E&amp;P to Refining and Marketing shown on page 11.  Refining and Marketing's net income in the fourth quarter was also impacted by impairment adjustments and also refining margins in the US were significantly lower than the third quarter.  Our US realized refining margin in the fourth quarter was $6.96 a barrel.  Now that's $2.07 a barrel lower than the third quarter.  The significant decline in market cracks were only partially offset by the benefit we get in higher margins from secondary products and improved sour crude differentials.</p>
          <p>On the international side, our realized refining margin was $8.31 a barrel.  That's $2.93 a barrel lower than the third quarter and is mainly due to the continued core hydro skimming margins.  The domestic refining crude oil capacity utilization in the fourth quarter was 94%, that's 4% higher than the prior quarter.  On the international side, utilization rate was 89%, that's up from 75% in the third quarter and primarily due and we saw some increased production and economic runs in our Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany.  So, worldwide, our crude oil capacity utilization was 93%, which is 6% higher than the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to page 12 and we show fourth quarter adjusted earnings were 753 million, so we start with gold bar on the left side.  Third quarter income was 849 million.  As we move to the right, prices, margins, other market impacts reduced income 147 million.  Then we had higher utilization and improved sales volumes, which helped us 40 million, and then there were some other items in the aggregate improved income 11 million, which brings us to 753 million.  Then we had adjustments in the fourth quarter of 464 million, which brings our total net income in the fourth quarter 289 million shown in the gold bar on the far right.</p>
          <p>Now, I am moving on to slide 13, which is the other segments where we compare our fourth quarter to third quarter.  We do not estimate fourth quarter earnings from the LUKOIL segment.  This does include a positive true-up of 101 million for the third quarter of 2008 but excludes the 7.4 billion reduction in the book value of our investments.  Our reported fourth quarter income for the LUKOIL segment was a loss of 7.4 billion.  We had some other items impacting the LUKOIL segment in the quarter, which include lower estimated realized prices somewhat offset by lower estimated extraction, export taxes and higher estimated volumes.</p>
          <p>Turning to our midstream business, income was at 69 million, it's 104 million lower in the prior quarter primarily to lower realized natural gas liquids prices.  This is somewhat offset by higher volumes in the fourth quarter due to restoration of operations that were down in the third quarter due to hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Our chemicals joint venture had a net loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter compared to income of 46 million in the third quarter.  Variance is primarily due to lower margins and volumes in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, our emerging business segment, adjusted earnings for fourth quarter was 60 million higher than the third quarter income of 35 million due to higher international power generation results.  But, our reported income of fourth quarter, when you include the adjustments, was a loss of 25 million.</p>
          <p>Now, our adjusted corporate expenses were 354 million, that's 73 million higher than the third quarter due to higher net interest expense, which included lower capitalized interest and higher environmental accruals.  The reported corporate expenses, including the adjustments were 388 million.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to the profitability of upstream and downstream, slide 14, on these slides, we compare our performance on income per barrel and cash contribution per barrel against what we see as the peer group, the large publicly-created international oil companies shaded in green and -- or shaded in grey and that includes Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, Shell and TOTAL.  So, the chart shows our E&amp;P income and cash per BOE for the years 2003 through 2008, and in the green bars, peer group is shown in grey and while we don't have data at this point for the fourth quarter 2008 we expect our income and cash contribution to be competitive.</p>
          <p>I go down to slide &#x2013; now to slide 15, which shows the same metrics of income and cash contribution for refining and marketing in peer group is the same.  You have the same time period and we would expect, when the results are known for the peer group for the fourth quarter, we would expect to be competitive in both metrics.</p>
          <p>Now, I go on to slide 16, return on capital employed, again, it's the same peer group shown in the grey shaded area and it reflects our return on capital employed with no adjustments for purchase accounting.  As we've shown in the past, adjustments made to our peers are reflected -- that reflect purchase accounting shown in Table 3.  Our ROCE for the fourth quarter was 7%; for the full year 2008, 15%.</p>
          <p>I'm going to the last slide in our presentation on 17.   So, I'm going to summarize.  As we said in our most recent release to the media, we've created a self-sustaining, competitive, integrated energy company and our long-term strategy remains unchanged.  Through organic growth and prior business transactions, we believe we have the resources and opportunities for growth.  Our existing portfolio of high quality assets will enable us to re-price our reserves, maintain our current production levels and operate in a low price environment.  We anticipate the company's first quarter's E&amp;P segment production will be near fourth quarter 2008 production and we expect exploration expenses to be around 400 million for the quarter.  Comments with respect to E&amp;P segment production, this is before consideration of OPEC cuts, but we don't see significant impact of OPEC cuts on our production.</p>
          <p>Downstream, we anticipate world-wide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate first quarter we'll be in low-80% range and this is primarily due to we have a lot of turnaround activity both in the United States and International and we expect run reductions at the Wilhelmshaven refinery.</p>
          <p>Our turnaround cost for the first quarter of '09, we expect to be around $225 million before-tax.  So, in light of the business environment as outlined as I started, we're reducing our cost structure and constraining our capital to live within our means, and then we look forward to sharing these plans --operating capital plans -- with you when we meet the investment financial community in March 11 in New York.</p>
          <p>So, that concludes the prepared comments and I think Gary we're now ready to entertain questions from those participating in the teleconference.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And, we'll standby for the first question.  The first question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Jim, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the relationship with LUKOIL?  I know you took an impairment charge, but otherwise still own the stock.  With Russian supply looking like it's probably going to decline as a country this year and probably next year, are you starting to see the potential for more opportunities given your ongoing partnership with LUKOIL?  Or, in light of all the things that have gone on in Russia with the oil price having fallen so much, has the relationship changed in a way where we shouldn't think about gaining additional opportunities?  Just hoping you can provide some update on LUKOIL and what you see in Russia going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Arjun.  Thank you.  First, the relationship with LUKOIL continues very strong and I really shouldn't comment on the forecast that they have with respect to their production levels and all.  But, we are working really quite well with LUKOIL on some investment opportunities both inside and outside of Russia.  So, hopefully, as we go through 2009, those organic growth opportunities we can make known to you and hopefully we can update some of that in March with our presentation to the financial community.</p>
          <p>The other thing is is that we continue to work with Gazprom on things that we can be doing inside and outside of Russia, to a lesser extent, Rosneft.  But, I was just in Russia this past week and I can tell you that the Ministry and the authorities are certainly looking at ways in which they can help promote investment opportunities for companies like ConocoPhilips to be working in Russia, as well as outside Russia, as I said, both with LUKOIL, Gazprom and Rosneft and others.  So, hopefully, as we go through 2009, we can roll out some of these opportunities, they're in the formative stage and we recognize that it's a different pricing environment.  And, I'd also say the Russian authorities recognize the importance of having the write fiscal take to generate and support those new investment opportunities.  So, pretty bullish on Russia, but it remains to be seen whether we can bring these new opportunities to the finish line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, thank you.  It's very helpful.  If I can ask one second one?  You did announce that the Origin Energy investment closed in the fourth quarter.  Obviously, the natural gas and the oil price and the LNG price environment is very different.  Can you just talk about your plans to move forward with really developing the LNG project there or should we think that that's on hold until the cycle recovers more strongly in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  First of all, we announced the $5 billion of the Origin transaction and fortunately we did hedge a significant part of that expenditure.  So, the net cost of the investment at the start was $4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of our plans, we have not cut back at all on the drilling program for the feed and the studies at work for the LNG that we have in mind to develop.  Our first vein that we have in mind is going to be in 2014.  So, we continue to work.  Obviously, we know the oil price and gas price environment it is today, but we look through that and we see a better pricing environment when we get into 2014 and subsequent periods of time.  So, we continue our drilling program in Queensland, and the results that we get from our drilling program is just as we expected.  So, there's really no change in that regard, Arjun.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Yes.  I'm interested in the renewed capital program.  Maybe you could just give us some general color on the kinds of things or the specific things that you will not be doing now versus what you might have had in the plan say one or two quarters ago.  In other words, where is the capital being extracted from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the details of this will all come in our March presentation in New York.  But, first of all, there has been absolutely no cutback or reduction in expenses or capital spent on maintenance of our facilities around the world.</p>
          <p>The second point is, all of our committed major projects -- multi-year projects like LNG projects in Qatar, Shaw project, all these different ones that we have in mind doing or that we've committed to doing we still have in the 12.5 billion that we've announced.</p>
          <p>Some of the upgrades in the refineries we are deferring, we have deferred somewhat waiting for new capital investment numbers on Yanbu, we have cut back some of our drilling in the Lower 48 and in Canada.  Of course, that's kind of a swing factor that's -- we have to look at what we think the prices are and the returns are.  But, those are some of the areas that we've cut back and &#x2013; but, we will outline this in full detail when we come to meet with you in March.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.  I wanted to see if you could provide your latest thoughts on the North American natural gas market.  Your opening comments certainly presented a fairly conservative or a weak view for the energy markets in general for 2009 and 2010.  And, I suppose that speaks to a lower expectation for demand for natural gas.  But, in combination of that and the recent success on the shale plays, I'm wondering what you're thinking could be the supply/demand balance in North America for natural gas the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, over the next -- short period of the next two years or so we see certainly having plentiful supply.  The real question is what's taking place with respect to demand?  Demand has a lot to do with the economy, industrial activity, weather and all of that.  So when we look at natural gas prices today we are somewhat surprised that they're below $5 in Mcf.  In our plans going forward over the next year or two, we expect to see some improvement in natural gas prices, but not a lot more than $5 in Mcf.</p>
          <p>If the market gives us $6 or more, obviously that &#x2013; it's helpful to the industry and to drilling programs.  But, with these prices I think what you're going to have is, most likely, less investment and that will lead to some correction in supply/demand.  But a lot has to do with we don't really know what's taking place on demand because of the strength of the economy.  So, our view is that we see natural gas prices in the short-term being around $5 in Mcf, maybe a little bit better.  But maybe that gives you the color on what we plan and expect as we go over the next year or two.</p>

          <p>Sure, that's helpful.  Thank you for that.  And then a real quick question on Qatargas 3, where that project stands now in terms of expected startup? I want to say it's already slipped into 2010, but any additional color would be helpful?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you are right.  I don't have the exact specific date, but so much is being done over at Ras Laffan and it does take longer for each of the trains, and of course our train follows each of the trains ahead of us, and that's the way it works, and the trains ahead of us have been &#x2013; have some delay.  But I think 2010 is the right year, and we'll update specifically that date when we see you in March.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I've got a few questions.  First one, maybe I'll get a quick answer on this one, maybe not the best question to ask, but Jim I think if you look at your return on capital employed, 2008 came in at 15% at a $100 per barrel oil price, 2004 came in at 15% at a $42 oil price.  From the outside looking in it just doesn't seem like this strategy of acquiring companies for growth is working all that well, maybe you could have some comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe &#x2013; really two questions in some ways.  First, from a historical perspective, when we look at what we've done on acquisitions and the assumptions that we used when we made the acquisition whether it was ARCO Alaska, it was Tosco, Burlington or the merger of the two companies, Conoco and Phillips, tied our experience historically, and we have either met or we have exceeded our expectations when it came to prices and cost and synergies.</p>
          <p>Now as you look forward with the pricing environment, I just think it's going to be most difficult to be looking at doing acquisitions of large entities; first is picking up acreage and picking up an asset that's close to you that seems to fit with where you have a large position.  So, historically, in hindsight, if you look at the oil price environment we are seeing today, the returns aren't as great.  If you see prices that are 70, 80 or $90, obviously they are much better.  But I can tell you that everything that we've done in the past so far, the history has been that the premises that we used when we did the transactions we have exceeded.  But I don't think you're going to see much of this going forward for ConocoPhillips.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just concerned that when you try and look at metrics going forward, and I know you make the argument that by purchase accounting versus pooling, but since that's now quite a long way in the past, it's going to be very, very hard to catch up with some of your other peer companies if you continue to have returns that are massively dying on competitors.  And I'm just trying to understand how you are going to try and improve those returns in your cost base if you are relying more and more on acquisitions for growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just said Neil that we are not relying on that acquisitions for growth going forward and our $12.5 billion capital program has nothing in acquisitions in it.  Obviously, we have the portfolio that we have today, and that's where we are going to manage and we've historically been pretty good on exploitation and operations.  So, there is a lot of emphasis, as I said in opening comments, in the slides, a real emphasis in this challenging business environment that we are in is we got to run well and we got to get the cost structure right.</p>
          <p>And that cost structure is not only day-to-day operations, but we have to also be quite aggressive on procurement when we buy goods and services.  And suppliers aren't going to just offer it up to you, you've got to be pretty aggressive to get it.  But we have the portfolio that we do.  If our returns are less than the peer group, then it's up to us to take actions in our plans and how we invest our money and operate to close that gap.  We intend to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one maybe quick final one, just looking at the first quarter in terms of your cash position which fell from Q3 into Q4, you are now carrying less cash than Hess is into Q1, and with LUKOIL potentially likely to make a loss in Q1 as well, I'm just wondering what you are looking at in terms of increasing debt in Q1 or indeed through the first half of this year or if you've got any plans there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, with respect to LUKOIL, there is no requirement for us to be putting any cash into LUKOIL.  So, all of their operations and investment is done by the corporate entity of LUKOIL.  So, we get a small dividend back, but it's cash flow positive.  So, there is no drain or requirement or call on cash from ConocoPhillips to fund or support LUKOIL.  So, when we look out, we are adjusting our operating plan in oil such that with the oil price environment we want to operate and fund our dividends in our capital spending program without a change in debt.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at so far this year, based on what we would expect for the full year the oil prices might be just about what we expected.  The crack spreads a little bit better than we expected and natural gas price lower than expected.  So, that's so far in the first month of the year, that's how we look at it.  Of course, it's the first month of year and it's the first month of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no plans to increase debt in the first quarter if conditions continue the way they are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our plans are we don't want, as we go through each quarter and as we go through the whole year, our plans are not to increase debt, our plans are to hold debt constant if market helps us a little bit better and we would be reducing debt.  Well, I'm not really disclosing or trying to disclose our internal forecast of prices or margins, but if you take the First Call assessment of what our company is going to do, it has a cash flow in the neighborhood of around $16 billion &#x2013; 15 or $16 million if we spend 12.5 on capital and 3 billion for dividends, by that essentially is living within our means.  That means that that debt won't go up or won't go down.  So if the market price is helpful, a little bit helpful to us than what First Call has, then the debt will go down.  If the environment is not as good, it goes up a little bit.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Erik Mielke with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning.  I'd like to follow up from the question that Neil just had on the loan acquisitions, and I realize you have an analyst meeting planned for March, and you may want to defer some of these questions until then.  But given that you've just had to take a very significant write-down on various assets on your balance sheet.  Other things you would do differently going forward, and particularly thinking about transactions like Origin, is that the sort of deal that you might still continue to do?  Or is that the sort of thing that we should not expect to see going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first we always, like any company, will look at all opportunities.  But in the case of the Origin transaction, what we see is a minimum of four LNG trains, first one coming in 2014, we expect to see a better pricing environment than we see today.  We expect natural gas to be tied to oil price.  And we see a significant amount of resource there over and above what's already publicly been noted, so we see a lot of upside in that.</p>
          <p>Now, when we look back at what we've done, we like what we've done.  We look at our investment for the long-term.  We're going to spend $12.5 billion in our capital program.  There is nothing in it for acquisitions, and we say we're going to live within our means.  So, there always is that opportunity to spend 50 or 100 or $200 million if we got the right asset, acreage, or producing property where we already have a position of strength.  But our plans do not -- do envisage doing multi-billion dollar transactions as we go through this near-term period of time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone.  Three very specific ones if I could.  In U.S., oil particularly, historically your realizations have tended to be below headline market prices, just for Q3 and now Q4 those realizations have moved to a premium, could you just help me understand the dynamics of that, please?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I -- maybe John Carrig could help out with that.  I think it has to be just a portfolio.  There is nothing unusual taking place with respect to operating cost, or taxes and we ran well.  We are watching our cost very carefully.  I don't think there is anything really unusual there, John, I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, I'd have to come back to you.  There is nothing in my mind that stands out.  Certainly it's an observation worthy of our reply to you, but I don't have anything at the moment that stands out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  And secondly, you mentioned a very low utilization in Q1 for refining.  I was wondering whether that's a level of utilization that you've seen already in January or whether the downtime that you're expecting is effectively back-end loaded in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got some major refineries down 30, 45 days turnaround, that was all scheduled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I'm asking is, are they down now or are they going to go down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're down now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but we just don't disclose that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But essentially I guess we can rate the downtime over the course of the quarter as opposed to thinking it is back-end loaded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we give, Paul, is just 80% for the quarter, so the precise allocation of that -- in a typical environment these are timed to deal with a variety of factors.  So, which one -- how much is down in March versus February, I don't have that available right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.  And finally, were there any goodwill implications from the Origin deal?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're really in the process of continuing to work our 2009 operating plan all the way down to business units.  When we say the business unit, the geographic location, and E&amp;P and by individual refineries, and so we'll share that with you in March, but the detail of that is not yet really known.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But, Jim can you tell us that is it more on the administrative side or in the technical functional side of the business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a bottoms-up process Paul, and it's based on the needs of each individual staff and operating unit.  So we're still in the midst of finalizing these plans and we will review them internally shortly and so we don't have a breakdown for you of where.  Maybe we'll be able to give a little more color on that in March.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Two final short questions.  One, EnCana joint venture, is both the upstream and downstream development plans still remain on track, or that is based on the previous program or that that has been changed?  Second one, I'm wondering if you can give us some color in terms of the industry-wide cost trend, have you guys started seeing some meaningful drop in the spot rate?  And if you do, when you think that the company will start seeing some benefit showing up in your operating results or financial results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First on the downstream joint venture with EnCana, there is no change in what we're doing. In terms of the upstream, there is no real change. It might be that some of the investment in adding on the wells has slowed down somewhat.  No change strategy wise or what we're ultimately going to do, but maybe some slowdown in terms of the capital and how quickly we bring on the production. Cost trend, well we know that costs are coming down somewhat, but I can't really comment on that, maybe John or Sig can, whether we've really seen significant reductions yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would comment.  As you might expect, we are aggressively pursing reductions not just with our own direct cost, but also the companies with whom we do business and we are starting to see some reductions. I don't have the multiplier factors for you at hand, but the time that that will take to work its way into the system, a lot of it's capital, a lot of those costs get capitalized. And some's operating cost, but there is a lag effect, just like there was a lag effect on the way up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In many regards, around the world both upstream and downstream, some of the projects that we defer, we're deferring not that we're not going to do them, we just defer them because we want to go back and rebid or wait 6 months or 12 months because we think we're going to get a better cost structure.</p>

          <p>Okay, guys.  Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Doug Leggate with Howard Weil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you.  Good morning guys.  I've got a couple of questions really around reserves and portfolio debt and I guess the first one is on LUKOIL.  Just as you said you can't estimate the earnings for LUKOIL, neither can you estimate what they are going to say about reserves when they come out with that, is there any risk or have you fully taken account of any possibility that they're going to have significant impairments also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly.  Are you referring to the current outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I'm talking about the reserve changes that you've already announced.  How have you taken into account what may happen with LUKOIL in terms of potential impairments, because you fully consolidate obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's an equity affiliate.  But, yes, we have taken -- we apply the same rigor.  Obviously, they are an equity affiliate.  We do get -- we work with LUKOIL and we're not going to get ahead of what LUKOIL is going to determine.  But, from our perspective, we followed the same processes this year that we followed in the prior years and it includes our assessment of LUKOIL's reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you have full access to the appropriate ceiling test information and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a full cost accounting exercise, but yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Okay.  Over the past few years now, if you look at the averages, obviously reserve replacement hasn't been there and your -- I guess the question is, do you feel confident with what you have right now and this kind of relates I guess to the acquisition question.  Have you got the portfolio depth to sort of maintain the targets you had laid out over the last few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you'll see from us in March is that we believe that we have the resources, that we will re-price our reserves over the next five years without banking or having to have exploration success or having to make an acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess Jim the follow-on from that then is and again I understand it is not something you want to disclose at this point, but under what pricing scenario, is that possible in a $50 environment or does it require a recovery to an $80 environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  No.  Let's put it this way.  I don't want to give you the specific numbers, but it doesn't require a 70 and $80 price environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess the final one is, just going back to Mark's question on Shaw. Shaw and Origin, both fairly big CapEx items that you committed to last year.  Could you give us an idea -- in light of just how significant those capital commitments could be, what are some indication of the breakeven economics?  Where do they not work if given that you've re-committed to potentially sanctioning Shaw this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have that right at hand and, again for competitive reasons, I don't think we want to give that to you.  But, in terms of commitment and the amount of money that's going to be included in our capital budget, you're going to see that when we come to you in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  All right.  I'll leave it there.  Thanks.</p>
