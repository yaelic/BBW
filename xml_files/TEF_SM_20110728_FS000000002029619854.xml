        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica's 2011 first half results conference call. Today, I have here with me Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; Matthew Key, head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe; and Miguel Escrig, our Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&amp;A session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica had released today a set of strong earnings despite economic challenges and headwinds from regulation. First half business trends are consistent with 2011 targets, and therefore we confirm our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>We have positive strong topline growth driven by the robust performance of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin, excluding Mexico and solid mobile data growth. We continued to deliver benchmark profitability, expanded margins quarter-on-quarter and limit in OIBDA, a year-over-year decline in Spain to levels similar to those of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Latin already accounts for over 45% of consolidated figures from revenue to operating cash flow, driven by the stellar performance of Brazil, and that shows the benefits of our high diversification.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight the significant progress made in several areas since our last call in May. This proves that Telef&#xF3;nica's strong execution and skills. We have reached a new social agreement with the unions in Spain. We are announcing higher than anticipated integration of synergies in Brazil, and we have launched our partnership program, which proves skill is a differential and valuable asset. All these initiatives will have a positive impact in cash generation. Finally, let me say that we fully reaffirm our dividend commitments.</p>
          <p>In our key financials, and starting with the summary on the P&amp;L, please go to Slide 3. Reported year-over-year growth rates were positively impacted by the full consolidation of Vivo in October 2010. Revenue increased 6.3% year-on-year in nominal terms to almost &#x20AC;31 billion and grew by close to 1% purely organic.</p>
          <p>Six month OIBDA topped &#x20AC;11 billion, up close to 4% in reported trends and declining around 2% in organic terms. Profitability remains robust with OIBDA margin up sequentially to 36.6% in the first half and limited year-on -year erosion.</p>
          <p>As a proxy to cash flow generation, operating cash flow ended at close to &#x20AC;7.5 billion, which is equivalent to a 6% organic decline compared to the 2010 first half figure.</p>
          <p>Our first half net income exceeded the &#x20AC;3 billion point, with second quarter profit negatively impacted by Telco's revision of the value of its stake in Telecom Italia, which reduced net income by &#x20AC;353 million. Please note that this is a non-cash item.</p>
          <p>In addition, cumulative D&amp;A grow at double-digit, driven by the full consolidation of Vivo and the amortization of Vivo's purchase price allocation driven to a 9% year-on-year increase in total PPA.</p>
          <p>Profit attributable to minority interests continue to drag that profit as a result of the change of consolidation of Vivo and higher earnings from this company. All things considered, EPS has stood at &#x20AC;0.70, but stripping out the impact from purchase price allocation and revision of value Telco's stake in TI, EPS would have reached &#x20AC;0.88.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 shows the results from our value over volume commercial strategy, being mobile contract and mobile data are key focus areas. Our total access days grew 6% year-over-year to 295 million with superior growth in the Mobile Contract segment, which already represents more than 30% of our mobile customer base.</p>
          <p>Contract net adds were strong across regions, accounting for 47% of mobile net adds in the first half and over 100% at Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a and Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. At the same time, demand for smartphones and other data devices continued to be strong, driving up mobile broadband penetration across all markets. By region, mobile broadband penetration reached 28% in Europe and 23% in Spain, although still low figure for Latin America shows a huge opportunity going forward.</p>
          <p>The rapid expansion of mobile broadband in our tiered data rates launched across all markets led to an outstanding 19% year-on-year organic increase in mobile data revenues, with a ramp up in growth in the second quarter in most markets.</p>
          <p>Mobile data revenue already account for 30% of mobile service revenue, up 4 percentage points versus the first half of 2010 with a contribution ranging from roughly 25% in Spain and Latin America to 41% in Europe.</p>
          <p>The fact that non-P2P SMS data revenues accounts for the majority of data sales in each region and continue posting very solid growth rates along with the right pricing schemes including bundles limit the cannibalization risk from new services and applications. And please notice that P2P SMS revenues continue to grow.</p>
          <p>Slide 7, we detail Telef&#xF3;nica's evolution of revenue mix. Telef&#xF3;nica LatAm emerges another quarter as the key contributor to growth, accounting together with Telef&#xF3;nica Europe for over two-thirds of consolidated sales, offsetting headwinds in Spain.</p>
          <p>Broadband and Services Beyond Connectivity already account for 26% of revenues, compensating the lower contribution from access and voice sales.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Slide 8 to talk about our business's profitability. Despite the commercial drive to boost smartphone and contract penetration along with increased network costs on higher traffic volumes and impact from inflation in some countries, operating profitability remains solid thanks to higher efficiency derived from our scale, scope and global initiatives.</p>
          <p>OpEx year-on-year growth rates slowed down for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting continued focus on efficiency improvement. As a result, consolidated OIBDA margins stood at 36.6% in the first half, a limited erosion year-on-year, but expanded 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding our full year guidance on the Slide 9, we do reiterate the outlook announced in February. In the second half we expect Telef&#xF3;nica LatAm to continue delivering their robust performance, capitalizing the synergies potentially in Brazil, and despite the negative impact from the unexpected change in regulation in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a, we're not expecting a further deterioration in OIBDA year-on-year change on the back of sustained growth in mobile data, further cost savings and the sale of non-core assets as we announced in our last investor conference. In Telef&#xF3;nica Europe we expect a steady performance in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now walk you through the operating and financial performance of these two regions, starting with Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a. Despite challenging conditions shaped by weak consumer confidence and the strong price competition, OIBDA in the second quarter showed a similar year-over-year performance as in the previous quarter. As we further deploy cost-cutting initiatives with all our OpEx items, except labor cost, showing a decline.</p>
          <p>We maintain our commercial strategy, prioritizing value over volume, and we increased the commercial resources devoted to customer loyalty, driving lower churn rates sequentially across all our services. As a result, and despite a sustained loss of high margin revenues, OIBDA margin increases sequentially more than 1 percentage points to over 45% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And we continue to expand the coverage in capacity of our fixed and mobile broadband networks as reflected in the higher CapEx year-on-year. In the slide &#x2013; on Slide 11 we provide additional color on the mobile business, where commercial activity was focused on expanding mobile broadband penetration and fostering data usage.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenue declined 8.1% year-on-year in the second quarter or 6.1% excluding MTR cuts. Voice revenues continued to be impacted by volatile usage strengths and intense price competition as reflected in voice ARPU, though price erosions slightly eased in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, data revenues were strong up 13% in the quarter and showed a ramp up in year-on-year growth rates on the back of the over 26% increase in non-peer-to-peer SMS revenues. The fact that these revenues already account for 73% of our total data revenues implies that SMS cannibalization rates from new applications is relatively low.</p>
          <p>Let me stress that SMS revenues have recorded a similar performance as in previous quarters with double-digit growth declines mainly explained by the current economic weakness. Although wireline business, users' optimization and the lower access base weighed down on voice revenues, our fixed broadband revenues remained pressured by the off year decline in a broadly stable customer base.</p>
          <p>However, it is important to notice that press competition in the quarter was more rational as most of our competitors have transferred to their customers their ULO price increase. We maintained our value-oriented strategy with more selective promotions on broadband led to a slowdown in the half year year-on-year decline. On top of that, churn improved quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>At the same time IT revenues continue to grow nicely by 15% during the month of the June on the back of our differential capabilities to target the corporate segment.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Slide 13. Despite market skepticism about our ability to further reduce costs in a very difficult environment, we have reached a three years long social agreement with the unions in less than two months since we started negotiations. This agreement will reinforce significantly our flexibility to manage our cost base, leading into future efficiency gains. On top of the new collective agreement that links for the first time salaries to OIBDA targets of the company rather than exclusively to CPI, the social agreement includes a new workforce redundancy plan in the wireline business already approved by the labor authorities involving up to 6,500 employees until 2013.</p>
          <p>The resulting cost per employee is estimated at &#x20AC;415,000 in net present value terms, including the unemployment benefits which were covered by the social security in previous plans.</p>
          <p>Regarding the financial impacts, we can tell you that at the P&amp;L level, we will account for a provision representing the net present value of payments to employees joining the plan until they reach their retirement age. This provision will be booked as non-recurring personnel expense in the second half of the year for an amount of roughly &#x20AC;2.7 billion. As benefits, we will set personal and G&amp;A expenses with positive impact in net income starting in 2012.</p>
          <p>In cash terms, yearly payments to pre-retirees are offset by the benefits related to lower personnel and G&amp;A expenses, and therefore the plan is cash flow positive since year one. Overall, we estimate the plan will generate around &#x20AC;1.4 billion of excess cash for the Group. In terms of leverage, our committed payments will gradually increase in the coming three years as employees join the plan.</p>
          <p>Moving down to Slide 14, we start the review for Latin American operations. In the second quarter, we had a strong commercial momentum with sequential increases in net adds across all services. On top of volume it is remarkable we increased the quality of the customer base with the growing rate of contracting smartphones in mobile and bundles in wireline. Topline growth remains strong at similar levels as seen in the first quarter despite a weaker performance in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Excluding Mexico, revenue growth <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:13:21) from the previous quarter to 7% year-on-year. This solid performance was reached without jeopardizing our robust profitability, posting an OIBDA growth pretty much in line with sales expansion if we exclude Mexico.</p>
          <p>Organic OIBDA margin declined by just 0.5 percentage points year-on-year to 37% in the first half. Please notice that growth rates are negatively affected in 2011 by a lower contribution from regional projects compared to 2010 as our priority this year is to deliver the projects already in place rather than launch new ones.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the solid data and broadband revenue performance driving robust growth both in mobile and wireline. Increased mobile broadband penetration on top of the healthy expansion on voice sales boosted outgoing mobile service revenue up 12.3% year-on-year in organic terms.</p>
          <p>The differential profile of our mobile customer base is reflected into year-on-year growth in ARPU. Wireline revenues were untapped in the quarter on the back of a growing contribution of internet and PayTV revenues.</p>
          <p>As of today, new services like data and mobile and internet and PayTV services and wireline already account for roughly 25% of each business sales.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the brilliant performance of our businesses in Brazil. In the second quarter, we reinforced our leading position in the market with increased net adds quarter-on-quarter in all services. Especially remarkable was the results achieved in mobile, where we continued to increase market share in the contract segment, now at 36%, raising ARPU to grow year-on-year as we leverage our leadership in the mobile broadband space.</p>
          <p>ARPU growth in customer expansion led mobile service revenues up 15% year-on-year in the first half with growth accelerating again in the quarter. Wireline revenue growth also ramped up in Q2, mainly due to a better performance of new businesses and the full consolidation of TBA. As a result, total organic revenue growth in Brazil posted the eighth consecutive quarter acceleration. More importantly, this robust performance was achieved while profitability improved as shown by the two percentage points margin expansion in the first half and the solid 13% increase in OIBDA.</p>
          <p>We will now spend a few minutes in updating you on our synergy program in Brazil. Only three quarters after closing the deal, there are clear evidences that the synergies are flowing faster than expected and that benefits will be larger than originally anticipated. As a result, we are increasing the total net pricing value of full operating synergies by 16% to a range of &#x20AC;2.7 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion, 60% of them derived from OpEx savings and the remaining 40% equally split between higher revenues and lower CapEx.</p>
          <p>On top of this we maintain our targets of &#x20AC;1 billion through &#x20AC;1.5 billion from financial and fiscal synergies. The results just explained show that the fixed and mobile businesses combined are better and stronger, and this performance will improve as we partially reinvest integration benefits to further reinforce our position in a market with significant growth potential.</p>
          <p>In 2011, operating synergies will have a positive impact in operating cash flow of over &#x20AC;120 million, but in coming years to a &#x20AC;400 million run rate from 2014. We feel very comfortable with these targets, as our execution skills are delivering tangible results.</p>
          <p>The Slide 18 will provide more color on the initiatives supporting these goals. Let me rapidly summarize them. In terms of the offer, business integration is low enough to be more competitive in the Corporate and SMEs segment, and to improve our reach as we will leverage our wireless national footprints to offer fixed services outside S&#xE3;o Paulo, while we expect to launch an integrated offer in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In platforms and efficiency, initiatives such as rationalization, unification, aggregation and optimization from core network to datacenters from customer care related activities are leading to material savings.</p>
          <p>While in terms of new services we are leveraging the global scale Telef&#xF3;nica to further innovate and expand customer spending. So to sum up our businesses in Brazil, our positive stellar performance, fully outperforming peers, and we are in the process &#x2013; we're in a process that may be the start of a virtuous and self-powered circle, as some of the synergies are reinvested into the business to continue strengthening our market leadership.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Slide 19, I will explain the recent developments in Mexico. The good news is that operating KPIs are improving quarter-on-quarter with increased volumes of gross adds with traction of our mobile broadband offer and a drastic change in outgoing traffic trends.</p>
          <p>These improvements are not yet reflected in international metrics, but give us comfort on the initiatives launched to turn the business around. But their newest other major change and renewed regulatory framework with significant cuts in termination rates, which in the short term are having and will have a painful impact on our business as you can see on the slide.</p>
          <p>Please know this, these impacts are maximum impacts, as they do not include any elasticity effect. On the other hand this drastic change could erode in the mid to long term some competitive advantages of the dominant player, improving our market positioning.</p>
          <p>In our view, the regulatory review is incomplete and therefore, we expect the regulatory framework to continue evolving to tackle different positions in the market with the different regulatory rules.</p>
          <p>And to finish off with Latin America, just two comments. The southern region performance remains very robust. In Venezuela, we have made a remarkable progress in our commercial proposition, allowing us to post the strong topline growth and very solid margins.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Slide 21 to talk about Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe continued the execution of its value over volume strategy, delivering a good financial performance despite challenging environments and severe regulation.</p>
          <p>Past growth in mobile broadband penetration together with successful tiered data pricing led to a solid mobile data revenue growth of 12% year-over-year, leveraging outstanding 32% peer-to-peer SMS sales. Smartphone penetration will further increase the second half of the year, leveraging on some &#x20AC;100 handset availability.</p>
          <p>OIBDA increased over 3% organically in the first half. That's increasing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:19:59) in acquiring and retaining the best value customers, a negative impact from regulation were offset by efficiencies from business restructuring and additional scale from network platform sharing. As a result, OIBDA margin slightly expanded to 27% after June.</p>
          <p>The Group also continued to actively invest in new business areas such as financial services, multimedia, which are now beginning to have a noticeable impact mainly on increased customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica U.K., as Slide 22 shows, continued building a profitable mobile broadband ecosystem. Strong demand for smartphones from new and existing customers drove penetration up to 35% with 55% of contract smartphone users in the consumer segment already based on tiered data plan.</p>
          <p>To highlight is the fact that most of these customers are taking the upper tier range of the tariffs, limiting the cannibalization risk from IP voice and messaging apps. As a result, customer spend was broadly stable over the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Six months revenue continued to be fueled by non-peer-to-peer SMS data, but we're up 32% year-on-year in the first half. In Q2 sales performance was sharply impacted by MTR cuts from April by 4 percentage points and by the progressive change in the company's commercial relationship model with some distributors until the second quarter of 2010. Please notice this effect will not affect year-on-year comparisons in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>OIBDA performance remained strong, driven by muted commercial activity and ongoing cost efficiencies. The steep quarter-on-quarter slowdown was mainly due to different MTR cuts in the U.K. market, explaining close to 8 percentage points of the deceleration.</p>
          <p>Let's now review our operations in Germany where we continue to enjoy a strong commercial momentum in mobile. A good traction of tariffs like O2 Blue and past adoption of smartphones is strongly supported by the My Handy distribution model, led to close to 406,000 contract data up to June, accounting for two-thirds of the total driven by the strong production in the consumer and business segments.</p>
          <p>The company is already showing tangible benefits in customer loyalty as reflected in contract churn declining trend. Non-peer-to-peer SMS revenue continued to post solid growth at 65% year-on-year in Q2, accelerating sequentially and leading to a quarter-on-quarter ramp-up in MSR growth to over 7% ex-MTRs.</p>
          <p>OIBDA rose close to 2% and the margin remained flattish at 23% in the first half as we reinvested the benefits from restructuring the business integration to foster commercial activity. We also launched LTE in several rural areas in Germany with a limited impact in CapEx, as most sites are located within the current 2G 900 megahertz grid.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 24, I would like to mention that we maintained net interest expense pretty stable year-on-year. They stayed below &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the first half despite the fact that the average total debt increased 17%. The debt increase has led our leverage ratio, total net debt, plus commitments over OIBDA slightly above the upper part of our target range.</p>
          <p>The excess debt over 2.5 times would have been offset if working capital consumption has been within the target range communicated in our investor conference. We are working to beat our goal of working capital consumption in 2011.</p>
          <p>I want also to highlight our solid liquidity position with close to &#x20AC;8 billion of unused, committed grid lines as of June 2011, most of them long-term, on top of &#x20AC;2 billion for the pending payment to fit the Brasilcel.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we have posted a solid set of numbers amid difficult trading conditions, including severe mobile termination rate cuts. Revenue trends continue to be strong, while profitability was stable to improving quarter-on-quarter. Our unique footprint in Latin America is boosting growth. We are leading the mobile broadband opportunity, monetizing it through Tier II data rates. We continue to prove our solid execution skills with significant progress in key strategic areas in two months.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would like to reiterate our confidence to deliver on our commitments. We are well on track to meet 2011 guidance, and despite operating challenges free cash flow generation will be ahead of our initial estimates by yearend, as we'll leverage on capital discipline and further initiatives to improve working capital. No doubt we will meet our dividend targets for the next years.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and we now stand ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I had a clarification and a question. The clarification was just around what you were saying about guidance. You said last quarter you expected growth to accelerate through the year. That statement hasn't been repeated, so it would just be helpful to understand how you see the sort of sequential momentum? And also when you mentioned assets out in Spain preventing any further deterioration in the EBITDA growth year-on-year, could you try and quantify that? That would be really helpful? And then the question maybe I have is around the U.K. market, where again I didn't understand the comments around the change in distribution model. Also I was surprised to see the very sharp slowdown in traffic growth. So if you could comment on those factors and the causes, that would be helpful?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Julio Linares. Let me take your first question. We had expected better performance around the year, but our results have been weighed down by a few operations like Spain or recoveries taking longer than we expected. And Mexico where we have the impact of NTR cuts, because of that &#x2013; because the turnaround has taken &#x2013; has been slower than we expected. Now we don't think that we can talk anymore about the expected to be a year, we've had back end load it in our results. But we do confirm our guidance both on revenues and OIBDA margin. So we confirm that our expected growth will be at 2% of revenues. And we are expecting a limited erosion of our OIBDA margin.</p>

          <p>Hi, Tim. It's Matthew. Just to pick up your two points on the U.K.. First up, we have made a change in quarter two 2010 where with distribution channels we move from sort of a revenue share model to a more traditional sec model, which would have boosted Q2 2010 revenue and therefore obviously reduced the year-over-year growth Q2 to Q2 '11.</p>
          <p>On the traffic growth point, in the U.K. Q2 voice was down 8%, traffic SMS up 18%. If behind your question, do we see any significant impact from OTT products? No, we don't. Interestingly, capital spend deterioration didn't accelerate, so it was about minus 3 in Q1, about minus 3 in Q2, that's customer spend. And the good news is that the subscriptions, which are becoming more and more important of our data &#x2013; of our overall revenue remained stable. So the fact that customer spend went down was largely driven by out-of-bundle minute, which was driven by the voice reducing. But no overall significant impact from OTT products.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I would to address the first question to Mr. Linares regarding the slowdown in Spain. Perhaps Mr. Ansaldo can also step in. Do you see that this is more of a secular shift happening on the market on pricing both in mobile and in fixed line broadband? And if that's the case, is your strategy of value over volume truly rightly directed, because basically we're heading more towards a price driven model in the market. And does the head count reduction specifically give you that flexibility to become more competitive in the future? That would be my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the Atento IPO that was canceled, I would like to know whether you still have plans to float it again any time this year. I know that the market situation was poor, but &#x2013; and if not, could you give some visibility whether that would even be a priority anymore or not? We may be considering that in our cash flow estimates. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. I will take the questions regarding Spain. The first part of your first question regarding the slowdown in Spain is both in fixed and mobile when you compare second quarter with the first quarter. It's an acceleration of the decline. It's both pricing and consumption, maybe mobile we see the combination of both, of pricing and consumption. In the fixed, maybe the more recent news is that despite the deceleration in consumption as the &#x2013; the slower growth in fixed broadband market. We're seeing some more rational behavior on the pricing side as the different competitors are adjusting their tariffs to the new ULL prices. But we continue with our value over volume strategy. We will continue focusing on quality of service and commercial efficiency, and obviously we see opportunities to attract and protect customers with high value, we'll go for it. The proof of that is that we continue focusing on contract and postpaid in mobile, and obviously for example what we are doing in data and mobile and also in IT in the corporate.</p>
          <p>And also on that side we changed our organization to have in the commercial side a geographical closer approach with our customers. So we can have direct decision making processes on the commercial side on the field, and that will helps us to be more precise in targeting customers or situations which we believe that we can create more value. Obviously, the head count reduction will in the next three years &#x2013; this year and next three years will improve our profitability, and that will give us flexibility to reinforce our strategy and to be more effective on the market.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; [066LRR-E Santiago Javier Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena]This is Santiago. On Atento, if you read again the communication that we produced, the word we used, and we used it carefully, was we suspend the IPO process. So it has not been cancelled. We continue to think that this is the right thing to do with Atento. And the reasons why we couldn't complete it are related to the rich stage of the market. [indiscernible] (00:32:30) markets as we expect should improve, we'll look at it heavily again. So the current plan continues to wait for market conditions to improve, and if that is the case we will take it again on the public markets.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jesus Romero from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; [06ZQZ4-E Jesus Romero]Thank you. I have two questions. The first one on the U.K. I don't know if, Matthew, you could explain the contract ARPU dropped quite a bit in the quarter. I don't know if you can give us a bit more detail on what [indiscernible] (00:33:05) and perhaps talk about the outlook for the second part of the year in the U.K.?</p>
          <p>And then the second question on the net debt to EBITDA of 256, if I look at the second part of the year, you have &#x20AC;3.5 billion of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:33:22) commitments, a spectrum auction in Spain, a &#x20AC;2.7 billion restructuring in charge and potentially FX adjustment to your Venezuela cash position. What can you tell us about net debt to EBITDA or what do you think will be for the another year. You think will be under the 25 range? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jesus, let me pick up your point on &#x2013; I think it was contract ARPU rather than blended ARPU, was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; [06CJW6-E Matthew Key]Yes. If you look at contract ARPU, you can look it from two angles really, one which is a sort of customer usage profile, and one with a spend profile. Clearly the main thing that drove the ARPU reduction was the MTR cut. Overall we've been probably heavier impacted by the MTR cut than the other operators. From a total revenue perspective it's probably reduced our revenue about 4.6 percentage points in the quarter, which will continue through the rest of the year. I just think we've got higher element of prepaid subs than the other operators.</p>
          <p>But on postpaid ARPU, when you look into what's happening, voice is coming down, SMS is coming down, but data is going up quite significantly. And the good news on data is we are getting a higher data ARPU per user across the total base. But also the customers that are taking a data bolt-on are increasing their spend as well, and that's not just a U.K. phenomenon. That is an across Europe phenomenon as well, which I think is good news. The other way of looking at it is between subscriptions and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:51) bundle. As I said earlier on subscriptions actually are broadly flat. So we're holding our subscriptions level, effectively the access fee, at a level which is really important for future tariffing from a product bundling perspective. The element is going down is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:08) bundle, and that's largely because of the minute reduction that I answered to Jim's question earlier on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesus, taking your question on the leverage ratio, we really expect at year-end to be below the 250. So complying with our commitment, there are several factors that make us confident on achieving that goal. On the first hand we have our capital generation, which is going to accelerate across the year, especially due to working capital management. If you see, we have been pegging this quarter or this semester, a high amount of CapEx and will be young, will have been accrued, and this is not going to happen in the second half of the year, rather the opposite.</p>
          <p>Also some of the payments we have in the second half such as the spectrum in Spain can be split into tranches, so roughly 50% of that will be paid later in 2012. And regarding the impact of the new provision from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:36:32) taking into account that they are non-cash and that and we are going to recognize as debt really which we owe to creditors. So the portion that is going to be signed with employees will become actual creditors of the company this year. And that could be a little bit over one-third of their total provision. And on top of that, as you know, our guidance on the leverage reduces that amount by the tax savings associated to this commitment, which is different in comparison with the normal debt, which has not a tax shield on the principal. That's it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Perhaps if I could extend the previous question one year forward, so as you add more employees, and therefore you recognize more commitment, obviously it will benefit EBITDA, but that takes longer. If you do exceed your target of 2.5 times, is it something you have to be firmly within by year end, or is it something you wish to be around that level in the next two or three years? Therefore, even if temporarily you move beyond that, it wouldn't necessarily change the way you do things. And can you please clarify again regarding the tax impact whether this year next year, the provisions you'll take will benefit the cash tax?</p>
          <p>And my second question is again regarding the agreement and the part where you've changed the way salaries are linked to EBITDA targets rather than the CPI. Could you give us an idea what the impact could be to numbers? Is it possible to tell us where you stand? How much would that reduce OpEx? Has it been implemented so far this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our leverage commitment is commitment to be respective certainly at yearend is not for the medium term. Although there may be temporary deviations, as we have had this semester, we have to work to correct them. And as I told you before, we feel confident that we will do it in the near future.</p>
          <p>Regarding the implications on tax of the commitments, we will recognize this next quarter &#x20AC;2.7 billion of charge. This will have an impact on our accrued tax, not on cash taxes. The cash tax savings will appear when we pay, and we will start making payments next year, and then we will save there 30% in taxes of every yearly payment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo. Regarding the agreement with the unions and for Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a first a clarification, this is only for the fixed business, which is half the majority of the employees, as you know. In the past the salary increases were linked to CPI. It was clear. Now what we have is a scale that's dependent on the achievement of our targets in this specific company. The salary increase will move from 1% in any case as the floor or to CPI as a ceiling, and an additional non-cash residual amount it will go through, for example, 103%, 105% of achievements. So the impact on the accounts will depend on the how the business goes. If we hit our targets, there is no comparable impact because we will hit CPI in any case.</p>
          <p>If we are under our targets in this company, we will have an increase which is lower than the one we had been given in the past. So this will give us more alignment of our expenses with our EPA. So we are having a great year over achieving targets, it will be similar. If we are under, we are gaining flexibility, and in terms of the increase, and this is an increase of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:40:56) revenue. So basically it's more variable if you want to call it a structure.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Wanted to confirm, you just mentioned that in the 2011 debt provision from the social plans should be around one-third of the total provision. So wondering whether that means that one third of the employees are supposed to sign up for the plan? This year whether you can give us any light on whether this is going to be in the last part of the year or any savings should be accrued this year or is pretty much going to come next year? This is the first question, and the second question is on your EBITDA guidance of margin having limited erosion relative to last year. In the first half, you are putting a tick in that box. Last year it was &#x2013; this quarter &#x2013; this first half it's been 36%. It was a 1% compression, but for the full year the reference you gave is 38% in 2010. So I'm wondering whether if you stay around 36% for the second half, and this is a two percentage point compression, this is still considered as a limited erosion? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Luis, this is Miguel. Taking your question, your first question, let me stress we are going to open the full accounting provision in the third quarter, roughly &#x20AC;2.7 billion. From the leverage ratio point of view, we have always been avoiding double counting. This means that we are not including in the FDA this provision, but rather we're adding up to our debt the equivalent debt commitment. And we will have there debt equivalent commitments when we have actual creditors. This means that we will recognize the amount of that corresponding to people actually signing this year. And we estimate this could exceed one-third of the total raise we are targeting. That's it.</p>

Can you give us some idea on the outlook going forward, you've seen competitors reducing prices, the consumer is still impacted. How do you see Spain will develop in the second half from a competitive and revenue generating environment?</p>
          <p>And the other one is back to the U.K. and the impact of the change in distribution agreement. Can you give us some idea how much of the non-MTR slowdown we can put towards the distribution agreement, i.e. one-off and how much is the consumer trying to get its spending in order? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Torsten, this is Guillermo. Regarding outlook for the rest of the year. What we have seen and now for example July is similar trends as we've seen in the second quarter. It remains consume, consumption, contraction and obviously price competition more intense in the mobile recently as we mentioned before. So we don't see any major change in the near future, maybe by the end of the year we can some signs. But to be honest, July looks similar to second quarter, and there's a lot of volatility. So we expect a similar scenario.</p>
          <p>We have several initiatives on the cost side to balance on the OIBDA side, and that's why we're saying that we see no further duration on the OIBDA year-over-year change. So there's an increase, but not more than now we see up to now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Torsten, hi, just to pick up your question on the U.K. I've sort of got a mental model where I sort of reconcile between Q1 growth and Q2 growth. So Q1 was plus 4%, take out 4.5% for MTRs, and if Q2 is minus 4% you've got another three percentage points to go, which is roughly &#x2013; very roughly split one-third the accounting classification point, one-third lower base growth and one-third customer spending. So that's the broad split. As we've said, the third from the accounting classification distribution element doesn't continue. Base growth, we will have some more momentum in the second half. We probably won't recover to the levels we were at last year and the spending is very much a consumer confidence question, I think, for the U.K.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. First a question on Brazil, very strong revenue growth on mobile and fixed, now a part of that is rushed out through the intercompany elimination. And I wanted to see if it was possible to get a little bit of clarity as to what kind of revenues are these appearing? Where do they come from essentially? Is it essentially corporate? Is it retail &#x2013; I mean residential?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with the working capital. You highlight that typically in H2 you tend to recover some of the working capital investment that you do in H1, and in fact that's what happened in the last few years. The only question was in 2010 you actually had a very positive working capital impact of &#x20AC;2.6 billion or &#x20AC;2.7 billion which helped obviously, and I was wondering therefore if we should expect in 2011 a real recovery in working capital of which <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:48:20), because maybe some of the things were passed in 2010, and I'm thinking about for example Brazilian spectrum or Mexican spectrum, those things will actually not revert in 2011? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on Brazil and the revenue growth, the consolidated revenue growth and the impact of inter-relation between both companies, wireline and wireless. I continue that you have the effect on the elimination part of our disclosure. So you can have an idea there of what's the impact of inter &#x2013; of traffic inter-related between both business that has significantly increased due to the promotion of domestic long distance followed through the mobile. Now that we are in control of both business, we have become more aggressive commercially speaking and before we have been able to be more present on the market and be more competitive, namely against Brazil.</p>
          <p>But in order to give you an idea of how the underlying trends in revenue are growing in the different business, both wireline and wireless, excluding that effect. Let me tell you that the line losses, the traditional line losses has been limited in this second quarter, limited in the first quarter, we have heavy rains. So we are losing 1.2% of our lines, but the second quarter has been much better than the first one. And therefore we &#x2013; and 70% of our lines have bundled.</p>
          <p>Broadband growing &#x2013; on the wireline side is growing more than 17% and TV is growing 45%. It includes the TVA customers, but excluding that effect it will be growing in the neighborhood of 10%. On the side of Vivo, the underlying growth of our service revenue is growing 14%, almost 15%. But data ARPU is already 22% of total. Data revenue is growing 42%. Non-SMS data revenue is growing 42.5%. The data ARPU service is growing almost 22%, and total customer base is growing 14%. So all underlying metrics, even excluding the effect of this interconnection, dial charges are very, very strong. We can be more detailed in further explanation, and if you want to have a specific idea of underlying trends, you have the elimination part of our statements, the interrelation between both companies.</p>

          <p>Hello, Mathieu, this is Miguel. Well it is true that this year we are not going to have some extraordinary items improving the working capital, which are mainly related to GR and provisions in 2010 which have not any cash payment that year. But this is not what I understand managing the working capital. We have the strategies here. Our program as we communicated in our Investor Day to improve the working capital and working with suppliers in the CapEx area, and also accelerating throughout the group in the payment terms in OpEx and improving the collection. And we feel pretty confident that this is going to give fruits, it is starting to do it right now, and then it will accelerate in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Also the CapEx trend is quite clear, and we will still have one extraordinary effect as I have mentioned before due to the delayed payment of the Spanish Spectrum option. We expect to beat the target we communicated in our Investor Day of 2% to 5% consumption in working capital over operating cash flow. We are confident in doing better that that.</p>

And eventually, do you have any kind of internal targets in terms of the timing to stabilize Mexico &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:52:55) Mexico. That's about Mexico.</p>
          <p>And the second one in Spain, again, I don't know if you could update us on the fiber and VDSL rollout and how that is affecting your share of net adds in those regions where you're rolling out the network?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete speaking. Well, in Mexico in terms of the tariffs that we have launched pretty recently is the reaction of the new interconnection of the new MTR scenario in Mexico. We have launched a tariff that includes all destination, including that is all networks in order to take &#x2013; to try to take advantage of these reductions in the entry barrier to the &#x2013; namely to the Telcel community.</p>
          <p>The competitor has reacted immediately, but I think that it is one of the effects of the potential positive effects of the interconnection reduction, and we want to foster that as soon as possible. Having said that, we are in open conversations with the regulator, because we think that this drop has been too severe and too immediate. And therefore we have conversation, because we disagree on some of the calculations they have used in order to reach this level of MTRs. I think that those conversations are open, and we think that the competitive environment in Mexico is still in front of the regulatory point. It is still not closed.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the situation in Mexico, it's a weak quarter from a financial account, very weak quarter, because of the year-on-year comparison with revenues down 30% and OIBDA, well, dropping 30%. It is true that because of the deterioration from our financial standpoint, it started in the third and most importantly in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The year-on-year comparison is going to be better. Because of the end of the day, the underlying operating metric is targeting better. We are intensifying our CapEx deployment, namely in 3G, while basically doubling the amount of base station in the country.</p>
          <p>Data revenue is growing 11%, that was namely almost flattish in the first quarter, non-SMS data revenue is growing &#x2013; is almost tripling. Mobile broadband adopt is growing 180%, the total customer base is growing almost 13% and contract customers 21%. The traffic is growing 4.7% for the first time in the last three quarters. Our net traffic growing 7%, and more use has had a limited decline. So in summary, we see some turnaround in the operational metrics that should start to be reflected from here until year-end.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo regarding the &#x2013; your questions about fiber, but you can infer from the CMK data is that if I remember as quantity it is very limited, less than &#x2013; in our case less than 2% of our total broadband planned. We are focusing in this stage in improving the processes, the quality of installation, the customer experience and also the commercial side how to sale these services in the places where we will footprint. This is very early stages. We are learning, and there has no material impact at all on our overall numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I have two questions please. Firstly, if you have to choose the yearend between three of your stated targets, that is paying the full dividend, keeping debt to EBITDA under 2.5 times and paying the dividend of organic cash flow rather than debt, how would you prioritize among those? And then the second question is how would you rate the probability of a significantly worse MTR cut in Brazil occurring? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John, this is Santiago. When we get to the year end, I am convinced 100% that we'll have been able to show that the commitments that we set for ourselves are fully doable. So I would not engage in a theoretical discussion as to what comes first, because all three are realizable. We're going to meet all three, and when we produce those numbers, we think we come with a sufficient inclusion, sufficient degree of leeway, so that we are comfortably going to meet our growth, our margins and our dividend commitments without any further strain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the question of our MTRs in the Brazil, no news on that front yet. The conversation or the rumors or the noise that we are hearing from the market is that &#x2013; is going into the direction of our progressive quarter glide capacity scenarios rather than our drastic initial debt, but no further news so far.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for &#x2013; two things please. Could you clarify the dividend language around the 2013 and on with dividend? And secondly, could you just sort of let us know what sort of magnitude of cash flow are you expecting to repatriate from Latin America annually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jonathan, this is Santiago. On the dividend language, let me be again specific. What we have said is that we are going to pay a full dividend in cash out of the results to be generated in 2012 of &#x20AC;1.75 per share. Starting 2013 that is be paid in late 2013 and nearly 2014 as the calendar goes. We left the window open not to change the amount but to be open, that is optional towards the content of that payment. So we could at that time ask around and see whether a buyback would be more interesting as a partial commitment as we have done in the past and the forecast.</p>
          <p>But no decision has been done. We don't have any strong preference for either. Mobile has enough time from now until the end of the 2012 to ask around and see what the investor community feels if there is a majority feeling.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you roll out a script dividend?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When the time comes, we will get there. What we have said is that at these low valuation levels it would not make much sense from our perspective to increase the share count. So it will not be used script dividend the sense of increasing those shares is not something is that is in our arsenal yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to Mar&#xED;a and Santiago, and thank you for taking my call. I just have two questions today, both concern Telef&#xF3;nica's leveraged target and evolution there and following into Jesus and Georgios' questions.</p>
          <p>Miguel I did not see reiteration of Telef&#xF3;nica's 2.0 to 2.5 times leveraged target in the slides or in the detailed report's text. Now is that because the social agreement, which is MTV-positive in the long-term, and it has the slightly leveraging effect was not included in previous guidance. Or is that fully offset by the additional tax synergies in Brazil, which was also not included? And if not, is deleveraging now a longer term ambition perhaps for 2013 or beyond? Or is Telef&#xF3;nica's new central tendency around 2.5 times gearing, and if so increasing rather than stable to declining gross debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our leverage target has been set in a way that we are going to be able to comply whatever we do, and we consider any movement we do we with its impact in the leverage. Really the recent provisions in Spain are going to increase obviously our commitments. But as I have told you, this could be one-third of what we have been commenting, and this will be offset by cash flow generation, because we have not just the ambition of generating cash flow to pay the dividend, but to have some leeway for other purposes and including this debt cancellation.</p>
          <p>Obviously, in the equation and when looking forward we take into account everything, and we take into account the tax savings in Brazil as we take the tax savings in Spain or any other country or the cash flow generation from the business. But we will continue moving towards the medium part of the range in the coming years.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, with this we come to the end of this conference call. We thank you for having spent the time to listen to us. And for those of you who still haven't enjoyed their summer break, probably well deserved. Please take it. And we will be back with the Q3 numbers sometime in mid-November. Thanks very much, and have a good day.</p>
