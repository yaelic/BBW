          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question and answer, sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Diana Sands, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sands, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings call. I'm Diana Sands, and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and James Bell, Boeing's Corporate President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>After comments by Jim and James, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question, please. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to remind that you any projections and goals we may include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking disclosures at the end of this web presentation.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diana, and good morning. Let me start today with a discussion of our 2009 performance and the evolving business environment. After that, James will walk you through our results and outlook, and then we'd be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Starting with slide 2. 2009 was a challenging year for our company, but in the end it was a year of significant achievement and one that we exited with momentum in our favor. We confronted an unprecedented market environment, with the global recession affecting our commercial business in the form of reduced orders, softening services revenues, lower delivery price escalation forecasts, and our decision to reduce 777 production rates. At the same time, the U.S. Defense Department and other agencies began re-evaluating their key priorities amid significant budget pressures, which has impacted some of our defense programs, most notably in the areas of Army modernization and missile defense.</p>
          <p>Despite these business environment pressures, and development program challenges that I'll speak to in a moment, our fundamental core operating engine continued to perform well. We delivered record revenue for the year in both our Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space &amp; Security businesses, while production programs like the 737, 777, and our portfolio of military aircraft delivered strong earnings.</p>
          <p>Our defense services business earned double-digit margins and grew its top line 18%, of which 16% was organic growth. Our commercial services business also maintained strong double-digit margins, even as it experienced marketplace realities that brought revenue down 6%. Our combined services business generated more than 13 billion of revenue in 2009, and this continues to be an area we are intent on growing and leveraging across the company.</p>
          <p>Our cash performance was outstanding given both market and development program pressures during the year. Disciplined cash management across all areas of the company paid off, as we generated 5.6 billion in operating cash flow, while at the same time made significant 787 investments in both R&amp;D and inventory.</p>
          <p>Regarding our development programs, there is no question that the 787 side-of-body issue and the increased cost we experienced on the 747-8 significantly affected our overall financial results. But through the diligent efforts of our team, the signs of progress are evident and we are achieving important milestones toward getting these sought-after products into the hands of our customers.</p>
          <p>The 787's first flight on December 15 was truly an historic moment in aviation, as this game-changing product has a level of technological advancement not seen since the 707. Since then, airplanes one and two have collectively made more than 15 flights encompassing more than 60 flight hours. Pilots have taken the airplane to an altitude of 30,000 feet and a speed of mach 0.65. Initial stall tests and other dynamic maneuvers have been completed, as well as extensive systems checkouts. Initial airworthiness was achieved earlier this month, and in the weeks ahead, we will continue to expand the flight envelope and move deep into a rigorous flight-testing regime. While there is much work to be done in the challenging days ahead, we are pleased with the progress we have made to date.</p>
          <p>We expect that the third and fourth flight-test airplanes will make their flight tests in February and that all six airplanes will be flying by the end of the second quarter. The production ramp-up is also progressing, as we prepare to deliver our first 787 late this year. We expect to be at a production rate of 10 airplanes per month by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>To support that rate build-up, gain tighter control of our supply chain, and better diversify our manufacturing base, we took several recent steps focused on the program's operations in South Carolina. We acquired Vought's 787 facilities and Alenia's share of the Global Aeronautica joint venture, while also breaking ground on the North Charleston 787 final assembly line. We believe these actions will help ensure the success of the 787 program for our customers and sustain our company's competitiveness over the longer term. We continue to be pleased with the 787 market success, with approximately 850 firm orders from 56 customers around the world.</p>
          <p>On the 747-8, we anticipate first flight and the start of our flight-test program in the very near future. We expect to deliver the first freighter at the end of this year and the first passenger variant in the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe strongly in the long-term market for this airplane and see the order by Korean Air late last year as evidence for that.</p>
          <p>Beyond those two programs, there were several other development program successes in 2009. The 777 freighter had its first delivery; the EA-18G was approved for full rate production; and the P-8A made its first flight during the year. Even as the Future Combat Systems program was restructured and it is now called Brigade Combat Team Modernization, the team executed well to its plan. Increment one of this program was approved for low-rate production in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our efforts to incorporate lessons learned from our development program challenges will remain a priority for us. We have been reintroducing rigorous functional disciplines across the company. And as part of those efforts, we recently appointed nine senior engineering leaders to work closely with program teams to help ensure technical integrity and excellence in critical areas of engineering expertise.</p>
          <p>As we begin 2010, we are reassured by the fact that our fundamental product and services strategy and competitiveness remain intact. We have built a large backlog, which at year-end stood at $316 billion. Commercial Airplanes booked 263 gross orders in 2009, and its backlog now stands at $250 billion, representing more than seven times its annual revenue.</p>
          <p>Our defense business, recently renamed Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, has a backlog of $65 billion. This business had several key wins in 2009, including the INTELSAT satellite contract and key proprietary and services contracts. We also sold P-8s to India, Chinooks to Canada and Italy, and C-17s to the UAE. We have been pleased with the further international interest in C-17s, and the U.S. congressional support of this program.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, this is a solid company with strong core businesses and significant growth potential, but we continue to face a challenging market environment, which I'll now address on slide 3. The global recession has clearly affected our airline customers in the form of reduced air traffic growth and resulting capacity reductions. While consumer sentiment appears to be improving, we believe it will take some time for economic indicators to rebound significantly.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenging environment, our commercial backlog is holding strong with over 3,300 firm orders. In 2009, BCA had 121 order cancelations and accommodated 271 aircraft deferrals. There were 57 deferrals in the fourth quarter, down from 84 in the third quarter, and the backlog of deferral requests has decreased. There has been no change in our production rate plans, which include holding the 737 at its current rate into the foreseeable future. We believe the discipline we have exercised in managing both production rates and market opportunities has paid off. We foresee holding to our production plans without having to enter into bad business deals for the company. In fact, we remain oversold in 2011 with a strong customer base.</p>
          <p>On the defense side, our focus continues to be threefold: Extend our existing programs by bringing capability and affordability to our customers, capture a healthy share of the international and services opportunities, and accelerate our repositioning with investment in adjacent markets, including cyber security, intelligence and surveillance, and unmanned systems.</p>
          <p>In light of the challenging business environment in both commercial and defense, we continue to be vigilant in our drive to become more productive. We ended the year with over 9,300 job reductions, just shy of the 10,000 we anticipated for 2009. Our plan reflects ongoing head count reductions in light of continued market pressures and related productivity requirements.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize by reiterating that despite challenges in 2009, I believe we are making good progress across the company and that we have faced the market and development program challenges head-on, accompanied by a relentless focus to improve competitiveness and reduce costs.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to James, who will provide a more detailed review of the numbers and our outlook. James.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with our 2009 results on slide 4.</p>
          <p>Revenue for the year was a record $68.3 billion, which was up 12% from a year ago. 2008's results were impacted by the strike, which reduced revenues by $6.4 billion. Earnings per share was $1.84, which includes previously announced 787 and 747 impacts. 2009 EPS was reduced $2.38 due to the reclassification of the first three 787 flight test airplanes from program inventory to R&amp;D expense. In addition, we took charges totaling $1.20 per share on the 747 program as a result of difficult market conditions and higher cost estimates. Because this program is in a loss position, costs associated with those factors were recorded during 2009 for future 747-8 deliveries.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned, the operating cash flow for the year was strong at $5.6 billion. This performance reflects disciplined operational management across the entire company and includes outstanding cash collections during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the fourth quarter performance on slide 5. Revenue of $17.9 billion was up 42% from the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2008 revenue was reduced by $4.3 billion due to the strike. Earnings per share was $1.75, driven by a strong performance across both businesses and a residual tax benefit from the third quarter charges.</p>
          <p>I will discuss our airplane businesses in more detail on slide 6. Boeing Commercial Airplanes' fourth quarter revenue of $9.2 billion reflects increased deliveries and a greater mix of wide-body airplanes. The team delivered operating margins of 11.1% in the quarter, driven by strong execution across its production and services programs and favorable delivery mix. Fourth quarter R&amp;D expenses were lower than expected, driven by timing of the operating model adjustment to better balance 787 development between Boeing and our suppliers. This timing shift has no impact on the overall 787 schedule or cost estimating.</p>
          <p>Gross inventory for the company now includes $7.3 billion related to 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling, and other non-recurring costs, an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter. We expect the rate of increase in 2010 to be slightly higher as we prepare to begin deliveries later this year. As part of our normal closing process, we performed a 787 profitability assessment and determined that the program is not in a loss for. This analysis evaluates all the revenue and cost assumptions associated with the expected initial accounting quantity. Included were costs related to the side-of-body modification, the schedule revision in August, anticipated production and productivity improvements, and the R&amp;D operating model adjustment.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress on further productivity improvements, while at the same time face increased profit pressure driven by the second assembly line and lower delivery price escalation assumptions. Supplier assertion discussions are progressing, and although we're in the early stages right now, we expect to make substantial progress this year. Customer discussions are also ongoing, with about 30% of them complete. Both were tracking to expectations, but we still have a lot of work ahead.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that initial deliveries for new programs typically start out with low or zero margins and improve over time. We anticipate that 787 will follow the same pattern. We will continually assess this program's profitability in advance of first delivery, expected later this year, and will provide you further insights as we gain them.</p>
          <p>For the year, we delivered 481 commercial airplanes, including most ever 737 and 777 deliveries in a given year. BCA captured 263 gross orders and canceled 121 orders, ending the year with a backlog of $250 billion.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 7 and our Defense, Space &amp; Security business. Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security delivered margins of 9.7% on revenues of $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong performance across the vast majority of its program, which was offset by higher costs of 133 million on the AEW&amp;C program. The unit delivered 121 production aircraft and six satellites during 2009 and continued to capture new business and achieve key program milestones, many of which Jim mentioned.</p>
          <p>For the year, Defense, Space &amp; Security generated $33.7 billion of revenue on strong growth in services and military aircraft. Operating margins were 9.8%, reflecting good overall performance. We were pleased with the relative strength and stability that this business provides us. It has performed very well, even with shifting DoD priorities and increasing budget pressures.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn slide 8, to our other businesses. In 2009, Boeing Capital delivered solid pre-tax earnings, reduced its portfolio size, and returned cash dividends to Boeing &#x2013; all that against a backdrop of an economic downturn and challenging financial markets. Boeing Capital financed approximately $800 million of new aircraft and other volume in 2009 and expects to finance less than $500 million of new volume this year.</p>
          <p>Now let me discuss our pension plan performance in 2009. Our asset returns for the year were approximately 15%, driven by strong equity market performance. Discount rates decreased from 6.1% in 2008 to 5.8% at the end of 2009. During the fourth quarter, we contributed approximately 29 million Boeing shares valued at $1.5 billion to our pension plans. The company's pension plans are now 88% funded on a financial accounting basis, and that's up from 83% funded at the end of 2008. 2010 pension expense is expected to be $1.2 billion, an increase of 300 million versus last year, driven by smoothing in of the 2008 market performance. The increase will be realized at the business units, and a portion will be reimbursed through government contracts. We expect required funding in 2010 to be less than $100 million. We also expect 2011 funding requirements to be minimal, but they will depend on this year's market performance.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 9 and discuss cash flow. In addition to the $5.6 billion of operating cash flow we generated in 2009, we also issued $5 billion of corporate debt at very attractive rates, which solidified a strong liquidity position. Boeing Capital separately issued $1 billion of new debt while paying down over $500 million of maturing debt.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 10. The debt issuances, coupled with the strong operating cash flow performance, position us well as we enter 2010. With over $11 billion of cash and marketable securities, the company has ample liquidity to continue in investing in our development efforts and growth strategies while dealing with ongoing market uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 11. Our financial guidance anticipates solid operating performance amid lower 777 volume and reduced scope on Army modernization and missile defense programs. Revenues are forecasted to be between 64 and $66 billion. We're setting 2010 EPS guidance at $3.70 to $4 per share. This reflects the lower volumes due to the marketplace impacts and continued investment in our business. It also considers some additional uncertainties in both commercial and defense markets and some short-term risks around our development program. We expect first quarter revenue, EPS, and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timings of volumes and delivery. Q1 EPS is estimated to be between 15 and 20% of full-year earnings.</p>
          <p>Our 2010 commercial delivery forecast is between 460 and 465 airplanes and is sold out. This includes a few 787s and 747-8s as we begin delivering these airplanes at the end of this year. Our 2010 operating cash flow guidance is approximately zero, reflecting a sizeable buildup of 787 and 747 inventory for delivery in 2011. As we deliver those aircraft next year, we expect operating cash flow to rebound to a level above $5 billion in 2011, and we also expect revenues to be higher next year. In 2010, we expect other segment expense to be about $200 million and unallocated expense to be approximately $800 million. This includes some of the provisions for market and development program uncertainties.</p>
          <p>2010 R&amp;D expense is forecasted to be between 3.9 and $4.1 billion and includes approximately $100 million associated with the first three 787 flight-test aircraft. We're not forecasting any supplier cost-sharing receipts this year or in 2011. We expect 2011 R&amp;D expense to decrease by more than $500 million, a substantial reduction but one that retains funds to support the 787 and 747 derivatives and pursue potential investments in the 777 and the 737. We're forecasting capital expenditures to be $1.9 billion in 2010, including 700 million for the majority of the 787 capital investments in South Carolina. We expect 2011 capital expenditures to trend down.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to slide 12 to discuss how we bridge our 2009 performance to our 2010 guidance. As Jim mentioned, 2009 was significantly impacted by the 787 reclassification and the 747 charges that we don't expect to repeat in 2010. Earnings will be impacted this year by the lower volumes as well as the continued high level of R&amp;D investment. Commercial Airplanes will spend an additional $100 million this year in its commercial services organization to invest in infrastructure to support the 787 fleet entry into service.</p>
          <p>Defense, Space &amp; Security expects improved productivity and better performance on its development programs to mitigate higher pension expenses and lower volumes. We expect interest expense to increase about $120 million this year due to the higher debt levels. The share count is expected to be about 740 million, reflecting the stock contribution to our pension plans last year. We are encouraged by the trends we're seeing in the commercial market; the opportunities we have in Defense, Space &amp; Security; and the recent progress on our development programs. But there is still a lot in front of us, and as I mentioned before, we feel it prudent to consider some risks and uncertainties in our financial guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, I know many of you want to know more about 2011 performance, which is why we provided some context today. 2011 results will be driven by three key factors: how commercial and defense markets evolve, our ongoing performance and required investment on our development programs, and our success in executing growth strategies in the defense and service businesses. We are aggressively addressing all of these areas and have planned to leverage the opportunities in front of us while continuing to drive performance improvement. We will share more details on 2011 as we gain further clarity in these areas.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, James. To close, let me say that our key priorities continue to be getting the 787 into the hands of our customers; repositioning our Defense, Space &amp; Security business while extending existing programs and expanding internationally; leveraging and growing services; maintaining our lead in innovation; and preserving our financial strength. I believe the challenges we've encountered, the lessons we've learned, and the actions we're taking to improve our development program performance are making this a much stronger company, both today and for the years to come.</p>
          <p>With that said, we would now be happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wondering if you could help me with the delivery assumptions of the 460 to 465. You talked about no change in the production rates. We know what the 37, the 777's doing midyear, and looking at. And I guess if I kind of translate that, I want to make sure this makes sense, but it would seem like you're implying something like 15 to 20 airplanes for the 47 and the 787. Is that in the right ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're looking at just a few deliveries on both of those models, and the reductions principally is in the wide-bodies and the 777.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, therefore, the low gross margin on that small number of units isn't a big driver of the margin assumption for 2010?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask a bit about the 787, sort of what's happening with regard to savings that you might be able to do, or cost growth as a result of supplier settlements where you may be paying them more than you once anticipated. But I also noted that you said somewhere that you did not intend to now have a 787-9 larger wing as once planned, and there are no customers for the 787-3. So I wondered whether there were savings as a result of not doing these two modifications and whether they were significant? And secondly, when we do see the first glimpse of financials for the 787 later this year, how far away from the GAAP profits will the unit profits get to be? In other words, how big of initial losses might we see when you first show us? I mean, is this many billions of dollars? As I recall, that's what it was on the 777, was a couple.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Joe, that was a long one question. Let me see if I got &#x2013; remember all the pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are really only two things: The 787-9 and -3 cost savings, are they large amounts? And then, two, when we really see how much you spent on the initial handful of 787s, is it likely to be many billions? I mean we saw 2.5 billion on three airplanes. So what should we be thinking for the first handful of planes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it. Our R&amp;D guidance takes in consideration the puts and takes of the fact that there's a change in the wing assumption on the 787 and the fact that there are no customers on the 787-3. So there weren't significant savings. I mean, when we work our way through what we have to do on the development program -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what about in the cost estimates? I mean, isn't the 787-9 wing, wouldn't that have made the 787-9 costs higher? Not just the R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily. I mean, the whole fact of the way the wing is being designed now, it just meets its requirement, and the cost associated with that is there as opposed to the way we were going to meet it before with the larger wing. So no, there aren't any large savings in the cost base relative to either one of those, Joe.</p>
          <p>As to the profitability differential between the program margins and the unit margins on the first three airplanes &#x2013; on the first deliveries. It'll be huge, obviously, because we'll be averaging that for our program as we normally do, which is, as I want to remind you, the only GAAP-certified way to do that from an accounting perspective. So that gap will be large, as it always is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, but I mean, we saw 2.5 billion for three airplanes in the reclassification. Is that the same order of magnitude that we'll see on the first planes? Or will it be much &#x2013; when you say huge, is it larger than the three that already went away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is larger because it'll have all the deferred production differage and all of that on the first delivery. So it'll probably be larger than that, and I don't know what the number is. But it'll be large.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jim, maybe you can &#x2013; James, maybe you can help us understand the very good 11.1% margin in the fourth quarter and then kind of the large drop that you're looking for at BCAG in 2010 in light of Sam's question. If you don't have a lot of &#x2013; I don't know, it sounds like you have maybe have six or seven kind of 747-8s and 787s. So the mix should be pretty good. And the R&amp;D doesn't look like it should be a huge surprise. So is there a lower accrual rate? Or how big &#x2013; maybe you can give us some color as to how big your conservatism placeholder is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's prudent, not conservative. But let me just tell you what it is, Cai. First of all, the deliveries are going to be lower next year than this year by about 20 units. Most of those units are wide-bodies. So that has a pretty significant impact on the gross profit margin, almost a point.</p>
          <p>As you look &#x2013; we talk about the R&amp;D model change, on how we're going to do R&amp;D to better balance that on the derivatives between us and our supply chain. That's going to have a significant &#x2013; not a significant, but it's going to have a margin impact of probably about 0.6 of a point. The fleet support investment, the increase in what we have to do in terms of being able to support the 787 once it goes in service, those costs are higher.</p>
          <p>That has an impact on margins. And then we do have some other issues, investments and productivity tools and things of that nature, that impact the margins for productivity effort that we would see going forward. And some contingency for being prudent to deal with our risk that we see going forward. And when you get that, when you take all of that in consideration, it walks that 11.1 down to the range we're showing you, between 6.5 and 7.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there are no other block program accounting changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only block change we had this quarter was the 737, and we increased it by 200, which basically just says that we're &#x2013; those are airplanes that we already have on order and they're coming into the nearer-term phasing of us getting ready to deliver them, which obviously provides us greater confidence on the current rate we have on 727s.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Jim, you talked about taking out and reducing about 1,000 &#x2013; or excuse me, 10,000 employees last year. And could you address a little bit of how that cost savings manifested itself in this year and how it will show up next year and what you're doing to &#x2013; what are sort of your objectives for your team to gain some productivity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, these head count reductions are related to volume changes, as well as some program challenges on the BDS side and some decreases. I think James, when he went through a discussion of '09 and of '10, pointed out some earnings tailwinds provided by productivity; obviously the head count reductions were part of that.</p>
          <p>In the case of IDS, it's more holding on to margins in a flattening &#x2013; and in the case of next year &#x2013; a declining environment. And in the case of BCA, it's a matter of ensuring the funding of our growth. Ensuring that we had the resources available to complete these development programs as well as anticipate a volume shortfall next year. And we anticipate continued work on the head count side in light of the market pressures that we see on both sides of the business next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James, on the 2011 cash flow, any kind of bridge you could provide, even just the big pieces to get you from zero to 5 billion plus? And certainly in there, I imagine the 1.3 billion plus per quarter of inventory growth is a big factor, but maybe help us with that and what else might be going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's just it. We'll maintain the disciplined financial management that we began enhancing in 2009, continue that performance, so we manage the working capital with a lot of discipline and a lot of focus, Joe. But the real kicker is just we'll start delivering in greater quantities the 787 and the 747 in 2011, and that's just going to reduce the inventory balances or have an impact on that, and that's going to drive the performance we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it going to reduce the inventory balance, or just will it grow more slowly?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll grow more slowly, and then obviously we'll start getting the revenue in associated with the deliveries, and that's where you're going to get the &#x2013; that's where the real impact will be relative to our operating cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the pre-delivery payments for 2012 deliveries really kicking in. Is that a fair comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. As you know, the way the model works, the closer you get to delivery, the higher the payments are, and then the &#x2013; and we get about 40% of them prior to delivery, but it is the delivery that kicks in the bulk of the payment, at about 60%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the 787 and the supplier assertions, are you negotiating supplier assertions in conjunction with the negotiations on the 787-9 in general? And I'm curious where things do stand on the 787-9 negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite frankly, we are doing that. In some cases we've combined them, and those are going well also. And what we believe is the end result of those negotiations are &#x2013; those assumptions have been included in our profitability assessment on the 87. So I think it's going well. And the key for us though, Doug, is that we think we'll get to the majority of the assertion negotiations this year. So that'll obviously put us on solid ground in terms of really finalizing our assumptions relative to how those negotiations would go, will just firm up. There'll be firming up every quarter over this year.</p>

          <p>I'm great, I'm great. Jim, I'll give you a question. As you see it, what are the longest poles in the tent regarding coordinating the production buildup on the 787? What would you guide us to look for on the outside to see execution on that through 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously deliveries, I think, would be the number one thing to look at, which is in our guidance, which would commence by the end of this year in our current estimate and in the basis of our guidance. I also think progress in Charleston, in terms of that facility coming online as we anticipate, which would begin some production in 2011 with some deliveries in first half of 2012. I also think the &#x2013; and I'm &#x2013; the comment refers obviously, the 87 in Charleston but the first comment, both the 47 and the 87. I think just the inventory, our ability to manage the inventories as we project, and we've allowed for significant inventory buildup this year, and the concomitant work down in 2011. I think all of those factors, which we intend to make visible to you as we march through it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. One fast last question. What's the order outlook for 2010? Obviously we saw weak orders in 2009, not unexpectedly. Are you seeing a pickup in campaigns? Can you give us some color? Will orders in '10 be up considerably versus '09?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thanks. In your R&amp;D guidance you were talking about some R&amp;D spending on 737s and 777. Can you tell what you're kind of thinking there? Is this just some initial work that you're looking at? Or possibly even more like re-engineering or re-engining the 737?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I would characterize it as maturing technologies associated with both efforts. But as you imply with your question, some pretty detailed thinking now about product alternatives. And obviously one of those is re-engining the 73, which is under active consideration from a product requirement standpoint. And so we're beginning to harden up alternatives, maturing the technologies with the right amount of R&amp;D spending and have a wedge in our budget to quickly move on both as the market requires.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think we will have to make the 73 re-engining decision, I would say, probably a little quicker than the final 777 decision. And you're right. I mean, I think understanding the A350-1000 a little bit better &#x2013; we have a little time to understand that as we consider alternatives.</p>

          <p>Well, I think on the weight question, we have block improvements as we march through initial production quantities, which are &#x2013; we've worked with our customers with and keep us within the mission requirements that we've agreed to with them.</p>
          <p>With regard the flight test program, we don't anticipate any major modifications to the airplane. The flight tests, so far so good. I mean, we're moving along as expected. We have not discovered anything significant in the design or the fabrication of the airplane. Initial airworthiness came along quickly. So I think that there's still the risk in the flight test program, as you know. Something could be discovered. We don't anticipate it. And the weight program is on track.</p>

          <p>James, on the same topic, will the mods so far on the wing to body join maybe on the first 20 or so ship sets, will those drive a higher inventory amortization on those aircraft?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the 737 and hypothetical of re-engining, what do you anticipate the effects would be on the existing customer base for the 37s and kind of their likelihood of deferring and waiting for what could be a step up in efficiency just five years out? Do you think it would induce some deferral activity on the 37 and put pressure on those rates in the '11-'12 timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, that's obviously a good question. I think there's always this tension when a new technology is introduced. Having said that, it's that customer base that is pushing us to consider re-engining or in some cases, a completely new airplane. So I think in this era of high fuel prices and productivity requirements, I think airlines are focused less on the obsolescence issue, although it's a factor obviously, but more on ongoing productivity. That's sort of a change in the behavior that we see out there. So many of these operators are anxious for us to move.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. And if I could just squeeze in one on the 737 again. The undisclosed backlog there, unidentified customer backlog, is pretty significant as a proportion of pool. Are those destined to be deliveries in the '11 timeframe that give you the confidence and visibility that we on the outside don't see because we can't see the customer base?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you gave good data on the deferral situation. I was wondering if you've started to discuss with some of your customers whether they would be interested in reversing some of the deferral decisions they may have made over the last 12 months as they look forward to better growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the discussion today with most of our customers is about moving things around. Now, in some cases, the customers are moving things forward. I think what we focus on with you are the deferrals, but in many cases, some of these deferrals are taken over by existing customers who are more anxious to get that technology. But those that have deferred by and large have not come back and re-ordered.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you guys give us more color on these one-time items at IDS? Can you size them and maybe just sort of walk through the latest on Wedgetail and what the issues are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And we did size them. We told you that &#x2013; this quarter that it was $133 million on the AEW&amp;C, and what that represented was about 88 or so on Wedgetail, where we have struck an agreement what it takes to do to final deliver these airplanes. And we're in the process of doing it, and we think that this additional recognition of costs would be sufficient to do that if we can perform based on what we agreed with.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and the remainder of it was on Peace Eagle on the Turkey contract. And so what we think we have in our cost assumptions is what it'll take to get those two airplanes or those two programs delivered and completed. And the key thing is we're really making good progress. I mean, we're down now to basically the fine-tuning. So I think it does size it and it recognizes the reduction of risk as we continue to move forward and get closer to final delivery on those two programs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. A question on cash and cash flow. It looks like with the pre-funding you did in '09, the cash balance is well strong enough to handle the 2010 cash flow burn potential. And then you have the 2011 tailwind going up to 5 billion. Can you maybe talk about with some of this excess cash you'll be building, what some of your cash flow usage priorities might be in the next couple of years, where you see the most opportunity to perhaps deploy some of this cash as we turn back into positive territory in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excess cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when you have two major development programs, I don't think there's any such thing as that.</p>
          <p>But basically what we have is now the liquidity that we need to have to get through the final investments associated with the development of those two airplanes, and get those airplanes started on a delivery route. And then also to support the ramp-up on both programs. So those are going to be the primary focuses. We have other growth strategies as we look at repositioning our Boeing Defense and Space business. We want to be able to make sure we continue to stay focused on that, because that's a high priority for our future growth. And those are the two things.</p>
          <p>At this point, we're not considering going back and starting our share repurchase program. And we won't get back to that or start considering things like that probably until 2011, once we get through the challenges we have on our books today.</p>

          <p>At Defense, you're highlighting about a 3%, looks like a 3% hit this year, which is a little bit smaller than I would have thought given some changes in GMD and FCS. Can you talk about the outlook beyond 2010 into 2011 with F-22 rolling off? I mean, does the Defense business shrink again probably in 2011?</p>

          <p>I think the moving parts there are continued growth in the services business, continued strong growth on the international side, accelerating growth in the adjacent markets that we've mentioned, and we anticipate some success in extending a number of our big platforms, offset obviously by GMD, FCS, and F-22. We're going to stop short of providing you guidance for how that sorts out in 2011, but we see some momentum there. Let's just leave it at that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning. A quick question. So Heidi Wood sort of touched on it, but I wanted to ask in a little bit of a different way for Jim. I mean, could you give us a little insight into what you think is sort of the biggest challenge facing the production ramp-up right now for 787? If it's in South Carolina? If it's with your suppliers abroad? I mean, what would you say is the biggest, and maybe second biggest issue you're facing on ramp-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the supply chain has settled down in terms of percentage of completion rates have improved significantly. On the subassemblies that are shipped to us, I think all the trends there are good. I think the &#x2013; getting through flight tests, therefore, being in a position to deliver the inventory that we've built this year at the end of the year is the thing that all has to come together, and we anticipate that it will. So I would look at flight test, as an additional comment, a lot less risk on the supply chain putting the airplane together than I would have reflected a year ago with the same question.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Also compared to a year ago, your outlook for the need for aircraft financing has changed a lot. Can you go into that a little bit about who's stepping up in the market to help your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the overall &#x2013; my comment would be that the overall financial system in total is in better shape than I think we anticipated a year ago. That would include commercial banks, it would include the capital markets, it would include leasing companies, even though their percentage is down somewhat. It's better than some of the apocryphal scenarios that we were looking at a year ago.</p>
          <p>And I think which &#x2013; XM. And so I think when you add it all up, the various financial sources all are in better shape than we anticipated, which means less of a requirement on us as a provider of last resort, so to speak. So I think it's more a reflection on the intervention around the world, slight growth in Chinese financing sources, the support there, their volumes there. They're a relatively new player. When you add it all up, it leaves less of a requirement for the OEM.</p>

          <p>I'm wondering if you can comment on trends for order deferrals and cancellations by customers? And I'm wondering if I understood correctly, it sounded like 2010 and 2011 are sold out, but you've got a conservative outlook beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, just the two parts of your question, the deferrals and cancellations are trending down somewhat right now as we speak, reflecting on the fourth quarter. That is one comment I made, and that is true in terms of sold out in '11 &#x2013; excuse me, sold out in '10, and overbooked in '11. Beyond that, there is continued strength beyond that. And it's similar strength, we would anticipate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If you could also just comment on how the Japan Airlines bankruptcy at this point could affect Boeing that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have anticipated JAL's financial challenges in our planning over the last year or so. And whether it ended up in bankruptcy or ended up in a similarly financially constrained environment, I think we've anticipated it. In any case, there is no near-term impact to our order book based on what we're seeing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you just discuss the steps you're taking to get 747-8 out of a loss position? And what kind of opportunities do you see for cost control in terms of the relationship with suppliers? And also inside the factory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have ongoing, obviously, programs with our suppliers and productivity programs in our factory. We have new opportunities to sell the airplane at new prices as it proves itself. So we're driving all of these. And additional volume itself will help with some of the cost issues. So it's sort of a full-court press on all elements of the business equation.</p>
          <p>And since we remain confident in the marketability of the airplane, there's a huge 747-400 base out there that is going to be turning over their technology over the next decade. We see a big opportunity to sell into that base with this airplane. I think the combination of productivity efforts, of pricing opportunities going forward, as well as working with our supply chain gives us confidence that we can improve that margin. Having said that, where we are right now is at zero. And we're working hard on it.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to follow up a little bit on the 747-8. You had a lot of 400s put into the market probably some years ahead of schedule with the JAL bankruptcy situation. I'm curious what your reading near-term is on what that will do as far as freighter sales and conversion opportunities for the BCF program, the whole Boeing program? And then your projections are to get about half of total sales in the large aircraft market of some 740 airplanes. So that's like 370 for the 47. How close are you on just whether the program will make money? Or is it going to be quite close by your break-even point? Or are you still quite optimistic as far as a very strong program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the two elements of the question. One, the 47-400 long-term freighter conversion opportunity. That airplane is the basis of a great freighter over time, and I'm sure that will become part of the mix. And I'm not sure whether your question implied would that accelerate Dash 8 sales, because pull out the 400 capacity. You could make that judgment, but it's a great freighter, the 400.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was thinking the opposite, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You were thinking the opposite. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What would it hurt sales because there's so many coming in? For the Dash 8?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, you mean ordered and being &#x2013; well, we're not delivering the 400.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I understand that. Will the influx of so many Dash 400s that could be converted, will that hurt -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see. I'm sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; Dash 8 freighter new sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. I think &#x2013; we have taken that into account in our forecast with the Dash 8, and the productivity of the Dash 8 is significant even against good freighters like the 400 converted would be. The other part of your question was &#x2013; I've now forgotten what the second part of your question was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to figure out where your margin on profitability for the Dash 8 is. You're expecting about 740 sales over the next 20 years for large aircraft between the Dash 8 and the A380, and I believe you expect to take about half that market. You had projected about 60% of those sales would actually be in passenger versions, but that isn't working out to be the case. So I'm just wondering if your guidance is still solid on that? Or is the market moving? And a) how the past-year version will sell, and, b) how close can you come to profitability? What would be your profitability margin on this given that there's so few sales projected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, look, we are confident that this airplane is going to do well. Let's start with that. The mix of freighter versus PACs is tough to project when you're in the middle of a global recession right now. And I think which way it breaks, we have our own internal projections which way it breaks. But that changes from time to time based on market conditions. We're beginning to see it pick up in activity on the passenger side in terms of discussions with customers. Always been strong discussions on the freighter side. So &#x2013; and if we achieve half the market that you describe, okay, there will be no problem with profitability on this program.</p>

      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. The problem with going last is people ask my good questions. Let me ask, though, are some of the issues that have come out with Airbus's A400M, does that present an opportunity for the C-17 perhaps to have more sales? And also, the progress with the Wedgetail, what do you seeing in terms of the market for that? And can you talk about any customer discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're seeing, as we get closer to completing Wedgetail, we're seeing a number of international entities interested in that airplane. And so early days in terms of discussions, but there will be a significant market for that plane, which of course is why we took the fixed-price development risk that we did, which caused us some pain. So we're beginning to see some of that come true. Early days though, difficult to quantify it for you now. But there's some good signs, guess is the way I'd say it.</p>
          <p>As to the A400M, listen, I anticipate that that situation will be sorted out. Who pays for what I think is a matter of discussion between the countries involved, as well as EADS and Airbus. But I don't anticipate that airplane going away. I anticipate it being in the marketplace. The C-17 stands on its own. Those requirements don't overlap significantly.</p>
