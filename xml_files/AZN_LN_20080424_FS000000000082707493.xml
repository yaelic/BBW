        <plist>
          <p>Good day and welcome to the AstraZeneca Quarter One Results Analyst Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Hunt. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I am chairing today's call with Simon Lowth, Chief Financial Officer of AstraZeneca. We also have the IR team and some of the finance team on the call as well. As you know today, we also have our AGM, which starts immediately after this call. So we will be focusing on running to time today.</p>
          <p>But before I handover the call to Simon, I'd like to read the usual Safe Harbor Statement. The company intends to utilize the Safe Harbor Provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995. Participants on this call may make forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, financial performance of AstraZeneca and by their very nature forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will now turn the call over to Simon Lowth. Simon?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan thank you and good afternoon to everyone. It's been a busy period for AstraZeneca, since we last convened for the full year results back in January. We continue to drive the current portfolio to increase revenue and our restructuring and productivity initiatives continue to expand operating margins and deliver profit growth while we invest in our pipeline of future products.</p>
          <p>To this end we made the first of three regulator filings scheduled for this year, with the U.S. filing for motavizumabin in January. And just last week we took a major step to provide an increased clarity and stability for our business with the settlement agreement with Ranbaxy concerning the Nexium patent litigation.</p>
          <p>But today we're here to cover the first quarter's financial performance. And I am going to cover four broad topics. First we will look at the headline numbers, and a high-level reconciliation between our reported results on a statuary accounting basis and core earnings which is the basis of upon which we provide our financial guidance. I will then cover sales looking at the performance by regions and by our key brands. I'll then move to the drivers of financial performance and I will use the P&amp;L on a core basis to describe these results. Where it's relevant I will try and call out those elements to which the first quarter run-rates may not be indicative of our expectations for the full year. And finally, I'll put this quarter in the context of our target for the year.</p>
          <p>Sales were up 4% at constant currency to $7.7 billion. As you would recall our guidance for the year is the sales growth in the low-to-mid single digits on a constant currency basis. So, the quarter is inline with these expectations. As you would expect the weaker dollar has had a positive effect on the top-line adding 6% to growth. So, sales on a reported basis are up 10%.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit was up 12% on a constant currency, up 21% as reported with the currency impact on profit being higher than for sales of plus 9%. Core earnings per share were up 9% at constant currency, to $1.28. The growth in core operating profit and the benefit of fewer shares in issue is partly offset by the increased net interest expense. With the currency benefit core EPS was up 19%.</p>
          <p>As you have seen in the press release, reported operating profit was down 5% in constant currency terms, this reflects the impact of three principal exclusions from core earnings. Firstly, the amortization related to MedImmune in the amount of the $109 million; secondly, restructuring and synergy costs which were $117 million in the quarter, and then finally, an additional one off item that is the charge of $257 million for impairment of the intangible asset related to Ethyol, MedImmune's oncology product.</p>
          <p>As you know that acquisition accounting, each of MedImmune's marketed products and development projects were assigned intangible asset valuations. In the case Ethyol, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has commenced an at risk launch of their generic product ahead of the conclusion of the ongoing patent litigation. And so we have to recognize an impairment of the Ethyol intangible asset as a consequence. Since these intangibles are related to the acquisition accounting in the MedImmune transaction we exclude this amortization from core EPS, to be consistent we excluded this impairment from core EPS.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the first key driver of earnings growth, increasing revenues. All my comments will be on a constant currency basis. We achieved sales growth of 4% in the first quarter; this is a good achievement in an increasingly challenging environment. Our top-line growth reflects the inclusion of MedImmune sales for the quarter of $533 million and this more than offsets the $267 million year-on-year decline in the U.S. sales of Toprol-XL. Headline sales in the U.S. were up 5% although underlying sales performances rather better across most of the brands, wholesalers need to be destocking during the quarter, although within the normal limit of distribution agreements. This destocking amounted to some $200 million reduction in sales compared with the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>In our established markets Western Europe continued to be tough. Sales were down 1% in the quarter with sales growth for Seroquel, Symbicort and Crestor offset by declines in Losec and Nexium. Sales in Japan were up 4%. We have seen specific or patterns of sales growth being a bit soft in the quarter ahead of the biannual price cuts. The top wholesalers hold back, until the price cuts take effect in April.</p>
          <p>Sales performance in Australia was excellent with sales up 29% on a strong launch for Crestor. We continue to drive double-digit sales growth in our emerging markets business where our investments to expand our presence are providing good returns. First quarter last year was strong and we are up 11% over that this quarter. And sales in the Asian emerging markets including China were up 22%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our key brands. Globally, Nexium sales were down 9% in the quarter, due principally to declines in U.S. sales. In the Rest of World sales were up 1% on good growth in Canada and the emerging markets. Nexium sales in the U.S. were down 15%. In the branded market, which we have defined PKI, excluding esomeprazole, we edged up market shares by around 60 basis points despite the launch of generic Pantoprazole at the turn of the year. However, the total Pantoprazole molecule was up some 140 basis points, so our cautious outlook at the full year results conference regarding this market event was warranted.</p>
          <p>Volume in the U.S. for Nexium was broadly unchanged, dispensed retail demand was flat and increase in non-retail shipments was offset by trade destocking in the quarter. The Nexium sales performance in the U.S. is due to net price declines. It's important to remember the phasing of the net price declines over the four quarters of 2007 with most of the full year effect being realized in the fourth quarter. Net prices in the first quarter of 2008 are only slightly lower than the fourth quarter exit rate, but are significantly lower than the third quarter of 2007, which are not yet reflected in the dynamic changes to prices that occurred last year. This is going to be a feature of the next couple with unfavorable price comparisons straight through until the fourth quarter, when a year-on-year price differential will finally narrow. Based on the performance in the first quarter and our assessment of the outlook for the rest of the year, we expect a mid single digit decline in Nexium worldwide sales for the full year.</p>
          <p>The Crestor sales in our Rest of World markets are now higher than sales in the U.S. Outside the U.S. sales were $419 million at 32% increase. I already mentioned the successful launch in Australia. Sales in Western Europe were up double digits. Crestor sales in Japan more than doubled and our volume market share is now over 13% in Japan, market share was 8.8% back when we announced the full results for 2007.</p>
          <p>Crestor sales in the U.S. were up 3% to $353 million. The statin market in U.S. has softened. Total prescription growth has slowed to around 5% in the first quarter over last year. I mentioned earlier that we've seen some destocking in the U.S. and Crestor is one of the products affected. Crestor's share of total prescriptions was 8.75% in March. It's the only branded product to have gained share in the quarter. So we are seeing a positive impact from the atherosclerosis launch. We are also encouraged by the trend in new patients starts and our net switches as all other statins, both are up, since the Athera launch.</p>
          <p>Seroquel sales were up 10% in the quarter, sales in the U.S were up 7%, total prescriptions were up 8% almost twice the market rate. The Seroquel XR accounts for about 25% of this growth. In other markets Seroquel sales were up 17%. 2008 is the culmination of a large life cycle management program in support of Seroquel XR. At the moment XR is only indicated to schizophrenia. But the submission for XR treatment to bipolar mania and bipolar depression are now under review in the U.S and in Europe. For major depression and generalized anxiety disorders, indication of the new indications that will be unique to the XR formulation. The depression package has already been filed in the U.S. and filing for anxiety in U.S and depression and anxiety in Europe will follow over the course of 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to Symbicort, most of its sales are still outside the U.S.; Rest of World sales are up 9% in the first quarter to $427 million and more than half the increase coming from Western Europe. In the U.S, sales in the first quarter were $44 million. There were no sales in first quarter of 2007 as we launched in late June. Product continued to gain momentum in the U.S in the first quarter with both the specialist and the primary care prescribers. Of our target core universe trial rates are now over 80% for allergists and 70% to pulmonary specialists. Share of patients immune to fixed combination therapy was over 26% in the specialist group.</p>
          <p>Primary care trial rates have increased to more then 29%. In share of patients immune to combinations therapy has increased to under 9% at the end of December to over 14% in the latest week. In the over market Symbicort's new prescription share is 7.8% and its muted combination therapy share is 15.2% in the week ending April 11th.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to other items in the P&amp;L, as we explain how the 4% increase in revenue was leveraged into a 12% increase in core operating profits. And again this commentary is on a core basis in constant currency terms. Core base margin increased to 80.9% of sales and improvement of 60 basis points over 2007. Lower Merck payments as a percent of sales combined with efficiency gains and favorable product mix were partially offset by higher royalty payments, chiefly due to the inclusion of synergist sales in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Core R&amp;D expenditures were down 2% in the quarter, however the first quarter 2007 had the intangible impairment charges of associated with termination with AtheroGenics and Avanir collaborations. Excluding these core R&amp;D expense was actually up 4% and activity levels for R&amp;D projects are on plan and are also seeing good progress on productivity initiatives which helps to mitigate increased pipeline cost and the addition of MedImmune.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense is up 2% with the inclusion of MedImmune SG&amp;A which was not included in the prior period. Excluding the MedImmune component core SG&amp;A is 2% lower than last year due to the effects of continued efficiency improvements. Core other income for the first quarter was a $151 million, $13 million higher than 2007 with the inclusion of MedImmune being partially counterbalanced by lower one-time gains and royalty income. As an accounting re-classification that affects other income, as you will know amortization of the intangible assets arising from the MedImmune acquisition have been in the account since June of last year, running at a $109 million per quarter. It will be included in SG&amp;A but now the amortization related to MedImmune licensing and royalty income streams has been re-classified from SG&amp;A to other income, which is where the revenue is recorded.</p>
          <p>As a result of this change, my guidance, that we expect other income for this year to be around the same as 2007, still applies on a core basis but with this amortization expense, other income on a reported basis will be lower than the 2007 statutory number. The improvements in gross margin and the reductions in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales have increased our operating margin by 250 basis points at constant currency to 36% of sales. As a result, the 4% increase in sales has resulted in a 12% increase in core operating profit, while operating margins have increased in the first quarter, our guidance on margins for the full year stand mainly maintain core gross margin flat on 2007 levels, hoth core SG&amp;A expense flat and increase our core R&amp;D expense, all on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Quick update on our productivity and synergy initiatives. They are all on-track to deliver two-thirds of the total target of $1.4 billion in annual benefits by the end of this year, with the full amounts to be delivered by 2010. An excellent example of what we are accomplishing is the restructuring in many of our sales and marketing organizations in Western Europe, the better part of which took place in 2007. We're now delivering fully the same level of sales with smaller sales forces in our largest marketing companies. We charged a further $117 million to the first quarter accounts for restructuring and synergy programs bringing the total provisions for the program to date to a little over a $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash generation and net debt you will see in the first quarter statement that our net debt has increased in the quarter compared to the year end position. This is expected. We paid out $2 billion of the final dividend for the year and in March we made a net payment to Merck of around $2.6 billion as part of the scheduled exit provisions to those Merck arrangements.</p>
          <p>Our cash generation remains strong and we still intend to reduce our net debt position over the rest of the year while also planning share repurchases of around $1billion subject to business needs.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to our arrangements with Merck. You will recall that in February when we announced Merck's discussion not to exercise the first option we promised you additional information on the accounts impact of these events. And I call your attention to Note 6 in the first quarter accounts where this is presented in some detail. I don't propose dealing with this topic in my formal remarks, but I will be happy to take questions as part of the Q&amp;A as needed.</p>
          <p>So let me continue this presentation with a brief update on our financial guidance. Based on the underlying business performance to date and our assessments of the prospects for the rest of the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our full year targets. You will see however, that we have increased the target range for core EPS for 2008 by $0.05. With the new range now between $4.45 to $4.75 per share. This increased target reflects the positive impact on earnings per share from currency movements that had been realized in the first quarter. For the remaining quarters guidance is based on our original assumptions for currency that is the fourth quarter 2007 average rates. And so since you are assessing the impact of currency fluctuations for the remaining three quarters you will recall that we provided a currency sensitivity table in our full year result presentation and this remains available on our website in the investor section.</p>
          <p>I think I will wrap up my formal remarks here and turn the call back to the conference operator, to begin the question and answer session.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The question and answer section will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will take our first question from John Murphy from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead Sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon a few questions please. First wondered if you could give us any guidance with regards to restructuring charges, you now expect to take between now and year-end for the year for the synergy's program. Second, there is as you probably seen a little bit of misunderstanding would appear with regards to the earnings guidance and the upgrade, maybe you could clarify that? As we understand it, the $0.05 upgrade is specifically due to first quarter and assumes -- would assume for the rest of the year that the currency for Q2, 3 and 4 actually went back to the average rate, you saw in fourth quarter last year. And then third, just with regards to R&amp;D are you still having anticipating on a core constant currency basis, high single digit growth because you did talk about efficiencies in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Well thanks John for that. Let me start with the R&amp;D, your third question, we do indeed expect to see core R&amp;D expenditure to rise for 2008 we gave guidance that drives at high single digit, as we've said today we left our guidance unchanged. We are though seeing that the benefits of efficiency and productivity coming through and we will able to update you on that and the impact of that, as we go through the year but our guidance remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>The dealing with the guidance on restructuring for 2008, the cost we said that two-thirds of the remaining billion dollars for restructuring in synergy costs will be charged in 2008 and that remains our guidance for the year and on the EPS guidance you did indeed summarize -- I think it well, to be absolutely clear and that's what we thought to do here, our underlying guidance absent currency effects for the full year remains unchanged. We have added $0.05 to the earnings guidance to reflect the currency benefit experienced and realized in the first quarter for the year. For the remaining three quarters we have essentially assumed in the guidance, the same currency rates which are the average for the fourth quarter of 2007 upon which we provided the guidance in the first place. We also provided you with a sensitivity table which will allow you to affect the impact of the potential currency movement for the remainder of the year subject to your views on currency.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you took the currency sensitivity we've provided, look at the average rates in the fourth quarter of 07 and the first quarter of 08 you will find where we get the $0.05.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. I have a question on the Seroquel in the overall U.S anti-psychotic market. You talked about a slow down in the market and it looks to me by looking at both the Abilify and the Zyprexa numbers just like yours but between Q4 and Q1, the rate of growth in reported sales has slowed by about 4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter i.e. Q4 over Q4 the year before and Q1 over Q1. Can you talk generally about what's going on in the market, I would have expected growth to accelerate given that Abilify now has an adjunctive approval for depression and Seroquel continues to allow in bipolor depression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market growth that we've experienced for Seroquel is slightly up for the third quarter on the overall -- it's up for the third quarter in terms of overall growth for Seroquel and we have obviously gained share and therefore taken approximately half the growth in the markets. So our focus has been on building Seroquel's position in the marketplace and we've been, we've been pleased with the -- with the performance. Indeed, 25% of the growth that Seroquel has enjoyed has come from XR, launched that in the last year and we &#x2013; that got off to a good start. Clearly the core priority for us in the course of this year is to roll out the life cycle management program to get the extended range of indications between XR and indeed some unique indications for XR and have confidence that will continue to drive Seroquel going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow up because your comments implied that you expected the market to slow down therefore, so I am wondering therefore what growth you expect in the market for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin I am struggling to find where we said the market running by psychotics was slowing below expectations. When we made that comment about Crestor the market was less slowing down but the TRx's for the antipsychotic market are still up 8%. I think last year was about a single digit growth maybe just barely 10%, so its not miles off of what the full year growth rate was and our growth rate inscripts is 8% and the market what growing about 4.5 I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kevin, just to build on that, I think your question had with in the center of it probably the most important factors that Seroquel, the growth rates and the expectations for the future are very much determined by the delivery of the new indications will add to the differentiation we have already in the marketplace. And that's really where we got to focus our efforts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now move to <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Just had a question on the operating ratios that you delivered in the first quarter, as compared to Q1 last year or fourth quarter last year. They do seem quite low, you're probably about 2,  even after you stripped out that one off from restructuring about 200 basis points better at the call and R&amp;D lines in the fourth quarter. Say these good ratios to be thinking about for the rest of the year or we are expecting to see some quarterly cost phasing, I mean, those ratios deteriorate through the course of the year. And also could you detail for us, what the realized cost savings from the restructuring program were in the quarter and then on Nexium's volume study you said versus fourth quarter and pricing as well but the sales down 10%, so if not price, what is it that's actually accounting for that decline versus fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get back to the Nexium question in the next round. The 9% is the global leverage, 15% decline in the state and that's non flat volume so the implied price variances as in the state is a double-digit price decline. But again I think the key point is, it's a function of the year ago comparator rather than further deterioration of price compared to the exit prices we had in fourth quarter of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is said to restructuring program, we provided guidance for the full year but in terms of benefit, cumulatively two-thirds of the 1.4 billion targeted benefits would be in the P&amp;L in 2008. The benefit in the P&amp;L for the first quarter is in line with that so somewhere near the order of a couple 100 million. And your first question was related to operating margins. We explained that operating profit for -- profit margin for the first quarter, was indeed up by 250 basis points to 36% of sales. We've seen strong operating margins in the first quarter but our guidance on margin growth will remain unchanged further for the full year.</p>

On page two of your press release you described the productivity of the initiative in western Europe, can you talk about delivering about the same level of sales with smaller sales forces and I am wondering if you can give us some hard figures behind the statement. To me, that language suggests maybe sales are slightly lower than what they would have otherwise been, but I am wondering, how that stacks up against what the percent reduction in the sales force that would have been in these territories? So I guess you could answer that on like an operating margin perspective, what has been the bump up in the operating margin as you've restructured in these western European markets and then a product question which is on the back of the news about the Jupiter trial and also enhanced results, there were several big revisions up on future press or forecast by the folks that cover your company and I am wondering if you'd be willing to comment about what you think about some of this big increases or how u see this playing out over time?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just deal with -- western Europe, I mean the overall sales were down in revenue terms by about a percent although volumes actually were up and the reduction in our sales and marketing organization resourcing in from the key markets was substantially down substantially more than that and therefore we've seen a marked improvement in productivity coming through in a number of those markets. Turning to Crestor, the three aspects to that, the first is that the Athera claims obviously came in our label at the end of last year. That's now fully embedded in the sales force, we have rolled out the DTC campaign starting in February and we are seeing the results coming through from that in part NRx share with some up take but more importantly when we look at both prescribing intent but also dynamic shares for example up from 10.2 to 11.5%.</p>
          <p>So we are certainly seeing the positive momentum from the Athera claim. And the two other developments that you mentioned, we do think that from the <mark type="inaudible" /> perspective has reinforced the use of statins. And in clearly in Crestor we think we have most powerful &#x2013; most powerful statin and Jupiter study is also positive for the brand clearly there is a lot of data that needs to be received, reviewed, analyzed and we will be able to update you on the implications of that set towards the end of this year. And I know Jonathon you want to add to that?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the specific element around the change in consensus around the analyst forecast, for one or two that caught the eye I think those couple of analysts who are actually coming off a very low price, if you look what happened within consensus overall I think numbers went up about 400 million, 450 million for 2012-2013 so we are no where near as big a change as I think you were hinting at with the question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think I know what the answer to this question will be but what do you think about that at average change to the Crestor forecast. I guess I am trying to figure out if you think there is going to be a major market impact on future sales of Crestor from Jupiter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't toss out what was in the analyst mind and did they recast that forecast. It could be the differentiation we get from the Stellar data on HDL and LDL, it could be the new Astra claim, it could be general disruption in the market, or it could be &#x2013; in your question points to be the Jupiter study. But for this specific impact in the Jupiter study, as we haven't seen the data yet and won't see it until the fourth quarter, it's probably a little bit premature to be predicting.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much for taking my question. Suppose the opportunity of asking Simon about the cost of goods. In the quarter you had a very good performance. But I think the cost of goods, something like 1.5 percentage points better than the market was expecting. And looking forward with your outsourcing policy and I think Ranbaxy have suggested they will be making 50% of your U.S. Nexium supply. Looks like the general direction for costs of goods is a very positive one. I wondered if you if you can give us a bit more scale and perhaps some timing on the benefits if your outsourcing policy on this particular cost line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The, we are indeed making progress in terms of driving efficiency based from the passage strategy we have in place, on going productivity initiatives and that is impacting our cost of goods and you will see that come through in the quarter. The guidance over the course of 2008 of percent gross margin remains unchanged clearly at the gross margin line those movements in cost of the goods coming through but also other effects such as royalty and Merck payments. Looking ahead, the continued development of our asset strategy depends on outsourcing and API is an important part of our overall program to drive efficiencies. I am not going to provide further guidance at this point, as to where that's going to get to into the further, but we currently see this as a positive trend and will contribute to margins in to the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah just a bit of follow-up to the question just asked. But can you just clarify where does Astra obtain the Nexium raw material now? And by what company is this <mark type="inaudible" /> finishing done currently? And as was just asked I was going to ask for you to quantify the impact on the P&amp;L perhaps with greater precision. And also how does it change the economics to Merck? And then lastly would you expect any continued efforts from Teva to overturn the pattern or would you anticipate that the barriers and time frames are simply too great?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve sorry. There was a bit of interference from the line -- could you just repeat the second part of your question. I think -- you wanted to understand where we sourced, where we are producing Nexium and fulminating a patent today. Can you just clarify there's a crackle here, the second part of that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you maybe say with greater precision the impact on your P&amp;L by virtue of the change in the sourcing and in the economics to Merck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Well let me deal first with all the question where it's sourced, where we are producing the Nexium API within our current manufacturing network primarily in Dunkerque in France. We are doing formulation packing in a number of areas including some that is being done on our behalf by Merck. So that's where it's being done today in terms of the overall arrangements in moving forward clearly the outsourcing arrangement around that is done at -- competitive rate we wouldn't expect it to be significant changes in gross margin as a consequence of that and then your final question I think on the ongoing litigation with Teva that we continue to have confidence in our intellectual property. We are vigorously defending it and the litigation with Teva continues. You need I'm afraid to ask them what their intentions were but I hope our intentions are very clear. Thanks Steve</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Simon, could you talk a little bit about your personal view of return of cash to shareholders. I am taking here the balance between share repurchase and dividend and clearly you have made very clear what you your plans are for return to a modest level of share repurchase later this year. But I am interested whether you think that there is scope for an increase in the pay out ratio in the future.</p>
          <p>And secondly could you give us a little more color on that destocking of in the first quarter, roughly how much of it was Crestor and if you have any other major brands you can give us a rough proportion that would helpful and finally on the now very clear basis for your guidance on the effects move we make, John Murphy actually used my very wording. You'd think we were sitting together when he asked the question exactly the same way. However, the background of that is there any chance that there is something we are missing here in your choice of guiding in this way as I can only imagine that you might get fair bit of a currency benefit there in the second quarter. But perhaps there is something that's going to resulting guidance not being raised by that same amount in the second quarter. So could you give is some confidential or color on what are those something we are not thinking about here and why you haven't done a more conventional way of offering your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Kevin though the let me deal with that one first. The I am glad to here that its clear and the what we thought to do is separate the guidance on the underlying performance of business in absence of currency where the currency movements where our guidance is unchanged and reflects the same confidence about the outlook for the year as we have it back in January. No change in that regards. In terms of currency we have added the currency benefit that has been realized in the first quarter. And when we get to the second quarter we will then make very transparent the benefit that has realized or not at that point and provide that in the guidance and we provided you with the sensitivity analysis we allow you to do that in anticipation as well. But. Does that help, does that address your question on the currency point Kevin.</p>

          <p>We don't have plans at this stage Kevin to change the dividend and buyback policy which is very clear that tend to grow our dividends in line with earnings per share before restructuring and synergy costs. To maintain two times cover and to return surplus capital within the year after procedures as what we see as good investment and debt pay down commitments that we have and obviously the dividend to return that through share buybacks and we see that is providing a good balance between both dividend and then buyback as a means of return. We don't have any plans to change that at this stage Kevin although it is clearly something that we review on a regular basis the specific guidance around share buyback for this year of around a 1 billion obviously reflects the fact that we've had the Merck payment of 2.6 billion in the first quarter. We will provide some guidance on the outlook for next year in due course, probably at the fourth quarter results update.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of questions. First of all just looking at Nexium is it possible to quantify the percentage of prescriptions or percentage of revenues that come from Department of Defense, come from Medicare, maybe the private payer in cash? And secondly just having now settled with Ranbaxy and you said you got greater visibility of the medium term cash flows is it possible to further leverage the balance sheet, maybe make additional acquisitions, and if so what should we be looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well thanks for that, Paul. Let me deal with the second one first. A -- made clear at the time certainly the Ranbaxy settlement brings us greater clarity and stability from which we can focus our attentions on investing in the business growing for the future. At this stage having taken on the additional debt for financing the MedImmune acquisition and in line with our desire to maintain our target credit ratings at double AA more than one we have agreed with the agencies a debt pay down schedule over the course of the next 24 months. And from the financing strategy that will remain our priority over that two year period. And I think in today's credit markets, maintaining that credit ratio is a very sensible and prudent position to be in. Obviously we will continue to review our overall strategy and financing policy as the business unfolds but for the next 12 to 24 months our focus is on meeting the commitments that we previously made. In terms of Nexium, I will let Louis pick that up from U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean in terms of Medicare again as we said in the past if you look across our portfolio, our Medicare Part D business represents something in the high teens as a percentage of our sales and Nexium would be typical of that kind of proportion. I think a cash market in general I think, it used to be in the order of 15%, that's probably come down a bit now as a result of Medicare D growth <mark type="inaudible" /> it is probably trending down below that mid-teen level. DoD most of the volume is active non-retail. You don't see it in the prescription data at all because it is all sold into the dispensing warehouses of the various military installations.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes, thank you. Two questions, first on the positive outcome of the Jupiter trial. Statistically speaking are there any preliminary bounds you can establish for a minimum number to treat patients basis, based on the finding that the trial was stopped early and secondly I didn't know if this came up earlier on the call as I wasn't on. But is there a figure in terms of an estimate for inventory levels relative to normal? Are you above or below on a dollar basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay on the Jupiter study we &#x2013; as I mentioned earlier we have obviously now got a lot of work to do over the coming months to collect and bring in that data to review and analyze it. We are not in a position to share with you any results and insights from that at this early stage that will be towards the end of this year. And in terms of inventory levels have you a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms &#x2013; what we tried to be clear is that we are seeing in inventory de-stocking is within what we would call the normal limits of the distribution and service agreements we have with the wholesalers. So they have a target level of inventory but they are allowed to be plus or minus a certain leeway of that just because you can't nail it down that precisely. What you are seeing is de-stocking within that normal collar so that nothing is untoward in a way of either excess or in fact under stocking in any typical quarter. It's just the amplitude around that normal variability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I'd just to clarity that it is within normal variability its just a little higher this quarter than we have seen in recent quarters and I have hence called it out for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I remember back in '03 and '04 you could usually give dollar amount in terms of how much above or how much below</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>or in that in year Gbola that was when we &#x2013; before the distribution services when into effect. And then it was much more relevant to talk about excess or because at that point you are talking about inventories that were building in anticipation of price rises you get a very large stock in and then the following quarter you would see that de-stocking and so you have wild swing in ex-factory sales relative to underlying mix. Again we are not seeing that kind of thing here, that's why we are not talking about a dollar level of inventory it is within the normal limits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, I guess just a follow-up in a slightly different way so we would expect perhaps that in Q2 there aren't any effects from inventory movements this quarter any major material effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One can't forward anticipate how the wholesale or ordering patterns will evolve. But in contrast of those earlier periods when you would see a big stock-in you would almost assuredly see a big stock out on the price rise speculation. Those kind of things are usual, are a feature of the past. That said we can't say in any given quarter whether our wholesaler is going to place a large order at the end of the last business day of our quarter and you see that kind of a swing.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. Just looking at the COGS ratio, again I was wondering whether that number includes any sort of FX, impact which may not immediately be obvious such as that we may experience a delay increase of COGS via inventories held by foreign subsidiaries or any funny effects like that. And then second quick question you simply quote sales have been all over the places and so the launch of the current 44 million now a  reasonable demand figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay dealing with you COGS questions. Now I have trends on COGs that we explained in release and we also provided you with an increasing COGs on a constant currency rate as well. The drivers there are continued efficiency gains on COGS which we've talked about and then relative movements on royalties and Merck payments, which probably reflects the mix of Merck related product running through the sales line. And also the high royalty payments which is as we mentioned chiefly to the inclusion of  the synergies. So there are no effects that I think should concern you. In terms of Symbicort we see that the sales for this quarter are good and that measure of underlying demanding predictor.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Firstly Simon apologies to comeback to the self-described very clear guidance, but just I think you touched upon this in this &#x2013; in your introduction remarks. But just wanted to double check how you treat $0.12 from the impairment for the full year. Whether or not that is included in the 45 to 475 or not?</p>
          <p>And secondly on Crestor, although it's early days I wondered if you can talk about what possibly amendment of the label progress that you could seek on the back of the Jupiter data. As well as if you could give us an update on the Aurora study that outcome study in end stage renal patients and possibly also talk about the importance of that compared to Jupiter? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly on guidance, the guidance we provided is on core EPS and therefore the impairment of the <mark type="inaudible" /> $0.12 is not outside that guidance. So it did not impact the guidance that we provided. Turning to Crestor, as I emphasized earlier we will only be able to update to you on the impact for the Crestor label on the back of Jupiter once we've received and analyzed the data. So that's something we will need to come back to the end of this year. Jonathan do you want to pick- up the Aurora in the context of the wider program around Crestor?</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. On the U.S. Nexium, could you state the proportion of sales of the intravenous form thank you? And also on the earnings guidance and currency assumptions, could you please provide more detail on the basket of currencies that are included in the other line in your sensitivity table please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Nexium IV is a very -very small proportion of total Nexium sales.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the other currencies the main currency that we include is the Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar and we have an emerging market which &#x2013; is always dollar linked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in that case its seems to me that the currency effects for Q2 to Q4 may be even higher for the remaining quarters than the $.05 that you realized in Q1, could make a broad, could you answer that broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We provided the guidance we did which is the guidance for the business excluding currency effects, as unchanged reflecting continued confidence in our outlook for the year. We added $0.05 to reflect the actual currency realized benefits realized in the first quarter. I don't want to get into the forecasting currency that's for the rest of the year, but if you got a particular view on that you can obviously apply the sensitivities to arrive at your own view of the currency impact for the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>I understand thank you but I was thinking, if you took the very recent rates...</p>

          <p>Alex you are almost picking at the basis for the predicating the guidance a little bit. We are giving you I think all the tools. You need to take at the end</p>

          <p>Well thank you very much indeed for joining the call this afternoon. Let me just briefly summarize with three points in the, in a challenging market we have delivered performance that puts us on track to meet our targets for the year. With the U.S. filing for motavizumab we have made the first of three regulatory filings planned for this year and we provided increased clarity and stability for our business with an effective agreement with Ranbaxy concerning the Nexium patient litigation in the U.S., and with that I would like to wish you all a very good day.</p>
