          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the CIBC Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. To reduce the audio interference within the boardroom and over the conference line, please turn your BlackBerry off for the duration of the meeting.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Ferren, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Ferren.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us today. The purpose of our conference call this afternoon is to discuss CIBC's third quarter results released earlier today. The call is also being audio webcast and will be archived later this evening on cibc.com.</p>
          <p>This afternoon CIBC's senior management team will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on CIBC's business priorities. The Investor presentation for today's discussion is available on our website. Following the formal remarks, there will be a question and answer session and I would ask that you limit your questions to one or two and then re-queue so we can get to as many of you as possible.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that any individual speaking on behalf of CIBC on today's call may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Certain material factors or assumptions may be applied, which could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially from the conclusions, forecasts or projections in these forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the note about forward-looking statements in today's press release.</p>
          <p>With that, let me now turn the meeting over to CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer, Gerry McCaughey.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before I begin, let me remind you that my comments may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>This afternoon, I will review CIBC's third quarter results. Following my remarks, our Chief Financial Officer, David Williamson; and our Chief Risk Officer, Tom Woods, will provide the financial and risk overview. Sonia Baxendale will then cover the Retail Markets business, and Richard Nesbitt will discuss World Markets.</p>
          <p>This morning CIBC reported net income for the third quarter of $71 million and cash earnings per share of $0.13. Our results this quarter were impacted by charges in our structured credit business although to a lesser extent than in previous quarters. Earnings apart from these charges and other items noted in our press release were $1.65.</p>
          <p>Our loan losses and expenses remain well controlled and our Tier 1 capital ratio after accounting for write-downs this quarter remains strong at 9.8%. In addition, we today issued a preferred share issue, which if added to our July 31 Tier 1 would put us at approximately a 10% Tier 1.</p>
          <p>This quarter, the largest portion of our structured credit charges are due to higher credit valuation adjustments recorded against our 8.89 billion U.S. total receivables from financial guarantors. Through July 31, we have recorded cumulative charges of just under $6 billion U.S. against this receivable, which of course have already been reflected in our Tier 1 capital ratio calculation.</p>
          <p>Giving effect to these charges, the remaining receivables from financial guarantors is 2.9 billion. While the impact of this remaining exposure has not been reflected through our charges to earnings, it has been reflected in the risk weighted assets used to calculate our Tier 1 ratio. This is because Basel II rules assign elevated risk rating to our financial guarantor counterparties when we downgrade their internal risk ratings. We have downgraded our internal risk ratings for our financial guarantors and therefore it is important to note that any future charges we may take against the 2.9 billion U.S. would have a leveraged reduction in risk-weighted assets and this would therefore dampen any negative impact of future charges on our Tier 1 capital ratio. David Williamson will touch on this in detail in his remarks.</p>
          <p>In this slide, our 9.8% ratio, 10% with our preferred, remains one of the highest among North American banks. In addition, it is very resilient to future CVA charges against our existing receivables for the reasons that I have given you. David Williamson and Tom Woods will provide further analysis of our capital strength in a moment.</p>
          <p>Turning to our business results, CIBC Retail Markets reported net income of 572 million up 12% from last quarter and down 4% from a year ago. Excluding these gains and losses, revenues were up 3% from last quarter and down 2% from a year ago. In light of the more difficult market conditions than a year ago, particularly for our retail brokerage business, the retail business had solid performance this quarter. In core retail marketing was down 2% from a year ago due entirely to lower treasury revenue allocations.</p>
          <p>We continue to achieve strong year-over-year volume growth particularly in cards and deposits while maintaining market share in what continues to be a highly competitive marketplace. In the area of personal lending, our market share has stabilized after a period of decline in recent years, while we shifted our portfolio mix towards secured lending and a lower risk point. For the second consecutive quarter, we had growth in our unsecured personal lending volumes, though we are taking a very measured approach to credit given the current environment.</p>
          <p>Credit quality for our retail loan portfolio overall remained strong and solid. While retail loan losses were up 22 million from last quarter, this was affected by strong growth in our cards portfolio and an increase in provisions from the expiry of previous card securitizations. Sonia Baxendale will comment further on our retail performance and priorities in her remarks.</p>
          <p>CIBC World Markets reported a loss of $538 million for the quarter, this included structured credit charges of 596 million down from 1.67 billon last quarter. Results outside the area of structured credit were better than Q2, but down from the third quarter of last year. Many areas of our wholesale business continue to be impacted as expected by much lower industry activities than a year ago as well as our desire to maintain a conservative risk posture in this environment.</p>
          <p>Our corporate loan portfolio continues to perform well with reported loan losses at 7 million for the quarter. Activity continues to reposition our World Markets business for a more sustainable performance in the future, Richard Nesbitt will comment further on our World Markets business performance and priorities in a moment.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide an update on our actions to reduce risk within our structured credit run-off business. In the area of U.S. subprime exposures hedged by financial guarantors, we reduced notional exposures hedged by ACA by 436 million this quarter through the termination of credit derivative contracts. In addition, normal amortization of subprime and other exposures hedged by ACA and other financial guarantors contributed to a further 292 million of notional reductions.</p>
          <p>As of July 31, our total remaining exposure to U.S. subprime assets hedged by financial guarantors is $2.84 billion. It is important to note this exposure assumed all assets go to zero and all counterparties sale and then go to zero in value. With respect to non-subprime assets hedged by guarantors, we took charges in the quarter of $768 million. Most of this charge was attributable to the widening of financial guarantor credit spreads as opposed to deteriorating value of the underlyings.</p>
          <p>Over 85% of this portfolio consists of CLOs and corporate debt securities, which despite the continued deterioration in credit market conditions during this quarter continued to be valued at 90 to $0.94 on the dollar respectively and whose credit quality continues to be highly rated. We also reduced exposures during the quarter that were hedged by counterparties other than financial guarantors. In our intermediation, correlation and flow trading books, we unwound 1.5 billion of bought and sold protection for a total reduction in notional of $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Developments within the financial guarantor industry over the past few weeks have generally been encouraging and positive, with several corporations announcing results in terms of restructurings and/or tariff and several comments by rating agencies generally being in the positive area. We are actively managing our structured credit positions and continue to assess all opportunities to reduce contingent risk in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the area of productivity, we continue to make steady progress. Expenses for the third quarter were 1.73 billion, down 5% from a year ago on a reported basis. Our target for 2008, which was established at the end of 2007, is to hold expenses flat to the fourth quarter of 2006, excluding FirstCaribbean and our restructuring activities. We continue to exceed that target through the first three quarters of 2008. Our focus remains on adjusting our infrastructure support activities in light of recent business divestitures. Our opportunities to maintain expense discipline in these areas should result in continued progress against our productivity targets over the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>In the area of balance sheet strength, CIBC remains very well capitalized. Our capital raise at the beginning of the year along with ongoing capital discipline resulted in a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.8% at the end of the quarter and 10% giving effect to our preferred issue today. This is well above our target of 8.5%.</p>
          <p>As I stated earlier, this figure is lower than it would be otherwise as a result of higher RWAs as a result of internal downgrades and RWAs set aside for the receivables from our financial guarantors. Our capital position is strong and prudent and will remain an area focus during this period of uncertain market conditions.</p>
          <p>In summary, CIBC made further progress in the third quarter to addressing its challenges with respect to structured credit and getting back on track to deliver consistent and sustainable performance. While a number of businesses are currently facing a challenging market, they are well positioned to take advantage of improving positions as they occur. As well work is ongoing to ensure that not only are they going to be well positioned, but they will be better positioned than they have been in the past. So that as conditions improve, our performance will also improve, in line and better than conditions.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn this meeting over to David Williamson, our Chief Financial Officer, for his financial review. David?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Gerry, good afternoon everyone. My comments also contain forward-looking statements, and I would remind you that actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>I'm going to refer in the slides that are posted on our website starting with slide five, which is a summary of our results for the quarter. At the top right, you can see the items of note included in our results this quarter. On a reported basis, we generated cash earnings per share for the quarter of $0.13. I'll provide more detail on structured credit run-off activities shortly.</p>
          <p>Excluding the items of note, our results this quarter of $1.65 for cash earnings per share were helped by higher volumes in retail markets and lower expenses that were hurt by lower treasury revenue and higher loan losses. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.8% as Gerry said and continues to be one of the highest amongst the North American banks.</p>
          <p>The next slide is a summarized statement of operations on a reported basis. The largest impact on results this quarter was for charges related to our structured credit positions. These positions along with U.K. based leveraged finance are now recognized separately as run-off activities led by a focused team with a mandate to manage and reduce the residual exposures.</p>
          <p>Slide seven provides details of the 885 million net pre-tax losses relating to our structured credit run-off activities. These losses resulted primarily from further deterioration in the value of underlying and a credit quality of financial guarantors due in general to continued weakness in U.S. residential mortgage market.</p>
          <p>Slide eight is a summary of our financial guarantor protection purchased against our U.S. residential mortgage market exposure. In U.S. dollars this slide shows that we have 7.7 billion of credit protection, which now has a fair value of 6.5 billion. We have taken credit valuation adjustments to-date of 4.7 billion and therefore have a remaining net fair value of 1.8 billion. This quarter 113 million of notionals were amortized through the maturity or normal pay down of positions.</p>
          <p>The counterparty shown as VI has an aggregate underlying of 1.9 billion with a fair value of 1.8 billion that have been terminated. These balances need to be deducted from this chart when determining future earnings at risk. With this adjustment made, it's the value of all the U.S. residential mortgage market assets and all the value of protection from the financial guarantors both held to zero. The maximum remaining exposure would be 2.84 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows our exposure to the U.S. residential mortgage market has declined over the past four quarters and provide details of the two components of the residual exposure I referred to in the previous slide. This next slide outlines the counterparty protection provided by financial guarantors where the underlying assets are primarily CLOs and corporate debt that are not related to the U.S. residential mortgage market.</p>
          <p>The far right column shows the fair value of the protection with each counterparty, which totals 2.4 billion at the end of Q3. Against this balance we have taken aggregate credit valuation adjustments to-date of 1.3 billion. The increase in CVA recorded during the quarter on these positions was 768 million. This resulted from an increase in the fair value against the holdings and continued deterioration in the credit quality of the financial guarantors.</p>
          <p>This quarter we experienced amortization of notionals of 179 million through the normal pay down of positions. While we have seen amortization in past quarters, the impact was far greater this quarter especially when we combine it with the amortization I noted earlier in our USRMM positions.</p>
          <p>This next slide highlights that our Tier 1 ratios affected by the combined impact of the write-down of CVA that goes through earnings and the high level of risk weighted assets attributed to the residual financial guarantor exposure. Under Basel II our internal credit ratings on the financial guarantors have resulted in substantial risk weighted assets being recognized, against the counterparty exposure and it is important to recognize that if higher CVA charges become necessary against the 2.9 billion of counterparty exposure, it will result in a release of these risk weighted asset balances.</p>
          <p>This would mitigate the impact of those charges on the Tier 1 ratio by approximately 50% of what would otherwise occur. This is not a new phenomenon but it is becoming more pronounced due to the low ratings we have assigned to the financial guarantors and the resultant build of related risk weighted assets to the current level of U.S. $12 billion.</p>
          <p>There are a number of slides I covered in some detail last quarter that address other elements of our structured credit run-off positions. Changes in these areas have not been significant and therefore I do not intend to specifically address those slides this quarter. However, we have included the same slides in the appendix updated as of July 31, and we would, of course, be pleased to address any questions on those slides during the Q&amp;A period.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our business results, starting with Retail Markets, our revenue was 2.36 billion, down 31 million or 1% from Q3 of last year. Continued strong volume growth and the gain on sale of the remaining Visa shares were offset by lower treasury revenue allocations. This slide shows the components of our retail revenue in a format consistent with prior quarters.</p>
          <p>This quarter I intend to aggregate those product lines so that I can speak to the key drivers of retail banking, wealth management and FirstCaribbean revenue rather than the individual business units.</p>
          <p>On the slide I have combined the results of our core lending and deposit business lines into what I will refer to as retail banking. This includes personal and small business banking, Imperial Service, mortgages and personal lending, cards and our Retail Markets' other business lines.</p>
          <p>One important point of note is that year-over-year results for each of these businesses were affected by internal funds transfer pricing allocations. Our internal funds transfer pricing system provides a liquidity payment to business units that source or provide funding and charges a liquidity cost to business units that use funding. This factor explains the revenue decline for a user of funds such as mortgages and personal lending and the revenue increase in a supplier of funds such as personal and small business banking. These charges and payments net to close to zero for retail banking on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Given internal funds transfer pricing does not significantly affect year-over-year results for retail banking, my commentary will focus on results excluding this factor.</p>
          <p>Revenue of 1.67 billion was down 34 million or 2% versus Q3 of last year. We experienced strong volume growth across our key retail product groups. Retail banking spreads were down slightly year-over-year as continued competitive pricing for deposits, the effect of shifting our portfolio to secured lending and lower mortgage refinancing fees were partially offset by better mortgage pricing.</p>
          <p>Cards results benefited from the $24 million gain on the sale of our remaining Visa shares and overall banking results were hurt by the lower treasury revenues this quarter, a portion of which are allocated back to retail and appear in the other line. Treasury revenues were down from a very strong Q3 of last year due to a more difficult market this quarter. In addition, there were fewer opportunities for revenue this quarter as we have reduced limits given the more volatile environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14, we experienced strong volume growth in our lending and deposit businesses. In cards, we continue to hold the number one market position in both outstandings and purchase volumes. We continue to see improvement in unsecured lending, which is up for the second consecutive quarter, although we continue to have a measured approach to growth in this area given our risk posture and the current environment.</p>
          <p>Our market share has improved in cards and consumer deposits from last quarter and is stable in residential mortgages and personal loans.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 highlights the results of our combined wealth management businesses. Included here is our retail brokerage and asset management business lines. Revenue of 392 million was down 29 million or 7% from Q3 of last year on lower new issue and trading activity due to continued volatility in capital markets. In addition, revenue in the asset management business was lower as mutual fund flows shifted into shorter-term funds.</p>
          <p>FirstCaribbean revenue was 165 million, up 32 million or 24% from last year. About half of the increase is due to a lower internal charge that is related to the cost of acquisition. Excluding the 4 million Visa gain, the remaining increase is due to growth in loan volumes, improved spreads and higher fees, offset somewhat by the impact of the stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>Retail Markets net income was 572 million down 24 million or 4% from the prior year. The provision for credit losses was 196 million up 29 million or 17% from last year. Tom Woods will discuss the topic in detail in his remarks, so I won't add any comments here. Non-interest expenses were 1.38 billion, down 29 million or 2% from Q3 of last year through continued expense discipline.</p>
          <p>Turning now to CIBC World Markets. As discussed Q3 revenue was hurt by additional losses and structured credit, but to a much lesser extent than in Q1 and Q2 of this year. Excluding the effect of structured credit run-off, Q3 revenue of 275 million was up 29 million from Q2 amid the continued challenging market environment.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual lines of business, starting with capital markets, revenue excluding structured credit run-off was 184 million versus 159 million in Q2. Within capital markets, fixed income and currencies revenue was up from Q2 partially offset by weaker performance in global equities.</p>
          <p>Investment banking and credit products revenues of 134 million was up 32 million from Q2. Q3 saw higher mark-to-market gains on corporate loan hedging activity and investment banking revenue was lower in Q3 primarily due to lower M&amp;A and advisory revenue and slower equity new issue activity consistent with the general market environment. Merchant banking results were up from Q2. We continue to expect moderate levels of earnings for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to World Markets expenses, Q3 expense of 266 million were down 92 million from Q2 due to lower litigation and severance expenses and lower performance related compensation. All these factors led to a World Markets' net loss for the quarter of 538 million. Excluding the impact of structured credit losses net income was 58 million, up 35 million in Q2.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our total expenses and our performance versus our 2008 target. Our target is to hold expenses flat relative to analyze fourth quarter 2006 expenses. We have made adjustments as noted on the slide to ensure a reasonable comparison. As you will see, we continue to run ahead of our objective to continued expense discipline.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. At this point, I'll now turn it over to Tom Woods.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. My comments may also contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>Slide 52, Credit Risk; specific loan loss provisions in the second quarter were 202 million or 46 basis points of net loans and acceptances. The quarter-on-quarter increase of 28 million was due to increases of 14 million in each of our Retail Markets and World Markets.</p>
          <p>World Markets specific loan loss expense was 11 million in the quarter. New provisions were up from the second quarter and the third quarter also incurred lower levels of reversals in the large corporate portfolio than we experienced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Retail Markets specific loan loss expense was 191 million in the quarter. Cards provisions were up due to a combination of higher volumes, the establishment of an allowance for securitized balances that came back on balance sheet at maturity, and slightly higher loan loss rates. This was partially offset by lower losses in personal loans.</p>
          <p>Steps taken to manage the slightly higher cards delinquencies are yielding favorable results and both delinquencies and provisions for credit losses are expected to return towards more normal levels in Q4. Net impaired loans decreased to 294 million at the end of Q2 with all of the quarter-over-quarter decrease coming from the consumer portfolios.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk, slide 53; this shows the Q3 distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios. In Q3, 67% of trading days were positive up from 53% last quarter, but down from 75% in 2007. The trading revenue here does not include the reductions in mark-to-market value of our structured credit assets as this analysis is carried out only at each month end.</p>
          <p>Slide 54, as Gerry said, the Tier 1 ratio was 9.8% or 10% pro forma today's preferred share issue. Our capital position remains amongst the strongest of the North American banks and provides substantial cushion in the event we have further structured credit charges. Capital decline during the quarter and structured credit write-downs were partially offset by internal capital generation.</p>
          <p>The Tier 1 ratio was also negatively affected in the quarter by an increase in risk weighted assets as several of our financial guarantor counterparties were downgraded, and as Gerry and David mentioned earlier, the increase in RWAs related to our financial guarantor counterparties as they've been downgraded reduces the potential impact of any future valuation adjustments on our Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to Sonia Baxendale, Head of Retail Markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. My remarks may also include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>Our fundamentals of Retail Markets are solid. We had strong volume growth and maintained market share. Starting with credit cards, outstandings grew 12% year-over-year primarily due to premium card volume growth. New account growth is strong with increasing volume being sourced through our internal bank channels' cross-sell initiative.</p>
          <p>In this quarter our newest premium cards Visa Infinite Gold and Aventura were rolled out to existing qualified clients. We are also increasing new client acquisition of Infinite cards. Credit quality remained strong. Residential mortgages continued to perform at industry growth rates with balanced growth of 12% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In the short-term, revenue is being impacted by lower prepayment break fees as a result of increased client retention rates from prior years. With the softening in the housing market, we expect mortgage growth to decline to low-to-mid single digits in 2009. Having said that, our originations activity so far is only marginally down from last year.</p>
          <p>In lending, our asset growth continues to show good momentum. While year-over-year market share is down slightly, we are flat year-to-date as unsecured balances had grown over the last two consecutive quarters. Personal balances are up 10% year-over-year, which is the strongest growth in three years. New balances continue to exhibit good credit quality with overall loss rate stable.</p>
          <p>In business banking, our operational initiatives to improve credit processes under enhanced lending risk policies are starting to generate increased business as small business client balances have stabilized after a significant period of decline.</p>
          <p>Deposit accounts and GICs had a strong quarter. Personal deposit balances grew 9% year-over-year and 8.7% on GIC. As a result our combined personal balance market share increased. Our bonus savings promotional offer was successful in increasing balances and we are retaining the majority of these balances after the conclusion of the program.</p>
          <p>In addition this quarter, we added the highly successful Aeroplan feature to our Unlimited Chequing Account. Clients can now earn monthly Aeroplan miles by consolidating their day-to-day banking transactions with CIBC in addition to receiving a welcome bonus mileage offer. Initial results have been extremely positive with new account opens up significantly over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Mutual funds continue to be impacted by volatility in global equity and fixed income markets. As investors continue to be cautious, mutual funds flows are primarily into short-term funds. As a result in Q3, mutual funds net redemptions were 154 million. These results placed us in seventh position overall in the industry year-to-date, up from 13th position for 2007 and increasing our market share by six basis points year-over-year and 11 year-to-date.</p>
          <p>The launch of new income oriented product solutions, the addition of proven investment manager talent to our team and the expansion of our wholesaling team are keys to continued growth and conversion to long-term product.</p>
          <p>In retail brokerage, revenues are down 6.8% as a result of continued volatility in the capital markets and lower new issue activity. And in distribution overall, we continue to make progress in our strategy to improve client access and experience in all of our channels. We opened three new branches this quarter, announced extended operating hours and additional branches opening Saturday and Sunday and in July, we expanded our Montreal telephone banking contact center, adding capacity to make an additional one million outbound sales calls to our clients in French and English.</p>
          <p>In summary, Retail Markets is performing well. Volume growth was strong and we maintained or increased market share in key business areas. Thank you.</p>
          <p>I'll now pass the mic to Richard Nesbitt.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Sonia. My comments may also contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.</p>
          <p>I will review CIBC World Markets' quarterly performance and provide an update on our efforts in 2008 as we build our business to focus on our strongest activities. I will also describe our high level priorities for building World Markets franchise over the next three years.</p>
          <p>As detailed earlier, World Markets recorded a loss of $538 million in the quarter. Adjusted for structured credit, net income was $58 million. As was the case throughout the industry, market and business conditions remained difficult throughout the quarter. While we saw some improvements in Q3, this sluggish business environment resulted in flat or negative revenue growth across our primary lines of business.</p>
          <p>Fixed income and currencies revenues improved slightly from the previous quarter. Foreign exchange continued its strong performance and fixed income trading revenues also improved slightly. This was due to increased retailer activity and participation in the government new issues. Revenues were down in our global equities business, the market for new &#x2013; equity new issues are operating at a slow pace across the industry.</p>
          <p>In real estate finance, as I mentioned in our last quarter's call, we are intentionally operating about half of our revenue generating capacity due to the ongoing uncertainties in the commercial real estate market in the United States. We continue to monitor industry conditions in this market and how we participate in it. We did have a revenue gain in the quarter resulting from our role as co-lead manager of a $1.2 billion offering in commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>
          <p>In investment banking, while market conditions had an impact on the number of opportunities, we continued to receive some strong advisory mandates. For example, World Markets was appointed as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of EnCana on the reorganization and spin-off of its oil sands assets and refinery interests.</p>
          <p>We were named financial advisor to Teck Cominco on its pending acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust. This transaction is valued at 11.5 billion and includes our role as co-lead arranger and joint book runner for $9.8 billion in bridge and term loans to support the transaction.</p>
          <p>We were appointed financial advisor to Saskferco on its $1.6-billion sale of a nitrogen fertilizer plant to Yara International, a Norwegian chemical company. And we are lead manager on a $288 million financing by H&amp;R REIT and are sole underwriter of a U.S. $150 million offering by Central Fund of Canada Limited. That's a quick look at our performance in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>I also want to provide a brief update on progress made during the quarter on implementation of our new strategy for World Markets. Our strategy focuses on the mission we established earlier this year. Our mission is to bring Canadian capital markets products to Canada and the rest of the world, and also to bring the world to Canada. This is what the professionals in our business do everyday.</p>
          <p>Implementation of this strategy is divided into two components: first, the ongoing repositioning of our business that will continue throughout 2008; second, continuing to intensify our focus on our clients so we can deliver on our mandate as a premier Canadian-based investment bank.</p>
          <p>Last quarter I described many of the initiatives taken to reposition the World Markets franchise. This work is necessary to focus on the considerable strengths we have in our primary lines of business and there are four continuing businesses in World Markets: investment corporate merchant banking, global equities, fixed income and currencies and real estate finance. The fifth activity is the run-off of assets from businesses we have terminated such as structured credit.</p>
          <p>In Q3 we completed a detailed bottom-up review of these continuing businesses. As a result of this review, we moved quickly on a number of initiatives involving our trading room and infrastructure activities. We are terminating or reducing activities that are inconsistent with our mission and goals or where the rewards do not justify the risk.</p>
          <p>We are investing in activities that reinforce our renewed mission and goals and provide an acceptable risk on return. For example, we are terminating certain Euro-based derivatives activities which are unrelated to our mission. We are reducing the size of CIBC's asset-backed conduits programs. We are reducing our infrastructure in London, New York and Asia. We reduced a number of employees in World Markets, announcing the elimination of 100 positions in May. Overall with the exit or sale of businesses since the beginning of the year, our staffing levels have been reduced by 40%. In our continuing businesses, there has been a reduction of 14%.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have made a significant number of new hires that deepen our senior management leadership capabilities in key areas. It is critical we complete this rebuilding work quickly so that we are in the best possible position once industry conditions improve. We need an effective transition from repositioning the franchise to building the business.</p>
          <p>For the medium-term, our goal is to organize ourselves so we continue to deliver outstanding service and value to our clients. To achieve this, we have developed a plan to focus on our strongest client relationships. These relationships are clearly some of the best in the industry. We want to solidify our reputation in the marketplace by making them even stronger.</p>
          <p>To conclude, this has been a difficult year for our business and for our industry, but we have completed a lot of work to rebuild our business, there is more to be done. Over the medium-term, our success will be measured by our ability to generate consistent earnings across the full business cycle. I'm confident we are on the road to achieving this goal and delivering on our mandate to CIBC and its shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from Jim Bantis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon, just a couple of questions; when I look at the trading revenue Richard, the last couple of quarters have basically been non-existent and I can recognize that the conditions are tough and there has been some retrenchment, but I just want to get a perspective on what the capabilities in terms of the net trading revenue could be going forward under your new plan and incorporating some of the retrenchment that you've done in certain businesses, because what we are seeing is from other banks whether its Canadian or U.S. despite the conditions, they are still producing medium size or significant trading revenues, so I just wanted your flavor on that.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just looking at slide 13, which was the retail market slide, lower treasury revenue and mortgage for financing fees were cited for the decline in 2% revenue, but if you were to adjust for these items would they &#x2013; what would the revenue growth be and would it be consistent with the volume growth that Sonia is referring to? And I will stop there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it is Richard first. I'll take the first question first then I'll pass it on to the second question. I think the best way &#x2013; we haven't really talked about the individual splits of the business going forward. But if you wanted to take a look at what we think we can do going forward, total economic capital assigned to World Markets is approximately 3 billion. Approximately half of that is for our ongoing businesses and the other half is for run-off activities.</p>
          <p>And if you recall the bank wide through the cycle target for return on equity is in excess of 20%. So we would expect World &#x2013; CIBC World Markets to be able to consistently produce stable earnings to meet that 20% threshold on the capital we are using in our continuing businesses, which is about half of that 3 billion.</p>
          <p>Under improved market conditions, we would expect it to be able to do better than that and somewhat higher than normalized results that you've seen here in Q3.That is about as far as we have gone in terms of answering that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, do you feel that you have gone as far as you can in terms of the retrenchment? Is there more businesses to close? Do you see it continuing in a bit of more of a downward cycle before a rebound happens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have gone through all of our businesses now. We have had business plans done by each of our businesses and the ones that we had intended to close or terminate we call them, we've terminated. The ones that we've intended to keep and those are the four that I've talked about here, we intent to keep. So, I think that process is complete and although we have pulled back, we, of course &#x2013; we have reduced our risk posture as well as our use of resources during this &#x2013; just this period of market instability along with the rest of the players in the industry.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim I'll &#x2013; I'll take the second part of your question, regarding the treasury results. I won't specify the amount of the decline in treasury revenues, but I will give you a sense of the &#x2013; the quantification to a degree or at least give you a sense of the magnitude.</p>
          <p>So, first-off, you referred to slide 13, where the allocation from treasury affects retail through the other line and you'll see that decline from 149 in Q3 of last year to 106 in Q3 of this year and I'd say that all of that and more of &#x2013; was in relation to treasury revenue allocations. So, when you look at the decline quarter-over-quarter of 34 million and that's obviously more than taken care of, by the decline in treasury revenue.</p>
          <p>I guess I would say this, when we're talking about declines in treasury revenue, just to give you a sense that Q3 was particularly strong quarter for returns on the treasury fund zone in relation to interest rate positioning and in this quarter, not surprisingly it's tougher market to successfully take views on interest rate movements; and plus given the volatile market, we've reduced limits, so that just reduces the ability for our treasury team to generate profits.</p>
          <p>So we are still profitable; this quarter we're just taking about a comparative reduction in treasury revenues. So, that's where it shows up in other and it's more than compensates for the difference between those two years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, Jim, just to add to that, when you take all of that noise out, the year-over-year revenue in retail would have been about plus 3%, the positives being primarily cards, deposits, GICs, in particular the areas that were greater challenge, were brokerage and mutual funds, those that were far more impacted by the environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could quickly review for me again the &#x2013; the approach taken to the fair value determination, particularly in the non-residential, U.S. residential mortgage bucket on the credit default swaps, the 2.4 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Brad, I'll speak to that. We're now on slide &#x2013; so we are all on the same page here, you are speaking to the slide 8, I guess that would be, right, where we are looking at the &#x2013; no, sorry you said 2.4 billion. So you are looking at the slide 10, the non-USRMM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually looking at your shareholder report. But yes that's right the 2.4, the fair value calculation there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to get a sense for what your inputs are for that valuation for these different &#x2013; not for the hedge valuation like for the value adjustments, but for the actual fair value of the underlying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. I am with you. So when we are &#x2013; just as Tom referred to, the process that we do monthly just by the nature of these assets, there's not &#x2013; these are the -call them level three assets where we can't look to market observable pricing. So the process is broker quote process. So once per month we go into the &#x2013; to the markets and get indications of pricing. And that's the basis upon which we get a sense of the mark for the fair value as you put it of the underlyings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you update that for us for August then, because I think that these are for July, if you're doing it monthly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the aggregate number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the end of each month, we haven't been releasing the inter-month period. But even if I wished to, I couldn't at this point, because we have to get to the end of August and then there is some period of days after that where we get quotes and so forth. So that process doesn't &#x2013; wouldn't unfold until sometime after Labor Day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions. First of all, in connection with the impact of the increase in risk-weighted assets that shows this &#x2013; okay, it's slide &#x2013; and you have basically got the counterparty exposure elevated by about a 400% risk-weighting here. Can you tell us under Basel II, what's the maximum risk-weighting that these types of exposures could go to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite a substantive amount. Under Basel II it could go to 1,250 &#x2013; 1,250. So quite a substantive amount, but these ones are at, as you say, roughly 400%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, can you &#x2013; you may want to get back to me on this offline, but one of the things I was trying to figure out was the total impact of ineffective hedges on earnings this quarter, in other words the ACS 3855? Can you give me some idea of what that impact on earnings was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are the impact of ineffective hedges. On that front, Michael, I would have to get back to you. And what we'll do is to the extent that when we discuss it you and I, if it is something that I figure to be to the benefit of the other participants, we'll post that on to our frequently asked questions. So anything that comes out of that we think would be of interest to the broader audience for those listening, we will post that on to the frequently asked questions section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you why I ask. It is because &#x2013; from discussions I've had previously it seems to be a number of other data items that you do release and the numbers that I get suggest that it actually made a fairly significant contribution to earnings in the latest quarter. But I just wanted to confirm that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well that will require a bit of follow-up, because I don't &#x2013; that doesn't ring a bell, so to speak. So let's look at it and if that's the case, we'll make sure it's posted through and you can see the details.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Couple of questions probably for David or Tom. Firstly, on the counterparties on the hedge exposure, the bank has been relatively conservative here in using market quotes throughout 2008 on both the underlying and the counterparties. Staying with that principle of conservatism, can you talk to perhaps the use of realized deals in the market or transactions that you have seen with some of your counterparties and how using marks at that level would differ from the levels we see in the July data today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me make a couple of comments and then the rest of my team can follow up as they would like. You are absolutely right. What we've done is used broker quotes for the underlyings and credit spreads &#x2013; current credit spreads for the monolines. And that's &#x2013; we've got a couple of advantages. One, with the monolines, it's a highly volatile space. So current spreads do give the market view at that point in time which is, as I say, due to the volatility that current indication is a good thing to have.</p>
          <p>Second thing, and this is one of the main points of value I guess for us and hopefully for those who follow the bank, by using current market spreads on the monolines, it gives a very good sense of what we'll likely be doing with our credit valuation adjustment. So during the quarter you and anyone else who is tracking the bank can get a sense of what the CVA status would likely be during the course of the quarter. So that's a mechanism that can be tracked and I think is helpful for both of the parties. So we're going to always sort of defer to that type of approach, <mark type="inaudible" />, use the market credit spreads as the best bell weather given all the data in the market as to what the view is for the appropriate provision against those receivables.</p>
          <p>Now as to what you are saying as far as restructuring activities or those types of activities, we would &#x2013; we have one counterparty where we did kick over, if you will, off of credit spreads to what we think we will realize on that position. And I'd say we &#x2013; that would be the only change we would make to our practice. The benefits, as I outlined, the current credit spreads have enough merit we would stick with that. But if we get to a point where there is a restructuring or we just have a view of what our ultimate recovery would be, that's when we would kick over to using that as  the basis for determining the provision just like we did with that one counterparty some number of months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; okay, and just to be clear on that. I mean, obviously with certain of your counterparties it would seem that the final two days of the quarter certainly were a key driver in helping those credit spreads come along. And my point would be, if you get the view here as these things go through restructuring that you are &#x2013; or any kind of negotiations that you are undergoing, that your &#x2013; the amount you'll actually collect from these counterparties would be a lot less than those spreads are indicating, it would seem given the conservatism the bank has employed all year in marking the book, that would be a better way to go in my view, anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's a fair point. If you get &#x2013; I guess my comment is it is such an advantage to use the market indicated rates, that they just don't require or allow for a judgment on our part. But to your point there is no doubt that proper accounting would be &#x2013; if we got to a point where we really thought, based on the knowledge we have, that our recovery would be less than what those spreads were leading us to, we'd be forced to, and it would be appropriate, to make sure we take the right conservative position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very quickly here on lending related credits, you mentioned the credit cards. The other uptick seemed to be in business services. If someone could just let us know what's happing there and what exactly this category encompasses.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the real estate finance in the U.S., looks like a $1.9 billion commitment outstanding. Your impairment trends looks very good. Just any kind of update on watch list or formations you're seeing there, so the business services in the U.S. real estate finance. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sumit, it's Tom Woods. Business services is a very broad category and we and the other banks go by SIC codes. As it happened this quarter we had a couple of small provisions there in the hotel and other services areas. Now hotel you might not think of being business services, but that's the SIC code for that. So we had a couple of transactions in the U.S. that we've taken what we think are prudent provisions there. So that's the uptick there and that's the business that we're not actively engaged in any longer and we don't have big positions, but two of them we had were there.</p>
          <p>The U.S. real estate finance; we've got a summary in the MD&amp;A &#x2013; that &#x2013; just maybe to elaborate a bit on that because this is a business we continue to feel very good about notwithstanding the press that you see on U.S. commercial real estate. The reason we feel very good about it, and I'll let Richard add if he likes, is the properties we have are very diverse. About three quarters of them were entered into after June '07, so these are post correction. Virtually all of the loans are relationship driven as opposed to competitive driven and that's the function of the fact that our team has been in place there since the mid 90's. We have as you say about a 1.9 billion, loan-to-values are very low and again that's the function of the relationship, they're typically in the low 60's.</p>
          <p>Maybe I'll just stop there and see if that's enough for you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. David, this isn't so much an indictment of the accounting, but along the lines of your discussion with Sumit, the reason why those credit spreads collapsed in the last couple of days is because the feeling was companies were going to get into these agreements, the monolines would get off some of the exposure and it would seem that taking recoveries this quarter on a couple of the monolines &#x2013; and I think you'd agree that there were probably some recoveries this quarter of previously taken provisions &#x2013; that it seems somewhat convoluted to do it that way given that that was the main reason why the credit spreads came in, in the first place. And again, I understand that you're focused on the credit spreads, but do you agree that it seems a little strange to be taking the recoveries in, given the reason why the credit spreads came in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mario, strangely enough I see on the last day of the month of the quarter we actually took a hit on spread, that's like a big one...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am talking about on the subprime side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually no, pretty universal it was &#x2013; so &#x2013; but I mean, I guess the best way to answer that is I mean you can get &#x2013; you look at the spreads on &#x2013; and relative to the ratings and you can see some very abnormal kind of situations, but it's &#x2013; frankly the spreads have proven to be the one kind of objective barometer as to what all the collective views of all the people in the market think that this could play out and so there is a tendency where events will happen. Some will be taken off the lots or put on lots and the spreads might not move in the same alignment. And then when you get into restructuring and capital injections and such force again it causes &#x2013; you sort of from a fundamental perspective say well that would cause you to want to do more or less provisioning. But the problem with introducing that kind of judgment is it is judgment and then the other problem is that it detracts from the process we have now where you and others can say during the quarter or at the end of the quarter, this is where I think roughly the bank's going to be and kind of the rationale for it as opposed to a judgmental overlay.</p>
          <p>But to Sumit's point, if it got to restructuring, got to the level where we had a pretty good sense of what our recovery would be and it's out of the sync with what we've got in the book, we would shift. And we've done that before with the one counterparty. And if we had a view as a result of being involved in restructuring so forth that we had too much on our book so to speak, again, to his point, conservatism would drive us to make an adjustment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you let us know whether the bank is willing and perhaps even actively trying to negotiate with some of the key monolines, perhaps like an SCA. Is that something that's ongoing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, to make a couple of comments, we haven't indicated the names of any of the monolines. So I need to be cautious about any comments regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> on the different monolines. Now the one thing that when we're speaking about credit valuations and such force, and we do &#x2013; some of the aberrations are that we have very &#x2013; and especially this quarter we took fairly big CVA's on monolines that are still AAA and recently affirmed on a AAA. So I guess that speaks to the comment regarding conservatism.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And David, I was asking you were discussing terminating any of these agreements with any of the monolines or &#x2013; and you can't answer that I guess, maybe you can answer?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just actually wrap it up with just one other thing. On the non-subprime</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've given us really good disclosure on the sort of ranges of first loss protection and all that stuff and if you go back &#x2013; and this is something I've been confused about for a while &#x2013; it seems really hard to imagine that there could be a 10% valuation adjustment &#x2013; not a valuation adjustment &#x2013; like a 10% marked-to-market charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On that say, $25 billion notional, given how much first loss protection there is &#x2013; and I understand you're going to broker quotes and broker quotes are what they are, but it just seems inconceivable that with those sorts of first loss protection that there could be any charges their at all, there could be any market value adjustment at all. So I guess what I'm asking is, is there something we don't understand about that notional amount specifically on the first loss? Is there any reason why brokers, the ones providing the quotes really don't put a value on that first loss protection? Is there something we don't really understand that would give rise to that 10% charge or 10% valuation, because on the surface, common sense tells you there shouldn't be any valuation adjustment on that. Could you help clarify?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well the first answer is I think you are right. And we'd &#x2013; universal support for your comments, that these quotes are getting to places that I think are hard to justify and it speaks to, I guess a couple of things.</p>
          <p>First &#x2013; and the chart you referred to and the data that you referred to is on page 14 of the MD&amp;A. Those listing, I think, you're right Mario as we provided quite a bit of information there for a couple of reasons. Fundamentally, the underlying performing fund, the level of subordination is such that's after they right the current level of mark is surprising and hard to justify, but it's determined on the basis of supply and demand,</p>
          <p>So the upshot being low level of liquidity and we mark half of the basis outlined and that's resulting in the 10% haircut on the value of these.</p>
          <p>So the upshot is, I think you're right; form a fundamental basis it is surprising. Hence we put that data into the MD&amp;A, so that people can see the level of subordination and we can help them kind of get to position you've concluded. But I guess in answering your question there isn't anything that you're missing that we are aware of, that should cause you to change your fundamental perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's ultimately the question; is there anything we don't know that someone else does, like the broker quotes for example, the brokers are actually providing the quotes. Is there anything we don't know that someone else does that would justify that kind of market; I think your answer to me here is, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing that we are aware of that has been missing; hence we are trying to maximize the disclosure so that people can reach that kind of best possible view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, we do and the mark as you know this quarter moved and again there is no reason for us to see that kind of shift and again other than supply and demand and that's was driving how we value it.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, the spike in loan losses on the card book, can you tell us how much of that is due to the recapture of the big securitization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't got into that granularity, but roughly speaking if you look at the 110 provision we took in cards in Q3 versus the 68 last quarter, that's a 44 delta, about half of it was due to volume and the other half was split pretty evenly between the securitization coming back on, both in absolute terms and relative terms and rate increases. So the rates would be well less than a half, probably well less than a third as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I'm sorry. I mean higher delinquencies which translate into higher provisions and slightly higher bankruptcies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The second question, relates to this point that you made, Tom well, Gerry as well, was this issue that to be extent there are more charges on the USRMM and non-USRMM exposure that you expect to get back a chunk of it on the RWA side. So, I just wanted to make sure I'm clear on that. So if, for example, on your USRMM, on your single largest position, the monoline number five, where you have a fair value of 1.9 billion and 800 million of VAs. So you've got a billion of &#x2013; that's owed by that. If you were to write that entire thing off, your RWAs would drop by 500 million; is that how I should think of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer it in the general and certainly David jump in here. And it is a &#x2013; you can't give an answer just based on this because we use internal rating to &#x2013; internal ratings, but conceptually just for you and others, the &#x2013; when we downgrade companies, in effect what we've done is built up an RWA capital or RWA assignment. Okay? And when we subsequently write down the underlying and hence the receivable, the receivable as an asset is lower, hence the amount of RWAs we need is lower as well. So if we were to write off any particular counterparty on that list, it would depend on the rating, but we would no longer need any RWAs because we've no receivable on our books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so again for one that's rated CCC; one would think you have a huge multiply on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you wrote off a billion in a CCC name, as you say, the receivable wouldn't be there anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the multiplier wouldn't be there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. And the multiplier in the case of an internally rated CCC, as David said before, is 12.5 times, so it's very large. That's the point Gerry tried to make in his...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So why is it only 50% then? Shouldn't it be &#x2013; if you take $1 out of &#x2013; $1 of VA hit, and let's say the tax effective is 70% of that number, shouldn't you get a multiple of that on the RWA front, not a fraction of it on the RWA front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Ian, you do get a multiple of that. In other words, if you have a CCC with a receivable of $1...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have RWAs of 12.5 times that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. But I think Gerry said in his comments that for every VA charge, I think you said you got half of it back on the RWAs. That's what I am saying. It seems to me is if it's multiples, not fractions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Gerry here. The &#x2013; if you look at that table, the &#x2013; and again it would depend upon our internal ratings, your counterparty 5 that you were looking at, as you can see there are a variety of ratings beside that counterparty from a BBB minus, which is low level investment grade, all the way to the CCC, that Tom saw. And so, clearly when you work it back, since the net receivable here is the 1.873 billion minus the 807 million, that means the net receivable is about $1 billion. And &#x2013; but clearly we are not internally rating it at a level of 12.50. 12.50 is when there is no value left whatsoever and you'll be running off that 100% and roughly the way that's arrived at is if you workout 12.50 times 8%, it comes to a 100% capital allocation. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly our internal rating is some amalgam of the BBB minus, the B2 and the CCC because otherwise if we are at 12.5 this one alone would have gotten 12.5 billion of risk-weighted assets and since that's the total that we have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That obviously could not be the case. Now, if you took something in the vicinity of the average risk-weighting because I'm not going to get into each of these counterparties, you know, we have approximately 2 point &#x2013; the total exposure is 2.9-ish of net receivables and the RWA allocation is 12 in change. There is a lot of puts and takes in here, but that would allow you to come to something like a four factor. And again, I'm not telling you that's the factor for this. But if you use our macro numbers and derive a factor, a four factor would not be too bad. And so I think what you're trying to get at is that if the fair value was 1873 and the VA is 807 the net receivable is $1 billion-ish.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The $1 billion-ish, if you use the 400% means that we have $4 billion of RWA to signed against that.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that gets written off several things happen. The first is that you would have a net charge assuming a 30% tax-rate. Again, I'm not telling you what the tax-rate is...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You would have a net charge that would filter through to capital of $700 million, okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You would have a relief in your Tier 1 capital of the $4 billion of RWAs. They would disappear as a result of the write-off. And if you look at the net capital effect again at 8%, you would have $320 million of capital released in your Tier 1. So that's why you come to somewhere in the vicinity of 50% impact.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. My question is actually rather simple and straightforward. My question has to do with the expense base at CIBC. And I guess this question is for Gerry. Looking at your slide 24 on expense objectives, you're obviously ahead of it. I'm just wondering when I still look at it however, you're not near the median for the productivity ratio. I mean, we have only had three bench reports so far. But by my numbers, it looks like you still will not get the median. I'm wondering if you can give us any sort of idea if about a $1.7 billion expense base is an appropriate one to think about for CIBC going forward in light of some of the head count reduction we've at World Markets?</p>

          <p>Well, there are two things to that. We've got the median mixes a strategic objective and it's been established before because it's an evergreen objective and also because as the competitors move so too shall we move. And there is also a reasonability to the median. And there's a variety of ways to get to the expense target. In recent years, we had several programs. And those programs &#x2013; I think we were fairly successful in meeting the targets.</p>
          <p>Our expense targets today are mainly derivations of two things. Number one, if business activity has declined in certain areas and therefore we feel there is an opportunity to right-size expenses against reduced business conditions, we would do that, but more importantly what in the next while we're going to be pursuing is the fact that we have exited a number of businesses that have that fair amount of infrastructure support behind them.</p>
          <p>When you exit the businesses, you don't automatically &#x2013; you don't automatically have all of the infrastructure reductions come in simultaneously, because some of it requires moving two plants to one city in order to combine them for purposes of technology and that sort of thing. And so basically what we've been doing in recent times is, we've been absorbing all of the inflationary impact of cost increases in rents and other areas and holding our expenses flat or better to the target that we set, which was Q4 of '06.</p>
          <p>Our intention is through an ongoing program of expense discipline with a big focus on right-sizing infrastructure in light of business exits, our view is that we are going to be targeting to keep our expenses on the flat side and we believe that where we are lagging today is on the revenue side overall for the bank, in terms of getting on side from a median mix view point.</p>
          <p>Expense discipline will mean that every revenue dollar of increase will be that much more productive, but we do believe that it holds the line on expenses, is our strategy now and we've been fairly successful at it, and make sure that we have a revenue approaching industry growth rates or in the case of the last year some areas in the industry have shrunk and we'd like to make sure that we're not shrinking more than those areas. As long as it's appropriate for our risk appetite because in some areas our risk appetite is not the same as the industry's, it's flat.</p>
          <p>But the short answer is, there are continuing opportunities as a result of business exits and the trailing expense savings that we can get from infrastructure, but that is not the primary area in terms of getting ourselves to our strategic targets. It's a necessary, but not sufficient condition to hold expenses flat. The key element there is to grow our revenues and to catch up with the industry.</p>
