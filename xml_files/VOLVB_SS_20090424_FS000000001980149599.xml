          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Volvo's Conference Call on the First Three Months, 2009. It will start with a presentation and thereafter there will be a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The conference will be chaired by Mr. Leif Johansson CEO of Volvo. Mr. Johansson, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, good morning and good afternoon to you everyone. We are taking the conference call of the Volvo first quarter 2009 and as is usual we have around the table here in Gothenburg, our CFO we have our business leaders and we also have people from Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>You can reach the slides that we will speaking to, available on our internet site and we are starting with slide two there, the one that says the headline Group highlights.</p>
          <p>It was obviously a difficult quarter and what turns out to be perhaps a difficult year. It started on a very low level. As you can see here adjusted for currency we had sales &#x2013; recorded sales in the first quarter which was minus 42% and of course there are rapid declines unheard of ever in the history of the Group. And we see there of course driven mainly, at least at the beginning of the quarter which was the worst part of the quarter by financial crisis and acute liquidity problems for many of our customers and then over time, it settled in at low rates here as a consequence of the real economy being damaged by that financial crisis.</p>
          <p>We had an operating loss of 4.5 billion which surely is not something that we like to see and we will be talking to you how we are adjusting to a much lower capacity utilization and production over the quarter and over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>We had a real decrease in trade payables, understandable when you put the brakes on as much as we have done in order to preserve that we are not building inventory. Normally we build inventory in first quarter, we have actually not built any inventory we have decreased inventory in the first quarter. That's good news but of course the penalty comes in trade payables coming down and thereby losing financing out of the Group.</p>
          <p>On the other hand on the financing of the Group we are doing well. And we have secured funding of 30 billion that we have a good liquidity position. Mikael Bratt, our CFO will speak later to that.</p>
          <p>Western Europe is at very low levels and we are now over the whole of Europe down 38%, but actually as much as 68% down in Eastern Europe. We have had a very slow start to the year in North America and I should say somewhat slower then what we have expected and that comes as a consequence again of the financial crisis and the slow economy of course that's developed and we are expecting there some perhaps bounce back towards the end of year.</p>
          <p>Then we can say that Japan has been a &#x2013; in very low volumes in the market, but the rest of Asia is doing slightly better and also it's higher than last year. But we don't have the same rates of decline there and even in some cases, like Construction Equipment, China even upward adjustments in the market.</p>
          <p>In South America then, down by about 12%. Now let's see. Flip to the slide to the Volvo Group there you see operating &#x2013; slide 3, you see operating income at lower volumes and obviously we are adjusting to you those. We have an under absorption in the quarter by 3 billion and we have layoff cost of 600 million which of course are really what it cost to put the brakes on as much as we are.</p>
          <p>We have and we will be hearing later that, we have increased credit provisioning for VFS of 700 million especially for Eastern Europe we'll hear more about that.</p>
          <p>We have raw materials and components in the first quarter here of 500 million delta compared to the first quarter of last year and of course that is coming on the basis of &#x2013; mainly on the basis of raw materials that went up or in the beginning of '08 and we have yet to see most of that come down. Even though it is coming down we still have a quarter-on-quarter effect of 500 million.</p>
          <p>And we also have had little effect there in that number of suppliers who have had difficulties financing &#x2013; difficulties in the quarter. Then we have a negative currency effect of 1.8 driven by the fact that we have had very dramatic currency changes over the quarter and over the comparison to last year's quarters. Mikael will take us through the details of how we do that.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D was down in comparable currencies by 7%, selling was down by 9% and administrative cost was down by 17%, so we are adjusting all of the components, all cost elements to lower volumes.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide four, the one that says sales growth over year, there you see how dramatic the downturn has become. That the downturns were dramatic there in the beginning of '08, now we see a really downturn there of 42%, so obviously a difficult quarter in that sense.</p>
          <p>Go to slide five, which is the workforce related cost. There you see an annualized reduction. The last time you saw a similar slide was in the last Q that was used to be 7 billion there. We have added an annualized reduction program here, takes us up to 9 billion and you see how that is expected to roll out over the different quarters. And let me make the point here that on the last given the notices that we had &#x2013; were giving in Sweden this last, past week, those cost reductions actually flow all the way into the first quarter of '10 as a consequence of the long layoff times we have in Sweden.</p>
          <p>In many other countries we have other tools like short term working weeks with the support from both governmental and to some extent individual contributions there and we are able to reduce cost quicker. But of course we have some remaining cost there. We have expected those programs to be with us for the whole of the year. Let me take France as an example, we actually now have the ability to send home both blue collar and white collar people with comparatively little cost from our point of view as we reduce production.</p>
          <p>But in Sweden we will have to go through giving notices and that takes time unless we can find other ways to achieve the same amount of flexibility that we are after that.</p>
          <p>That takes us to working capital and Mikael Bratt, our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Leif. Another few words on working capital and also later on the financial position for the Group. We posted negative cash flow of 15.7 in the quarter and as you can see on the working capital specification here on the slide six, the major part is then from the payables, 16.6.</p>
          <p>We managed to offset the negative effects in the cash flow from operational results with receivables and inventory. When it comes to the inventory of 1.5 reduction we should remember here that Q1 you normally have a seasonal effect where we build inventory, but this year we have actually managed then to reduce the inventory and quarter-on-quarter here we're talking about an 8 billion improvement compared to last year. And looking at new truck inventory we were down 10% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>When we talk about operating cash flow in the quarter here, we need to remember also that the issue we have here now with payables going out very strongly as we are paying the maturities that are from the production in September and October. We have not been able to offset by inventories in the same pace. So it's really a timing effect you are seeing here. As we go forward, we should catch up on this. And looking at inside the quarter, the majority of the payables were done in the first half of the quarter here.</p>
          <p>If we now switch over to page seven where we have the net financial position, you can see the result of the cash flow in the quarter. We have increased net debt-to-equity ratio to 63.2%. We should also remember here that our way of presenting the net debt includes the pension liabilities, which really is a long-term liability. But if you &#x2013; and if you strip that out, we come down to 49.6%, excluding the pension liabilities.</p>
          <p>And we should also remember that we are carrying the currency effect from 2008 into this quarter as well as the Swedish krona has maintained very low levels. So the currency effect, if you strip that out, you would bring the 63% down to 50% in Q1 here. So both pension and currency is of course including the 63% you see here. Our ambitions going forward is to be below 40% over time here, and that ambition certainly still remains.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence of the increased financial &#x2013; net financial debt here, we also see increased interest expense, going from around 340 million in Q1 last year to 800 million this year. And it's really volume-driven. And even though we have and are paying higher spreads than we did at that time, the reference rate has come down and compensating that to a large extent. So volume-driven effect there.</p>
          <p>Moving on to page eight where you see our funding situation. I would say here that we are in very good shape. A number of transactions were done in the market during the first quarter. We issued the euro bond the early part of the quarter followed up by a SEK bond. We have done EIB, we have done a number of bilateral agreements and also operating in the commercial paper market successfully here throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>And as you see on the slide here, we also signed a new revolving credit facility of almost 8.5 billion Swedish in April. It's not included in the numbers you see here, but as a reference, we have secured further committed facilities here. And the cash position remains strong, around 24, 25 billion here as we stand in the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So I would say that we have a very comfortable position and also looking forward, our refinancing need to coming years is very low, for at least the next two to three years.</p>
          <p>I think I will stop there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mikael. Leif Johansson back here again. And let's look at the slide that says Trucks, slide nine in the package. We have a real significant slowdown there as you see by 41% and again unheard of and hitting all markets at the same time rather than the normal progression of a downturn.</p>
          <p>We obviously have a big operating loss here and that is driven by lower sales and thereby lower income of course, but also with under absorption. And as you know, these are &#x2013; four brands here represent very major facilities at Volvo where we have had very low capacity utilization and production. And as you can see here, actually lower than sales, and inventories of new trucks were actually reduced by 10% there.</p>
          <p>In focus, we have a lot of discussion of course in many places and often painful such discussions because of downsizing and the participation of many of our colleagues and employees. And we are looking at different ways to improve flexibility on this downturn.</p>
          <p>We frankly don't think that the market, the whole of the global market will be almost halved over a very long time. So it's more a matter of when will it come back than if it will come back. As you know, trucks are tied &#x2013; sales of trucks is really production tools for the economy in general. And you would have to convince yourself that the economy would be down very, very long for us to remain at where we are. So we are trying find ways to downsize and get cost down; at the same time, have reasonable flexibility as we move forward.</p>
          <p>What happened in the beginning of the year here on aftermarket and services was actually a drop also in spare part sales in aftermarket and that's because of a number of customers having to park their fleets and we had an impact of that. I think towards the end of the quarter, that started coming back to more normal numbers. But more of an effect here actually that park had been &#x2013; or a number of the population had been parked.</p>
          <p>As we move forward, we will continue to make inventory reductions and make sure that we don't get into issues of losing margins on sales. Then of course we have in this quarter and over the next almost year here with the Euro 5 coming up in Europe, Euro 6 and then also U.S.'10. We are preparing for new emission regulation, which, as you know, drives with it very considerable cost, driven by regulatory rules. But we are also taking the opportunity when we have these to come up with what we feel new and exciting products. So tied to that, there is a product development, also to the benefit of customers.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 here is an important slide and one that is difficult to really make out. We are trying to provide you with the real numbers here. First of all, let me say that the real delivery rates, as you have seen now over the past three or four quarters, is not only tied to net order intake. We are actually selling products in deliveries that are coming from two sources really, net order and production and all then also inventories. And they combine to represent the real market demand for our product. And if you look at the comparison between Q1 '09 and Q1 '08 there, you see a drop in order intake of 65%. And then you should remember that Q1 '08 was still very strong, or at least strong years &#x2013; quarters of order intake. And then you see the 20,000 orders that we have gotten in, in Q1 '09, which of course is much lower than Q1 '08.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you can say Q1 '09 is 48% up from Q4 '08. And what you see there is really now a positive order intake in Europe, cancellations basically with very small numbers and gross order intake flowing into the order book at a much different way than it did in past couple of quarters here.</p>
          <p>North America to us is surprisingly low there. And we think that's driven by the fact that customers feel that they can buy products off of inventory, and we may think that they &#x2013; that will over time change. There are not much inventory left for it to be a potential pre-buy in the U.S., orders are soon going to have to come in, even though there are some inventory of course to be still sold.</p>
          <p>South America, as you can see, they are actually quite strong. And Asia, with the exception of Japan, not so bad either and other markets actually up here. So total of that means that we had 48% higher order intake in Q1 compared to Q4 '08. But as you can see, these are difficult numbers and we are at very low levels.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 11, there you see the heavy-duty truck market in Europe, which we have now adjusted downwards. In looking at what Q1 contributed and the recession rates there, and we are now saying it will be down by about 50% off of the high base there of above 300,000 units. And there is still a big question mark there, genuine uncertainty and very different across different member states in Europe.</p>
          <p>If you still go to North America, there you see a downturn, and again we are adjusting downwards to very low levels as you can see here, 30 or 40% down off of the 185. That takes you into the lowest point in almost 20 years here. And we don't think &#x2013; we don't think that that is a sustainable level. We have a very old population of trucks in North America, there is certainly an acute financial crisis and there is certainly a low level of industrial production, but at the same time you can say that the old fleet of trucks will not be there to be able to support an upturn when it comes.</p>
          <p>And again you can see the trend line as on both those two slides which are very much trending along with economic growth, and you would have to convince yourself that we should be in a very, very problematic economy to think that the markets will stay as low as they are right now, but difficult to call, and not and too early to say that we have seen a turn.</p>
          <p>That takes us to Construction Equipment and we have Olof Persson our new President and CEO of Construction Equipment and slide 13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Leif, and if we then start with the conditions in the global markets you can see from the slide that the total world market is almost half in the first quarter compared to the same period last year and in Europe if you look at that it's even worse with a decline of 64%.</p>
          <p>And of course, United States was heavily affected by this downturn and we came in 46% lower than last year. And adjusted for currency and acquired and divested units United States was actually down 59%.</p>
          <p>We are facing a very low capacity utilization during the quarter and I not sure that it was only around 20 to 25%. And of course those low volumes and under absorption due to the capacity utilization and negative currency effect that we had to report a second consecutive quarter loss and this time we came in at minus 1.395 billion which is almost in line with the last quarter report.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we have been able to defend our market shares in our most important regions. I'm also pleased that we have been able to continue our reduction of the unit inventories this quarter with another 10% in addition to the 20% that was achieved during autumn last year and actually if you exclude Lingong, our inventories were reduced by 29%. And this is of course a result of that we pulled the brakes very early last autumn in terms of reducing the capacity.</p>
          <p>Leif mentioned that we have seen if you look at the markets a little bit of an uptick in China in the quarter and actually now if we combine the Lingong and Volvo business in China, we are in units the number in the three in that market. We have a stable and good position there.</p>
          <p>Looking at our capacity, we started last autumn to give notice and we have now given notice to around to 4,300 employees. And that is corresponding to more than 20% of the total workforce compared autumn last year. And in focus is of course to continue now, the work that we are doing adjusting the capacity to the demand and we would have a very strong focus on inventories going forward as well during the second quarter and we will continue then having that contributing to our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Finally, the new business model I talked about in the last conference call is developing according to plan. And I am actually very pleased with the progress so far and looking at that business model, I do now expect cost savings in the magnitude of 500 million SEK to a billion SEK on a yearly basis and that will start to kick in at the end of this year and I would assume that we'll have full effect of those savings in less than two years from now.</p>
          <p>And that was Construction Equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Olof, thank you. And we have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson then on Buses, on slide 14.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. First quarter for the bus market we can see that we are more and more affected by the global economic downturn, I will say except for Asia. We have still a significant decline in the demand for coaches while city buses is to a lesser degree.</p>
          <p>And some numbers in North America, the coach market is down 30%, but it seems like it leveled out at that low level and then we have some imminent ordering right now showing that maybe we have reached a bottom there.</p>
          <p>Mexico it's the coach market down 50%, and also now in South America we can see a fairly fast decline in the Brazilian market. Coming from very high numbers but in North and South America, we see we have a reduction on the coach side there.</p>
          <p>In Europe, still the coach down 20, 25%. Some decline in the city bus segment, but not so much. And in Asia we can still see a growing bus market and all in all I will say if you read our order intake it's down then 8% compared to last year. So a fairly good order intake I will say mainly driven from business region international.</p>
          <p>Deliveries was declined by 20% when you count the number of vehicles and the net sales was up 10%. If you adjust that for exchange rate I would say it was up 3% and the main reason that we still have fairly high sales is that we have more complete buses compared to chassis in our product mix.</p>
          <p>The result was minus 95 million and the main effect is the lower volumes and also negative currency contracts that hits the P&amp;L for the first quarter. And focused going forward, we have our turnaround program that we have both and more on the cost side. We have done some capacity adjustment and we have noticed 650 people then in our different plans around the globe. We are sharpening our inventory reduction and we are then preparing now in Europe for Euro 5 introduction of the new emission legislation and as we can report from now we have engines with very good performance both on reliability and fuel consumption.</p>
          <p>So, I will say that is the report from Buses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, we then have G&#xF6;ran Gummeson, slide 15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The total market for marine engines continued to drop sharply during the last quarter. And both in Europe and in U.S. and we actually saw in some markets that the drop of up to 80%. The demand for industrial engines has until now been relatively stable, but we have also seen some decline during the quarter in some segments especially in Europe.</p>
          <p>But there are also some bright spots as Olof said from VC [Volvo Construction]. We have also an uptick in China and South-East Asia and their demands is acceptable. There we have had an operating loss in the quarter and that was mainly then due to the drop in sales, that had been more than 35% and also the under absorption in our production systems.</p>
          <p>Early this week we gave a second notice to around 100 employees in Gothenburg and also in our diesel engine factory in Vara, Sweden. And we have told the associations already in this case.</p>
          <p>We are as we speak now also reviewing our global structure with an aim then to take down the cost even further, and the target is to reduce the cost level by around 200 million Swedish crowns on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>We focused now on securing operating efficiency, and in this new downsized structure and manage our operating capital so that we can continue to secure a positive cash flow for the Group. I have already talked to you about the innovative drive system, the IPS system many, many times and now in April we will actually deliver the 10,000th unit of this new system. It's a good success for us and this is actually also &#x2013; it's a part in our targets when we started this project a few years back.</p>
          <p>And now during the summertime we will launch the next stage of this system where we actually are using the Volvo Group's 11 liter engine which means that we can now take on powerboats all the way up to 100 feet actually which is in the line of 35 meter boats. And create fuel savings all the way up to 50%.</p>
          <p>So that's basically a short report from Volvo Penta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xF6;ran. That takes us to slide 16, Volvo Aero and Staffan Zackrisson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The first quarter this year there is a downturn in air traffic. It's the second quarter that the downturn is affecting the industry and it was 8%, but even more severe is the downturn in air cargo is close to 25%. As a consequence of this, the demand for new aircraft is going down and Boeing and Airbus have started to lower their production rates and announced that for a number of aircraft types.</p>
          <p>If we look on the sales for Volvo Aero, it was positive 8% but if you have adjusted for dollar effect it is a net decrease by 12. So it's a decrease that goes over all areas and especially the aftermarket segment.</p>
          <p>Operating income was positive 83 million and that was of course also affected by capacity cost and also by weaker spare parts and also thirdly by hedging losses on the dollar.</p>
          <p>We have in our focus of the capacity adjustment. We have so far reduced about 15% of our capacity and alongside the capacity adjustments, we are working hard with the cost management on the other elements of our cost base and reducing capital.</p>
          <p>At this same time, we are preparing for the future business and we have a large proactive development program going on for the aircraft that's going to be introduced in the 2014 time range. And we have also built up our portfolio when it comes to aftermarket activity as we just announced an agreement but GE Aviation for asset management. And we're building that portfolio to get our future probability of selling more on the aftermarket to address that problem that we have.</p>
          <p>That concludes for Volvo Aero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So now we have Sal Mauro, we have slide 17 and we have Financial Services. Sal?</p>

      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. New retail financial volume for the first quarter was at 7.5 billion SEK. This represents a decrease of about 33% on a currency adjusted basis. While penetration has increased from 22% to 28%. The volume decrease reflects lower volumes at the Volvo Group BAs. Our portfolio grew by about 6%, again currency adjusted and most of that growth came in the first three quarters.</p>
          <p>Operating income has decreased to a negative 396 million SEK, attributable to a significant increase in provision for credit losses amounting to 780 million SEK. The majority of that provision is attributable to our Eastern European portfolio, most notably the following countries; Russia, Romania, Ukraine and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Where we've seen a sharp deterioration is in Eastern Europe and the economic conditions and the related portfolio performance with increased delinquencies, repossessions and inventory levels.</p>
          <p>Just as a reminder and a review, we set our reserves in accordance with IAS 39. The IAS 39 states that you have to take a look at impairment in the portfolio. From that we set up a specific and general reserves and we booked the provision to the P&amp;L in order to effectuate those reserves and any of the write offs taken against the asset levels are taken through the balance sheet as a decrease to the reserves.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at North America, we have to remember we've been in a downturn there since 2007. Repos remain relatively high, but very comparable to prior periods. We've been able to contain the situation, I think in a very good way. We have been having some good collection techniques, modifications and repos and our remarketing has really proven to be quite good.</p>
          <p>Our average turn of inventory is about 35 days and they're doing an excellent job with that, in South America, mainly in Brazil, it's continuing to perform well with some signs of weakening as the global crisis continues. Mexico is showing some signs of weakening as well and we're watching it very closely and taking action.</p>
          <p>We're actively working with our customers to mitigate further losses. Actually in March we saw some positive news in the Unites States in the portfolio statistics, very early days but we'll take whatever positive news we can get right now.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at Europe, VFS is experiencing increased levels of delinquencies particularly in Spain and Poland, and in markets where our customers have an affiliation with the car industry.</p>
          <p>While we're experiencing greater write-offs than expected, I feel our European team has a really good grip on the issues, and we're taking the necessary actions to mitigate the losses.</p>
          <p>We see some signs in saying that our customers' willingness to pay has increased which is always a good sign and we're working very closely with them.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, the speed and the depth of the downturn was concerning. Through the third quarter of 2008, our portfolio statistics did not demonstrate much stress at all. However in the first quarter we've experienced a very sharp downturn in the portfolio performance and it continued through the first quarter. And we've taken very aggressive actions to protect the portfolio and also to work with our customers we feel that will make it through these turbulent times.</p>
          <p>The segments most affected are the car hauling segment and also the construction segment. We feel our customers that will not continue to meet their commitments. We're acting very swiftly all around the world and repossessing the equipment and then working closely with the BA's and our dealer networks to remarket the equipment in the most efficient way.</p>
          <p>We've seen some positive news in late March, early April in Eastern Europe where we recently sold 150 units that had been repossessed and the severity on those units was actually lower than we had expected. Very early days, but actually a pretty good sign.</p>
          <p>Of note globally our &#x2013; we're seeing very good performance in our dealer network. Something we didn't experience in the last downturn. And we're watching it closely; there's obviously some isolated issues but overall the dealers are performing extremely well.</p>
          <p>We continue to work with the Volvo Group BA's on integrating offers for new and used equipment and I'd also like to say we've had a very consistent market approach. We're not fair weather friends, and while we're being even more prudent with our credit standards and approach, we're continuing to provide credit to well qualified customers.</p>
          <p>Overall, our organization is fully engaged in managing the downturn and I feel we'll come through this even stronger than ever with greater relevance to the Volvo Group and our customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's take the concluding slide on the Group summary and slide 18. There obviously a difficult quarter almost 42 or is 42% down adjusted for FX, very significant production cutbacks, so much so that we were reducing inventory and then also eliminating inventory in the quarter an operating loss and a good liquidity position.</p>
          <p>If we look at in focus there is really only one thing to doing in times like these in the shorter term and that is to make sure that we adapt a cost structure to whatever happens on the revenue side and then secure cash flow. We are happy to report that in general we are gaining slight amounts of market shares in almost all markets and that's the way it should be right now.</p>
          <p>Then over the longer-term we need to make sure that we can build yet another decade of reasonably good and environmentally sound products.</p>
          <p>With that, let me open up for any Q&amp;A that may be there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. First of all, I was hoping you could quantify the decline in the aftermarket sales both in the Construction Equipment division as well as the in the Trucks division. And secondly, I was hoping you could also tell us what that currently is as a percentage of sales in those two divisions. Then lastly, I was hoping you could sort of clarify or quantify slightly sort of what you expect in terms of extra under absorption costs in the coming quarter as you've been highlighting that the manufacturing output will come down a step further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think in general, you can say in aftermarket sales, typically, they don't &#x2013; those sales don't fall much at all. Actually, if anything, they are sometimes countercyclical. When we started the quarter here with reductions of, let's say, around 10%, very different in different product categories, very different in different countries. So I think that's about as fine details that we can give, and then over time, coming back up.</p>
          <p>Typically, you can say what we call soft product, which is aftermarket-related product in general, but also some other. It's about 25% of the Group's turnover in normal times and then of course increasing share when the sales of new products fall as much as they are right now.</p>
          <p>Then you said something about the extra unabsorbed cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. You've highlighted that you're going to take your manufacturing output down another step in order to cut your inventories even further as the outlook seems to have come down a step further in your guidance. The question here is as you take your manufacturing output down further, I can't imagine that the under absorption costs come a step higher. I was just wondering what the delta would be quarter-on-quarter here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I would have a catch-all delta. And frankly, one of the reasons for that is that we are actually supplying to the markets on &#x2013; we don't have a fixed order book or a fixed production rate set for example for June yet. So we will do what it takes to take down production and take down with the object of taking down inventories. But we can't give you a forecast on that.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide five, you can actually see how the workforce-related cost there is coming down almost quarter-on-quarter progression. As you can see here, we have a reasonable effect in Q2 '09 and then as we go into Q3 and Q4. But that's the best guidance we can give right now. We are building what the market needs from us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi gentlemen. I had a question on the customer finance operation. Can you give me an idea &#x2013; I saw the annualized write-off is at 1.51 during the first quarter. Can you give me an idea of how that trended during the first quarter, whether there was much difference between the months and how you see that number developing in coming quarters? And then the other question I had was you did very well in terms of inventory reduction of new trucks. And to some extent, that was offset by secondhand trucks coming back into the system, I mean back to Volvo. What are your expectations for secondhand trucks players for Volvo in Q2? Do you think it will be the same sort of magnitude as you saw this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, we have Sal perhaps on the Volvo Financial Service question first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The deterioration, as I said, was really in Eastern Europe, and we saw it actually build in January, February and March. While we don't give forecasts, what we're seeing right now is a bit of a leveling out. But the build was definitely towards the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Then we have Mikael, perhaps you want to talk to the inventory there on used and new?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can do that. When it comes to the used, as you said, it was partly offsetting the reduction we saw on new. And I would like to give you an exact forecast to how it will be developed during Q2 here. But what I could say is that it's a good control when it comes to used. We have seen some slight increase when it comes to Europe on the truck side. U.S., we are overall at manageable levels when it comes to used. As you know, we went down in the economy in U.S. almost two years ago, three years ago. And during that journey, we have managed to get out of U.S. a number of used trucks before the economies in the rest of the world went down. So I would say it's in good control there.</p>
          <p>We have seen an increase in Eastern Europe, mainly due to repossessions, and we are managing that. We are selling used trucks and we have good pace in that activity. And the other source of used trucks for us of course is the trucks that are coming off lease. And even though there is no dramatic numbers in the trucks coming off lease here, we are trying to renegotiate with our customers and trying to postpone those &#x2013; prolong those contracts out in time even though it's hurting the sales short term, but we get a better spread there. And when it comes to Construction Equipment used, they are actually down even in Q1 here. So I would say, it's a manageable situation when it comes to used, even though it has its challenges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was more of a Q1 thing in terms of these trucks coming back. We shouldn't expect much of it going forward then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we can give you any detailed predictions there. But I mean used is something we are working with and always have been working with. And we should also remember that we have a good retail network here that are managing these kind of questions. So we have used in support of our ordinary course of business. So it's not, well it's a problem, but -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon gentlemen. Could you tell me &#x2013; well, I'm thinking of China, for example, where you have big local competitors for the domestic market at least temporarily has been a bit weak. Have you seen them move their positions forward, for example, keep the production levels high up and push equipment out into the export markets in South-East Asia? And have you seen any of that coming into Middle East, Northern Africa into Eastern Europe as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This particularly on the Construction Equipment side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And Trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's your impression, Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I was &#x2013; my impression without having any specific data is that is not something we have observed coming. What we have seen in China is I would say like Leif said, is we have seen an uptick in the local demand. And that we are following that, and of course, reacting to that in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our impression is that the stimulus packages that the government has put in China on the construction side, at least short term is working reasonably well. And as we said, so much so that we are actually pulling up production level a little bit for the domestic market there. And I would assume our competitors would be reading &#x2013; our Chinese competitors would the reading the market in the same way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and just two questions; let's say that the economy flips in the second half of the year and really starts moving again. What's your preparedness or what's your ability to increase production by, say, 20, 30 maybe 40% from the current very low levels? Can you do that? Do you have the people?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can say that. If you're talking from the very low levels now, when you say 20, 30%, then we have the people or we have the people very close by and take France, Belgium. We have them in our factories on short-term weeks if you take Sweden and the U.S., we would be looking at getting people back into the system. I don't think that would be a major issue if it happens quickly.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on this slide five on the workforce related costs, we actually &#x2013; on the Swedish side, we have under absorption. We have the people available to us right now. If it moves into &#x2013; in such a way that we'll have to part with a lot of employees and especially then in the Swedish place, then we will have a little longer starting track. But right now in the European labor markets, there are very few alternatives to getting jobs <mark type="inaudible" />. So, I don't think unless &#x2013; I don't really think that we would have a major issue in getting production back into pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all good, great. And then finally just if you could, you mentioned &#x2013; well in the currency impact, there's both the hedging losses and then the translation of losses in subsidiaries. Do you think you can give us a rough split what was related to hedging contract, and what's the translation effects of losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, Mikael, you are the expert on that. And normally, we don't give splits like that. Is that a good answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But as we &#x2013; I don't know if you listened into the press conference earlier today there, but the big change here is really that our volumes have come down so dramatically with the hedging policy we have a way of doing hedges that is rolling 12 months here. That was not adjusted in the same pace as the volume has come down now coming to this year, and I would say that's the major part of effects here clearly.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I've got three little questions. First of all on the working capital issue; I think you intimated at the end of the fourth quarter that you hoped to be able to get something in the region of 15 billion out of inventory. And obviously on the working capital, you have this reversal of about 11 billion. I mean do you still expect to be positive on cash flow from working capital for the full year? Can you make things back from inventory?</p>
          <p>Second thing is you &#x2013; I understand there's been some pricing pressure in Construction Equipment, I was wondering if you could update us on whether you are seeing pricing pressure there whether that's something ongoing? Also on Trucks, I think that on this morning's call, you've been talking about crazy pricing. But is passing on sort of raw material costs, which now presumably are beginning to fall, crazy pricing. And just finally, you've got something like 44 billion of intangibles on your balance sheet today. At what point would this sort of much lower level of production you're looking at? At what point do the auditors start taking a dim view of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I think on the working capital, Mikael, do you want to speak to that on inventory and inventory targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as I said before, I mean what is happening right now is what you could say a timing effect here. We commented in Q4 that we would release inventory above 15 billion going forward, and that still remains. And it will take some time until of course we catch up here. It's very difficult to release inventory in the same speed as the production volume has gone down here, and therefore the payables and which payables is really as you know in 60 to 90 days delay from, where we adjust the production. So they come in bigger batches so to speak than what the inventory is possible to release. So our expectation is that over time these will meet each other of course. And we are still positive of releasing inventory going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And as your second question was on pricing, and should we ask Olof to comment that first on Construction Equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course the market situation is very difficult as it is now. But having said that, the prices on equipment is holding up somewhat. And if I look into our pricing during the first quarter giving all the regions and all the products, it's basically a flat evolution during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the Trucks pricing in general, I think the best way to give you a picture is to say that we do get paid for better productivity in Trucks. For example, energy efficiency as you know, we released a new line of FH trucks here. We have released a new line of Renault Master and Traffic trucks. Energy efficiency pays off also on the price side. To say that we are getting any general price increases across the board, when we don't have anything new to offer would be wrong. But also we don't, we actually see a lot of discipline in the market when it comes. We don't see much of crazy deals. I think we said that in the early morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we expect raw materials' falls to be passed on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can say actually our raw material gradient is coming down. We have a quarter-on-quarter comparison here, which is difficult. But most of those increases came in quarter three and four last year, and we did take price increases in connection with them. So even though the comparison shows that it's not really an increase in the running rates, it's an increase in quarter-on-quarter comparison. So I think the answer to your question on raw materials there would have to be yes. But we are really looking at a downturn or a gradient which is beginning to slow quarter-on-quarter comparison there.</p>
          <p>Finally let me say, and I had that question also a couple of times. On the regulatory side, where we are introducing Euro 5 and U.S. '10, there we do feel that the market is accepting that when you make changes as big as they are going with as we are in Euro 5 or indeed in U.S. '10, then the market is there to take that. They accept that there is a regulatory impact there. Then Mikael, could you talk about the intangibles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have of course ongoing dialogue with auditors every quarter and we also have a process for doing impairment of intangible on a quarterly basis. So that's something we're following very carefully. I think it's too early really to say anything about that today. We have to see how our cost reductions are coming into effect and also how the market develops. But that's something that we are following very carefully, but where we stand right now, there is no immediate risk for any impairment write-down there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi again. I guess my first question was related to the production change between first quarter and second quarter. If you can give us a &#x2013; give a feeling for how big that change will be? And my second question was if you could split up then the absorption costs. Basically, how big was the under absorption in Trucks and Construction? And that was my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think as I answered before here that we have not set a manufacturing schedule across the Group for all the different products for Q2. So we will be building what our customers are demanding for us. And to some extent, this is also a mix issue. We have an inventory, but that inventory does not consist of all variants that we have across the Group's different product ranges in different countries. We may be called upon to build certain variances and we may we called to actually &#x2013; depending on what the order intake looks like over the quarter to run a different rate.</p>
          <p>I don't think it would be appropriate to try to give you a number there. We are reducing in some places. We've had a fairly weak April here with the Easter and everything else. But we could well end up with doing more towards the end of the quarter. We frankly don't know. I think it's inappropriate to give you a number there. And with that also, on the absorption rate, it would be inappropriate to give you a number. We will be building what our customers want from us.</p>
          <p>Normally, I think that sometimes, we are misreading this. Normally, we don't have order books of six, eight or nine or 12 months. We have order books typically of two or three months. And that really doesn't mean that we fix in any way, fix a quarter's production rates.</p>

          <p>Sure. I guess the question on the under absorption was more from what you had in first quarter '09 and maybe not what you were going to have in second quarter. Would it be possible to get how it was in the first quarter in Trucks and Construction?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day everybody. I would just like to revisit the earlier pricing question and if you could focus on the North American market when you said there was no divergence from disciplined pricing. Does that hold for that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say that again so that we understand what you're asking please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is specifically on the North American truck market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trucks, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the comment to an earlier question that was kind of in general related to Truck pricing; does the comment disciplined pricing accurately describe what you're seeing in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in the main, it would. At least I think we can say we have not seen activities in the first quarter which is dramatically different from the year-end. I can also say that we are not satisfied with the level of trucks or the price levels of trucks being sold in North American market. I think customers are getting at low prices very good trucks right now.</p>
          <p>But that's what happens when you are two years into a real downturn, and there has been lots of inventories in the market. But, in general, the inventories are beginning to clear out. We have a very low, an old population, we have very low deliveries rate in the first quarter. We have a $10,000 increase on the U.S. '10 product in the first quarter of '10. So I don't think that we should say that we have a declining price environment or a worsening price environment in quarter one in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then if I could ask a follow up for the North American market again on Truck. As you've noticed, there has been a slight increase in industry order intake. Could you comment as to whether that is being kind of produced real-time or if that is, as in past periods in front of emission standards changes, albeit softer, is that accumulating at the end of the year and kind of working back into the year at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we have actually &#x2013; we have two effects. I think we will have much less of a pre-buy this time around &#x2013; less of a pre-buy effect than we've had over the past couple of emission points. And the reason I think is that customers were somewhat burned with a big pre-buy in 2006. And they got trucks, what they felt for a low price, but the new trucks turned out to be working quite well too and sometimes with better energy efficiency also. I think the customers have become somewhat wiser. So I am expecting less of a pre-buy even though there will be some.</p>
          <p>I think what we are actually seeing in North America, and I may be early in saying that, that's more a judgment call that it is really built on fact. I think we are seeing in North America a beginning of a correction in the market upwards and an adjustment to higher activity levels. And I think especially that's true on the construction-related vehicles like Mack Trucks.</p>
          <p>We have very little inventory of trucks in that category of trucks in North America. We are seeing big stimulus packages flow through. We are somewhat disappointment as the pace of how those stimulus packages flow through into real orders. But there is enough money there both on the federal level and on the state level for it I think to be a reasonably viable upturn and not one that is mainly driven by emission standards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can sneak one last in. With your comments on the vocational truck, are you seeing that extend to the very large over-the-road long haul truck classes as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in general what we are seeing if you take just the last smell of the U.S. truck market is that there is still, on the long haul trucks, there is still an overcapacity, there is an inventory there also. So we are seeing less of new order intake there and more of new order intake on the construction-type truck than on the long haulage side. But you know how this works that the long haulage industry turns on and turns off very quickly with the up or downturn of the U.S. economy. It's over volatile in that sense. And I think just the smell of an upturn would actually increase on-road orders also.</p>

          <p>Hello.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask a couple of questions on financial issues please. First of all, could you give us some guidance on your likely net financial costs for 2009 given I think Mikael you mentioned this morning that you are on average at about a 300 point spread in your financing costs right now.</p>
          <p>And maybe a question for Sal as well on Financial Services and the blowup in Eastern Europe. Could you give us an update on roughly the size of the credit portfolio there? I think if I don't misremember that it was running at a sort of level of between 15 and 20 billion krona equivalent. And would that mean that what you've done is to essentially do a write-off of something like four or 5% of the portfolio there? And what should we expect going forward given what you've done already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mikael first perhaps and then Sal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I mentioned also this morning is that we see that the spreads for the Volvo Group is coming down from fairly high levels in the beginning of the year. So our blended funding cost isn't the magnitude you mentioned here. We have done the reference trend rate that has come down. So really depending on what's happening with that, and also what will happen with the volumes going forward. But &#x2013; the funding volumes going forward. But we are well secured funding-wise now. So if you should expect the volumes to be around the levels where they are today, and assuming that the reference rates are staying where they are as well. You shouldn't see too big changes in the interest rate cost for Volvo Group in absolute demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our portfolio &#x2013; you're almost dead on there, the portfolio is about 14, 15 billion. And we've set up what we feel are the adequate reserves at the end of the first quarter for the impairment we see in the portfolio. And we're not going to give any future view of that right now. We're watching it very closely. We've put in a lot of resources to take care of it. We're aggressively working with our customers, and we're hoping to see in the second quarter a better performance in our portfolio in Eastern Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can just add on regarding the schedule value exposure, there was a 300 million charge in the first quarter for that. I assume you've tried to be conservative in taking that charge during the quarter, but you did take a charge in the fourth quarter as well, at that time, I think related to North America. Do you see any significant risks right now for any additional such charges in the coming quarters?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I mean if we look at the U.S. first, I would say that in the quarter here, it has been fairly flat, so no big movements there. I mean the main default came prior to Q1. If you look at Europe, we had another 10% drop in the quarter here between Q4 and Q1 here. But when we look at overall reduction from the peak here, we're talking about 35%. But it's very important that we remember that when we have the reference point of the peak, it was also an extreme situation here, where actually the shortage of trucks at the time almost made a used truck more expensive than a new truck, because the demand was so high here, but I think we have the worst behind us here.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from line of Mr. Alexis Albert from Natixis. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have three questions if I may. The first one is can you give us the average age of the fleet in Europe? This is my first question. The second question is regarding the loan you got from the government of France. I would like to know if you already got the money on that, because I think the carmakers didn't get the money yet. And can you give us the cost of this loan?</p>
          <p>And my last question is regarding the goodwill. When I look at the goodwill at the end of 2008, it's mostly a following up question of what has been said already. But when I look at the goodwill at the end of 2008, I can see that goodwill for Trucks in Asia is quite high, 6.2 billion and for Construction Equipment high as well. And I think that the goodwill for Trucks in Asia is mainly related to Nissan Diesel. And when I looked at what Nissan Diesel was saying just before you bought it, I think that the outlook for them was quite a bullish especially when you look at the outlook for Japan over 2009 and probably 2010 as well. So I'd like to know if there is any risk of impairment. I know you speak a bit about this already, but it looks &#x2013; there is a risk from it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think perhaps we should start with that first, and Mikael you may want to repeat what you said before here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I mean it's true what you're saying here of course the split of the goodwill between the different business areas here. But I have to restate what I said earlier here that we have a general process around impairment of goodwill, and it's done on a quarterly basis, and we have a dialogue with auditors. And where we stand right now and what we can see in terms of the combination of market outlook, into our cost reduction et cetera, et cetera. We do not have an imminent issue here when it comes to goodwill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Nissan Diesel especially, do you think that in the coming years, we will see the margin they were speaking about. In 2006, 2007 they were speaking about 8% operating margin, do you think we can see that, of course not in 2009 and 2010, but 2011 and then what do you think it's achievable for truck makers in Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we can comment that really. I mean we're getting very close to forecasting and so forth by doing that. And I think as I said before, where we stand right now we do not see that downside risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it touches, Leif here. It touches another discussion we had also in the other conference call, which is the fact that the markets are as low as they now are, will that mean that we will not be able to make money on trucks and construction equipment. And we certainly think that this is a unique situation. It's been brought about a financial crisis, and it has created a &#x2013; the most dramatic downturn that we have seen in the history of the Group.</p>
          <p>We don't think that that is a good place to start forecasting from. We should be getting back to the normal trend lines, trucks and construction equipment are production tools in an economy, normal trend lines. And then I would be a little more aggressive than my colleagues here, and say we do think that Nissan Diesel will come back to reasonable margins, given reasonable markets.</p>
          <p>Mikael, we had an issue of Government of France here, the loan there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>

          <p>Different in different countries, but I think it is true to say that it is reasonably young. So unlike the North American truck population, which is now very old, then you can say on the European side we have a reasonably young truck fleet out there.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Yann Benhamou from Exane. I have two questions please, first one regarding your refinancing needs. I understood that for your industrial operation, it was already secured for '09. I wanted to know how much more you had to refinance in your financing portfolio?</p>
          <p>The second question was more related to the cost savings that you have adjusted to 9 billion, does it include the people that you have just announced to layoff last week? And finally, my sense is that even if you have for production come down in Q2 versus Q1, given the savings, which would come through at the same time. Q1 looks to be a kind of trough for earnings. What's your view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on the financing of Volvo Financial Services, Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You said refinancing here, let me clarify that. We have no refinancing need in the customer financing portfolio. We only have a need for new businesses that needs to be financed. And when it comes to that under predictions we have from Financial Services, we are well equipped to meet those demands through a number of transactions that we have lined up here for them. So there is no shortage of funds for the customer finance portfolio going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on this issue on what we have included in the 9 billion, is it correct that the latest round of notices that were given here in Sweden in the past week, they are included in the 9 billion. And of course there are long delivery times on those. They won't actually happen until we come into Q1 in 2010. And therefore, if you read the Swedish papers and see Swedish media today, you will see a lot of discussions about the ability to have flexibility improve by taking short-term working &#x2013; short time working, for example, a day or a week off.</p>
          <p>And of course from our point of view &#x2013; but that's without government support. That has to do between the employees and the employer. If we could get that in a quicker way, then perhaps we could deliver cost reductions quicker and have reductions also. But it needs an agreement with the unions for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have any estimate from the impact of such measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say again. Do I have any estimate on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If this measure is agreed by unions, what would be the impact in terms of savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. No, I can't &#x2013; it will be based on local negotiations conducted at every site. And we have 15 or so sites, major sites in Sweden where we conduct manufacturing. So, no, I don't have a catch-all number there. We will see &#x2013; report that as we go along with it.</p>
          <p>Then on this issue of what's going to happen in Q2, I think we have already commented on that. We don't have a fixed production schedule. We will build what customers are asking us to build over the time</p>

          <p>I'm being reminded by my colleagues here of time. So perhaps we should take a final question there.</p>

          <p>The last question comes from the line of Mr. Ulrich Scholz from Oppenheim. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon gentlemen. You before mentioned financing difficulties of some suppliers and clients. Did you change the payment terms with clients or suppliers to support them? And could you please repeat the working capital reduction you target for in the running year? And second question regarding the markets North America and Europe. Given the duration of downturn in North America, do you see any positive factors for the European market that you say the downturn could be short in Europe?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think on the supplier side, in general, we have not decreased payment terms for financing of our suppliers. And I should say with one exception, and that is the law in France, which, as you know, stipulates that we cannot have longer payment terms than 60 days, so. And there we have had &#x2013; have an effect of that because of the legal impact.</p>
          <p>What we have otherwise done is to put in a program of supplier chain financing where we, through third party financing, arrange quick payment for suppliers, but really with a third party. And that seems to have worked quite well and has taken some of the heat off of financing of some of our supplier base.</p>
          <p>And then in general you also heard me say that I think we have had to make price concessions or price adjustments on a couple of suppliers here that were in really bad shape. But in general, I should say, slightly better perhaps than what you could have expected or read about in media. And I think that's true of both North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>Working capital reduction, I think we have given you numbers there on the inventory. And receivables of course comes up and down with the sales and the payables comes up and down with the production rates. So, and CapEx, we also confirmed this morning that the target on CapEx and inventory then remain the same. And then receivables and payables will be what they turn out to be.</p>
          <p>On the European side, or in the North American markets, I think we can say that &#x2013; well, you heard me make a longer answer of North America just in previous questions. On the European side, I don't think we have any real signs of good improvement. You did see the truck orders there, which actually improved, really on the base of cancellations having gone away. And then you saw deliveries which was down 41%. So of course, a dramatic downturn year-on-year comparison. But still an impression is in Europe that the cancellations gone and net order intake positive at least have taken off of the real first out of the water there in Europe. Bu it's much, much too early to call that a turnaround.</p>
