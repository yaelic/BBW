          <p>Hello, welcome to everyone for this Presentation of the Results for 2009. I'd like to welcome also everyone who is online with us. Before passing over to Didier Valet, I am with my three other colleagues, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Sammarcelli, S&#xE9;verin Cabannes and Bernardo Sanchez. I'd like to give you a few words to introduce.</p>
          <p>2009 is a year I see as a transition year for the group, transition in an environment which of course is very difficult and changing. Transitional so because it's a year, which reflects the crisis, our past, a lot which weighed us down in 2009 is now in the past, but it's also a year in which we recorded very good commercial and operating performances, both in France and outside France. Our results are therefore positive, &#x20AC;678 million this year.</p>
          <p>Transition year in first stage of group transformation, the group is adapting to this new environment with a number of measures by reducing its risk profile, adjusting its activity profile and of course, by anticipating new financial and banking regulations which are going to be more fairer and tougher, which is why the financial structure has been strengthened, which &#x2013; and also why the capital increased in the autumn.</p>
          <p>In slide four, you have the main achievements of 2009, which display what I've just said, the first stage of the transformation. I am not going to say it again. We can of course answer questions on each of these.</p>
          <p>Slide five, a few words on the remuneration policy, which is responsible one we're applying this year. I would like to say &#x2013; and step back slightly and say ahead of time, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is the bank that has chosen Paris where financing Corporate and Investment banking is concerned, is in Paris. 6,000 direct job sub-contractors, it's a good thing for France, it's good thing for French enterprises, for investors to have this workforce available and also good for work public finances.</p>
          <p>If a quick calculation was made, when our employees de facto will have &#x20AC;1 variable remuneration, at the same time &#x20AC;2.8 will be &#x2013; will go into the state funds with social funds and &#x2013; which finances our health system. So, it's an opportunity also for the country to have this economic activity.</p>
          <p>The second thing as to the process was &#x2013; the whole process has been reworked, new rules of the G20 and I think in France this was &#x2013; which has been done very thoroughly. This whole process has been reviewed by the Bank Commission and by <mark type="inaudible" /> with the remuneration orders over the market. Following this process, we will pay our market operators &#x20AC;250 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>I'd like also to come back to the &#x2013; an essential point and that's our strategy on slide six. It's clear, it's a universal bank strategy at the service of its clients. We tried to share on this slide what we mean by this. First of all, very importantly, we're centering activities on client services. Universal bank <mark type="inaudible" /> has a selection of clients whose needs are diverse and varied. I met many of them myself and fundamentally we need &#x2013; it's essential to understand their needs so that we can adjust our services. This principle is what's guiding our strategy and will be guiding our strategy in the coming years. And this is why I'm very satisfied with 2009 because we gained market share and I think we've progressed in this area in a very dynamic way. And at the same time we've managed to reduce the CIB profile &#x2013; risk profile with the indicators you'll be able to see later, which should be dropping.</p>
          <p>Second thing, which comes alongside this first point, this strong relation with the client, one we believe in, we can see the bank functioning around three main core businesses where there is a contact with clients; the French Networks, the Retail Networks, the International Networks and the Corporate and Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>The other two businesses such as Financing and Investment Management and Services, can also have their own clients. But they will work with even stronger synergies with these three main core businesses. For example Private Banking, we developed synergies where the &#x2013; with the Retail Networks, but also we benefited from our services with the Financing bank for private banks.</p>
          <p>Geographically speaking, this means that the development &#x2013; geographical development for these activities will be coherent. Third thing is the &#x2013; our portfolio, our activity portfolio, 2009 we thought that we'd created SNB for asset management <mark type="inaudible" />. This will continue and give priority for acquisitions to the international network, as I have already spoken in the past of a number of countries that could be our interest too. These priorities are &#x2013; will remain of course, and we can consider adjustments &#x2013; progressive adjustments of sales of other businesses.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Didier who will comment on the results &#x2013; detailed results for 2009.</p>

          <p>Hello. Thank you, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. On this slide seven, you can see the group's results for 2009 and for the last quarter. Overall, you can see that revenues for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is stable, &#x20AC;21.7 billion, with good control of management cost. So, overall operating &#x2013; gross operating income, which was positive in this &#x2013; which is positively moving in this context, minus 3.6% like-for-like.</p>
          <p>Considering the impact of the crisis &#x2013; the world crisis and the deterioration of the residential markets in the States, the risk charge doubled compared to 2008 to reach 5.8 billion. And I will look at that in more detail later. So in total, 2009 &#x20AC;678 million, group 221 in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide eight, the operational efficiency plan which demonstrates ability to improve productivities in early 2008 has been as of the time &#x2013; the goal was to improve the gross operating income. We had three levers to do this; to pool infrastructures &#x2013; IT infrastructure, which was done as from the 1st of July 2009, creation of a new department within resource development; optimizing the business processes which was ruled out on a large scale; and led to more tactically and to reduce certain expenses and in particular external expenses. This is in line with gains of &#x20AC;557 million in 2009, 442 saved operating expenses. The threshold being &#x2013; positive can be, thanks to the efficiency of our processes. We're expecting &#x20AC;450 million additional gains in 2010, which will be the result of projects that have been taken &#x2013; been started in the last two years through the group's first stage of industrialization.</p>
          <p>Slide nine, cost of risk, as I mentioned in the introduction it's doubled compared to 2008. I'll start with the French Networks, 72 bp for 2009, in line with our guidance. Cost of risk slightly higher in the fourth quarter, two issues, due to two issues, 40 &#x2013; which represents 40% of the overall fourth quarter allocation, the cost of risk remains high on enterprise clients and on deterioration.</p>
          <p>International Retail Banking, 191 bp, so &#x2013; due to a strong rise of the risk in Russia which tripled compared to 2008 though fourth quarter trends seen in the third quarter is the same, slight stabilization although it's staying high. Fourth quarter, the cost of risk was 441 bp in Russia; and other countries, Czech Republic and Romania are doing well fourth quarter, slightly later cost of risk was between 100 and 130 bp.</p>
          <p>Specialized Financing and Insurance, 250 basis points in 2009. Cost of risk, consumer loans and financing equipment, which was less 125 bp.</p>
          <p>Finally, Corporate and Investment Banking, so outside the extinguishment asset management, fairly stable around 90 bps in 2009 and actually dropping in the fourth quarter to around 38 bp. So, extinguishment on managed assets as announced on 13th of January, a bit more than &#x20AC;600 million provision for the RMBS. The quarter charge, &#x20AC;800 million, so overall for the year 1.4 billion. So, overall cost of risk for the group, 170 bp, and fairly stable in the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 is the financial strength of the group, so capital increase, strength of our capital increase, &#x20AC;4 billion, which was set in the autumn, but also thanks to the control of our weighted assets. So credit &#x2013; our French economy plus 3.1%. The market activities for the financing activities have contracted, as you can see, over 40% end of &#x2013; compared to the end of 2008. Acquisition of 20% of Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and creation of Amundi. The Board is going to prepare in May a distribution of 0.25 cent dividend with an option of that payment in shares.</p>
          <p>Page 11, if we look at the financing &#x2013; the group financing program, good conditions for 2009. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is well viewed signature. We raised &#x20AC;37 billion in 2009, two-thirds of which are our own signature or our own structures, and 2 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> they have now from September start financing French enterprises. End of 2009, we are hedged &#x20AC;3 billion compared to 2010. Already 4 billion in 2010, so 7 in total for 2010 for needs between 25 and 30 billion estimated, so about 20 billion amortization for 2010 left.</p>
          <p>If we look at the businesses, our French houses have progressed in all areas. Positive progression of all our divisions, like-for-like, in a year of recession in all of the areas we operate in. So the French Networks, progressed 2% as announced, International slightly less than 2% as for the Specialized Financing, Private Banking plus 1.1%, and Corporate and Investment Banking, it doubled.</p>
          <p>If we now look at page 13, the French Networks good performance of Financial and Commercial illustrated by the dynamics of accounts opening, three-quarters of which in H2. The success &#x2013; commercial success, as for example, that the less &#x2013; end of the restrictions on the Livret A, &#x20AC;4.4 million.</p>
          <p>Overall, the collection of savings progressed by 5.3% compared to 2008. Credit loans, the progression of outstandings is 2.8%, 3.1 for the whole group in France and the 2.8 &#x2013; between 3.6 individual, commercials 3.8 and the institutional is dropping slightly. Insurance life, again up, so &#x2013; and rising in the H2, 2009, so the financial results are in line with our announcement. RMBI is progressing by 2% and C/I ratio progressing also.</p>
          <p>Page 14, to give a perspective on the scope of the French Networks fee for 2010. As you know, Boursorama as for the 1st of January, 2010 will be in the French Networks Group. So we have three brands actually complementary, ones with strong franchises, commercial franchises on all our markets. By these three brands, we can respond to our customers' needs going to all different types of banking with a leader for distance banking. The best coordination with the &#x2013; a good coordination of each unit, which will enable us to roll out the best practices in banking and price synergies is effective for 2010, 3% growth in NBI and 1.4 in the C/I ratio.</p>
          <p>Concerning the international networks, I already mentioned that though some of the countries such as Russia, Romania, the Czech Republic have experienced some recession, it's 9% in Russia, 4% for the Czech Republic, you can see that we have been able to progress to improve our net sales by 1.9% with a constant scope. This growth has been achieved in an environment that has been rebalanced with deposits up 5%, credits down 0.6%. So this has enabled us to improve the ratio of credit over deposits.</p>
          <p>Overheads, well, we have adapted our systems with a reduction of the headcounts, mainly in Russia, and we have also slowed down and changed the geographical mix of the branch openings, 58 branches opened in 2009 versus in 2008 and most of them in &#x2013; around the Mediterranean Basin. This pole is still beneficiary with an RB over weighted assets of more than 300 base points in a stressed environment with Russia, which is making losses in 2009, I will be back to that. The return on equities is 14.4%.</p>
          <p>Now let's focus on the two main subsidiaries, Czech Republic and Romania. You can see that the Czech Republic investment &#x20AC;200 million, result of deliberate overhead cutting or cost cut policy. In Romania, we have a high dynamic &#x2013; commercial dynamic approach. We've got estate loan scheme, which is guaranteed by the government and we've a contribution of approximately &#x20AC;240 million for 2009.</p>
          <p>Another zone, next slide where we have strong positions and profitable positions is Sub-Saharan Africa and the overseas territory. You can see that this contributes a little more than &#x20AC;100 million to the net income of the group. And we are continuing our growth policy in the main two countries of the Mediterranean Basin where we are present, Egypt and Morocco where we are number two with SGB. And we are supporting main local companies. In Morocco, we have continued the extension of our coverage and we are number three in Morocco in terms of finance projects.</p>
          <p>Now concerning Russia, we are announcing the reorganization of our activities with our Russian partner. You know that Rosbank, whilst since 2008 we had launched the integration process and we have aligned with the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale standard and we have developed the co-operation between the Russian subsidiaries, this will give a new imputes to the Russian Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale layout since we are going to merge both structures, Rosbank and BSGV, into one entity which will be held 85% by Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
          <p>Our two specialized subsidiaries, Rusfinance and Delta Credit, will be held 100% by this new entity, which will make it possible for us to be supported by the expertise of the specialized entity, have more synergy within this layout and work in tight co-operation with the world business lines of SGCIB. Our objective is to be a reference sector in Russia that will grow profit from the economic rebound expected in 2010 in this company.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, on the international networks on page 19, you can see that we still have got four main zones of activity, Central and Eastern Europe. In 2010, we want to consolidate the acquired position and consolidate the &#x2013; or optimize the goodwill with more cross-sellings.</p>
          <p>Russia, I already touched upon it. Mediterranean Basin is going to continue developing the network, in particular in Morocco and Egypt, and Sub-Saharan Africa and French territories where we want to consolidate our positions. For 2010, we expect GOI which will be up 8 to 10% with even distribution between NBI and overheads.</p>
          <p>Now the economic performance in the Specialized Financing business has been affected by the economic slowdown, but it's up 2.8% in the NBI. It shows an increase of the outstandings. We have recognized the impact of the degradation of the used car market on the ALD accounts. It represents &#x20AC;150 million negative impact and the performance of this pole in terms of sustainability of the NBI is remarkable, as soon as 2010 will have a leverage due to the improvement of the second-hand vehicle market improvement.</p>
          <p>So the growth in GOI is 7% due to the high cost of risks. Well, the result is slightly negative. Concerning the insurance sales activities, well, this is buoyant life insurance inflows, very good collection in life insurance. We have increased the non-life insurance origination and the NBI is to &#x2013; somewhat down. Altogether we've got a net result which is &#x20AC;17 million on this particular &#x2013; probably in 2010, we are expecting a re-bounce of the activity of the insurance and finance &#x2013; specialized financing. Taking into account the measures that have been made in 2009 with the stabilization and the reduction of the cost of risk that should materialize during the second quarter or the second half year, our objective is to have an GOI of &#x2013; improved one in 2010.</p>
          <p>Concerning the private banking, we have very good commercial activity, I mean assets managed are up, segment performance satisfactory with an NBI which is resilient. GOI is up since overheads are well in control and we have continued extending the operations of the private banking in synergy with the French Networks. We've got four regional centers open in Lille, Bordeaux, Marseille and Lyon and we'll have four additional branches open in 2010.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency on derivatives, for example, is very well recognized by our customers. Concerning the asset management as mentioned by Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, 2009 has been a reorganization year with a creation of Amundi, the third European actuary. We have 25% of it. It's operational &#x2013; it's been operational since January 2010. Creation of a single platform for a structured index fund management transferring of &#x2013; 13 billion assets transferred to Lyxor. Lyxor has &#x20AC;86 billion managed now and consolidation of the U.S. platform with the acquisition of MetWest by TCW, which has been announced in December and which is going to be closed in few days' time.</p>
          <p>Concerning the investor services, good commercial performance in security services. Newedge, JV with Calyon, gained in market share. It's now a world leader on this particular market and in spite of the good control of the management overhead the GOI has decreased taking into account the rumors, although the interest rates. For 2010, this will have an objective to see the contribution of each of the business lines progressing with some actions that are detailed and we'll have the benefit of the Amundi operation that will be available as soon as 2010.</p>
          <p>Now back to SGCIB, and let me start with the reminder of what Michel P&#xE9;reti&#xE9; has done since beginning of 2010 &#x2013; '09, sorry. The strategic objectives were three, reinforcing the client-driven approach, increase operational efficiency and have a dynamic managing of the risk profile. A number of initiatives have already been made such as the reinforcement of the Key Client strategic coverage illustrated by the recruitment of council bankers and investment bankers. Also the creation of a single management covering the share in fixed income activities. So, this has proved to be efficient already in terms of optimization of the risk profile. We have also owned the assets managed in extension with extinguishing, sorry. We have improved in 2009 and we have an ambitious plan to improve the operational model. In 2009, we have already gains in market shares, a strict control of cost and risk and we have reduced the portfolio of legacy assets.</p>
          <p>The objectives for the business model, with an adaptation of the capital of 17% which will be the standard in 2010, the capital allocated to the market activities has been five-fold and we want to reach an ROE after taxation between 17 and 20% and C/I ratio less than 60%.</p>
          <p>Reinforcement of commercial position, concerning financing and advisory, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has participated to &#x2013; operations to support their French and European customers on the bond market <mark type="inaudible" />. We are number four in Europe for Eurobonds issue with a market share of more than 7%. We have also reinforced our position on the convertible bond issues with a market share of a little even more than 5%. We also have an evolution of our market shares in fixed income currency and commodities. We &#x2013; last but not least, on the equities market we are still the number one in the world for warrants and share of derivatives.</p>
          <p>Now next page, reduction of the risk profile, illustrated by three figures. Firstly, significant reduction in the balance sheet of the financing &#x2013; Corporate and Financing Bank, the decrease is even more clear on the funded part, the &#x2013; you see the funded part of it, this has been reduced by almost 40% down &#x20AC;200 billion. VR -VaR is at a very low level, &#x20AC;30 billion. The peak stress post-Lehman was much higher and the stress test have been kept by 2, I mean as compared to the pre-crisis and post-Lehman Brothers peak.</p>
          <p>Next page are the legacy assets. This is in a separate P&amp;L. We have centralized the &#x2013; accounting centralization process in 2009. The derivative had been decided in 2008. In 2009, those legacy assets cost us 4.2 billion with three components; the CDO of RMBS announced on January the 13th.</p>
          <p>NBI and cost of risk of the RMBS only represents &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Exotic credit derivatives 1.6 billion, mainly during the first half year and the monoline write-downs were less than &#x20AC;700 million. We've had &#x20AC;8 billion of disposal in 2009 and considering the new authorization assumptions, we consider that the essential of the crisis is behind us.</p>
          <p>Now, 29, something on the financial performance of the Corporate and Investment Banking, impact both the legacy assets, but including this the NBI is at 6.9 million, which is similar to the record level in 2006. Underlying, well, there has been a very good performance, doubling as compared to 2008 and 20, 30% above the 2007 performance. This has been achieved because of the share markets. And fixed income, currency and commodities products have made a good performance, though there has been some kind of slowdown during the fourth quarter. Concerning financing and Advisory, record NBI of 2.5 billion up 37% versus 2008. GOI is at &#x20AC;3 billion and the operating result &#x20AC;700 million including the legacy assets.</p>
          <p>Page 30, corporate management &#x2013; corporate center, it &#x2013; this marked-to-market value of the CDS hedging amounts to &#x20AC;1.6 billion in 2009 and the marked-to-market value of financial liabilities at 720 million. Summaries on those two elements concerning the CDS, the portfolio has been significantly reduced in <mark type="inaudible" />. Taking into account the level of the present credit spreads, we consider that the impact in terms of volatility will be limited in 2010. And on the signature spread at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, the impact should be limited though the spreads are a little more under tension.</p>
          <p>GOI, well, no plus value versus 2008. Coverage on equities, we have a plus value of &#x20AC;732 million due to the stabilization of the values &#x2013; input values at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, I am going to give the floor back to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric for the conclusion now.</p>

          <p>Thank you. 2010, slide number 31, the group is going to continue its growth with several sort of work on site, three main aspects of the French Networks. Internationally are differentiated by geographic zones, the strategies were differentiated, the transformation of the Russian operations, which will be one of the main things we're going to have to do with synergies and cost sales.</p>
          <p>In the Specialized Financing and Insurance, as you can see, we should have &#x2013; should become more buoyant with the change of the environment, again intra-group progression is privileged. In private banking, targeted development will be sourced out and we will try to be recruiting new clients.</p>
          <p>And then, Investment and Corporate Banking, client-driven approach, efficiency &#x2013; operational efficiency on the increase and reducing the risk profile. As you can see, you saw in slide 32, 2010 will be for positioned for a rebound year after 2009, which was marked by the severe recession and I must say we are in line with our goal to this the start to the year. 2010 is still starting though with an uncertain aspect, regarding how France economy will recover. Also the crisis highlighted excessive risk in the banking industry, which most of the banks have actually reduced and the regulatory environment will also change. So all that means there are some uncertain aspects.</p>
          <p>Within this context, it's essential to concentrate on our strategy and transformation plan, which must be long-term transformation. The ones we're talking about are the ones that would have prolonged effects. So, we're going to lay out a five-year plan, which is called Ambition SG 2015 around the following priorities. Reinforce our universal banking strategy, which is focused on the core business, client-driven and based &#x2013; our base is the customer relations, retail banking in France and international banking, corporate investment banking with specialized financing and insurance asset management and all seeking to get into work with greater synergies.</p>
          <p>Second point, the acceleration of the group's growth where again the effort will be more than advance toward the client services, the clients, customers at the heart of the system. We will also work on the development and talents of the people we work with and also development of the new operational model, which is going to draw on pooling production resources and process industrialization. So 50 initiatives within this program, which was started at the beginning of this 2010 year, and will be presented on the 8th of June in more detail on the &#x2013; during our Investor Day.</p>
          <p>We've finished with the presentation. We can now answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have a number of questions. I am going to try not to spend too much time on them. I'm just going to &#x2013; two or three. The guidance regarding provisions, if I understood, you've had fairly precise movements on SFSBM very much on the other businesses. So I don't know what you expect in 2010 for the group on other businesses in overall?</p>
          <p>I also didn't understand too well regarding the collection at private banking and asset management for Q4 specifically. The NBI target &#x2013; within what time scale do you see that target? And the last if I may, the P&amp;L shadow is the evolution &#x2013; I can't really spot the figure in the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Didier answer the shadow P&amp;L and private banking will be from <mark type="inaudible" /> and collection, the cost of risk, Didier, you can say few words. I myself would just like to talk about the NBI and this 17 to 20% currently and &#x2013; when we look at the financing &#x2013; Corporate and Investment Financing banking in 2009 and on the basis of generating revenues, we are having superior profitability.</p>
          <p>But what we have integrated into our thinking is of course the regulatory changes that are coming. You know, 1st of January 2011 the capital charge will change for the &#x2013; will increase for trading activities, for example. So, we have to integrate all these changes. We've also got to integrate the &#x2013; to specify, again we have to affect some percent of the businesses of the asset-weighted outstandings and the owned allocated equity. This new model has to be taken in account with the regulatory changes that we've got to generate at least that kind of profitability after tax. Of course, it's not an immediate target, but it's only integrated for longer term loans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the cost of risk. Okay, concerning the cost of risk, we don't expect any large changes. Cost to risk is fairly stable in H1 and improving in H2. If we look at it in more detail compared to our business, BFSM we should have the same type of trend in Russia and we hope to be as balanced in 2010. So I believe this will be the operations and the dropping of the cost of risk bit of this and outside the two &#x2013; those two that I mentioned, which capital 40% of that charge for the &#x2013; for 2010, our risk charges should be similar for the French Networks, so 2010 fairly stable.</p>
          <p>And Corporate and Investment Banking, expect the longer-term portfolio activities with annexed the cost of risk, which is very low and the reclassified assets. The important aspect, and which I mentioned on 13th of January, are the RMBS CDOs that we showed on P&amp;L, &#x20AC;700 million. Large part of that should be provisioned for 2010. We've dropped throughout the year. So, it will be more in Q1 where we will have the most provisions between 200 and 300 and then it should stay down.</p>
          <p>And if you have it, and it's page 38, it's 3.1 billion net of &#x2013; so you've got the figures for the 31st of December, 2009 compared to the progression to view the &#x2013; progression of the RMBS CDOs. <mark type="inaudible" /> the private banking, the collection was fairly &#x2013; it was close to nil with a good collection, thanks to the synergies of the French Networks and the Italian fiscal aspects, which &#x2013; and in Swiss francs, which is good, overall the year a collection of 2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The asset management collection in Q4 of about &#x20AC;11 billion, with the main impact being TCW after the &#x2013; one of the main managers left the group, 10 billion of which linked to subsidiary. Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Two questions, concerning Russia, when you say that you are reaching breakeven in 2010, are you talking about Rosbank or the whole Russian mechanism step-up and compared to all that in Russia could you give us, if you would, on what &#x2013; how much the NBI represents as you integrate it, if you set it aside, how much that represents in the total. What was the share of different activities for that?</p>
          <p>Second question, you have introduced in the next quarter a global market notion, which seems a mix on the securities and fixed income activities, which seems weird because that makes it direct. So, do you still intend in the coming quarters, so does the global market fairly accrued not giving afterwards adjusting between securities and fixed income or is it just a way of wording it which was not &#x2013; does impact the way financial information is communicated and in terms of statutory?</p>
          <p>And regarding retail banking and in the wide sense of term and in particular consumer loans, where do you stand in your thought process regarding the &#x2013; adapting the processes, the overall &#x2013; and sidelines and also on the network?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will then probably let Bernardo comment for Russia. As I said, for Russia our system today is first of all a mechanism of retail banking, that's Rosbank, the subsidiary of BSGV, this consumer loan activity and residential loan activity. BSGV, Rosbank activities also work with large enterprises. SMEs are fairly not well developed so far and on &#x2013; so just to give an idea of the performances, I'll let Bernardo answer in more detail, but just first for 2010.</p>
          <p>Global markets, no, we will continue presenting securities and fixed income. There will be no change in that respect. This creation is more for the carriers of synergies and risk management that will be more thorough and more overall. I think in 2009 it worked very well and I expect that it &#x2013; I'm very confident that it's going to work very well with the different customers, institutionals, asset managers and so, it's a good strategy change but the idea is not to change the information we give competitors as well.</p>
          <p>For consumer loans, again as I said, our model really is based on customer relationship, acquiring and our relationship with customers in the long-term. Of course, we have to look at all the different considerations of management to capital and liquidities. Consumer loans in that respect it is important to be very coherent between and the developmental activities and our presence in retail banking outside France current and future presence. Coherently &#x2013; it's important to give some coherence.</p>
          <p>There is lot of &#x2013; many uncertainties remain in these activities. It's one of the aspects we have to look out and we will be very strong in terms of strategy, very beneficial. As you can see, 2009, we &#x2013; a certain number of countries, geographical zones, we left, we don't have any long-term ambition. And Bernardo, maybe an additional comment on Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer your question precisely, there are three different aspects to the results. In Russia, we have four subsidiaries to date. We've planned &#x2013; talking about organizing differently two subsidiaries with retail banking activities, Rosbank and BSGV. We have Rusfinance, which is consumer loans, and Delta Credit.</p>
          <p>Consumer loan activities, even though they've increased the credit risk, there has been increase to the credit risk this year due to the Russian crisis, it has been able to have a very good performance. High &#x2013; we have a high market share in consumer end loans in Russia and vehicle financing. The two retail banks are the ones we're referring to when we talk about where &#x2013; which we are aiming to reach breakeven by the end of the year. So the group, they actually being Rosbank &#x2013; thanks today to the &#x2013; currently to the reorganization and emerging.</p>
          <p>And then we have an investment banking activity which is currently profitable. But it's &#x2013; and it's today one of the strengths regarding synergies for the group competencies and the competencies we need to strengthen in Russia. This is going to be one of our main &#x2013; it's going to very important in this respect and the know-how in our Russian subsidiaries, it would be one of the progression factors out there.</p>
          <p>So far regarding asset management, less ambitions. We have ambition in time regarding the context of universal banking, but we look at it probably more at a later date. Didier?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a few words on non-Russia. On slide 18 you've got the figures regarding &#x2013; and that's the &#x2013; what we're talking about when we're talking about breakeven by 2010. The global market, we'll probably say more next time. If you look in the press release, you've got the fixed incomes, I guess you've got it for the year and you've got the securities, 2.3 billion for the securities, 2.9 for the fixed income.</p>
          <p>You've also got it in the press release, page 18. The share income, it's given &#x2013; the figure is given there and fixed income, &#x20AC;255 million, again &#x2013; this again is the fixed income lost to the benefit of the consultancy services, so that &#x20AC;50 million from one activity to the other essentially because of the synergies of the latter to the &#x2013; with this indication and the corporate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A few words again on Russian and the prospects, I remember a year ago we were fearing &#x2013; there was a shock on the &#x2013; in the Russian crisis right and I feel that the way that crisis was managed was remarkable, very clear signals of the activity improving. Our 2010 prospects are good. The currency is being re-appreciated, the reserves are better, the liquidity is improving in the banking sector. So 2010 results, so it will still be a transition year but Russia managed the 2009 crisis year very well and the next of course is the Russian economy needs to transform itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have got a few questions on the Corporate and Investment Banking. Now, when we compare the quarter-to-quarter trends, the drop in the market activities is a little more than 50% which is at the bottom of the bracket as compared what we have seen in the other banks. Now, what can explain this effect?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you communicate the evolution of activity as we very often have at the moments as to the recognition of the bonuses where some banks have modified their policy during the fourth quarter? How do you deal with the 55% different that you mentioned in the press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So concerning the evolution of the activity I'll let my colleague &#x2013; and the accountings, I'll let my colleague answer. On the income ratio, it's difficult to compare practically because we must make sure the scopes, the perimeters are the good ones and also we have to take into account, for example, the personnel charges.</p>
          <p>We have 50% of our headcounts in France, that means that our charges, staff charges are very, very high, which is not the case with our colleagues in the U.K., for example. So taking into account the bank, without any reprocessing we are at 33. If we had the same head count structure, we would be less than 30.</p>
          <p>Now evolution concerning the fourth quarter of the Corporate and Investment Banking activities, you say that it's at the bottom of the range as compared to our peers, but we must consider the &#x2013; everything because we &#x2013; for the fourth quarter we are in a better position than our peers. Now, these changes are due to a few negative elements that have had the negative impacts on the NBI, but we are in line with our guidance, with our objective, &#x20AC;2 billion NBI per quarter on the Corporate and Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>So some one-off signals, that &#x2013; we explained that, but we are in line with the guidance. I want to emphasize the discipline that we have applied to the risk taking procedure &#x2013; activity. You've seen the stress test indicators and so on and so forth, balance has been &#x2013; really been in control. So risks are under control and this is the result of this worldwide policy that we have embarked to and this is one of our strength to have trusted our remodel. We can continue running risks, but well-controlled risks.</p>
          <p>Didier, for the last question concerning the recognition of the deferred part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are compliant with the standard. The standard says that when we are &#x2013; under conditions of presence and performance, we can spread the charge on the vesting duration of the plan. And we have started investing one-third of the deferred part in 2009 knowing that the present conditions &#x2013; because well when people leave they don't leave without bonuses.</p>
          <p>So, we are compelled to spread over three years. And we have also included the &#x2013; kind of the French charges, which has not been yet voted. Well, Great Britain of course this &#x2013; well, the situation is not better, that we pay taxes in France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your presentation you don't mention any longer the acquisition policy that was mentioned during the second part of 2009. What are your ambitions in this respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we didn't mention it because nothing has changed. We'll come back to that in June of course. But well, we have acquired Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord &#x2013; or the minority shares of Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord. We also have bought over the minority participation in Aviva in our damage insurance Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale subsidiary. We want to give a new impetus to this product in the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale network.</p>
          <p>In addition to see &#x2013; do this, there has been the restructuring of Rosbank, which is a major strategic operation. Then we'll remain very much focused on &#x2013; I mean in a world which is full of uncertainties in terms of regulations and asset valuation, we must be very careful the residual in test of the real value of the goodwills and therefore the assets.</p>
          <p>As I told you, we have a priority allocated to the Retail Banking abroad with the Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, which remain our privilege regions. Poland also is a country where we can see very interesting opportunities. And Private Banking is also a business where we can seize opportunities if ever we can find opportunities corresponding to our business model, so nothing new in this respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now to prompt your answer, this was the question I wanted to put to you. You know that in the U.S. the authorities are envisioning to prohibit to the banks to carryout trading for their own account. So would this &#x2013; or can this may have &#x2013; can this have an impact on your activities? Could it be applied by the European authorities too? If it were represented in your output, it has an impact in your activity. You are also mentioning the uncertain environmental in terms of legislation. Is there any other regulations that could impact your results?</p>
          <p>And last question on the acquisitions. You have set a picture of the acquisitions business line per business line. Do you think that at the moment SG has reached the critical size &#x2013; the sufficient critical size as a group to develop, because the press regularly mentions a possible alliance or merging with banks of your &#x2013; with other banks of your size or bigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Let me step back a little. Concerning the regulation changes, as you know these crises has raised in a number of countries questions on what is the right mechanism, what is the good mechanism, what is the right size of the bank, how to control the financial and banking market. Well, I think we must all keep in mind the fact that the crisis was not only a bank crisis. It was first and foremost a crisis of a competitive open world, and in particular for the European economies. The crisis was linked or due to the monitory imbalance between consumption and savings. This has not been yet sold until now. So banking system is one of the elements to consider, but not &#x2013; certainly not the only one.</p>
          <p>As concerns the banking sector, there has been a rather fuzzy or vague process at the beginning of the year. You know &#x2013; as you know in the context of Basel, the regulating authorities have brainstormed on capital and liquidity. This brainstorming is going to be based on an impact study, very precise one, not only to see what kind of amounts could be at stake, but also macro-economically speaking what could mean for the economies. And the main challenge or the main stake in Europe where the financing of economy is provided for the two-thirds of it by banks. In the U.S. it's only one-third by the way, the financing coming from the market mainly. So, the main stake for Europe is firstly are the same rules applied everywhere, and will be banking system be able to finance economies in 2011 and 2012 when we can believe that the recovery and the requirements will be more vigorous. So, this is a first point that should find an answer by 2010 &#x2013; end of 2010.</p>
          <p>In parallel to this, there are a number of new regulations or proposals, in particular, the one you are referring to in the U.S., that's Obama's proposal. The idea is to say that the banks should not indulge in trading for their own account. I mean, I believe that there are discriminating between the trading for customers and trading for their own account. And to be Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale considering the deep modification of the model, well, we won't be really hampered by this.</p>
          <p>Well, I'm not &#x2013; I don't believe that trading for own account has been at the origin of the crisis. Crisis comes from the loans origination, which was a vicious one. It has not been verified that people could really reimburse at least in the U.S. I think that we are deeply changing the model and concentrating our trading activity as much as possible on the customers or the clients. We want to bring liquidities to the customers and this is an evolution which &#x2013; when not traded it will get to a competition by the way. And it doesn't meet the point. The main point is capital liquidity, control, regulation of the banking sector. And let me add that there is the banking sector with the non-regulated sector too, and in this trading for own account question, you must consider everything and not only the banking sector.</p>
          <p>Second point, getting with our strategy, I believe that the beyond the fact that people are still putting questions on this size of the banks, I mean are the present banks not too big? Well, firstly, I guess that Europe absolutely needs that of a significant size and the European banks when they have to finance &#x2013; or the French companies, I mean when they need financing, needs to work with the &#x2013; need to work with big banks. The world markets, the Brazilian, Chinese, American competitors could be very powerful actuaries. Secondly, concerning SG, well, we are among the major European banks and I consider that we should scrutinize that business line per business lines. They consider that each and every of our business lines we are competitive and we can develop retail banking in France. I'm very optimistic on the supplementarity of the three networks, the traditional network, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Retail Banking, France, that will enhance their multi-channel distribution strategy and Boursorama, which is the leader in terms of online banking.</p>
          <p>And foreign networks, in a world in which we can expect a strong growth from the emerging rather than from the mature countries, a very strong presence in the zones. To me it's a warranty for growth. And we've got very strong roles in the Romania, the Czech Republic, Russia, Egypt, Morocco, all those banks are working really well. In the presentation, you have seen what their contribution are. And it's very interesting to see the balance of the model. Each and every of those banks contribute significantly to the results in their own countries.</p>
          <p>And then CIB, which is a key challenge to the world that shrunk, the world is getting smaller and smaller. When banks are indulging in that kind of business, facing needs and requirements that are very high, I'm surprised to see that those customers are in demand for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale services. We have strong ambitions to develop those products to reinforce our goodwill and we've got all capabilities to succeed. So you see, this is the priority. I can play legal with my kick, but I don't like puzzles really.</p>

          <p>Hello, just a few &#x2013; specifications on the assets. Can we have an idea on the underlying residual assets on the RMBS, what we're to expect, not only what's under the CDOs, it would give us an idea of the visibility to you on where we're going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Didier, would you like to answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have in the reporting the write-downs compared to the CDO. We don't have the different sections of the RMBS because some are on higher &#x2013; in the higher brackets. Some of them are impacted by the market deterioration on single layers, and when the cost of risk rises you can get from &#x2013; values from 0 to 100. So you can see the costs in the third quarter and you can then expect the impairments on the one hand and the losses. I don't actually have layer by layer, though there may be probably hundreds of thousands of different layers, but there is the same in parallel write-downs.</p>
          <p>If I understood rightly, we are talking more about the maturity rather &#x2013; yes &#x2013; rather than write-downs. Yes, so the three, four, five years for the assets to maturity, so the total extinguishment asset remaining life is three to five years. There were a number of them, a number of them &#x2013; anticipated reimbursements. But there were also longer ones on the RMBS that should amortize not to &#x2013; as fast as initially planned.</p>
          <p>The RMBS CDOs are assets which are more long-term in the underlying, but they are also well written down as you can see the detail in the annexes, you can see that we've written our and over 70% to some of them. Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I understand the volatility of the fixed income and forex results in Q4 because you say that it's picked up already at the beginning of the year. Could you give us some different business lines &#x2013; give us the market &#x2013; details of the market, and regarding the daily performance on different values and how it stands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might ask Michel P&#xE9;reti&#xE9; who is in the room to give you more information. He can give you some of the answer. He's here if you like, give him the mic. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all overall for the year, the fixed income activity was exceptional and displayed growing performance on the increase greater than the rest of the market. Slowdown in Q4 due to on the one hand less customer activities and that's the seasonal effect that everyone benefits from. And in Q4, we're more euros than dollars and it's one of the development things we have to look at in the future. The dollar and the euro markets were more affected in volumes and the dollar ones were and that was due to their ratio of dollars.</p>
          <p>Well, if you look at the customer market on our traditional segments, forex and fixed income, in Q4 you can't see this drop, the significant drop. Trading wasn't brilliant in Q4 due to activities and particularly <mark type="inaudible" /> in Europe. And the VaR at the beginning of the year didn't show any significant changes as richly on our market activities or uncertainty, which is still fairly low, rising slowly and progressively.</p>
          <p>Yes, the question was also on the revenues. If we look at the 2 billion per quarter, so the daily income is also is still in line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add to the question, and Didier mentioned that the beginning of the year was promising and very strong for January. Now, by mid-February, what's the feeling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The comments we gave were to date. I'm not sure about today, but until yesterday certainly the comments included the first two weeks of February. We're still in line with our targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I would like your opinion on the liquidity ratio and the stable one in the long term. You highlighted that there were &#x2013; that's where the possible changes with the structure and system could occur and do you &#x2013; you are under the 100%, which is what the bank seemed to be saying today. What do we need to do with that?</p>
          <p>The second question is on &#x2013; regarding the trading. You stopped ventilating customers' trading, whereas you used to be one of the only banks who gave that information. Is it something you're stopping following or you're just not giving it anymore?</p>
          <p>And last question regarding Asia, in the comments I didn't see any specific expansion mentioned regarding that. Many of your competitors have expansion projects in Asia and so where do you stand there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Didier comment the technical aspect of the ratios and may be Michel for Asia. More generally, I'll comment on China. I've always said that we're concentrating on the capital. We tend to forget the liquidity. And I find that maybe it's even more important, if there is one change &#x2013; potential change it's that fact that certain banks will need to adjust the way they manage liquidities. It's essential challenge they take.</p>
          <p>I am happy with the way we did manage that in 2008, 2009, mostly of the cost of the liquidity and the long liquidity. If we see the policy, it's always been our policy we decided to finance our long activities by loans and deposits and long results which is where the &#x20AC;37 billion raised in 2009 of long resources base to reimburse the debt for reaching maturity but also to finance our loan activity.</p>
          <p>I think in the banking practices this &#x2013; I think this is the case everywhere. And in the future, how do we see liquidity management? I don't think it's mainly by simple ratio, I think it's a buoyant management of stress test, but as for the capital I'll let Didier answer more precisely in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Regarding Asia, beyond the NBI, we should talk about. I think we are in a world that's changing with the ramp up of emerging economies, not only Asia. But fundamentally those emerging countries are on the &#x2013; we're exposed there with &#x2013; to some of these emerging economies with our retail banking and other.</p>
          <p>So beyond the strengthening in Central Europe and Africa and the Mediterranean where we've strengthened already, if I look at the other territories, the priority for us would probably more Asia than Latin America, that's a certainty. It will be more complicated to develop for us all of the different activities in countries such as Brazil.</p>
          <p>So our strategy will be very concentrated in terms of business lines, but China is important because it's important for our clients. And we can see that our clients are investing and they are developing in China. And it's fairly natural, but we should be able to support them, which is why our fundings are developing in retail banking. We're opening agencies. And I'll let Michel comment. And we've got joint ventures and asset management and so on.</p>

          <p>The Chinese enterprises I should say they are fairly domestic, starting to look at development outside France and we could offer them banking services outside in the Mediterranean and that's because those are territories that also interest them. So that will be Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale strategy.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. Didier, more technical on the liquidity ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long-term ratio liquidities, I think no bank will reach 100% today considering the assumptions given by the Basel Committee, which is why there are discussions that with Basel concerning assumptions, considering deposits where they're leaving and if any we haven't actually noticed post-Lehman. The French banks and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in particular managed very well through this crisis. They were amongst the first to open up certain aspects of the market post-Lehman, so good signature, good management is displayed by them.</p>
          <p>So the discussions with the Basel Committee, the ratios &#x2013; the systematic ratios must be looked at and then discussed. Then after that we have a preference so that's why the banking commission tries to work to best look at each assumption but overall to work on ratios that are more economically adopted. And if we apply the rule as it is today, I am not sure what would become of bond markets &#x2013; bank bond markets in terms of varied demand or concentration of what the banks will own. Some banks will opt in the crisis because of some of these aspects and the French banks demonstrated a resistance in this. Michel, on the strategy in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asia, we have ambitions that are large, but paradoxical &#x2013; and in a paradoxical way 7 to 8% revenues, well, Corporate and Investment Banking are via consolidation of our franchise in Europe and strengthening of our product offer &#x2013; and in particular on dollar. So what's important is to fight each battle one-by-one also at the same time.</p>
          <p>So our ambition is to double share revenues for Asia by 2012, so from seven to eight to around 50% &#x2013; 15% and it's also beyond that very important to strength our position with our European customers to support them in Asia and to reach out to institutional financial which is what we are doing, but we need to reinforce our dollar on that in order to do that. 1,500 employees out in Asia in a program, a recruitment program which is ambitious. So, things are happening, but it won't accelerate before 2011. Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick question, could you give us a few words on Greece, and how the subsidiary there, considering the macroeconomic which is still quite complicated for 2010 and your potential exposure to domestic practice?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick answer to a quick question. The exposure is manageable. Our subsidiary in Greece is small, it requires restructuring which has been started in the last times is going to carry on. We are going to be very thorough in low generation, but the situation is highly manageable for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two quick questions. If I've understood rightly, the Corporate and Investment Banking and the consultancy between Q3 and Q4 gives us 300 to 600, so 50 million. You mentioned &#x2013; the rest looks like a very high growth. Could you explain that? And whether you also &#x2013; the fourth bank according to the tables you've given, corporate bank, so in France how do you plan to develop in that area? You seem to be quite offensive in that area? Could you give us a target in terms of percentage of overall revenues to that task, specifically? And how do you feel it can affect the rest?</p>
          <p>And another question is more for <mark type="inaudible" /> as you come from the distribution world without going into long dissertation. Could you give just a few words on your thoughts on the distribution models both in &#x2013; as in terms of range and distribution process, organization and the difference between the distribution and as you're saying, well &#x2013; and the banking distribution and in particular Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>I would let Bernardo think about his answer and Didier comment the figure given shortly. I would just like to say again what we &#x2013; the way we see the Corporate and Investment Banking, as I said, we want to be the service of our customers. Those CIB customers are large enterprises and financial institutions, asset managers. People from different areas and they also require different coverage and different products.</p>
          <p>If we concentrate on just the enterprise aspect, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale I feel in the current environment has a unique development opportunity of its franchises and in particular in investment banking. Why? Because on the one hand in that the world in which we are entering, credit loans will have considerable value and will maintain that value and we'll have a fairer valuations. So we'll remain very strong.</p>
          <p>Secondly, to develop banking relations with customers, I have met a lot of Presidents and CEOs and Chairman of different international banks within France and outside France. To create that link at a very high level and then benefit from it on all the different strategic products, you need highly qualified bankers and people who can discuss strategies and particularly those who can include the securities aspects Michel will comment more in detail.</p>
          <p>So in a world where a lot of players have disappeared, where we could be seen as being one of the rare banks in Europe that can still develop in such businesses, there is a really one-off opportunity, an exceptional one. I mean in France and European still in France and in European countries we're going to reproduce that &#x2013; duplicate that model.</p>
          <p>We mentioned developments in emerging countries always is part and parcel of an overall model, which in the long term relations based on added value structure, financing and so on. So a quick word on the figure. Michel, could you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you elaborate on the way we get organized in our plans and then we'll have a comparison with Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning financing and advising you've got the figures in annex, T4 that &#x20AC;625 million and T3 or Q3 &#x20AC;575 million, and reclassification of the securitization part has increased between 50 and &#x20AC;100 million third quarter. So there is not such a high increase as you're mentioning, it's something rather stable. Michel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning recruitment for the investment banking, we've got a recruitment program that we embarked into last year, 40 bankers in Europe, and this program is significantly on the way since we have already recruited 25 of them. During this crisis, we have gained market shares everywhere, in all compartments and in all sectors of CIB.</p>
          <p>It was important to consolidate this at the level of the European customers, that is the case in France, and therefore we have recruited business bankers of the top level in England, Germany, Italy; Germany and Spain mainly, so as to have the same type of relation with the European customers as those we have with the French customers because we did feel that during this crisis we are supporting our customers.</p>
          <p>We have allocated scarce resources to those customers. Many of our peers have withdrawn when the situation was very stressed. So those customers have appreciated our support and we want to keep those relations for the next five or six years and therefore we want to take this opportunity. Bernardo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll complete here because we've got a press conference afterwards. Now maybe we should spend a lot of time together to talk a lot about the <mark type="inaudible" />, but you must realize that today there is a fundamental difference due to the sector where the &#x2013; I mean or the &#x2013; I mean the links or the relations between the sector and the customers is somewhat perforated.</p>
          <p>Now probably, the strongest mutation that our activity and in particular Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is initiated is to move from the offering marketing attitude where the commercial strength is based on the technical capacity of producing or manufacturing products that sell well. In some of that, we want to become an actor or an expert in the marketing demand. That means that we step into the customers' shoes and we analyze the understanding &#x2013; we try and understand what his requirements are. This is one of the major lines of the proposals of &#x2013; or the 2015 plan of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale initiated by Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a. This is a major modification with the relation with the customers, with the clients.</p>
          <p>Of course, we've got a credit activity &#x2013; well, loan activities, which is a particular facet of our client relation. It introduce &#x2013; it introduces a very strong relation with the customers including in the loan granting we may have a better understanding of the customers' requirement. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a has mentioned the plans that are enforced by France though France is not main territory plans to improve the agility with which we take into account the SMEs requirements for loans.</p>
          <p>Well, this is a great step forward in the change of attitude of the bank. In practice, we try and identify what is the requirement. So we are not far from doing that. Practically, in practice when our experts produce or design some new product they have to imagine what the requirement for the customer is and we try and put the client right at the core of our concerns to conclude with an interesting sentence that I heard from great UK professional. Our ambition is not to have our customers loyal to us, but make sure that we are loyal to our customers and this reputation is on the way to build up the future growth.</p>
          <p>Well, this concludes this conference. Thank you very for your attention and have a good day.</p>
