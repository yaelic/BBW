          <p>Greetings and welcome to the third quarter 2010 Monsanto Company earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley, you may now begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob . Good morning to everybody on the line today for our third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; and Carl Casale, our CFO. Also joining me are Will McAndrew, Manny Cruz, and Ruben Mella of our IR team.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we are webcasting this call. You can access the webcast and the supporting slides at Monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address.</p>
          <p>We're providing you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures in the slides and in the press release, which are both posted on our website.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-K and today's press release.</p>
          <p>Since we've just provided updated quarterly and full-year guidance, I'll walk through an abbreviated summary of the quarterly results to save the bulk of the time for Carl to take you through our full-year outlook and our 2011 metrics; and for Hugh to talk about progress on our near-term strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>Let's start with an overview of our financial results on slide four. Fundamentally, the results were in line with the revised guidance we issued last month for the full year and for the third quarter. For the quarter, ongoing earnings per share were $0.81, slightly ahead of our prior guidance. As expected, the quarter reflects the reset of the Roundup business. On a year-over-year basis, net sales were down 6% and gross profit declined 24% to 1.4 billion for the quarter. As has been the case in the recent quarters, this was largely driven by Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides, which came in at a loss of 189 million on the gross profit line, reflecting the negative gross profit effect associated with the near-term adjustments from our Roundup repositioning. Carl will cover these effects in slightly greater detail in his outlook for the full year.</p>
          <p>From a seeds and traits perspective, sales in the quarter were up slightly over last year, while gross profit was down slightly. Likewise for the year to date, sales in the segment increased 4%, which reflects increased sales in our US corn business, our global soybean business, and contributions from both cotton seeds and traits and the vegetable business. Year-to-date gross profit for the segment was down 2%, as the increase in sales were offset by the higher launch year COGS and restructuring moves we've discussed previously.</p>
          <p>On the cost side of the ledger, we continue to realize a lower run rate for SG&amp;A, supporting the expected 2 to 2.1 billion guidance for this full year. That run rate reflects the benefit that we have realized because of our restructuring program. To date, our restructuring spend for the fiscal year is 184 million, taking our cumulative total to $590 million of the projected 550 to 600 million in total spend.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, which is lower than the 30% recognized in the prior year. As was the case in prior periods, benefits from several tax items were recognized in the quarter. With our revision to earnings guidance in the last month, our tax run rate puts us in line for a full-year tax rate that may be better than our projected 29 to 30% range.</p>
          <p>As is typical for this quarter, free cash flow was a use of cash. In particular for the year-to-date period, cash flow was a use of cash of 1.15 billion compared with a use of 145 million for the same period in 2009. That use of cash largely reflects the repositioning of the Roundup business affecting net income as well as working capital and the cash portion of the restructuring charge. That's partially offset by lower inventories from a reduction in seed production and a normalization of deferred revenue compared with the prior year.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash deployment, we spent approximately $374 million in the quarter on share repurchases. That will allow us to close out our current three-year, $800 million program a year earlier than originally planned.</p>
          <p>Let me turn the call over to Carl so he can expand on our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everyone. A little more than four weeks ago, we provided our revised guidance for the fiscal year following the strategic repositioning of the Roundup business. As we expected, the third quarter results were in line with that revised guidance. We're on track to meet our full-year ongoing EPS guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 and our free cash flow target of 400 to $500 million. Through the third quarter, our ongoing EPS is $2.49, which is squarely within our full-year range.</p>
          <p>With that as the backdrop, it's useful to walk through how we see the year closing out and then shift into the first look at the metrics and drivers we see shaping our mid-teens growth trajectory in 2011.</p>
          <p>As Bryan noted, Roundup gross profit came in at a loss for the quarter. This is the direct result of our repositioning actions as the quarter reflects approximately $200 million in negative gross profit impact as we implemented the first of the near-term adjustments. Practically, that gross profit impact was driven by the lower price and volume effects from the burn-down season and our accrual for the accelerated payments to close out most retailer and distributor incentive programs. That means that we've worked through a good portion of the anticipated actions that will make up the cumulative $0.50 to $0.70 EPS effect we project as a result of the repositioning.</p>
          <p>For the broader ag productivity segment, we continue to realize strong results this year, driven by a record year in the lawn and garden business. So for the fiscal year, we continue to expect the total ag productivity segment to deliver approximately 450 to $600 million in gross profit, which includes the expected contribution of between 50 and $200 million from Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides after the repositioning actions.</p>
          <p>If we shift to seeds and traits, even in a challenging year, our results are coming in consistent with our previous expectations. As Bryan also mentioned, gross profit at this point in the year is down slightly from this point last year. Here are a couple key variables that influence where we stand and the ultimate landing point for the full year. First, pending the final true-up of planted acres and returns, we continue to see our DeKalb branded corn seed share steady or basically flat this year. Consistent with that, our overall US branded corn volumes are flat year to date while worldwide volumes are down slightly. For the full fiscal year, once we have expected sales in Latin America in the fourth quarter, our global seeds and traits volume will be flat for the year.</p>
          <p>Second, the biggest upside came from mix. We have seen an increase in the trait intensity mix in the US. In corn, farmers continue to drive toward technology adoption, with more than 75% of our branded US corn portfolio in either triple-stack or SmartStax, a positive step change from the 70% penetration rate in 2009. That's mirrored in Latin America, where the increase in trait acres in Brazil and Argentina have had a positive overall mix effect on the business.</p>
          <p>Practically, that positive mix effect hasn't fully dropped down to the gross profit line for the segment as the launch year effects on cost of goods that we've discussed previously offsets the per acre gross profit expansion. Specifically, we've already discussed the restructuring charge to cost of goods that we took in the second quarter to position our US corn product strategy for 2011. Some additional restructuring charges have been booked in the third quarter as we reach out globally and get our complete portfolio in position to offer the newest hybrids and the latest trait package in each area. For the full year, our total restructuring charges for seeds and traits represented a $93 million decrease to gross profit.</p>
          <p>Additionally, both corn and soybeans in the US reflect the continued short-term cost of goods headwinds we discussed last quarter associated with the launch of SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield and the higher production cost from our hedge positions. These restructuring moves were conscious choices that are now behind us, but made because they enable our product strategy going forward. When coupled with the one-time adjustment to our hedged US production positions we discussed in the second quarter, these items represent a year-to-date charge to cost of goods in excess of $120 million that will not be repeated.</p>
          <p>If not for those actions, our seeds and traits gross margins would be slightly lower than last year and reflective of incremental launch costs. Segment gross profit would have been in line with the expected contribution to our EPS guidance before last month's reset. Including the negative effect of the approximately $120 million in 2010 decisions, we expect seeds and genomics gross profit to come in at 4.6 to $4.7 billion for the full year. That anticipates a modest incremental increase to fourth quarter gross profit over last year, primarily reflecting Latin American corn. But more broadly, we've given ourselves a foundation for the seeds and traits growth in 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Mathematically to hit our $2.40 to $2.60 ongoing earnings guidance, we expect to range from minus $0.09 to plus $0.11 as the ongoing EPS level for the fourth quarter. On slide five, you'll see there are only a couple of moving parts to the fourth quarter as we close out the year, the biggest of which is the remaining Roundup repositioning actions. Within Roundup, we'll have the pricing effect when we have volume at the lower price points as well as some carryover as we close out our distribution incentives and see the full gross profit impact from the supply contract breaches.</p>
          <p>On the seeds and traits side, fourth quarter reflects a significant contribution from our Latin American corn seed business. That includes both the repeat of gross profit related to our Mexican corn distribution change and the contributions from Argentina and Brazil.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, our full-year SG&amp;A spend is trending very well, and we continue to expect SG&amp;A will come in at the 2.0 to $2.1 billion range for the full year. The fourth quarter will reflect a consistent SG&amp;A level as we complete the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>No doubt there's still some work to do to close out 2010, but we are becoming increasingly focused on 2011. As promised on the second quarter call, we're back today with the guideposts that we use to calibrate and track our mid-teens growth going forward. As CFO, let me share with you how I view those key metrics, which we've included on slide six. Put simply, these are the metrics that matter to us, the dashboard indicators we look to when we're tracking the operational progress and the health of the business.</p>
          <p>On the left side, you'll see the categories that translate progress into practical financial guidance. At this point, we can give you an early look at the directional trends in these key categories, and we'll expand and update them on our fourth quarter call once we have the 2010 end points. On the right side, you'll see the factors that set the financial outlook. We've moved away from the specific line item detail on the business drivers, but we'll be able to provide meaningful direction on the large contributors across each segment.</p>
          <p>This is a walk down the P&amp;L, culminating in our expectation of mid-teens earnings growth on an annual basis. If you start there, here's how I see the roll-up happening. Most importantly, we can achieve our mid-teens earnings growth in 2011 without double-digit gross profit growth from seeds and traits. Top line growth will come from an increase in seed unit volume as well as mix improvement. Hugh will cover this in some more detail. But if you look at the leverage, there are three points that matter: Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the US, the US corn product strategy, and the trait expansion in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
          <p>All in, I expect global seed and trait volume growth in the low to mid-single digits in 2011. And the reason unit volume growth matters a little more than pure share metrics is we can control what we sell, but we don't control the denominator of acres planted, although we do expect volume to be reflective of share growth at a global level. The benefit of that unit volume growth is that your portfolio remains fresher and you have less total obsolescence, so this is clearly a priority for us.</p>
          <p>On the ag productivity segment, we expect to deliver steady-state gross profit in the range of 550 to $600 million beginning in 2011. This is largely in line with what we expect to earn in 2010, so there will be minimal contribution to gross profit growth in the coming year, but it is a significant step toward the predictability we see at steady state. We will aggressively look at the infrastructure supporting Roundup to make sure those support systems are in line with our steady-state guidance. That process is underway, so we'll be able to give you an update on those actions on the fourth quarter earnings call.</p>
          <p>As we then move into the below-the-line items, the cost savings we've realized as a result of our restructuring actions have allowed us to institutionalize a reduced run rate in our SG&amp;A for 2010. We continue to see those savings carrying forward such that we expect SG&amp;A for next year will grow only at an inflationary rate from this year's levels.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D line, there's no debate that our R&amp;D pipeline is our competitive differentiator and fuels the upside opportunity in our business longer term. We don't look at this line as a means to reach our earnings goal, and we'll continue to resource our R&amp;D for success. To reinforce that commitment, we move to give you a specific range for R&amp;D spend rather than a metric that floats with sales. We'll lock this down in the fourth quarter, but practically speaking that range should represent an increase over our 2010 endpoint but at a growth rate somewhat lower than we've seen over the past few years.</p>
          <p>The last items in our guidance dashboard relate to cash flow. The most important task is to efficiently translate earnings into cash. I said we remain on track to deliver 400 to $500 million in free cash flow this year. This is still on track as the fourth quarter is the primary collection period in the US and drives our full-year cash generation. We'll discuss specific guidance for 2011 in our fourth quarter earnings call, but I see cash generation rebounding to a significantly higher level as we see business grow and we drop off cash uses associated with our restructuring and with working capital requirements from the Roundup business.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization will be than what we expect this year, in the $650 million range, reflecting investments made to expand our production capabilities in seeds and Roundup over the last two years.</p>
          <p>The remaining driver for free cash flow will be capital expenditures, which I expect will be in the 600 to $700 million range. This moves more in line with depreciation as we now have a fresh asset base. Taken cumulatively, that means we expect mid-teens growth is going to put us on track to generate significant cash flow levels in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Our strong balance sheet puts us in a position to access capital if a significant acquisition opportunity will present itself, so we'll look to ways to more aggressively deploy the cash we generate directly to our owners, with a priority on generating sustainable value over the longer term. Practically, we continue to see dividends as a priority mechanism to distribute cash to our shareowners as we grow the business.</p>
          <p>We complement that with our share repurchase program focused on managing dilution now and in the future. As you can see on slide seven, we expect to complete our current $800 million authorization a year earlier than we expected. And as we announced last month, our Board of Directors approved a new three-year, $1 billion plan that we expect to begin in the fourth quarter. If you take that all in, what matters is how it informs our opportunities.</p>
          <p>As I wrap up, I tell you that from my vantage point as CFO, what matters going forward is that with the decision last month to fundamentally change the Roundup strategy to support our traits business, Monsanto now effectively becomes a pure-play seeds and traits company.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide eight, you'll see two things. The gross profit contribution this year from the entire ag productivity segment will only be about 10% of our total. And as we go forward, the natural growth in our seeds and traits business will make that comparative contribution even less material. That means it's seeds and traits growth that matters. You'll see the historical perspective on our growth. If you focus that snapshot on the last couple of years, the seeds and traits business has been in line with our mid-teens growth trajectory. Taken in combination with our operational plans, that tells me that the opportunity is realistic and attainable. That means in the near term, we shift our focus very intently to execution and on implementing our plans.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh, who will walk through the key business developments we're currently working on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carl, and good morning to everybody on the line. As Carl just noted, this is a period for our company where our execution matters. We came through a number of business challenges in 2010 and we've made the difficult decisions that effectively clear the decks for our path going forward. Practically, over the next year we'll be a company that's clear on our priorities, does what we say we will, and adds credibility through our results. To that end, in the short time since we were last with you, there has been a lot of activity on a couple of critical areas that shape our plans and our near-term implementation.</p>
          <p>On our second quarter call, I told you that one of the things that informed our strategic decision making was the direct feedback that we got from our farmer customers. As you'd expect, our dialogue with farmers is continual, and the feedback that we've been getting from the most recent conversations is encouraging. Fundamentally, the feedback that we get loud and clear is that new technology does create value, but they need more products at more price points to allow them to manage the risks that they take every day on their farm when they try out so many new products that come so quickly.</p>
          <p>The beauty of that ask is that it's all within our control. We don't have to go out and invent something. We just have to take what we have and work with our customers. I think that's happening. And while I recognize that these are early qualitative indicators, I believe farmers are telling us that we're addressing the issues that matter and we're making progress.</p>
          <p>So if we take that as a step in the right direction, let me go from there to a couple of the other areas where we feel we've made some progress that moves us towards operationalizing some of the key factors for the 2011 season.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with Roundup on slide nine. If you look at our quarterly financial statement, you can't miss the fact that we've begun to move on the actions that we outlined for you a little more than four weeks ago. Carl covered the financial relevance, so I won't belabor the details, but I want to touch on how we see the strategy coming together. First, in the last week the Chinese government has taken action to remove the value-added tax or VAT rebate on glyphosate. That's a good step forward covering one of the two big areas of effective Chinese subsidies. This move is another signal pointing to the structural changes that we suggested would occur in an increasingly generic glyphosate industry. So in the near term, I really don't see that changing our forecast or the strategy for Roundup.</p>
          <p>More importantly, a lot has been written lately about the pending demise of Roundup as an effective herbicide and what that in turn means for our biotech franchise. I can tell you that's misplaced; and if anything, there's a new practical opportunity emerging. Basically, we've built Roundup as the centerpiece of simple, affordable weed control, and the process that creates the incentive for farmers to proactively get ahead of weed resistance broadly rather than reacting once resistance has become an issue.</p>
          <p>I think cotton becomes a bit of a case study for this strategy. Part of the reason that resistance has been delayed in cotton is because of the widespread use of multiple herbicides as a part of the standard regimen. As we move forward on our Roundup positioning, this is exactly the practice that we will build on. We will wrap other active ingredients around Roundup to create a complete weed control system. With Roundup coming down in price and with the ability to pair that with effective generics, that means that for less than what he's paying for weed control today, a farmer gets a total weed control package that actually fights against weed resistance before it's ever an issue.</p>
          <p>That simple, cost effective weed control program then sets the stage as we transition into multiple modes of action via our next generation biotech traits. The leading edge of that is dicamba tolerance in soybeans. And the early indicators from this year's field trials continues to confirm for us that our dicamba control is excellent and will be an ideal complement to our Roundup Ready system.</p>
          <p>If we move entirely to the seeds and traits side of the business, there are a couple of areas where we're developing some interim data points that inform how we're thinking about 2011. The first of these is in Roundup Ready 2 Yield, where I believe we're seeing some legitimate momentum coming together, which is captured in slide 10. I recognize that the proof will be in the performance once farmers check their yield monitors this fall, but we're seeing an increasing number of players make the substantial bet that the performance will be there. There's no doubt in my mind farmers aren't betting against the technology since 40% of our US branded customers are using Roundup Ready 2 Yield this year.</p>
          <p>But just as importantly, the industry is now validating the technology. Earlier this month, Dow signed on as a commercial licensee for Roundup Ready 2 Yield. They now join Syngenta as another major soybean player that had the chance to evaluate both Roundup Ready 2 Yield and the competitive options and voted to go with Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And these are decisions that they've made with data that they've generated independently using competitive comparisons.</p>
          <p>Between these companies, our brands, and our licensee partners, more than two-thirds of the soybean industry has embraced the new Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform. Likewise, just a couple of weeks ago, an independent insurance provider in the ag sector unveiled its biotech yield assurance program for 2011 built on Roundup Ready 2 Yield. This is a nice incentive for farmers to try Roundup Ready 2 Yield. More importantly, when you make your living on the risk calculation on payouts for crop performance, as these guys do, it takes a lot to show this level of support. So the fact that they've made the determination that the yield advantage is statistically strong enough to extend greater coverage is another signal I think that the industry isn't treating Roundup Ready 2 Yield as a possibility, but the likely industry platform going forward.</p>
          <p>The same would be for areas within our US corn product strategy. I mentioned that I felt like the feedback that we've gotten from our customers has been encouraging, and I'd say that this is particularly true when it comes to the feedback on our corn product strategy. If you go to slide 11, I'd assert that nobody else in this industry can offer a family of reduced refuge products in the form of a double-stack, a triple-stack, and an all-in-one eight-gene stack. This is a truly differentiated product portfolio. And to be clear, I continue to expect that because of that technological differentiation, we will be the premium priced seed. Increasingly that value proposition is really us versus us rather than us versus the competition, so our implementation is focused on getting our relative value propositions against our current products right from the drawer.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect our differentiated products will become even more differentiated with Refuge in a Bag or RIB. The reality is these products would represent the industry's only single-bag RIB option. In fact, I'm happy to be able to say that in the last few days, we've submitted an application to the US EPA for a 5% RIB for VT Double PRO in the Corn Belt. That means pending EPA approval, we expect to make the leap from refuge reduction to RIB in both SmartStax and Double PRO beginning in 2012. That's important because the refuge matters to farmers and it ensures the durability of the technology. Planting and managing the refuge is complex and it's inconvenient. But we've just completed new market research that indicates that 97% of growers who use insect protected corn do plant refuge acres in some configuration. And maybe more importantly, almost half of the farmers indicated that they would be likely to switch brands to get a 5% RIB product because of the simplicity of a single-bag solution.</p>
          <p>Directly related to that corn strategy as well as Roundup Ready 2 Yield momentum is our pricing approach. To be blunt, I recognize that one of the biggest areas of outstanding questions revolves around our pricing. In the last couple of weeks, we've rolled that out. We've rolled out our initial trait pricing to our seed licensee partners, so we've taken the first step on this pricing journey. And to be fair, we've intentionally played the specifics of our pricing strategy closer to our vest because that's an advantage that we don't need to offer our competitors. But if you go to slide 12, you'll see we've given you an indexed look at the gross profit per acre expectations for our complete corn product strategy.</p>
          <p>This is the all-in bag price indexed from our 2010 triple-stack and weighted across our zones. It's a bit of a modeling aid, and it's more directional than it is absolute. But more importantly, I think it illustrates a couple of key things. Most importantly, we've done what we said we would. We'll generally keep prices in line on our triple stacks. We've narrowed the premiums for SmartStax to recognize the upfront risk sharing, and we're inserting new products into the value ladder.</p>
          <p>The same basic premise holds in soybeans. We've made the adjustments to our pricing approach for Roundup Ready 2 Yield that gives farmers the incentive to make the leap from Roundup Ready 1. Generally speaking, we'll give farmers the option of choosing the seed treatment, and we will adjust the premium to be closer to Roundup Ready 1. These are steady-state ranges, so you'll see that we'll realize a step change in the margin contribution from SmartStax and Triple PRO over our triple-stack offerings.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we will actually carry in about 1 million acres of SmartStax at the higher cost position for this year. The margin uplift then will be a bit muted while the launch costs and the carry in inventory work out through 2011. That will put SmartStax at somewhat below its steady-state landing point this coming year.</p>
          <p>And that leads me to a quick word about production. By calibrating how we deploy this family, we will be able to maximize our summer production for each product while minimizing our higher cost winter production. The benefit is reflected in our margin progression, where we'll get to these steady state ranges in 2012, a year earlier than we would have with greater winter production. With this production approach, we stay on track for a significant ramp up across the SmartStax family, hitting mid-teens total acreage in 2011.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the addressable opportunity and our first real year of having this family approach, we'll replace almost half of our flagship triple-stack acres. From there, the beauty of this production approach is we can then use this year's farmer purchases and grower feedback to inform how we ramp up each product within the family for 2012 without having to do any extraordinary production.</p>
          <p>So if you take all of that together, you get exactly where Carl indicated we'd be. Even with multiple price points across the market, the average margin that we will realize goes up. Since we were never going to take SmartStax to every acre at equal prices, that average margin benefit is the reason that matching the cost position to the market segment makes good economic sense for us, and more importantly for our grower customers. And if you build on the direct feedback from farmers with the feedback that came from our licensee partners recently, I'd tell you that the product strategy and the pricing approach were well received. It's still early communications, but the feedback suggests that we've been responsive and that there's some excitement building moving forward.</p>
          <p>So as we wrap up, I'd step back and I'd recognize that as good as you can feel at this point, a lot of this only really matters once growers see the products perform and start voting with their purchases. But if I end where I began, if our task is executing the operating plan, those purchases are borne of a lot of the work that gets done well before seed ever reaches the bag. And in that regard I feel good about a couple of key things. Firstly, we've done what we needed to do with Roundup, and we'll now focus on using our crop protection business to support seeds and traits; and secondly, with the experience and the agility to use our products and our leadership, to use 2010 as the pivot point to create mid-teens growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>So with that, we'll turn the call back to Bryan and look forward to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have a two-part question on seed pricing. The first part would be what is the all-in pricing assumption that is embedded in your forecast of double-digit growth in the seeds and genomics platform in gross profit terms for fiscal 2011? And the second part would be more specifically, you've had some preliminary talks with your licensees at this point. I was wondering if you could comment on the magnitude of the reduction in the premia for both Roundup Ready 2 Yield seed and SmartStax. If those premia were X last year, would they be half of X or more or less? That kind of color would be helpful, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kevin, good morning, so I'll maybe cover the second and let Carl talk about the first. So the feedback from licensees &#x2013; and you have to be so careful at this time of the year. So we're going to be probably more cautious than we have been traditionally. But the feedback from licensees was very encouraging because they felt that they had been heard. So on SmartStax versus triples and on Roundup Ready 2 Yield versus Roundup Ready 1, in beans we took out &#x2013; we gave growers the optionality on seed treatment. It's my expectation that many of them will go ahead and use that seed treatment, but it's their option now. And that move in itself reduces the premium by about half from where we were previously. It reduces the premium from about $20 to about 10, and then we skinny down a piece of that remaining 10.</p>
          <p>On SmartStax, ballpark, half or more wouldn't be too far away. It's probably in the region of about &#x2013; moving towards that magical number of the one-third to two-third value share. So as we migrated on these premiums and we looked at corn pricing, the clear feedback that we got and all the modeling we did after the fact, we've tried our best to drive that one-third to two-third value share, and I anticipate that that's going to be received well as we run it this fall. And then your first question, Carl?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of general pricing trends, Kevin, Hugh talked about basically the trait platform. But the other thing that impacts the price benefit or the mix effect for next year will be we will launch our new best hybrids obviously at a premium to what they're replacing. But the nuance of the effect is it's just not the delta between next year's price and the previous year's price. It's the delta between next year's price and the four or five year old hybrids that they're replacing in the portfolio, so you get a nice lift there as well. So there's a mix effect in combination with &#x2013; a mix effect on the genetics as well as a mix effect on the trade upgrade that Hugh mentioned as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just as a quick follow-up to that, if I think about first generation soybeans and triple-stacked corn, would it be your intention to hold prices stable for the first generation or prior generation products or make an adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Broad philosophy, we would anticipate holding them pretty stable, Kevin. We've got one or two geographies we need to do a little bit of cleanup, but we'd hold stable and key off that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my one question is unfortunately going to be &#x2013; I'm looking at the Roundup gross profit through nine months and it's minus 103. And you're still talking about doing 50 to 200 million for the full year, and you didn't narrow your guidance range, which for a quarter as small as 4Q seems pretty wide. So I guess I'm just wondering how you're going to do what looks to be 150 million of GP at least in Roundup in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent, good morning to you. You're right. The last quarter, as it has been for a long time, the last quarter has ebbs and flows in Roundup in it. And we're unevenly distributed because a lot of our branded business falls in the back end of the year, and you see Brazil and Argentina wakening up again in the back end of the year. So Carl, maybe a little bit of color on what that spread looks like and how we see the Roundup business unfolding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at Roundup, Vincent, for the fourth quarter I'd say there are probably three big variables that are going to drive the performance for the business. Hugh just mentioned one of them, which is we're very front loaded with our supply business in the first half of the year, and we're back loaded with the brand on the second half, and obviously which commands higher prices.</p>
          <p>The second is the intention is that the producer will benefit from our new pricing predominantly in FY '11, not yet in '10. And then the third one is the timing of the remaining actions around the repositioning of the Roundup business. Those are the three moving parts that are going to generate that range and that outcome, and that's why that range is still wide, Vincent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I guess you're still very comfortable that you can do north of 50 in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're comfortable with the 50 to the 200 million range for the full year on the Roundup business, yes.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just rough numbers in terms of impact on the business, it would be probably two-thirds North America, one-third rest of the world. And if you included Latin America in that, you'll probably get north of three-quarters, Jeff, in terms of where our corn business is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, Carl talked about a number of extra charges that you have this year, but I would imagine that total management compensation expense or bonus expense is probably down this year. So what's the delta in terms of compensation expense for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's going to be significantly down, Jeff. We haven't broken that out, but given our results and our performance this year, it's going to be a very thin year for bonus season comp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, this is Carl. The way I think about that informing 2011, our SG&amp;A guidance that we just gave for 2011, which is inflationary above our current run rate of 2 billion to 2.1 billion, would include a more normalized run rate on incentives embedded within that; so an anticipation that we're going to achieve the desired performance within the business and pay incentives at the target level. Again, that's inclusive in that guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the only other piece that I would add, Jeff, so the one-third/two-thirds split is really rough. The piece that gets masked in that is the emerging technology penetration in Brazil and Argentina. So we've seen a really, really fast ramp on singles to doubles. And after 10 years, we're seeing Brazil approving products at a pretty rapid clip. So that traditional mix will change as we see technification in those corn markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As you lower prices for SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield, can you give your acreage expectations for those products? I mean do the acres go up as you lower prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., I think if you look at corn first, we are moving. I made the comment on us versus us and us versus competition. And a piece of this work has been narrowing &#x2013; to Kevin's question, narrowing the premiums between our product offerings and inserting additional products in there. With the news today that we've now submitted for a double stack with refuge reduction, we're thinking about that family of refuge reduction products with narrowed premiums between that range to drive trial and adoption. We just planted our production acres in the last few weeks. And I'd say in corn if you look at that whole family and mid-teens acres projection for the coming year, we've got a little bit more conservative on the winter production because of the dramatic effect that it has on margin lift. So I think trajectory-wise, we're going to be in the zone.</p>
          <p>On soybeans, a lot of this is going to be based on what we yield out of those production acres this year, but we're still saying mid-teens for Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And it's hard; I think we learned a lesson last year. It has been a warm, wet season. It has been spectacular growth. But just like farmers, I'd feel a whole lot better with another six to eight weeks under my belt before I paint what our yields are going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and you said that you're going to hold the base pricing on your products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess is your competitors are going to react. They're not going to make it easy for you to take share. So what are you building in for that, and is there any risk that the entire pricing curve in the industry comes down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can only speak to my products and my strategy, so what they choose to do is their call. I think from the research that we've done and the conversations that we've had, the key for us is to drive adoption and encourage growers to put their toe in the water and try these products. And until we get to that &#x2013; so we have moved, as you know well, we've moved to 50/50 value share. As we dial back to one-third/two-thirds, I believe that we will see grower adoption, and with grower adoption and the performance of these technologies, we should be in good shape.</p>
          <p>So in each one of these segments, P.J., we will continue to be the premium priced product. So from the perspective of what happens with price spirals, I think we will continue to be premium priced in every single one of these segments because of our performance. And if you think over the last couple years with flat share growth in corn, we are about a third of the market. Our biggest competitor is about a third of the market, and the remaining companies are the remaining third. And despite price disparity, we held share; so the share growth from our biggest competitor came from others. So I think we've done a ton of work in this. We're still operationalizing it and rolling it out to our sales teams. The key for us is sharing the value we create more aggressively, and I think that prompts growth despite our premium prices.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>And I'm just looking for a clarification. You said that you got rid of dealer incentive programs on Roundup. I just want to make sure I understand that you are keeping the Roundup Rewards program, or are you getting rid of that as well?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., this is Carl. A key component of the revised or reset Roundup strategy is that when we get pricing approaching generic levels, but you continue to provide the benefits of Roundup Rewards, which we will, that makes that a pretty compelling offer relative to the alternatives that are out there. So given that in the Americas the purpose of Roundup now is to support our Roundup Ready franchise, and Roundup Rewards is an integral part of that, we will be maintaining it. In fact, we'll be looking for ways to perhaps enhance the offering going forward.</p>

          <p>Could you talk a little bit about what you think a farmer would need to see in his SmartStax performance this year to embrace the product and want to buy more next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He's looking for a yield improvement over his triples; I guess two or three things. He's looking for a yield improvement over his triples. He knows that he has bugs in the field even though he hasn't seen them for the last couple years, so he's anticipating. He's hedging on normalized weather, and he's looking for the performance in new hybrids that he hasn't seen.</p>
          <p>The other piece, Bob, is as you talk to these guys, a lot of them are maxed out on refuge management. They have taken triples as far as they can on their farm, and he's looking for the edge on refuge management. But the awareness amongst that community on RIB in 2012, they are absolutely focused on it. So I'd say it's yield. It's a quick peek on our new hybrids, which he still hasn't really had a feel for, and it's that next level of refuge management. Carl, I don't know if you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's exactly right. The way that a farmer is thinking about it and with what we've done with our premiums, a farmer doesn't need to see more dead bugs in SmartStax versus triples. They just need to get the benefit of refuge reduction, which we've built in regardless whether it's a wet year or a dry year. So in anticipation of Refuge in a Bag coming in 2012, with what we've done with our premiums, we think if there were no additional benefit other than just refuge reduction, this is a pretty compelling opportunity for the farmer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you just refresh my memory? How many unique isolines were developed for this year on SmartStax versus taking the existing triple and adding the SmartStax trait package? And then what does that look like as you go into 2011 in terms of numbers that are available?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The SmartStax were basically new isoline conversions. It's a different product than what the triple product was in the marketplace. Basically, about 40% of the genetics in SmartStax this year are brand new genetics that aren't shared with the triple-stack product, Bob.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a question on Roundup Ready pricing. How has the increased incidence of glyphosate resistant weeds impacted the perception that farmers have surrounding the value of the Roundup Ready trait in corn, soy, and cotton? I understand that you have reimbursed some farmers for the cost of additional herbicides to control pigweed in cotton. As a follow-up, what impact will this have on your per-acre returns for Roundup Ready cotton, and do you anticipate extending this practice to any other crops?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandy, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let Carl comment. There has been a lot of coverage on the whole Roundup resistance conversation. Let me try and frame this for you. It's predominantly an issue of the South, not exclusively but predominantly. And within the South, it's predominantly an issue in cotton. So we see very little incidence in corn; and the reason that you see very little of it in corn is the range of chemistries that are applied in corn, and there's a lesson and a learning in that. It's emerging in soybeans, particularly in the South, and cotton is the first piece of work to be done.</p>
          <p>Our strategy &#x2013; so directly to your question on how does this influence this, the grower is looking for help. That's why I think there's an opportunity here and it's the emergence of a new category. And what we are going to work on is defining a handful of products, and by a handful I'm thinking half a dozen products, of which we have two in glyphosate and acetochlor. And those would become the base treatments to manage resistance before it becomes a problem. And the key in this is offering the grower those half dozen products at affordable prices. And I think if we can give them the advice, we can drive price discovery, and we can help educate that grower on how to fight this rather than using expensive bundled materials, you get a long way down the path in solving this in cotton and you head off of the path before it becomes an issue in soy. So that's a piece of our go-forward strategy on how we manage Roundup, how we link that to Roundup Rewards, and how we help the grower with affordable solutions.</p>

          <p>We've seen at least in Illinois some indications that we've returned to more normal rootworm infestation levels. Can you comment in any of the other key growing areas what you're seeing and how this will likely impact the yield performance versus the VT Triple? And similarly for RR2, has white mold been less common this year? And if so, are you anticipating that that's going to help your yield results in RR2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so with a caveat of Scottish optimism, Sandy, so white mold is a problem in cold, wet years. And this year, it has been wet with a lot of moisture, but it's very warm. So, so far we haven't seen any instance of mold emerging. It's looking like a more normalized year. And so far on early, early bug counts, as you make the point in Illinois, we're seeing a slight elevation. But as I said to an earlier point, we're growing our own seed right now. It's really, really early in the season. So it's probably &#x2013; from some of the early reads we're seeing, earworm could be every bit as much a problem this year as corn rootworm, But there's every reason for hope still. You can see at this stage we're not losing, but it's a bit early to describe victory, I think.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Now that you've dialed back on the value capture to a third, can you start walking up that value capture model in 2012 with higher pricing, and can RIB be an enabler of higher pricing starting in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, thanks for your question. I'd like to deliver on '11. I think we owe our owners that and we owe our farm customers that. So I think the key for us in this is we placed our bets a few weeks ago on seed that we're producing. As you say, we've dialed back. I'd actually say we've advanced our thinking and rediscovered the one-third to two-third value share. And with that, I think we improved sentiment and reputation with growers, and we win on those head-to-head tests.</p>
          <p>2012, RIB I think has the capacity to be a game changer, and growers are anticipating that. And right on the back of RIB, particularly having applied for the double-stack RIB product a few days ago, that becomes the early flagship for drought. So I'll tell you how I'm thinking about '11, '12, and '13 is how do we continue to drive unit volume growth? How do we continue to satisfy growers, and how do we deliver innovation on these two new platforms? And the platforms will be RIB and Roundup Ready 2 Yield in beans. I think it's way premature to be talking about are we going to be walking prices up. I'd just like to regain momentum we've lost in the last two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, but just longer term do you think farmers are still willing to share half the value with you longer term on your technology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the endpoints on the value that we create are exactly the same. I think how we get there is probably a more regulated march. But if I take you to 2013, one side of the house you've got RIB across all your major products, and you've loaded drought on it and you've delivered yet another increment of yield. And on the other side of the house, you've got a soybean business that looks a lot like corn because of multiple stacks. So then you have soy with dicamba and a yield gene in that '13 &#x2013; '14 timeframe. And we should be first pick for the grower because we deliver more incremental yield than anybody else. And it's the algebra of if then &#x2013; if that, then what. I think job one for us is securing the certainty of that yield, and then we can talk about that, David.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies &amp; Company. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Lucy Watson on for Laurence today. Would it be possible to quantify by segment the cost savings that you've achieved so far from restructuring actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, we share SG&amp;A across the enterprise. If you look at the actions that we did a year ago, those were predominantly directed at the direct SG&amp;A support of the Roundup business. What we're looking at now is basically the things that I would call the supporting SG&amp;A that's associated with the business, and those will be the areas that we're looking at right now for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl, maybe a few words about how you project SG&amp;A going forward because it ties with the incentives question; we're looking at flat SG&amp;A on a year-on-year basis. So we've fundamentally shifted that, but with the exception of some costs in '11 increases, it's flat, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're basically 2 billion to 2.1 this year. We're basically saying inflationary growth on top of that. But if you look at the big benefit that we got from the restructuring we took, it fundamentally changed the slope of our run rate. And we just now fundamentally spend less as a company than the path that we were on in 2008. If you look at the delta between those two run rates over time, there's a huge, huge SG&amp;A avoidance benefit to the company.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With the I guess large step change in the branded portfolio to 75% triples and SmartStax, it looks like corn gross profits were still down about 10% year over year. And I know there were some launch year costs and restructuring in there, but I guess would you just be willing to walk us through the year-over-year bridge in a little bit more detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure that's a great &#x2013; I know we're getting to the top of the hour here, but that's a great question. I think if you &#x2013; and maybe I'll ask Carl to do just a brief dissection of this. But were it not for some of the actions that we took this year in corn, we would be exactly in line with our expectation. So we took a series of actions that I think clears the decks for 2011 growth. And they were largely conscious, and they're all one-time actions that I think set us up nicely for next year; but Carl maybe just at a high level, what they were and how they reflect on the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So the way that I think about it is about $120 million in action is one-time, as Hugh said, that affected the gross profit line for the business in corn this year. The composition of that 120 would be roughly one-third some corn hedges that we had that we changed to basically allow us to have lower cost of goods going forward. And then the other third &#x2013; or I should say another third was our domestic corn portfolio, to reshape it for the SmartStax family going forward. And the other third is largely international corn, predominantly Brazil, as we transition our portfolio in Brazil from our first generation single trait to our second generation single trait down there. But again, those are one-time effects we had this year to position the business for growth for 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Rob. Again, I'd just like to thank you for joining us this morning. I think with everything we came through, this is a pretty straightforward quarter to report, and that's a good thing. So there's not a lot of news. There are not a lot of new data points, but I guess there are three things that I would leave you with in a quarter like this.</p>
          <p>First with the Roundup repositioning, we've made a number of significant decisions to improve the predictability of our business performance in Roundup, and I believe a straightforward quarter is the first step in that direction. Secondly, it's a year where we made adjustments, and I'm personally encouraged with the feedback from our customers, albeit on an early read on those adjustments and the course that we're on for next year. So it doesn't guarantee success, but I think there are some very good early indicators.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, while there's work to do closing out 2010, as a team we're increasingly turning our attention to 2011. And I feel very good about the product plan, the pricing, the operational focus, and the opportunities going into 2011 for our prospects in delivering consistent annual earnings growth in the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>So we hope that many of you will be able to join us in August for our Whistle Stop event, which this year is in Nebraska, to see both our current products and some of our pipeline technologies in the field; so until then, thanks very much for your support and for your time this morning.</p>
