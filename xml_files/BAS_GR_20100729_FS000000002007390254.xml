      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of BASF, I would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2010 conference call. BASF delivered excellent second quarter earnings and sales continued to recover strongly, especially in our chemical activity.</p>
          <p>With me on the call today are J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht, Chairman and CEO of BASF SE; Kurt Bock, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Feldmann, Board Member, responsible for Performance Products. Following the presentation, all three gentlemen will be available to take your questions. For your reference we have posted the presentation and the press documents on our website at basf.com/share.</p>
          <p>And with this, I'm already going to hand over to J&#xFC;rgen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It must be a really tough day for you all out there. Thank you for joining us here at BASF. In the second quarter, the global economy continued to recover and we experience better demand from almost all customer industries. Tight supplies of certain products and positive currency effects further contributed to our excellent second quarter performance.</p>
          <p>In Q2, sales rose by 30% to &#x20AC;16.2 billion and EBIT before special items almost doubled to &#x20AC;2.2 billion compared with the same period last year. Especially our chemical activities, as Magi already mentioned, posted new records for sales and earnings, despite the first turnaround of our entire Nanjing, Verbund site, which we successfully completed mid-June.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will further strengthen our portfolio with the announced acquisition of Cognis. As a consequence, our businesses will move even closer to attractive end-user markets and become more resilient to cyclicality.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of July, we also announced that we will expand our collaboration with Monsanto, adding wheat, a fifth crop, to our joint plan biotechnology pipeline. At the same time, we agreed to additional investments of up to USD $1 billion, reflecting the strong leads and commercial prospects in the collaboration's early work.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to hand over to Kurt who will now take you through BASF second quarter results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, J&#xFC;rgen, also welcome from my side. Ladies and gentlemen, I will today focus on the sequential comparison of Q2, 2010, versus Q1. It would help you to better understand business dynamics, given the fact that the second quarter of 2009 was unusually weak due to the crisis.</p>
          <p>Debt increased by 5% over the previous quarter, while total volumes declined by 2%, given significant lower volumes in oil and gas, increased volumes in our chemical activities was more by 5%. Prices rose by 2%. Currency effects contributed 5% to sales as a result of the strong depreciation of the euro against many other currencies. At &#x20AC;2.9 billion EBITDA was 9% up over Q1, representing an EBITDA margin of 18%. EBIT before special items rose to &#x20AC;2.2 billion, an increase of 13%.</p>
          <p>Net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.2 billion, up 15% quarter-on-quarter due to higher income from operations, as well as the lower tax rate. Lower tax rate of 32.5% was a consequence of the significantly reduced share of the oil and gas business, which, as you all know, has a very high tax rate. Adjusted earnings per share were &#x20AC;1.50, improvement of 14%.</p>
          <p>Now I will quickly take you through the business development of our six segments. Chemicals recorded another excellent quarter. Sales increased by 50% and earnings by 49%, respectively, due to strong demand across all divisions and regions.</p>
          <p>Petrochemicals sales went up by 60%, driven by continuous strong demand for cracker products coupled with further price increases in all regions. Planned and unplanned outages that compared to us in oil fields and acrylics led to very tight markets. We were able to improve earnings despite the scheduled turnaround of the Nanjing site as J&#xFC;rgen mentioned.</p>
          <p>Inorganic sales rose by 15% due to higher volumes, especially for metal systems, inorganic salts, and electronic materials. Margins for ammonia and methanol improved, while the demand from key customer industries led to an 11% increase in sales of intermediates. Supply of Butanediol, polyalcohols and specialty amines did not suffice to cover actual customer demand. The weaker euro supported overseas exports from Europe to Asia. Earnings increased only slightly since we incurred higher fixed costs related to the startup of new capacities.</p>
          <p>In plastics, strong demand from key customer industries such as automotive, appliance and textile, higher prices and positive currency effects drove sales up by 18%. Earnings also improved despite several maintenance turnarounds in polyurethanes.</p>
          <p>Performance polymers sales increased by 21% and earnings were up significantly. The seasonal upturn of the European construction industry pushed up volumes for foam. We were able to improve margins for foams, polyamides, monomers and nylon 66, which were in extremely tight supply.</p>
          <p>Stronger sales volumes and positive currencies effects lifted polyurethanes sales by 15%. We experienced a stronger product uptake from the appliance, automotive, construction and furniture industries. Rising benzene and toluene costs put MDI as well as TDI margins under pressure, while polyurethane systems houses and the specialty business delivered an excellent performance. Earnings matched the good level of the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The performance products segment continued to perform strongly. Synergies from the Ciba integration as well as the implementation of our business model contributed positively to earnings. Due to shortages of important raw materials, we were not able to fully serve customer demand in several product lines. Compared with last year's second quarter, we also reduced special items from &#x20AC;294 million to &#x20AC;21 million.</p>
          <p>Sales in dispersion and pigments rose by 19%, reflecting improved demand in all businesses and regions. In particular, the global market for additives and pigments remained tight. Successful price increases more than offset higher costs of raw materials, earnings increased substantially.</p>
          <p>Sales in care chemicals reached a new record with highest growth coming from Asia. Volumes for all product areas were back at pre-crisis levels and prices improved. Constrained supply resulted in tight markets for hygiene and aroma chemicals. Earnings remained at a high level.</p>
          <p>High demand in all regions and businesses helped to increase sales in paper chemicals by 5%. Rising feedstock costs put increasing pressure on margins. Thanks to our extended restructuring program, fixed costs could be further reduced and consequently earnings went up.</p>
          <p>In performance chemicals, sales rose by 11%, driven by a continued strong recovery of all major customer industries, as well as inventory re-stocking by our customers. Higher raw material costs could be mostly offset by price increases. Earnings improved further.</p>
          <p>In functional solutions, sales and earnings rose significantly, benefiting from stronger demand from the automotive industry, as well as the seasonal upturn in the construction sector.</p>
          <p>In catalysts, sales went up by 15%, reflecting higher volumes and increased precious metal prices. The mobile emission catalyst business recorded a further recovery in Europe and North America. Higher sales of refinery catalysts were partially offset by weaker demand for chemical catalysts, where we only noticed the first signs of a recovery. Earnings remained on the level of the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The seasonal pickup in construction activity in North America and Europe increased sales of construction chemicals by 33%. Nevertheless, the market environment remains difficult, especially in the U.S., Spain, U.K. and Japan, highlighted by the fact that volume was just 3% above last year's second quarter. Only selected emerging markets show a favorable development. We further improved margins and reduced fixed costs, which significantly drove up earnings.</p>
          <p>Higher sales volumes in all regions lifted sales and earnings in the coatings division. We benefited from strong demand from the automotive industry in Asia, which also triggered high production, especially by German car makers for export to China. Moreover, increased demand from European steel producers led to higher sales of industrial coatings.</p>
          <p>Decorative paint business in South America continues to perform strongly.</p>
          <p>And now agricultural solutions. Despite a late start into the season, sales in the first half of this year increased slightly. Higher volumes, both in Q1 and Q2, as well as positive currency effects more than compensated for weaker prices.</p>
          <p>In Europe, weather conditions continue to be less favorable towards the second quarter, resulting in reduced disease pressure negatively impacting our fungicide business. Nevertheless, sales rose slightly due to higher demand for herbicide. North America, we had a mixed picture. The sales of fungicides declined. Our herbicides business continued to grow strongly. We experienced declining demand for some fungicides due to high channel inventories. Excellent demand for our new herbicide, Kixor, was responsible for the strong growth of herbicide.</p>
          <p>Favorable business conditions for soybean herbicides in India, as well as positive currency effects contributed to a good business performance in Asia. In South America, sales grew strongly as a result of higher demand for insecticide and fungicide. Lower prices and higher expenditures for marketing, sales and R&amp;D costs, earnings to come in below the record level of last year.</p>
          <p>Now oil and gas. Sales in oil and gas almost remained on last year's level. EBIT before special items advanced by 2%. Sales in E&amp;P declined by 10%. The significant increase in the oil prices trend, averaging about USD $78 per barrel compared with $59 per barrel last year &#x2013; same quarter of last year, could not compensate for the OPEC restricted lower oil production in Libya as well as lower selling price for natural gas.</p>
          <p>Earnings decreased by 10%, mainly due to the oil production restrictions in Libya. Gas, natural gas, trading was flat. The cold weather in April and May, coupled with improved demand from industrial customers and power plants, led to a strong increase in gas volume. Stock prices, however, declined by more than 10%. Earnings increased significantly as a result of the strong volume growth.</p>
          <p>Nondeductible oil taxes included in earnings of &#x20AC;209 million were approximately on last year's level. Net income after minority interest, however, declined by &#x20AC;33 million to &#x20AC;148 million due to minority interests of &#x20AC;47 million versus minus 13 in the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>And now to other. Sales in other increased by 32% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the excellent performance of styrenics. Demand for styrenic polymers was high in all regions, particularly in Europe. Commodities, as well as specialty copolymers, were in tight supply. Earnings in other amounted to minus &#x20AC;301 million. We increased earnings of styrenics, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Earnings in fertilizers, on the other hand, decreased sharply.</p>
          <p>In addition, earnings in other include higher provisions for BASF option program. Our stock outperformed all major sector benchmarks. Currency losses recorded in other, predominantly due to hedging of future sales, were approximately &#x20AC;40 million in the second quarter reflecting the weaker euro. No further hedging losses were incurred in the segment and you understand our, I think, hedging policy.</p>
          <p>Special items in other, mainly provisions for planned restructuring measures, amounts to &#x20AC;106 million.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to talk about the cash flow. In the first half of 2010, we generated a cash flow from operating activities of &#x20AC;2.7 billion, but we think a very satisfying result given our strong sales growth. Consequently, cash tied up in net working capital increased to &#x20AC;1.4 billion, thereof &#x20AC;1 billion were already spent in Q1. We, nevertheless, continue to reduce our days of inventories and sales outstanding.</p>
          <p>Cash used in investing activities amounted to minus &#x20AC;600 million. Last year figures of minus &#x20AC;2.9 billion reflect, obviously, the Ciba acquisition.</p>
          <p>And finally our balance sheet. The significant appreciation of many currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar against the euro, inflated our asset base by roughly &#x20AC;3.8 billion since the beginning of this year. The biggest currency related increases are fixed assets, which went up by almost &#x20AC;1 billion, inventories by about &#x20AC;500 million and accounts receivable by about &#x20AC;700 million.</p>
          <p>Due to the improved business environment, inventories and accounts receivable increased. Currency adjusted they grew by &#x20AC;2.4 billion to roughly &#x20AC;18 billion since the beginning of 2010. Net debt climbed by 500 million to &#x20AC;13.5 billion as a result of the dividend payment.</p>
          <p>At 35% our equity ratio is very solid. Financing conditions for BASF remain very attractive. We have not observed any significant changes following our announcement to acquire Cognis.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand over to John Feldmann, who will give you an update on this acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kurt. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. On June 23, we announced that we had reached agreement to acquire Cognis. With the acquisition we pursue clear objectives. We want to achieve a leading global position in personal care ingredients and strengthen our leading position in home care. We will significantly expand our nutrition and health activities.</p>
          <p>On top, we will become a major supplier of products based on renewable raw materials. And finally, we are also strengthening our formulation and application expertise. Our target is to outpace growth in the relevant markets by at least two percentage points and achieve an EBITDA margin of at least 20% in the performance products segment by 2012. We expect the acquisition already to be earnings accretive by 2012.</p>
          <p>We will integrate the Cognis businesses into our performance products segment. We currently estimate integration costs between 200 and &#x20AC;250 million by the end of 2012, and want to achieve cost synergies amounting to at least 5% of the 2009 sales by 2013.</p>
          <p>The detailed integration plan can only be developed after an in depth analysis with the acquired businesses, which we will conduct in a strategic dialogue with our new colleagues from Cognis. However, before we can proceed we need the consent of the antitrust authorities in the various countries, which we hope to receive by November this year. Nevertheless, we are currently initiating the first steps to ensure that the organization is prepared to take on about 5,500 employees and 2.6 billion euros in additional business activities.</p>
          <p>We decided to split up our existing chemicals operating division into two new divisions. Effective August 1, the nutrition ingredients, aroma chemicals and pharma ingredients and services businesses will form the new division nutrition and health. Our personal care, hygiene, home care and industrial formulators businesses will makeup the care chemicals division. The respective Cognis segments, health and nutrition and care chemicals, will later be integrated into these two divisions.</p>
          <p>The Cognis product offerings for minings, synthetic lubricants, coatings and crop protection also ideally complete our portfolio. These product lines will be integrated into our performance chemicals, dispersion and pigments, and care chemicals divisions. All these divisions will then be able to offer their customers an even more attractive portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the coming months, together with our colleagues from Cognis, we will work out the details of the integration plan. The worldwide Cognis team has done an excellent job and was very successful in recent years. And together, we are looking forward to forming the best team in the industry.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand it back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Let me conclude with the outlook for 2010. We expect that the economic recovery will continue at a moderate pace in the second half of 2010. Consequently, we updated our expectations for economic indicators in 2010. We now project global chemical production, excluding pharma, to increase by 7 to 8%, up from 5.3%.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2010, we left the average oil price assumption unchanged, which means USD $75 per barrel, and reduced the average dollar euro exchange rate from 1.40 to $1.30 per euro. We expect BASF's sales growth to outpace global chemical production growth in 2010. We anticipate that income from operations before special items will improve considerably, and we will earn a premium on our cost of capital. And finally, we expect to increase the dividend.</p>
          <p>And with this, we open up the floor for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to invite you to ask your questions to all three gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> So with this, we would like to start with Norbert Barth from WestLB. Good afternoon, Norbert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon. Dr. Hambrecht, one question regarding capacity situation. And also what you would say more, when the situation still was a little bit more dark, that in the overall industry there's overcapacity in the market. Now it looks, as market recovered stronger than expected, that perhaps that is not anymore such the case. And you also mentioned that there is still some shortage in some product lines. So can you elaborate a little bit on that? How you see that now onwards perhaps still see some overcapacities from the capacity side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Norbert. Let me answer this in more general, because others might have the same question. I would say we have split picture here, and this is developing going forward, especially on the cracker side. We will have ethylene and propylene in surplus because of new crackers in Asia and the Middle East, additional capacity coming into the markets. This applies certainly also propylidene polypropylene. We will see it in EO, and MHE. We will see it in PO. We will see it in styrene, partly still for MDI, but this is considerably improving.</p>
          <p>Now if we switch over to those who are more tight, already tight, to start with PDO, which will improve a little bit the situation because additional capacity comes on soon, acrylics short. TDI at this very moment not so short but getting shorter as season picks up towards the end of the year. Adipic acid, nylon 66, added value chain, very, very short, capital as well. Also C4 is also short. So all in all, just reflecting our major product lines now, I would say this is a mixed bag. Capacity utilization is not yet where it has been in general terms before the crisis, but in some product lines very short, also because discipline is still there and closed-down facilities are not coming back on stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Andreas Heine, UniCredit. Good afternoon, Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question regarding the performance in North America. It was strongly up Q-on-Q, was that only on the petrochemical side? And maybe one remark also on what you said, a moderate growth in the second half of 2010. What do you mean by this? Sequentially? So from the first half ongoing growth, or is it a moderate growth compared to last year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me pick up the last question first, Andreas. What I really mean is both. It will be moderate growth compared to last year, the quarters, because there we &#x2013; overall performance and you remember where that was from quarter-to-quarter it improved. That was still the growth rate, the relative growth rate going forward certainly will come down. Not any longer with this very high growth rate. And this supply, certainly, if you look back to the first quarter sequentially going forward, the growth rates will diminish. This is what we understand under moderate growth. And with this I hand over to Kurt with regard to North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>North America, I think it's across the board, with one exception which is really Ag. In Ag we saw declining profitability and we spoke about the reasons for that. What you see in the second quarter is basically what we expected earlier this year in which we communicated, fixed cost under control still down, volumes recovering, margins okay and with that you normally see a nice production and profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was very gratifying, by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is coming from Neil Tyler from J.P. Morgan. Good afternoon, Neil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. A question on the performance products business. John, at your presentation in London you mentioned that the conversations with customers were not including any sort of conversation about price because of the urgency with which the customers were needing deliveries. I wonder if you could give us, perhaps, your latest thoughts on whether that's still the case? Because I think at the time you mentioned that you didn't expect it to continue indefinitely. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, also in the performance products segments we have some product areas which are extremely short. This is particularly true for those product lines which require long, long multistep synthesis process. Particularly pigments are very short on supply. And therefore, the debate there is still about availability of products rather than the extra price situation. Something similar is true for our acrylic acid value chain. Polymers based on acrylic acid, also some products for detergents, are relatively short. We don't see this easing up immediately, but in the mid-term it will certainly ease a little bit and we will be then back on the pricing front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, thank you. Very helpful.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Maggie. Thanks for taking my question. It's on oil and gas. If I understood Dr. Bock correctly, the magnitude of the 10% EBIT decline in exploration reduction was due to Libya, yet the non-deductible oil tax is flat. If I try to reconcile that, then, it is not only Libya but also business in Germany, North Sea, Russia that has declined. Could you tell us whether you were able to sell any contract gas at all in the second quarter? And whether you think you can get that contract, that lost contract volume back? Or whether you will? Or gas formula has to renegotiate that lost EBIT that I think you have incurred in the second quarter? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Thomas. I think those were two questions. One is really about the profitability of our E&amp;P business. We suffered in Libya because we have restrictions, and that has a direct impact on our bottom line. And it's not really reflected in the non-compensable oil taxes because that is not a linear function of the oil price. You have to be very careful here. On top of that, obviously with the natural gas price being relatively weak, we also had lower earnings in the gas exploration business. This also has an effect. All the other oil exploration activities or production areas, which we have Europe, you mentioned the North Sea, have done very well.</p>
          <p>The second question was really about could we sell any gas at contract price? Yeah. Absolutely, because it's the backbone of our business and it continues to be in the future as well. The spot share has increased and we mentioned in our report there is continuing price pressure in natural gas. Although, we have to say that &#x2013; and you follow this closely &#x2013; that the gap between the spot price and the contract price in Europe has narrowed over the last couple of months. The spot price has gone up and almost cut through the contract price. So I think it's a very dynamic development, and it's very difficult to make here long-lasting predictions about the price gap between spot and contract. I would be very careful with regard to that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Just as a follow-up question on the shortages and, in particular, the very tight supply market in acrylics and in polyamide 66 you mentioned. My understanding was that it has been created by a number of plant turnaround or exceptional starts in some plants in this market. Do you think the situation could ease into H2? Or do you see, going forward, further shortage situation, a very tight situation into H2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Matthias. Very generally speaking for all the product lines, shortage will continue into the second half. Also there will be some release in nylon 6, and maybe even part of acrylics. Still the question is out whether all capacity which is in place is able to deliver. And this has certainly created a shortage, which is going beyond the normal supply situation. And this will continue most probably. All in all, I would say this is a rather reasonable our perspective.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It's on what you're seeing in China at the moment across your chemical businesses. The context being some of the price declines we're seeing in commodity markets and some evidence of destocking. I wonder whether you could tell us what you're seeing in your businesses in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie, this is a mixed bag. As I talked early on, on let me say capacity and demand balance, this certainly applies in the micro context also to China. You are right. If we look into the cracker situation there, this is the weakest spot in the world at this very moment as we have on top capacity coming in Ningbo and in Singapore, and not to speak about the Middle East. So C2 is long, C3 is more reasonable, C4 is &#x2013; also in Asia &#x2013; basically short, but less short compared to the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>If we look then into other product lines, I have to say this is rather balanced at this very moment. Concerning stocks, speculation always starts in China and the speculation is now towards no contango on oil price any more. No increase in basic raw material prices. Be careful going forward. And this is why they are looking into their stocks in certain product lines and we will see how this continues in the near future. But I'm still confident because growth in China will continue also on a lower level compared to the first and second quarter, most probably around 10%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Two questions. Where geographically in E&amp;P do you expect to be growing production over the next 18 months, if you can pick out sort of the key fields? Second question is much more straightforward. Depreciation and amortization, there seems to have been a big sequential decline in Q2. I mean, frankly, always seems to jump around quite a lot from quarter-to-quarter. I just wondered if you could give some guidance on the full year and also why you saw that sequential decline? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think I will take both questions, Andrew. Key fields, I think we don't really give indications about key fields. We talk about regions where we operate. As you know, we acquired, about 18 months ago, a business activity in Norway. That has developed very nicely. We just recently announced a second finding a couple of weeks ago. So that is &#x2013; those are very good prospects and these fields will be developed over time and will yield positive results for BASF. We have, in Russia, almost achieved our peak production level. There's still some way to go in one field. And in Libya, as we mentioned, we are still restricted by the OPEC restrictions. And as soon as those are lifted, we would also see a recovery of our volumes in that area. Apart from that, I would really direct you to our fact book, which gives you a very good overview of the areas where we operate and where we try to find additional oil and gas reserves.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and investment, first of all, investments came kind of down compared with last year. CapEx, that is a result, obviously, of the crisis in 2009, when we really cut back a little bit on investment or delayed certain investments, Andrew. You'll probably see this also throughout the third and fourth quarter of this year. If I see it correctly, depreciation levels in Q1 and Q2 have been stable and virtually unchanged. That is pretty much a given number, which you can then take Y2 for the second half of this year. I hope this will answer your question.</p>

          <p>It also reflects a little bit growth going into the future. You can be sure that as we go forward in our portfolio shift, and I said this already in the last discussion we had with you, that we are more and more focusing on R&amp;D and less so on CapEx, because downstream activities are much less CapEx intense. And this you need to take into your consideration as we go forward.</p>

          <p>Now I would like to ask Mutlu Gundogan from The Royal Bank of Scotland to please ask his question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, everyone. One question from my side. On the outlook of moderate pace in economic recovery, is that supported by the ordering pattern of the clients? What are you seeing there? Are clients getting more? Are they ordering more often? Are they ordering more per order? What are you seeing there? And also, could you also talk about restocking that you've seen in the past? Has that come to an end? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mutlu. To the first question with regard to the moderate growth, I think, coming back to what I said earlier and complementing to this, you all need to take in considerations the base effect for us. Second, and this is related to your second question, restocking has and is playing a role. It'll come to an end. How much is it? Difficult to say. I have only a few figures of channel consideration. For example, in North America for the entire production industry, the impact on the close, and this translates in GDP terms, have been in the crisis minus 0.8 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Now going up in the first half of this year in North America, this was plus 0.4. Now the question is, is it going further? North America is losing a little bit of momentum, we will have to see. But all-in-all, I would say restocking is almost completed, it will continue a little bit but not much. Especially looking into the tight supply chains, John has talked about a little bit and we talked about earlier, there is still a need to replenish the inventory.</p>
          <p>Then coming back to the moderate growth, I think going forward we need to look into what is going to happen with stimulus package consequences fading out; and second one, public debt and the reduced spending which will occur in Europe. It's not going to occur immediately, it comes step-by-step, and it will have an impact. This is why we need to talk about more moderate costs going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking my question. We've heard from a couple of people and a few questions here that several product, C3 and C4 products in polymers remain quite tight, so pricing looks like it's going to remain very stable in Q3. So that means we've had like five, six months of fairly elevated prices. Then my thinking is that that might be extended for a couple of months as the competitive assets come back and stocks are restored. So does that mean then as we go into 2011, there's a risk of negative pricing effects, there's year-on-year effect on revenues? Could you give us a bit of feeling in terms of whether that's risk and whether should we &#x2013; how we should consider that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

It's just really too early. Looking into what can be done from a capacity point of view, there is a little bit, but not too much.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a very short-term question on the so-called summer dip. What is your current assessment of the magnitude of the summer dip? Are you seeing any at all or is it in the usual magnitude? What's your view with regard to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the summer dip usually is overestimated, generally speaking. But of course we have summer holidays in Europe and everyone knows that France is closed down for four weeks and Italy is closed down for four weeks. And this is reflected in the automotive industry, partly we have it in furniture industry. A typical example, let's talk about China, the season in the summer is weak if it comes to furniture and bedding and only coming back towards the end of the year. Now, yeah, we have a little bit of weaker months in second half of July and August, but overall we do not see a real summer dip.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a quick question. There was a lot to read about some potential difficulties that foreign investors face in China and there were some remarks also from BASF there. First of all, could you give us some insight how severe this really affects you as maybe as I see one of the premier partners of China in terms of direct investment? And secondly, has there been &#x2013; following these remarks, has there been any significant change in attitudes yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Stephan, first of all, I was basically named here as one of the front runners. I did this for the German entity, not for BASF to make this very clear to start with. Now there are potential difficulties, which always have in there and we always have talked about those, which is intellectual property, loss disclosure, off design and so forth; counterfeiting is a big issue, 70% of counterfeiting is happening in China, very clear. This all-in-all has no direct impact on our investments at all. We continue to invest in China for the Chinese market. We will do so going forward with the enlargement of Nanjing, with the investment in Jianjing, et cetera. Has there been a change in China? Yes, it has been. There is constant improvement and there is, let me say, one point where we need to watch out. You may not be aware of that in China in 2008, more than 600,000 patent applications have been made. Just to compare this with Europe entirely, 150,000. And this figure is going up though everyone who wants to invest in China will get a good advice if he looks into freedom to operate. Now China has turned intellectual property issue around because they have realized that this is a real value, they need to protect and they are starting to do so, although execution entirely in China might be not as long as this very movement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the tax rate, it looks that you're getting less affected from the oil taxes in Libya. So assuming oil production as well as oil price in the second half to remain on par with the first half, is it fair to assume that the reported tax rate, which was 32.5% in the first half, is a good proxy for the full year and thus means well below consensus which is going to be around 39%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we haven't really changed our estimation of the underlying tax rate, which is about 25%. And if you take all the non-compensable oil tax issue, really arrive at that number precisely. What is important in the first and second quarter obviously is our business mix, the share of chemical income is much, much higher than in the first half of 2009. And actually it was almost 50-50 and now it's about 25% earnings at a net income level, 20% net income level, which comes from oil and 80%, roughly 80% coming from the non-oil activities and that is a major, major factor influencing our underlying tax rate. And obviously, any projection needs them to make an approximation of the business mix in, let's say, 2010 and 2011. If you want to look at non-compensable oil taxes, it's probably a good estimate to assume that they will be slightly higher in the second half of 2010 than in the first half of 2010.</p>

          <p>Now I would like to ask Jaideep Pandya from Berenberg Bank for his question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. Basically, two questions. First is, in terms of businesses across the board, which are the areas of concern going forward in the sense that where you've seen a massive restocking and where we could see demand coming down, especially in Q4 2010. And the second question is, what are you seeing in terms of basic raw material prices, because fundamentally this has been fairly stable and would like to know what is the outlook on that front? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pandya, let me take the two questions here and start with the second one, basic raw material prices starting with oil. I said this before, there is no contango anymore, so there is more slight movement at this very moment with slight increase. What we expect in the second half of the year is slight increase in raw material prices generally.</p>
          <p>Looking into concerns with regard to businesses and stocking and restocking, or let me say coming even to the point of starting de-stocking, the only point where we really see already inventory coming up a little bit is in automotive in China. There are companies who have too much stock. This is just the contrary in U.S. And in Europe, basically the same. So this is the more critical area. Then we have other concerns where our customer industries are in heavy restocking. I'm sorry, heavy restructuring, this is a payable industry in Europe and North America, growing basically only in Asia. The rest is shrinking still. And here we have very severe situation because paper prices are at their lowest, whereas raw material prices concerning pulp and chemicals are rather high. So here we have to say this is certainly somewhat of a concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you so much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now I would like to say hello to Lutz Gr&#xFC;ten from Kepler and ask him for his question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, which is on Ag chem. You've mentioned a declining demand for some fungicides due to high channel inventories. Has that worked out with the end of the second quarter, or do you expect further inventories coming to the market here in the third half and what's your &#x2013; third quarter? And what's your price assumption for the fungicides in the U.S. please in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our goal was really to work ourselves out of this inventory situation during the first half of 2010, and I think we have achieved that to the extent possible. The fungicide business actually in the second half of this year on the Northern Hemisphere is coming down. So it doesn't really have any significant role to play for sales or earnings, but I think the &#x2013; to answer your question briefly, I think the channel effect, inventory effect has come to an end by the end of the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we come to Martin Evans from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Just one quick question on catalysts, where you point out it made a significant contribution to earnings in Q2. I'm assuming that essentially is connected with the automotive rebound and the restocking for the industry. Are there any other trends on auto cats that have emerged in the second quarter, possibly in terms of the value of the catalyst or emissions legislation or any other heavy duty trends that we should be aware of? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Martin. You are correct with your assessment of our catalysts business. Earnings recovered because volumes in automotive went up. Although you have to keep in mind, we saw recovery. The absolute volume of the automotive industry is still well below pre-crisis level, especially in the developed countries. And in the developed countries, this is also important, because there you sell the bigger catalysts and the bigger the catalysts, the higher our profit. Obviously while in Asia, especially in China, we sell very well. We have a very high market share, probably the highest in the industry, but the catalysts per car obviously are much smaller and therefore less profitable.</p>
          <p>Underlying trends, I think I'm not aware of any major change in legislation which would affect us. The underlying trend is still that the developing countries are adopting stricter standards and this will drive actually the higher usage of catalysts and the other point is really heavy duty. These are catalysts which will be the growth area of the future and where right now the stakes are being distributed or being fought for. And I think we have a very good position to get a very nice share in that good growth segment, which is really driven by legislation.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now we move on with Peter Clark from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Good afternoon, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just a quick one, you alluded to in a lot of areas that stocks are probably about towards normalized levels or perhaps certainly had gone up a bit. But also in terms of the ordering pattern, because obviously before you'd been indicating that there's been a sort of just-in-time ordering pattern from customers. And you said if that continues, you'd have to look at your pricing mechanism. So really tying the two together, if inventories have gone back to normal levels in some areas, yet the ordering pattern remains that sort of hand-to-mouth-type pattern, are you looking at your pricing mechanisms in some of these businesses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take this one. Ordering pattern to be very straightforward, I think there has not been a major change in this area. It's still rather short. With regard to pricing mechanism, we are not going to change this, because value before volume certainly has driven us to the place we are. We have reduced our complexity of products and so forth and this has helped very much to make this more easy. Now we will continue with the overall approach we had in the last quarter into the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was actually inferring more that pricing mechanism would be pushing up, because I thought it was a more expensive way for you to serve this very short ordering pattern rather than the pricing pressure the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very simple, if customers ask on short term, what shall we do, we need to serve our customers. How they like it? And let me say in the best way, we certainly try to optimize. Though overall, I would say the overall pattern did not change significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now I would like to ask Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst for his question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I would like to ask a question on agro chemicals and Latin American pricing. Obviously we are looking now for the new season in Latin America. Is this season, let's say, de-coupled from the price pressure we have seen in North America? Or other to ask is, are you have purely let's say in historical prices what you had last season or any changes on the price debit in agro chemicals in Latin America?</p>
          <p>Second question is on exploration and production. Obviously with mixture of Russian gas and more gas, it's much more difficult to forecast price movements. Therefore I would like, if you could provide us volume and prices for exploration and production to get a little more clarity here? And perhaps I guess gas prices now have to go up. I'm not sure about the Russian ones. But overall, do you now believe we are at the low point here in your mixture in the gas prices? And will Q3 benefit from higher gas prices due to the lag? These are the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to try to answer starting with the last one. Let us think about this question or your request to get more detail on E&amp;P in terms of volume and price, I mean we have to think about that a little bit. As you know, we normally don't provide these kinds of data for businesses below the business segment. Gas prices have been bottomed out. That's always hard to predict. There's lot of volatility going on. Demand has recovered as we mentioned, also the LNG supply is still available, I would say that probably there is more upside potential than downside potential, put it that way. But I would predict that or forecast that there's certainly continuing volatility in pricing.</p>
          <p>Coming to Ag, is South America different from North America? Yeah, certainly in many, many ways. One difference is the crops, for instance sugarcane is very important. In South America, sugarcane has done relatively well, pricing this year is pretty strong compared with the other crops. We have weak soft commodity prices all over the place, with actually one exception, which was sugarcane, and we are very well positioned in sugarcane also with our insecticides. So I think we can take advantage of that situation for us. South America is very much a fungicide and insecticide area where we have good products available and we have done very well in Q2 and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to do so for the upcoming season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the price pressure you have seen in North America is not spreading to Latin America in fungicides and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these are regional markets and those markets are unrelated in terms of pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now we're working down our last three questions. The first one comes from Norbert Barth from WestLB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, again perhaps two short question. One is regarding your cash situation, so with the improving, do you rethink buying back shares? And perhaps the second question to Kurt Bock, perhaps you find it inappropriate, but I want to ask you, becoming the new CEO do you see a little bit &#x2013; or what will be your priorities and kind of strategy? Because some &#x2013; despite I think the team is clearly growing close together, but perhaps each person see it a little bit different from a different angle, point of view. So perhaps you can tell us something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert, here I have to step in. Cash. Cash is clear. What we are going to do, no share buyback for the time being and with regard to the strategy, Kurt will talk about this, let me say in second half of next year. This is still, and we are working together since many, many, many years. This is still the strategy which is going on, and you know exactly what we are doing, so this is not for discussion at this very moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So moving on with Neil Tyler from J.P. Morgan, and then we have the final question from Paul Walsh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello again. One more question, actually back to the Ag business and the margin development. You cited both price pressure and increased fixed costs. I see from the release, the R&amp;D has gone up by about 100 basis points as a percentage of sales. In terms of the rest of the 500 or so basis points of margin drop year-on-year, can you give some idea of how much of that was at the gross margin level and how much was your fixed cost inflation, and what the outlook for the SG&amp;A is in that business? Is that going to continue to inflate at the same rate? Or is that going to &#x2013; is that more a sort of phasing issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Neil, those are very decent questions. And we don't give that level of detail at the business level. When you look at our EBITDA margin for the first six months of 2010, they are a few percentage points below the level of 2009. We still foresee that the second half will do relatively well. Will we be able to achieve the EBITDA margin which we had, which was a record in 2009? Very hard to say. The market circumstances are quite challenging right now, and I think all of our competitors commented in that direction. So it needs to be seen. We have some flexibility as always in terms of the marketing and sales, selling costs and we are very, very cost conscious, as you can imagine. We will continue with our R&amp;D spend, that is really important to build our pipeline. But I'm not really in a position right now to give you a precise SG&amp;A margin for the, let's say 12 months of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with this we come to Paul Walsh for his final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking one more question from me. It's two parts please. In the gas distribution and trading business, I'm sure my analysis is wrong, but it looks to me like your year-on-year pricing is going to start to accelerate in terms of delta from the third quarter, given the way you compute your selling prices in the gas distribution and trading business. I wondered if you'd comment on that particular statement.</p>
          <p>And secondly, there's a very deliberate reference in your outlook to the fact that you're going to raise the dividend and you've just said buybacks are out of the question. How should we read into that in terms of the magnitude of increase in the dividend that we're likely to see this year, because you've done very large increases in previous years over the last five, and I wondered if we were just looking at an organic sort of nominal increase or something more meaningful like we got in 2006 and '07 I think it was? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take the last one, make it very simple. This is a decision to be taken by the supervisory board, but what we can tell you and we always said is we are going to increase the dividend as we earn premium on cost of capital. And it certainly depends on the premium level. So I cannot give you here any further guidance than that. Now we had the first question, I really have to say, Paul, I really didn't get your question, because it was &#x2013; somehow maybe it's the weather outside here, we have thunderstorms, so maybe this is the reason we didn't get it. But I didn't understand your first question, I only got that this is interrelated with gas trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the gas distribution and trading business, it looks according to my analysis, which of course could be wrong that your selling prices will show a meaningful increase year-on-year from the third quarter based on how you compute your selling prices in gas distribution and trading. And I was wondering if you could make a comment on that, that your selling prices in the gas distribution and trading business will start to increase or accelerate year-on-year from Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's a very good assessment, yeah, absolutely. Now the real issue is, is you're just looking to quarter-by-quarter pricing of oil last year and there is still major part is contracted. So it's very clear that the gas price will go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24">
        <plist>
          <p>So with this actually we have come to the end. We hope that we have answered all your questions successfully. And before we close, however, I would like to focus your attention on one point. We would like to invite you to our next event and that is coming up really fairly soon, namely it's our round table on agricultural solutions. This will take place in New York on 5th of August and then the following week in London on the 10th and in Frankfurt on the 12th. So we will update you there on the newest developments in plant biotechnology. Especially we can go in more detail with respect to the expansion of the collaboration with Monsanto, and then we will give you also an update on the first half-year performance of our crop protection business and the outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to our next reporting date, please pencil in October 28, 2010, then we will publish our third quarter results. And with this, we all would like to say thank you for joining us this afternoon. And should there be any leftover questions, which I don't think there are, but if there are, then please contact any member of the IR team and we will be very happy to help you. So with this, have a good afternoon and goodbye.</p>
