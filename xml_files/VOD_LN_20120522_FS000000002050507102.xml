          <p>Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining us for the presentation of our yearly results. Next?  Thank you for joining. Next? Is this the one I have to &#x2013; yeah, okay. Good. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. Okay, good. So, somebody will have to follow.</p>
          <p>Today we'll follow a slightly different order. I will give you the highlights for 2011/2012, then Andy will do the whole financial review for the year. Andy will be followed by Steve Pusey who is going to talk about technology and what we are doing to delivering our super mobile strategy. And then I will come back with some comments and remarks about our commercial strategy. And then as usual we'll be joined by Andy, Steve, Nick and Michel for your questions. Can you please move to the next slide? And may I also suggest that somebody comes here and takes care of this and we replace it?</p>
          <p>Highlights of 2011/2012. Group organic service revenue grew 1.5% in the year. 2.3% in Q4. We are outperforming major competitors in most key markets, meeting our guidance. Adjusted operating profit at &#xA3;11.5 billion and free cash flow at &#xA3;6.1 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know, Verizon Wireless have paid $10 billion of dividends, &#xA3;2.9 billion was our share. We have distributed that to a special dividend. The board has resolved for a final dividend increase of 7%, 6.47 pence per share. If you add the special dividend of 4 pence, the increase versus the previous year is about 52%.</p>
          <p>We have completed &#xA3;3.6 billion of the share buyback. Of the total program of &#xA3;6.8 billion, we are now at 91%. And as I said, I will make a few comments about the progress in our commercial and strategic delivery after Andy's financial review and Steve's network commentary. Andy? Good luck with that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good morning, everybody. Let's see if we can have any more luck with the slides. So, let me just start off then with sort of key numbers here. So, &#xA3;42.9 billion of service revenue for the year. That is an increase, as Vittorio said, it's 1.5% for the full year in total. EBITDA at &#xA3;14.5 billion, just fractionally down, 0.6 percentage points down on a like-for-like basis compared with the previous year.</p>
          <p>The margin continues to reduce. So the reported margin was down by 0.8%. We took some restructuring charges, without which the margin would have come down by 0.6%, which is about half the rate of decline of the previous year, so very much as we had planned. And the adjusted operating profit at &#xA3;11.5 billion, if you adjust out for the disposal of SFR, that is on like-for-like basis a 2.5 percentage point increase compared with the previous year. And actually that &#xA3;11.5 billion number, if we restate that on the same basis with FX as we did the original guidance that is &#xA3;11.8 billion, i.e., the very, very top of the guidance range that we gave at this time last year.</p>
          <p>Let me then move on to the lower half of the P&amp;L. So, first of all, financing costs are up year-on-year. I have got a slide later on this, but broadly speaking, two factors in that. One is the decision to fix more of our interest rates and the other is some credits in the prior year that are not recurring.</p>
          <p>Tax at &#xA3;2.3 billion is broadly similar to the previous year. The effective tax rate was 25.3%, so just slightly up on the previous year. And that is primarily due to the increase of the mix of the profits from the U.S., which is a higher-taxed territory. We have then the gain in the middle on the disposal of the SFR stake, so a &#xA3;3.4 billion gain. And we have taken additional impairment charges in the second half of the year for Italy and Spain and Portugal which, in addition to Greece in the first half, brings the total impairment costs up to just over &#xA3;4 billion.</p>
          <p>The earnings per share was 14.91 pence, which is down 11% on last year. But remember, 8% of the 11% is because we have disposed of businesses, so there underlying it's 3% and, put simply, that is down exclusively to the decision to fix more of the interest costs.</p>
          <p>The dividend we have increased by 7%, as Vittorio said, in line with our commitment. And that gives us a full year 9.52 pence prior to the 4 pence of the special dividend, so 13.52 pence for the year in total, a 52% increase year-on-year. And free cash flow, which again I'll go into in a bit more detail, at &#xA3;6.1 billion is in our guidance range for the year, lower than last year because if you recollect last year, we were in the final stages of our working capital program which gave us about &#xA3;1 billion of benefit last year but did not recur again in 2011/2012.</p>
          <p>So, moving then on to the high-level walk of the previous year's service revenues with last year. So, we started the previous year was &#xA3;42.7 billion and this year was &#xA3;42.9 billion. I'll go across the page, the second column here in gray, the effects of regulation, again, significant, &#xA3;0.9 billion of drag from regulatory front. But the good news as you go across is the data again has grown more than offsetting the reduction in voice. So, the data revenues for the group were up by 22% at &#xA3;6.2 billion. And then &#x2013; and I've got the separate slides on each of these, messaging revenues were up year-on-year, the fixed revenues were up, wholesale revenues were up and the FX clearly has slightly reduced the final number, &#xA3;42.9 billion is the number for the year.</p>
          <p>Now, if I look at that in terms of the pre and post-MTR rates, we have got here the sequential quarterly growth rates in gray, this is the reported numbers. In red is the numbers before the MTR rate cuts. And I guess the first comment here is in Q4, the most recent quarter, roughly 1% of that growth is because we have an extra day because of the leap year. But, nonetheless, a good fourth quarter for the year. The overall impact of MTR cuts has been about 2.2 percentage points for the year as a whole. And broadly, we expect that to be similar for the year that we are now in.</p>
          <p>So let me just go across then and look at one or two of the areas of focus. So, first of all, data. On the left-hand side of the chart here, the data revenues, as I said, were up 22%, &#xA3;6.2 billion for the year. So good progress here, particularly driven by mobile internet. Mobile internet revenues up 48% year-on-year, 107 million users of data across the group. The 27% on the bottom left-hand chart here, 27% of our European customers have now got smartphones, which is up 8 percentage points on the year before, which itself was up 8 percentage points on the year before that. And roughly 60% of the customers who have smartphones have got data price plans with us.</p>
          <p>In Europe, of our postpay consumer base, about 43% of our revenues are now coming from customers with integrated tariff plans. On the right-hand side, we've got messaging. So, we saw slight reductions in overall volumes of messages in Spain and the Netherlands and we had regulatory caps in India. But notwithstanding that, the overall volume of demand for messages remained very strong, 11% growth in messages across the group, and overall increase in revenues for messaging up 4.4%.</p>
          <p>Moving then on to enterprise and fixed, two of the other areas of focus. Both of these actually got similar growth rates to the year previous. So on the top here in red, the enterprise revenues across the group grew by 2.2% and are now &#xA3;9.9 billion. Enterprise revenues now comprise about 23% of the revenues of the total group, or in Europe, they represent about 30% of the European revenues. So the general theme here was fairly aggressive on pricing but very, very strong growth, particularly from the Vodafone Global Enterprise unit, the big multinational accounts where we actually saw revenues up by 11%, primarily by greater account penetration.</p>
          <p>On the bottom left, then, we have the fixed revenues, which grew by 5.4%. Again, similar to the previous year. We've now got 6.4 million broadband users. And our One Net product, we have taken that up from 1.3 million customers to 2 million during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Just stepping back, then, the 1.5% of the overall growth in service revenues, not surprisingly, the story here is strong growth in emerging markets, good, solid performance in Northern European markets and weaker performance in the Southern European markets. So, on the left you can see the stars, if you like, the Ghanas, Turkeys and Indias, in roughly the 20% to 30% range. And on the right you can see Greece, Spain and Australia, which all struggled more, albeit for slightly different reasons. Not that it is on this chart, but just for relevance, I think if Verizon Wireless were on here, being 40% or so of our net worth, that's 7.3% growth that would actually come in as the fourth highest growth business and the biggest single one if, of course, we counted its numbers in our revenues.</p>
          <p>So just in terms of quick comments on individual countries and I'll go through these reasonably fast, Vittorio will comment upon some of these in a minute. But top left here is Germany. I think the headline is regaining revenue market share in the German market, which is good. We saw the fourth quarter revenues grow by 4%, both before and after MTRs. We had data revenue growth in Germany of about 18% and a major continuing push on enterprise, where we saw revenues grow by 8.2%. We have now built out LTE network that covers about a third of the population, which Steve will talk to shortly.</p>
          <p>On the top right then, on the UK, I think the best description of the market overall is probably the word fragile. I think the performance of our business has been very good. 1%, 1.1% reported growth, 4.5% but for MTRs, data slowing slightly as we have the lapping effect from the previous year, but a big focus on improving the mix of the customers progressively towards contract and we now have 69% of the consumer contract revenues in the UK coming from customers on integrated tariffs.</p>
          <p>On the bottom left, Italy, a more difficult macro environment, a 4% reduction in revenues. It would have been about half that but for the MTRs, big push on data, 14% up. Mobile internet was actually up 76% in those numbers. Enterprise was up 5.8 percentage points, so I think doing well against a difficult background.</p>
          <p>And then finally on this slide in Spain, where, again, the macro environment remains very challenging, a 9% reduction in the revenues there. I think doing well against our main competitor, but nonetheless, the overall market is pretty difficult. And I guess the key change there more recently has been in the dynamics with regards to customer acquisition and subsidies, which is early stages but clearly a step in a helpful direction.</p>
          <p>So, let me move then on to the AMAP region. India here on the top left. Very, very strong year from our Indian business. Revenue growth there last quarter, 21%, but pretty much 20% for the year as a whole. We have seen prices stabilizing in the market. Actually, the ARPU for our business there went up by 4.8%. We now have 150 million customers. And in revenue terms, India has now moved into fifth place in the group, having knocked Spain off the perch. We have seen a continuation of the trend ever since we bought the business of increasing revenue market share. And broadly, I think the operational side is really very positive. Separate that a little bit from some tax issues, but the operational side is very positive.</p>
          <p>And Australia then on the bottom left here. The numbers, I think, belie the fact that there is some impact from MTRs, so 4 percentage points of extra drag from the MTRs, otherwise actually the trend might be starting to pick up a bit. Clearly, taking some time to get the brand perception improved. Steve will talk in a minute about some of the things that we have been doing on the network and I think good progress that is being made there. We have announced the strategic agreement with Optus, which I think again, is an important step forward and, as Vittorio will mention, some management changes as well in our Australian business.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, on this chart, Egypt, I think a very good story here. So this is a year on from the revolution. We have seen the like-for-like quarter grow by over 7%. We have particularly been strong against the number two operator in Egypt. Data revenues are up by 53%, and I think the business there actually is in very good shape and pulling through what has been a very difficult period for the country very commendably.</p>
          <p>So let me change track a little bit and talk about margins. I said earlier on that the reported margin is 0.8% lower than a year ago. The top chart here shows how it has changed by country and the bottom chart shows how it has changed by, in essence, the cost driver. So if you just look at the top chart, you can see there the 32% the prior year. And essentially the 0.8%, really, Spain and Germany in some respects are the total, albeit Germany is almost exclusively because we took some restructuring charges. The rest are net neutral. Put another way, Australia actually took the margin down by 0.2% on its own; some restructuring was 0.2%, so the underlying excluding those is around the sort of 0.5% level.</p>
          <p>If you look at it by cost driver, not surprisingly, that was primarily about continuing investment in smartphones and some extra commercial costs that came with that, plus the restructuring. So, overall, I think the margin is very much on the trend line that we had foreseen. On paper the second half margins look a little bit weaker, but remember the impact of the restructuring charges was taken fully in the second half and that more or less accounts for the difference between the two years &#x2013; or the two half years.</p>
          <p>Now, let me just turn to a couple of different topics. On the cost side, operating expenses for the group two years ago, so this chart is taking a two-year period, &#xA3;10.7 billion. The focus we have had on costs has taken in the blue bar here, &#xA3;0.9 billion out of those costs, so that is about 8% for the group overall. In fact, the majority of the &#xA3;0.9 billion came from Europe alone, so we're taking about 12% out of the European cost base in a two-year period. Some of that in the green box has been reinvested, so we've had to do with inflation on wages and energy costs, we have got more network locations and we have invested selectively in new product areas. But the net of those two is we've taken about a third of &#xA3;1 billion out of the cost base. And then in AMAP, obviously, we have put more money in there to fuel the top-line growth in the AMAP markets.</p>
          <p>One of the other areas that personally I'm the most proud of is what we have actually been doing behind the scenes in terms of shared services and getting efficiency and cost reduction across the group. So five years ago, so a longer time interval now, we did not have any shared service centers. We have now got shared service centers in Egypt, in Hungary and two in India. We have now got 6,000 people who are based in those locations. We have completely changed out all of the finance procurement and HR systems across the group, we used to have 20 different ones; as of the 1 of April this year, we are now on one, we have now got 70,000 users on that system. And in procurement terms, which I'll come on to the next slide, that is giving us huge benefits.</p>
          <p>We have externally benchmarked the new shared service centers and they've gone straight in at the second quartile with an absolute ambition that we will get to first quartile by March 2014. But all of this is already on the run rate to take &#xA3;100 million out of our cost base and there is definitely more to come.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the supply chain off the back of that harmonization of systems and co-locating people. We have made, again, huge, huge progress in the supply chain area. So, we used to have 24 teams, separate teams, we are now at one team. We are managing somewhere around &#xA3;10 billion of spend. We have seen savings per supply chain employee rise 60% over that period of time. We have recently benchmarked externally and our savings that we're achieving through this team about 10% last year, that compares with a world-class standard, not an average standard, through external benchmarking at 6%. So, clearly, delivering much more benefit and, hence, the CapEx we are investing amongst other things, getting a lot more money for that. And you can see overall the increase in the cash benefits that we've got cumulatively over that period of time coming just shy of &#xA3;5 billion.</p>
          <p>So, Verizon Wireless, you will have seen through Verizon the numbers for Verizon Wireless. But just very, very high level, the last quarter the service revenue growth is 8.2%. It's been in a corridor of 7% to 8% now for actually several years. We have seen an increase in market share, a big push on smartphones like we're doing in Europe. The bottom left chart shows the margin that we are achieving in the Verizon Wireless business which is absolutely at the top end of the pack in the U.S. And, in fact, the last quarter put 4 percentage points on the margin.</p>
          <p>Top right is the debt level in the business notwithstanding the payment of the $10 billion payment out to the shareholders. We have now got the net debt again reducing and it is currently at &#xA3;6.4 billion. And then the overall spectrum rollout on the LTE is going very much on plan and nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population now covered. I think we put in a similar chart to this last time around. But just if we take Vodafone, and we take our proportionate share of Verizon Wireless and add the two together, then in service revenue growth terms, rather than being a 1.5% service revenue growth business, on this basis, the group is at 3.1% growth. If you take the EBITDA for Vodafone, &#xA3;14.5 billion and add our share of the Verizon Wireless, that takes you to over &#xA3;22 billion equivalent. And the same, albeit not on this chart, on free cash flow takes us over &#xA3;9 billion. And a number of areas that we are actively working with Verizon and Verizon Wireless are listed on the right.</p>
          <p>So on to financing costs, I said earlier that these have increased fair amount year-on-year. Let me sort of do this chart in reverse order. In the bottom half, you can see a number of items from last year which were sort of benefits to the interest line, so the SoftBank asset accretion, the China Mobile dividends, and capitalization of borrowing costs. In aggregate, about &#xA3;400 million that is essentially not recurring, hence, the truer comparison is really the middle line, &#xA3;1.6 billion applying the &#xA3;1.2 billion, and the vast majority of that is taking a conscious decision that we would lock in to fixed interest rates whilst they are low by historic standards, some mark-to-market costs as a result of that. But overall, including those, we have got an interest cost of about 5% for the year, which his roughly what we'd expect for the current year, and we've now got about 76% of our debt fixed over the next three-year period.</p>
          <p>In terms of free cash flow, I said earlier on, the &#xA3;6.1 billion, and that played &#xA3;7 billion last year. By far, the biggest single movement here is on the third line, on the working capital. So, if you'll recall, we had a two-year program to take money out of working capital and we had over that two-year period, we put about &#xA3;2 billion into the bank. That finished the year ago and, hence, we have not got the recurrence of that. The rest of the items here are net roughly neutral. So we spent a little bit more very deliberately on CapEx, very strong belief in driving for the data networks. We had lower cash tax costs and we had slightly lower dividend receipts. Overall, if you take that &#xA3;6.1 billion and you add the &#xA3;2.9 billion that we received by way of the cash dividend from Verizon Wireless, we actually received in the year &#xA3;9 billion.</p>
          <p>So, onto the balance sheet. I think our balance sheet is in good shape. We started the year &#xA3;29.9 billion of net debt, we have closed the year at &#xA3;24.4 billion, so a net reduction of about &#xA3;5 billion during the period. Quite a number of moving parts here. So, the &#xA3;6.1 billion of the free cash flow, disposal proceeds, primarily SFR and Polkomtel, contributed &#xA3;7.6 billion. The share buyback program that happened during the course of the year, &#xA3;3.6 billion, the Verizon income dividend &#xA3;2.9 billion coming in. Equity dividends out, &#xA3;4.6 billion for the standard dividend and &#xA3;2 billion for the special dividend.</p>
          <p>Spectrum, we've spent &#xA3;1.4 billion on spectrum, particularly in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, with a number of spectrum options store coming up. It has to be said. Then one or two smaller amounts down at the bottom. So &#xA3;24.4 billion was the closing net debt. Since the end of the year, we have received &#xA3;1.5 billion from the second tranche of the SoftBank proceeds, albeit we do have, as I said, a number of Spectrum auctions coming up in the relatively near term.</p>
          <p>So in terms of guidance against what we had said we would do last year, on adjusted operating profit this time last year, we said we expected it between &#xA3;11.0 billion and &#xA3;11.8 billion. At half year, we narrowed that to &#xA3;11.4 billion to &#xA3;11.8 billion. On a comparable basis, we hit the top of that range, &#xA3;11.8 billion.</p>
          <p>On the free cash flow, we were at &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion as a guidance range this time last year and at the half year, and on a comparable basis we've come in at &#xA3;6.2 billion, so middle of the range. The EBITDA margin we said we expected that to continue to decline which, as I said earlier, has been the case. And the overall level of CapEx, we expect it to be similar which again has proven to be the case. So I think against the guidance for last year, that is a firm set of <mark type="ph" /> green ticks (26:12).</p>
          <p>Now, more importantly, moving on the guidance for the year that we are now in, and what we've done here is just started off with a sort of simple table that says the published numbers on profit for last year, &#xA3;11.5 billion and cash &#xA3;6.1 billion. Do remember, however, we will not have a recurrence of the SFR dividend, et cetera. Therefore, on the free cash side, we need to say it &#xA3;0.2 billon out. And we have taken a view, particularly with recent movements in foreign exchange rates that we will guide on the basis of, in particular, &#x20AC;1.23 to the &#xA3;1, whereas last year's actual was &#x20AC;1.16 and that takes &#xA3;0.3 billion, &#xA3;0.4 billion out of the cash and the profit. So underlying, &#xA3;11.1 billion and &#xA3;5.6 billion were the comparable numbers from last year. We are guiding to &#xA3;11.1 billion to &#xA3;11.9 billion for the adjusted operating profit, i.e., we expect an increase and the free cash flow in the &#xA3;5.3 billion to &#xA3;5.8 billion range, i.e., stable free cash flows.</p>
          <p>We have said that for the service revenue, primarily because of the MTR effect, our previous guidance of the 1% to 4% range, we think we will fall slightly below the bottom of that range. And we'll do an update in a year's time on the subsequent year. We expect the margin trend to continue and we're still targeting to get that broadly stable by March 2014. And we have just for equivalents, showing what the medium-term free cash flow would be on the new guidance ranges.</p>
          <p>So bringing this towards the close, just a reminder on shareholder returns, we will, over a four-year period, have returned very, very nearly &#xA3;26 billion to our shareholders. The red is the basic dividend, the gray is the buybacks and the blue is the special dividend. We have committed to a 7% increase in the dividend for the final for last year and reiterated 7% for next year. The share buyback program continues and that should complete somewhere in the summer of this coming year.</p>
          <p>So in overview, I think a robust performance against a more difficult backdrop. Just key numbers for me, service revenues, up 1.5%, the margin trend is improving, as we said it would do, the adjusted operating profit is up 2.5%, &#xA3;6 billion, &#xA3;6.1 billion of cash flow generated, &#xA3;10.2 billion of cash returned to shareholders, net debt at the end of the year, 1.7 times EBITDA. We have updated the medium-term revenue guidance or updated the revenue guidance for next year and we have essentially said the underlying guidance for the 2012/2013 year will be an increase in adjusted operating profits and stable free cash flows.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I will hand over to Steve, who will talk to you about something different.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy, and good morning. What I'd like to do this morning is share with you how our technology investments are supporting our Supermobile vision and, in particular, to focus on two areas. Network, we do believe that the network is a sustainable differentiator and I will share with you how we're taking our market-leading data position to the very boundaries of our infrastructure. And also on IT, where we believe we can create an unmatched &#x2013; and support creating an unmatched customer experience are all touch points to Vodafone, which we also believe is a sustainable differentiator.</p>
          <p>So firstly on to the investments. You can see that we've kept a consistent level of investment in our assets through the last year, up slightly year-on-year, but with a particular focus in the last 12 months. If we look to Europe, our focus has moved particularly to those capabilities of online call centers, security, our platforms for the future, Machine-to-Machine and One Net to service that growth. We've invested quite significantly in the platforms for the future in billing and CRM to create a flexible platform for the data world that we face. And in our networks we've been quite aggressive in the transmission self-build, both improving the capability but reducing our reliance on third-party lease services. And in networks, we've now taken the data coverage in Europe to 89% of our footprint, something that we feel is very important, particularly for smartphones.</p>
          <p>In AMAP, it's a similar story, targeted investments. You can see with South Africa we've quite aggressively done a radio refresh there to the very latest technology, and that's been supported by a transmission build; again, reducing the reliance on other parties. In Australia, we had to correct the Australia infrastructure, so big investments in radio there as well as in the 850 megahertz spectrum, which has been vital for coverage and depth to address some of the issues, which are now overcome and we're now building for the future. And in India, although we've had a lower net site counts, we're very proud of the fact that that investment went into a first-class 3G network in India this year. We took the very best learnings from our European arena and we delivered a state-of-the-art 3G network in India that has won best network after we've completed its build.</p>
          <p>So to look at the drivers, and probably this is one of the most important factors for us in technology, clearly driven by data and clearly driven by data volumes, our traffic has gone up year-on-year about 35%. But the important message here as you can see that the mix has changed more aggressively away from mobile broadband and toward smartphones, LTE and wireless fixed replacement. That brings with it new challenges for us, particularly, we've invested in signaling to address the smartphone growth, which is we've just kept ahead of that phenomena. So we've had no impact on our customers.</p>
          <p>And regards capacity, we're still very comfortable with capacity. You can see from the bottom left graph there that in the busiest hour we're still running 8% maximum &#x2013; over 90% utilization figure. So that's a comfortable flow. Overall, on the footprint, we're still running at 36% busy hour utilization in our markets. And a second sort of reference on that is that in the spectrum, we're still only using 47% in Europe of our second carrier, which still, again, is a reference point to a capacity ability for the future. So we're still very comfortable with the capacity.</p>
          <p>If you move to the top right hand chart, one thing that we do monitor to give best performance to our customers is the performance that the smartphones can deliver and the tablets can deliver. The graph here depicts an accurate figure of our base. And you can see from the red column that 46% of our smartphones in use today are operating with a 7.2 modem. And in the next chart, I'll show you how we invest to keep the network performance ahead of that curve so that our customers can get the very best out of their smartphones by using the Vodafone network.</p>
          <p>And, lastly, we monitor on a weekly basis the throughput of those devices. What are customers doing and how do we need to evolve the network so that our customers can get the very best data service? You can see from the pie chart, it's dominated by streaming, usually video but quite often audio these days, and web activity, which means we have to invest in improvements in latency as well as net throughput speed.</p>
          <p>Now, where are we going with our investments in Supermobile? Firstly, coverage. We do feel that everybody will want ubiquitous coverage for data. So in the next couple of years, we will be extending our footprint of data coverage to at least 93%. In the big markets, it will be beyond that. This is the total average. We'll use 900 spectrum refarming in all of our markets to achieve a lot of this; it also has the added benefit of indoor coverage improved performance.</p>
          <p>And we've introduced in the bottom of that top left hand bar chart there, a new KPI that we thought might be interesting for you. We're trying to give a measure, moving away from more downlink speed to what is a measure of average performance that the individual can experience on the Vodafone network. So we picked this, how many data connections are experienced in 400 kilobits or better consistently. And that's really a proxy for good video experience. So today, 79% of our measurements are showing a connection above 400 kilobits, and it's obviously something that we'll be focused on improving quite aggressively through the next two years.</p>
          <p>If you move down to the bottom left hand graph, this is our network radio, and that matches up with the previous chart. You can see the majority of the handsets today are at 7.2  modems; 82% of our European network is already better in speed than 14.4 or better. And that's the wave that we keep pushing ahead on. You can see as it evolves towards 2015 that we'll move up through the HSDPA capabilities to HSDPA+ of 43 megabits, and that will keep us ahead of the projected capability of the devices in the market; again, targeting the very best experience on the Vodafone footprint.</p>
          <p>You can see in the purple bars an overlay. This is delivered through single RAN, 2G, 3G, 4G and 1 box of LTE. We say overlay because it will be some time before you proliferate exclusively the market with 4G devices, so customers will want the benefit of both services in many locations. And by 2015, we'll have at least 36% of our footprint on LTE.</p>
          <p>Top right hand corner. This is really important for a great service for the customers, high-speed backhaul. We denote high speed by a capability installed of 1 gigabit or better. Today, 41% of our European sites have that capability, we're aggressively upgrading that and in 2015 we'll have at least 74%. Also, we're pushing fibre deeper in the city centres. About 14% of our footprint has direct fibre connectivity to the sites today, we will be delivering small cells this year in our city centres and we feel it will be more economic to do that off of direct fibre connections to the sites.</p>
          <p>And lastly, LTE, we were one of the founding fathers of LTE in Vodafone with two of our colleagues in the industry. I'm pleased to share with you that it is delivering the step change that was promised for the customer. The figures on performance there are conservative figures. Our early customers on lighter-loaded networks were actually getting better than those performances, above the 12-megabit performance criteria.</p>
          <p>As Andy said, 35% of the households in Germany are covered. As you know, we had to do rural first as per the license, but we've now moved into urban coverage in mid-November, and we'll extend that through this year. We've also launched in Portugal very recently in the major cities, and that will be complemented by Italy and Spain before we get to 2013. In preparing the future, we're big believers in single RAN flexibility, so we will be keeping ahead of the LTE ready and switching on very quickly and very economically as spectrum dictates and we'll extend the single RAN to 80% of our footprint.</p>
          <p>On to IT, we believe we can deliver an unmatched customer experience. And that's not just by investing in the individual attributes, i.e., online, retail, call centers, et cetera. It's the interrelation between those assets so that any one of our support or sales agents can get full visibility of the customers' interest, activity or issues. And we believe we can delight customers by linking those assets together. So we will be investing more heavily to differentiate in that experience for our customers on all touch points. That will extend to the way we push product and pricing to marketplace; so bundling, flexible discounting, flexible charging for an internet world is paramount in our IT investments.</p>
          <p>And, lastly, the ability to exercise and release very rich network assets to third parties by releasing what's called application programming into phases or network capabilities, APIs to third parties, we think be a rich source of future opportunity. Today, that is manifested in charge-to-bill and third-party charging with our billing assets presented externally. We will invest more in this.</p>
          <p>Whilst this has been going on, we've quietly been transforming our technology assets over the last five years in a similar journey to Andy explained earlier. We have consolidated 14 regional data centers into five very large hubs, three in Europe, Africa and India. We have virtualized those hubs into creating the Vodafone Cloud. Europe and Africa is already completed this year. Well, very quickly, we'll be extending that to the Indian capability. The Vodafone Cloud is alive and it gives us very fast flexible speed of delivery as well as business continuity and resilience.</p>
          <p>It's on these platforms that we deliver the centralized services. Andy talked about the ERP system that we delivered, we could mention the Machine-to-Machine platforms, the One Net platforms. And even as we move forward, the consumer platforms, like joyn, that you can experience upstairs in the foyer.</p>
          <p>Security is very, very important. Security will grow as a challenge for our industry. We invested early in a blanket security umbrella, not just for our own company assets, but also, of course, to protect our customers' data. We created a centralized management center in Europe. But this extends to the full footprint of the Vodafone capability and assets. And lastly, for efficiency of management of all this estate, we created three shared service centers, one in Hungary, one in Egypt and one in India, to mostly economically manage these assets.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of the technology footprint, we feel that we've got a very, very solid base for future. We will maintain best network, we will extend data to everywhere that we had voice and we will keep ahead and give a special service for those smartphones and tablets of the future. We will create an unmatched customer experience by investing seamlessly across online, retail and customer care, and that will be delivered across the Vodafone Cloud. And, lastly, we've done all the major building blocks. We've quietly built a very strong, high capacity, robust, global IP infrastructure, a super highway, as it used to be called. We have built the Vodafone Cloud and we have built a best-in-class security infrastructure to protect our assets and our customers. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>So, what's the way ahead? I would like to wrap the financial and the operational comments of Steve and Andy into a more cohesive, strategic way ahead starting by 2008, 2012. What did we do and how do we do it and then moving into the priorities of those, we have to share some remarks about our organization.</p>
          <p>This is the original track that I illustrated to you in 2008 about the strategy of Vodafone. It was called The Stronger Vodafone. It had four pillars. It was talking about operational performance, delivering more minutes, more SMS, sweating the assets and leveraging on the scale. It was also about growth. In those days, we used to talk about bundling and DSL, growth engines, emerging markets delivery, not everybody was convinced that we would really deliver in emerging markets, and, of course, capital discipline and priorities for managing our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we moved again another original chart to something which we called A More Valuable Vodafone. Here, we were more precise in talking about leadership in three areas, more precise in indicating as engine of growth, data, enterprise, emerging markets. And, again, re-stressing efficiency scale and capital discipline. So the question for me is did we deliver and how did we do it in order to look into the future and see what we will do?</p>
          <p>Now, this chart tries to answer the question, did we deliver. On the left hand, you see the evolution of our market share over the four-year's period in some of our largest OpCos, Turkey, Italy, India, Spain, South Africa, UK. All of them went up. Germany went a little bit down over the four years. On the right hand side of the chart, you see the last quarter-on-quarter, so the more recent trend, which again, with South Africa stable, has all the other markets positive. So I think we can say, yes, we did deliver.</p>
          <p>How? The how is really &#x2013; and this is important because I'm often asked about what is the read across of our strategy implementation. I really think we delivered the implementation on our strategy on a group-wide basis, but also allowing for local implementation to identify the right priorities and for implementing what was relevant.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly go through some of the examples in the UK. In the UK, we are recovering EBITDA. Not yet where we were but clearly recovering. We have refocused on value, delivering very good performance on enterprise. Andy has indicated already the performance, reorganized the company and de-facto redesigned the way we approach the market.</p>
          <p>In Germany, again, similar &#x2013; some similar topics, enterprise leadership, very good performance in the year, 5.6%, more recent quarter even higher. The whole company has integrated Arcor which was a priority &#x2013; a specific priority there. And, as Steve has indicated, we have LTE leadership in Germany and in general in Europe in that space. So, recent quarter performance, 4%, as Andy had said.</p>
          <p>If we move to India. In those days, we said the national footprint is very improvement. We now have 110,000 sites, up from about 50. Market share went up to 21%. We are a clear number two, strong number two. Andy has said margins are also going up, slowly, but going up. So a success story mainly built through a network and branding locally managed.</p>
          <p>Vodacom was more about maintaining the leadership. We chose data and network distinction as the key vector for the strategy. It has been very successful, &#xA3;700 million of data leadership in the country. I have to say I'm also pleased of the international performance of Vodacom. Finally, Vodafone is growing 40% outside of South Africa and we have also managed a good brand integration without losing to the strength of local Vodacom but reaching a recognition of our broader brand and iconography which has now covered the whole of Africa.</p>
          <p>Italy. Leadership &#x2013; we just have got the leadership. We maintained the leadership. We are stable in a challenging environment. In Italy, clearly, we are leading in the consumer space, strong NPS, a lot of innovation in the data space. But I'm also happy to report very good performance in enterprise. Italy is our leading country for the One Net converged solution for businesses and a very solid &#x2013; we have a very solid distribution in the country.</p>
          <p>If you look at Spain, Spain is a more difficult case. Now, the good news here is we have not lost ground to the main competitor. Actually, if anything, we have gained a little bit in the period. But honestly, we have lost grounds together with the main competitor to the others. In Spain, we have made the deliberate choice of investing into lower prices and different commercial model. It shows in the declining EBITDA. It's very important that the new commercial model that we are trying to push through in Spain is successful in Spain, and hopefully also beyond.</p>
          <p>A few quick comments about the other markets, I don't need to go in the detail. Turkey is a great case, 29% market share, just reached them, stronger network, strong distribution, excellent implementation of the brand. We went from negative EBITDA to about &#xA3;270 million EBITDA there and a great brand execution.</p>
          <p>Netherlands. Netherlands has been, again, another good example of applying our data pricing philosophy early, almost a test bed for it. Now we have a 31% market share. EBITDA margin is back into the mid-30s. And we also are using the Netherlands as the test bed for our distribution &#x2013; new distribution model after the acquisition of Belco.</p>
          <p>Ghana. Ghana probably not the most value-creating acquisition that Vodafone has done in its history, but at least, a pretty good turnaround. It's an amazing case from number four to number two, very strong position. Record &#x2013; Andy has shown record growth of 30%. We are EBITDA breakeven in Ghana, including also the fixed line. So, again, a demonstration that we have a Vodafone way to approach emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And then, Australia, again, transparency, we have made integration mistakes. We have &#x2013; we're fixing them. We have a new very experienced COO there and we have a big inflow of Vodafone expertise into the market. We have fixed the market problems; we have a collapse in the complaints from the customers. I expect this to take some time, probably, 18 months, 24 months. But I think that from now on, there will be &#x2013; it will be another turnaround case.</p>
          <p>On the financial front, again, I don't need to go through the story. &#xA3;15 billion raised through disposals. Minorities investments sold in France, Poland, China and Japan. &#xA3;6.8 billion buyback. &#xA3;2.9 billion dividends received. So I believe our strategy works. It's a broad strategy. It covers all the countries. But beauty is that we have found the right balance, I believe, in global strategy and leveraging on our scale, but also allowing for prioritization done at the country level and investing the money where it really yields the better returns.</p>
          <p>So, where do we go from here? What's the strategy for 2015? The most important element of our strategy and here looks a bit theoretical, but it is not, is the Supermobile strategy. What's our main objective for Voda? What is the objective that I'm giving to my countries? It's clearly leadership in value share. Leadership in value share will require more differentiation I think for the industry, but for Vodafone specifically, increasing loyalty from the customers, sustaining the current ARPU and improving the AMPU, so the margin per customer.</p>
          <p>We have six elements and we'll cover quickly all of them. And some of them have already been covered by Steve. Clearly, network excellence is a tangible source of differentiation, second, healthy data pricing model, and we'll cover it, roaming and data services portfolio, not just products but also services, an easy, customer-friendly, state-of-the-art experience in dealing with the customers, industry benchmark retail evolving into a service model more than an acquisition model and a well-balanced choice of terminals.</p>
          <p>Now, on the network, I don't have to say a lot of things because Steve has already covered here the usual charts. Traffic keeps going up. We're about <mark type="ph" /> 60 peta (51:50) but very stable indicators in the lower part of the chart. How do we do it? It's first of all through investment, so we invest. 25% of our investment is just for managing capacity. Second, we clearly mesh different type of technologies. Steve has mentioned small cells, LTE, it's HSPA, it's everything that helps fibre, high-speed transmission, self-build, I mean, all the things that Steve mentioned to manage the growth. Some kind of active management of utilization, which really means discrimination across customers.</p>
          <p>But also most important, I always want to draw your attention to this. The trends in consumers are different. Smartphones are the really growing thing. And this is for an average usage of 200 MB, 300 MB per month. Tablets are becoming bigger, usages of an average of 400 MB, 500 MB per month. But data, mobile broadband data, which are actually going down, used to be at 1.5 GB, 1.3 GB, 1.2 GB per month. So, there is a rebalancing effect that we can accommodate and actively manage in our networks.</p>
          <p>Second element of the strategy, and this is really important, is pricing. And here we &#x2013; as I said, we used first the Netherlands and now, more actively, the UK, Spain and the other markets to really lead new pricing concept, integrated tariffs are for Vodafone now in contract consumer cover 43% of our revenues, up from 27% one year ago. This is a huge marketing effort, but this is I think what will really bring us in a much better place to increase then the average margin per customer. Of course, UK and the Netherlands are smartphones countries, higher numbers. The prepaid markets are following, but also in prepaid, we are making it in there. And if you look at the usual chart which says how much revenues are at risk, it's now 15% of the revenues which are consumer contract out of bundle or incoming. So still a big number, 16% actually, but down from last year. And we'll continue to work actively to reduce this number.</p>
          <p>Third element, portfolio of services and products. First of all, roaming. We have made proactively a distinctive point of Vodafone that we bundle data roaming into our tariffs. We, today, have 2 million customers on our &#x20AC;2 per day data tariff, please inform Brussels of this. We have 2.1 million customers who have roaming included in their tariffs. Today I was reading the Italian newspaper is advertising for SMEs and SOHOs data roaming included in the main package. And we are seeing some very positive trends, as you can see, plus 39% of data roamers versus the past. We noticed through our database and our CRM analysis that some customers were turning off data when they were abroad. Now, we're trying to address that and by saying, don't worry, it's &#x20AC;2 per day, it's included in your pack, just keep doing what you do at home. And this is, I think, a positive of Vodafone.</p>
          <p>Of course, basic internet revenues are up 50%, as Andy has said, lower part of the chart, this is due to a variety of reasons. There would be the special offers, bundled offers, but also new products. And Steve has mentioned joyn, I would like to mention the cloud services that we have launched in some markets and will be launched throughout the whole of Europe this year, the anti-virus and protection services, so Vodafone Protect, Vodafone Cloud, Vodafone Guardian, all the additional products that we will give to our customers to make the data experience better for them.</p>
          <p>One key element of our strategy will also be the customer experience. I have to say the job that my colleagues and Michel especially has done in Europe has been incredible this year. You see from the chart, we now moved from 265 million visits to online cares to 474 million. We moved from 0.5 million active mCare users to 8 million. And we have now 60% of our customers who receive their bill online in Europe. This is important because this is not just cost. Of course, there is a cost element in their strategy. But there's also a very high engagement and NPS implication. So, this is again recapturing loyalty back into our own domain, delivering also a service that costs us less. More of this in the future.</p>
          <p>I mentioned shops. We are planning now by 2015 to move 6,000 out of our 8,000 shops into a new format, a format which is more about retention than acquisition and more about service than sales. We have already done &#x2013; we are kind of underway, in the UK, the early results are very good. We are shrinking the number of shops, increasing the footage, changing the model, higher revenues, as you can see in the case study, plus 30%, higher margin, 4 percentage points, and higher customer satisfaction. So, retail is going to move into a service-type of hub with a stronger value in managing loyalty and managing retention. And this is, as you can see, a common theme across everything from pricing to network, retail and customer care.</p>
          <p>And, of course, the final element of this, which has a very important economic impact on our P&amp;L, is terminals. I'm glad to see that, now, if you exclude the kind of super basic phones, even in the high end, 18% today of the volumes, there's wide choice. In the mid end, 32%. We can manage acquisition or retention costs much more proactively than before. And we also have our own &#x2013; in the value segment, our own brand with specific projects, 1 million, Vodafone Smart, 0.5 million Facebook, and you go on like this.</p>
          <p>Tablets are also an important element in the device strategy. There are now 1.2 million active tablets in the Vodafone networks. And I used the plural, tablets. It's not just one, it's more and more formats and more to come. Again, this is going to be an additional line of revenue which is complementary to the main smartphone revenues, not just a replacement.</p>
          <p>So, these are the kind of six big vectors of our consumer strategy. You might ask, do you have goals? Do you have KPIs? The answer is, yes, we have a book this thick of KPIs and goals which we monitor monthly. But I'm not going to share the details. Let me tell you what the key KPIs are. Of course, smartphone penetration, which we are following, we are on track for the 35% goal. In 2015, the number will be much higher. We are now convinced that it will go higher. Data usage, we are planning for a much higher usage than the 200 MB to 300 MB per month per customer. Recent quarter-on-quarter numbers for Apple iPhones, for Android are actually positive, so it's going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Pricing is very important. We're talking a lot about pricing of voice, pricing of data, whether it's falling, whether it's growing. I really believe that we have to move into ARPU and AMPU type of thinking, because everything is going to be integrated and we need to &#x2013; and we are actively looking at the increase that this is generating. We are not very far away from what we gave you in the past. We always said 2% to 10%, with 5% being a little bit of where we are today. We keep working on that. And, of course, the terminal side is &#x2013; and the subsidy side is very important. Which leads to the next one, commercial cost. We measure the efficiency of our commercial investment on a monthly basis as subsidies as a percentage of committed revenues and we are bringing it down market by market, in some markets more than others. Spain clearly is the test market. But we have targets by market to be down several percentage points to make the economic equation better.</p>
          <p>And finally, churn. Churn very important now, we are in a kind of stable type of environment. It has to go down. My ambition is to bring it in line with the Verizon experience or the American market. I will not talk about enterprise today, if you don't mind. We have an open office on the 27 of September. Nothing new here. VGE, clearly big vector, 10.7% growth last year. We are expanding as a world-class organization. One Net, very good performance in One Net, more than 2 million seats now active. We are launching a version of One Net for larger companies, a version for international companies. And we're expanding the functionalities of One Net.</p>
          <p>Machine-to-Machine, plus 40%, relatively small but still, &#xA3;250 million. A few sectors selected: automotive, consumer electronics and smart metering as priority. We will cover again in September. And, finally, security and software solutions, which is more and more to be bundled with our enterprise catalog. Everything, including the integration of cable and wireless will be discussed in September.</p>
          <p>Now, everything has to be funded in life. What are the four buckets in order of importance, so by size. Clearly, commercial cost is very important. As I said, efficiency targets and healthier commercial models are part of our planning in that area. Second, procurement and supply chain. Andy has covered how strong and effective we are now in our global purchasing. We are centralizing more and more contracts. We are going into more collaboration with Verizon Wireless, finding mutual benefit in different types of vendors and categories.</p>
          <p>The third one is network and IT. Steve has talked about what we have been doing in this area. We are considering selectively active sharing where it makes sense. More centralization and more sharing of platforms across countries and moving to single IT stacks progressively, which is the equivalent in IT of what we have done in network. And, finally, Andy has said that shared services, we have today 6,000 seats outside of the normal, let's say, footprint. We will probably go to 10,000 to 11,000 in a reasonable timeframe and also get to world-class capability there.</p>
          <p>These are the main cost initiatives that will fund what I have described before. Now, we have to realistic. Are there challenges in front of us or only great opportunity? Yes, there are some challenges. In order of importance, macro, clearly austerity in Europe, lack of confidence in Southern Europe is a big issue, some underlying cost inflation in emerging markets has to be kept under control and the temptation of taxation that some governments, if not all governments, are feeling these days. This is really what I would put under the number one cloud.</p>
          <p>The second is regulation. Regulation, MTRs, Andy has talked about it. We have been hit a little bit more than what we thought by MTRs. Spectrum pricing and spectrum conditions, very important for us to get them right. And a little bit of roaming, even if here I have to say we are proactively addressing the roaming thing, so I'm a bit less concerned. I have to say India probably falls &#x2013; is under both clouds, consistently with the monsoon season which is approaching, and clearly the macro and the regulation are for us in India both areas to be monitored, but monsoons eventually finish and they have a season.</p>
          <p>And finally, competition is always there. I have to say a good data pricing is an important element in the competitive landscape that has to be kept under control. As last point, over the top substitution, speed as I said, yes, it's there, but we are less concerned than in the past. We are doing the right things from a pricing perspective. We keep VoIP disintermediation under observation. It's stable. It's 3% of our total network. We manage many, many, many, more million, billion minutes in our own packages than through VoIP. Of course, we'll continue to have a look.</p>
          <p>Now, how do you go with opportunities like the ones I have described but also the challenges? I think you go with a strong organization. We have a strong organizational program called The Vodafone Way. It's not here that I will share all the elements, but there are two that are important. The first one is the alignment of our management on the long-term interests. As you know, we worked a lot on incentives and we have put a more balanced mix of global versus local in the short term.</p>
          <p>But we also have introduced last year here guidance for ownership. I'm glad to report that today we have more than 30 million shares owned by the senior part of the team, and more are vesting this year, so I expect this number to go up during the year, during 2012. The important thing is that more than half of our people already exceeded the 100% ownership target, which, again, gives a very strong alignment with value with shareholders and with long-term orientation.</p>
          <p>The second element which I think is important is the depth of our bench. When we started the journey, we had 208 senior people. We then added Vodacom, we added Ghana, we added India. 112 have left the company in one way or another. 68 have been hired from outside, 68 have been promoted. There is some reorganization that probably will bring the number back to around 200. But this says that we have roughly, roughly about a third seasoned people, about a third promoted from inside and about a third hired from outside, 60% of whom have international experience within Vodafone. We are very proud of this.</p>
          <p>We only have three CEOs who have been in position for more than four years and one just for four years and one month. And we have also increased the diversity of our management body. So, I'm confident that we have strong alignment of interest with long-term value, but also a very good depth of management for trying to face the challenges, but, most importantly, exploit the opportunities.</p>
          <p>In order to conclude for macro conclusions, first, demand for data, enterprise and emerging market growth, I think, is well addressed by our strategy, which will be continuously adjusted to take into consideration the various developments in the world. We are competitively stronger. We have a decreasing dependence from mature voice. Now it's 38% mature voice as a percentage of our total revenues, geographically balanced assets. Technology, operational and organizational setup is now right to leverage on the group's strength, but also to locally implement the best strategy, which I repeat is to capture value share. And, finally, we continue to be focused on generating very good shareholder returns with a strong value orientation for both capital investments and corporate activity.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Tim? And then I go this way and then I go there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Tim Boddy from Goldman. A couple of questions. I would like to ask a little bit about growth. You've obviously stepped away from your mid-term revenue growth target of 1% to 4%. Can you update us really on what you're trying to say in terms of growth? There's very strong operational message around cost discipline. Are you saying you've up on given up on growth and you're going to try and sweat the assets more, or do you still expect growth for the group in the medium term?</p>
          <p>And then the second question seems linked to that. Again, you've emphasized in Supermobile your goal of achieving network differentiation. It does seem that when we look at the market today, in general, small players still grow much faster than larger players and regulators seem very keen to limit the potential of the larger players to get network advantage. So when do you think we'll see that point where the smaller players stop growing so quickly and you can really get that differentiation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I take both questions and then maybe, Andy, you can refine. First of all, the growth question. We have been hit a little bit more than expected by MTRs. We will, therefore, be this coming year a little bit below or slightly below the 1% to 4%. Of course, we still have the ambition to grow. I have a strong value message in this phase also because you can grow in revenues, but we also &#x2013; I'm truly convinced that there is an opportunity in Europe to grow in value.</p>
          <p>Which is a little bit linked to the second question also. How do you create value? You create value by having stronger technological platforms and giving better service to your customers. It's true that some smaller operators keep growing more, but we are confident that if you look at the broad numbers, I mean, it's nice to have a nice big percentage of a small number. And in some markets, like Germany, you start seeing some strain on some of those players. So we are convinced that our strategy is the right one to create more value and hopefully to capture a higher part of that value especially in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the regulators, I think you have a point. We need to fight a little bit harder with regulators because some of them are still a little bit in an old model. But, again, there is so much need in Europe for investment, for employment and, quite frankly, for a very good digital infrastructure and quality infrastructure that I see that the awareness, if not the actions, is moving. But I would have to spend some time on that, I agree with you.</p>
          <p>Andy, you want to be more...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just to add, the MTRs has been a greater drag than we had envisaged, so that has brought us down a little bit. I said earlier, the MTR effects of this next year will probably be similar. I think, actually, there a year after it should start to improve a little bit. So that plus maybe the economic environment picking up should be a better sort of space the year after this. But growth, pretty modest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, since I've got it. So I guess really just your idea that you want to create value. And what I'm seeing is some of the smaller players actually creating more value with the subsidy-free model. So smartphone penetration has quite rightly been a KPI for the last few years but with obvious implications for your costs. You've got some blunt measures in Spain. Is that a model that makes more sense across Europe or are there more subtle things you can do to reduce spend and then be able to give more value back to your consumers?</p>
          <p>And then separately, I'm just wondering how worried you are about Wi-Fi cannibalization and the risk that network differentiation will be harder for you or more expensive where you don't own your own wire line and whether or not Verizon-style cable partnerships might make sense in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is like four questions in one.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm giving it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And so, Simon, and then we go back this way and then that way. First of all, your question on the subsidy model, I think that the Spanish model &#x2013; I mean, first of all, I support that and we support that as you have seen by our commercial moves. It's a healthy thing and we are trying not just in Spain to go there. As I said, we're moving to an efficiency measure of A&amp;R which tries to pull back the amount of upfront investment or at least to make it more proportional.</p>
          <p>We can do it now much better than in the past, thanks to the availability of many more of these things. Of course, it's something that we have to manage relative to each market. So, to be clear, things have to progress throughout all players. And if some players are faster or slower to adjust to the new model, well, we will play whatever game makes sense for the specific market.</p>
          <p>The question on Wi-Fi, I would say that it's a little bit of a myth that fixed operators have an advantage there. Yes, we are embracing as &#x2013; Steve, maybe you can make a few comments on that. We're embracing all new possible technology, whether it's Femto, Wi-Fi, Lamppost, I don't know what, there's the next thing. But the reality is that it's the operational implementation which is difficult; it is not the fact that you own or you don't own the little fibre that goes there.</p>
          <p>It's who owns the lamppost. Is it the borough? Is it the London Transport Authority? Is it a neighborhood? Is it the cabinet which is owned by BT? So there's so much operational complexity. We don't think honestly that we are at a disadvantage here. Actually, we are all in the same place. We are going to play that game. But it's not about who owns the link that makes &#x2013; is going to make a big difference. Steve, do you want to talk in more technical terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think to add to that, <mark type="ph" /> Robin (1:15:08), I mean, we will incorporate Wi-Fi in our small cell technology. So, for us were agnostic and we've always said that to the wireless technology, it's another wireless technology. Interestingly, we've been measuring and monitoring the performance of Wi-Fi versus, in the higher order, HSDPA. And in four big markets where we've tested this, we are outperforming Wi-Fi in the public environment in raw downlink speeds.</p>
          <p>So, I think we get too hung up on, as Vittorio has said, the raw radio versus the operational degree of difficulty, the backhaul challenges that exist absolutely with Wi-Fi are the same as macro. And the big benefit of macro HSDPA or LTE is the consistency of the service that hand over the quality that we can deliver, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So we'll take Wi-Fi, we'll bring it into our mix. Any incumbent faces the same challenges on real estate and distribution of small cells that we do. And, largely, one might argue, the effect of Wi-Fi on smartphones and tablets in the home, we've already gone through that wave because it is what it is on the amount of data volume consumed in home. So we're really talking &#x2013; I think your question is more public Wi-Fi, and I would say we'll incorporate it in our mix.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Vittorio. Simon Weeden from Citigroup. Three questions but one is a small one. Dividend cover, as we look at the growth in the dividend and the free cash flow, I'm just really talking about the ordinary dividend, does there come a point where you worry about your free cash flow cover of the ordinary dividend? Is that something we should think about from beyond the current fiscal year in terms of the growth in the dividend?</p>
          <p>Second one is just to come back to the subsidies and commercial cost side of it, if as we've seen sometimes in certain areas, there is a migration towards <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:26) and away from subsidization. You get a revenue drag associated with that as customers' ARPUs fall because they're not paying for the subsidy recovery anymore. First off, should we expect that drag to be something that is present in the total revenue for Europe over the next few years? And, secondly, is it time to start to disclose what proportion of your revenue in some way is influenced by that need to recover a subsidy associated with a sale so that you're not seeing just voice, data and text; you're seeing voice, data, text and handset or device? And then just finally the quick one was, is there going to be any prospect in the near term, well, not the near term, but what sort of timeframe do you see retirement of 2G networks being a factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, while Stephen and James prepare their questions, let me get the second &#x2013; a piece of the second one and then pass to Andy, Steve and Michel the other one. Let me say I half agree with you, half agree in the sense that it's not by coincidence that I have said that internally we measure and will have to measure more ARPU and AMPU, so manage margin per customer as opposed to just pure revenue.</p>
          <p>Because at the end of the day, if you lose a piece of the revenue because that goes into a financing scheme, but you also lose the cost of the subsidy, and the margin goes up, it could be good news actually. And that's the way we are teaching and we are internally debating all these commercial decisions. Because at the end of the day it's the margin that really matters. And it would be more and more margin.</p>
          <p>I don't agree with you when you start talking about disclosing the voice, the data there. Because in reality, with integrated pricing, these are accounting allocations. At the end of the day, I pay in the UK &#xA3;26, &#xA3;31, &#xA3;46, whatever it's going to be for a set of services, so I believe it's going to be more revenues and margin rather than splitting into the specific things.</p>
          <p>Andy, dividend cover, retirement of 2G; Michel, maybe, another comment about...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the dividend cover, I'm fine there. I mean, we're talking about high 5s &#x2013; mid-to high 5s of free cash flow. We're mid-to-high 4s of dividend. We've got the debt level at the lowest level it's been at now for really quite a long period of time. We've got Verizon Wireless cash coming in, hopefully, on a reasonably regular basis. So I think when you put all of that together, I think we're in a good space. I mean, the uncontrollable clearly is the FX, particularly on the euro. But that aside, I think we're in a good space in the dividend cover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The retirement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't necessarily look at it as 2G, 3G and 4G because with single RAN, as I said, 80% of the footprint on that it's shared infrastructure. So, we look at it at different way. For sure, there was an evolution of customer types toward smartphones and tablets, which is reducing the reliance on the 1,800 and 900 spectrum that was originally designated for 2G voice and text. So you're seeing us reuse that as the customers migrate and refarming the 900, and that will continue.</p>
          <p>So I think, infrastructurally, singe RAN is somewhat agnostic to that and as well as the backhaul. So the benefit for us is we're reusing that spectrum as we evolve those customers up through smartphones, and you'll see that continue. There are some network assets that we can retire that are capacity-driven, and we'll do that. But I think it's the natural evolution that will follow and the main benefit and when we're out of that is spectrum reuse.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Stephen Howard here, HSBC. I have two questions. Firstly, do you think that small cells, which look to be the next big iteration technologically speaking, are likely to be scale-friendly, particularly in view of some of the comments that we've just heard on backhaul and the challenge that that represents?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just trying to wrestle something positive after the Australian experience, it would at least appear to demonstrate that if a meaningful gap opens up in service quality levels, it is very visible in revenues. Unfortunately, that hasn't been particularly in your favor in this instance. But what I'd like to try to understand is what kind of differential do you think you need to open up in a positive sense in order to drive meaningful, observable revenue differentiation? If you look at that slide, I think you had page 32, you've got this figure of 100% objective by 2014/2015 of device throughput of over 400 kilobits per second. If that's your objective and you think the network is a differentiator, where do you think your leading competitor is going to be at that date? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take the first one, I'll take the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We've been doing lots of studies, Stephen, on small cells and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:23:00), very well written. It's something that we've grown out of the Femto work which we also pioneered and we moved to what we call public Femtos, which we started enterprise and other coverage. Originally, there were lots of challenges on interference, it was the main issue. We put them in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:23:24) cars driving past were flipping on and off every three seconds and it was crashing everything. So, we've experienced that wave of learning.</p>
          <p>The economics of deployment are not so much backhaul because we can mesh backhaul and we can put it off on high-order fibre. The real issue is one Vittorio alluded to, it'll be a new challenge for real estate and new kinds of real estate, requirements for small cells will be at lampposts, sides of buildings, the acquisition of suitable, consistent power feeds, et cetera. So our main concern is not so much backhaul, we're pretty well equipped with fibre into our city sensors, now on metro rings and fibre to the base station where it matters, and we're increasing that. It is the real estate and the challenges in acquiring real estate to put these things on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me take the second one on Australia. I can say, yes, Australia is an example of when things go wrong. I can say Turkey or Ghana are examples on when things go right; actually, you actually opened in the other direction. I wish I had a mathematical answer to your question. I think, to be honest, we learned the 400 KB measurement from Verizon, Verizon were very strong on measuring customer experience at the video level at 400 KB, so we are importing that from them.</p>
          <p>Honestly, it's not the only thing for, of course, uninterrupted video and streaming experience is important, but it's also all the other things that I mentioned. It's also your ability to self-manage your account, which is becoming much more complicated, let me say, &#xE0; la Amazon, which is our ambition, my ambition is to be the Amazon of telecommunication in terms of relationship with the customer.</p>
          <p>It's also the type of experience that you give in the shops and you give live when you have to choose. It's a lot of others, it's the IT-capabilities to propose and push the right services to the right people. It's roaming differentiation. So there's a lot of things that would go into opening the gap, and we categorize them under the six chapters that I have indicated to you and that's our strategic plan for now. It's difficult to attribute a single one gap as the target that would enable a positive gap.</p>
          <p>James, then, yeah, <mark type="ph" /> Morris (1:25:49), then we should have to go a little bit there and then we'll come back here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions, please. Firstly, why has data growth slowed quite a bit in the UK market? I thought smartphones were selling pretty well over here.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, on the issue of network quality, again, on the case that you gave around congestion; so, if 8% of sites are suffering some form of congestion in the busy hour, what does that really mean for urban sites? Presumably that could point to substantially high congestion in urban areas. And do you think that 8% level is the acceptable level? You obviously want to drive up mid-data spend for customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michel for the first one on UK and Steve for the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, for the first one, three reasons. First, lagging effect of price increase on data last year in the same quarters. Second, high penetration of data already in the UK, so obviously what led to <mark type="ph" /> sour (1:26:50) growth. And, third, still some decline on the mobile broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to the second question, 8% is not a static number, i.e. when we find a congested site, we don't call it congested, we say busy, it's more or less collapsed. We regularly have sites at 90% in different geographies, but if it consistently hits 90% utilization, we have them on watch daily. And so, we'll relieve that congestion.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at our capital investments in capacity, they're almost certainly targeted at these sites. And what you'll see is a site will get relieved, we'll add extra backhaul capacity or another carrier or ultimately sell split. And that 8% moves around. So, customers don't experience a static congestion. This is what we focus on and this is what we put our investments in to relieve that pressure. And you'll see it actually in a city like London. It's been moving around London for about three years now. What we're saying is we're comfortable with this level because we can address it and it does not impact customer experience and we get on it fast and we keep pressing it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's <mark type="ph" /> Mark Morris (1:28:04) from Barclays. A couple of CapEx questions. The first one, I think CapEx went up slightly. You were saying it was broadly flat. It seems most of that is opportunistic spend rather than capacity related. Is that the approach we'll see you taking in 2013?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to the mix of CapEx. It seems it's been lower radio, more transmission and core. And is that the same direction we should think about the next couple of years despite the increase in IP backhaul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first question has an easy answer. We invest where we see opportunity to have positive business cases. And I'm not concerned if one year I invest &#xA3;200 million more and maybe next year &#xA3;200 million less. And so, it's really business-driven decisions, not anything in a word if you called that tactical, but it's business-driven decision. On the mix, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the mix, it's very much to target the two areas that we said earlier on the IT side. It creates forward-looking differentiation on customer contact points, online retail care and to join them together, we'll carry on investing there. And in the networks, we delivered investments in the single RAN to give us flexibility, also there's OpEx and efficiency that comes with that, but preparedness for the future and the backhaul.</p>
          <p>And so, we're consistently investing in those areas right now. Perhaps, slightly heavier emphasis in the last 12 months, so that will continue for a little while on the backhaul capability, but pretty consistent there. And it's certainly not increasing, which is usually the question in capacity. Although, of course, if you up the size of the pipe, you're inherently delivering more capacity, but capability is where we're focused.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of more network questions following up on those. I think previously Steve showed some relative download speed charts which you haven't done this time. I'm just interested if that's because you don't want to or because they haven't got better and just a little bit more information on that would be interesting.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, going back to this 8% of sites hot in the busy hour, I mean, presumably, there's some kind of 80/20 rule around sites. So these 8% of sites may be carrying 50% of traffic in the busy hour. Is that not a meaningful network experience problem? And, again, how do you think that compares across the sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I take the first one because it is linked to the second one? The reality is that, yes, we continue also to monitor the speed and we have all these nice speed things. But the reality is that, again, in discussions also with Verizon, we said what is really relevant is the experience of the customers. I don't care if I have 15 megabit per second when, by the way, the handsets, as Steve has shown, are not capable of getting more than 7, most of them.</p>
          <p>I care if when I'm watching my Chelsea versus Bayern game, I cannot get the right moment where the goalie scored or I get interrupted, or I don't get my whatever music in a consistent way. So, I have to say this was part of a discussion with our network colleagues to say, let's take the customers' point of view. Of course, I measure the speed and, of course, I have speed test here, and I just checked that I have 8 megabit per second here and whatever. But the reality is that what is going to be important is the ability to spread our investment on as many customers as possible. And this is what we have given them as a mission.</p>
          <p>Now on the &#x2013; how hot or red hot the 8% are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we actually do &#x2013; by the way, I totally concur with that. We're at a point in raw speed that it doesn't matter anymore for the things that customers want to do on the internet. And it's more of the consistency and Vittorio set that pace and we're trying to follow it consistently.</p>
          <p>On the 90% figure, this is an average &#x2013; rolling average we take. So, we measure every busy hour. And it's not does a customer experience it three days in a row, we meant that figure has taken from a 14-day average and how many times does a site pop up as over 90%. Now, it doesn't say over 100%, meaning there's real stress. So we picked a conservative figure that allows us some headroom and we still address it early when we see a challenge creeping up. And you can address it very quickly with spectrum. And so, we've got plenty of headroom in spectrum, as you can see, or more substantially releasing more backhaul capability or power.</p>
          <p>So, we're quite comfortable that that's the right metric to follow and we're quite comfortable that we're addressing it such that it does not impede customer experience. And customers are pretty quick to tell you when it does. And that has happened on occasion; Clapham Junction is a good example here that we've got on. And hopefully you'll see a difference in our &#x2013; when you get the feedback consistently.</p>
          <p>Others in the industry, I don't know what others do. You'd have to ask them. I'm sorry. We're pretty comfortable that we can keep ahead and deliver a differentiated experience by focusing on that in what could potentially become a congested zone.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, Justin Funnell, Credit Suisse. Just going back to your revenue guidance, I'm going to guess that very few of us have got a view of the next three years at the moment, but you used to have one. Just wanted to go into a little bit more detail on the reason for the change in the approach. Maybe it's just an investor relations' philosophy thing. But if we look at some of your trends &#x2013; sorry, that wasn't a euphemism for anything.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; just looking at your organic trends, when you look across the four big markets, your non-SMS data revenues are generally slowing. It's not just the UK, it's all four of them. We aren't seeing tiering working at the moment properly. Is there something more fundamental basically behind this change in the revenue guidance? Do you need to shift your pricing structure more significantly to get that growth going again?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on Spain. This drilling into slide 13, please. The growth, excluding effects from <mark type="ph" /> chart (1:34:43) very helpful slides you put there. It's got worse obviously by a percent. I guess there must have been a leap year effect as well; this probably got worse underlying by 2%. Could you just talk us through what happened in that quarter in terms of the timing of what <mark type="ph" /> TIFF (1:35:00) was doing with subsidy changes, what you were doing and to what degree that affected the growth rate for you in that quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will turn to Michel for the Spanish question. Let me take &#x2013; because I really want to reiterate what I already said. I'm not so sure I would really look at so much at detailed voice is doing this, data is doing that, SMS is doing that in the future. Of course, we'll continue to do it for a while. But as I have said, the more the penetration of smartphone grows there, the more we sell bundles, the more we give, even on prepaid, kind of included in the pack this amount of data, the more the allocation of each service is a function of the price that the service in isolation would get, because this is an accounting rule, if you can get it separated. But it's not what the customer really experience. The customer pays &#xA3;31, &#xA3;46, &#xA3;38, whatever it is, and then there's a different behaviors. So, I really believe that the focus should be more on the ARPU and on the AMPU going forward.</p>
          <p>Yes, there is still pressure on voice, but to some extent, we take it. I mean, if I look at average price per minute in Europe versus average price per minute in the U.S. and I look at data &#x2013; when data margins in Europe and in the U.S., we are exactly the other way around. And we should rebalance over time. So, we are following the market and pushing the market a little bit there. This is the answer on the specific of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:39) component.</p>
          <p>Now, Andy, would you like to comment on IR forcing us to change our philosophy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is this is not an IR thing. I think we just said what it was, is the world has changed. There has been a little bit more pressure from the MTR perspective. There is an economic situation which is difficult to address. And we just basically said we would be below the 1% and we still have plans for growth. This is what we can say today. But it's not &#x2013; no big underlying phenomenon that is taking place, it's just the reflection of where we are. Michel, Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Spain, first, quarter-on-quarter, I would say that underlying is more or less the same performance, mainly driven by still pressure on price, so that was what we have introduced a few quarters ago in order to rebate our prices and tariffs. And the second is traffic which is going down, so which is probably the only country in Europe where we're experiencing voice traffic going down year-on-year. So, that's what is driving this performance around minus 9% in terms of &#x2013; in Spain.</p>
          <p>In terms of the new commercial model which has been implemented, as you know, we have implemented it in Spain ourselves only the 10 of April. So, of course, there is no effect on the last quarter. Then just say that for Telef&#xF3;nica, it has had a big effect. So, the total volume of gross add has reduced by roughly 30% in the market and most of it coming from Telef&#xF3;nica. We have introduced the same in April, so we see now some pressure on our gross adds in April and March. The good side is that we see also some improvements on churn, so we have a rebalancing from growth adds to churn, still early days. What we are trying to drive and coming back to the question of <mark type="ph" /> Robin (1:38:45) and Simon, I guess on commercial spends, there are two things that we are trying to do.</p>
          <p>The first is to give more transparency on handset prices because up to now the customer doesn't know the value of the handsets that we are giving to them. So, hence this idea of further moving to financing or other type of stuff in order for the customer to realize much more what is the value of the handset. It doesn't mean that he cannot value package but at least he has to understand what is the value of the handset. And the second is rebalancing in between acquisition and retention, so which is this moving this shift in order just to make sure that we put more resources on retention and reducing churn, which was actually the main target of Vittorio.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Sorry, Robert. So, it's Will Draper, Espiritu Santo. A couple of things, one on India and one on Verizon. In India, obviously, you're executing well organically and there appears to be some repair in market pricing. Do you think there is a requirement for consolidation in India still, i.e., an inorganic move? And related to that, do you have enough spectrum in India? And if you don't, how do you think you might acquire some? And then on Verizon, we're sort of halfway through the year and I wonder what the timetable for discussions with Verizon over the dividend is, and what kind of, well, I guess timing for a decision on that we might expect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the second one while somebody gives a microphone to Nick Read, who will take the question on India since Nick is the architect of &#x2013; not the operator but the architect of this great performance in India over the last three years, and he enjoys all the intricacies of spectrum rules in India.</p>
          <p>The Verizon question is an easy one to answer. There's no timetable, no public timetable. This is a private partnership; this is not a listed company. We just paid the special dividend three months ago. We will update the market whenever the discussion takes place. I mean, the budget is discussed at various points during the interim, so first forecast and then approval and so on. So we had nothing really to communicate today and this is &#x2013; again, keep in mind, this is a private partnership, this is not a publicly traded company.</p>
          <p>Nick, India, do you want to consolidate and do you have enough spectrum for continuing to be as successful as you are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think this is working. In terms of consolidation, I think you're effectively seeing what we described about a year ago. We said there was sort of like three tiers: the new entrants, the sort of regional players and the national players. And I think with the recent license cancellations of 2008, you will see an effective consolidation take place.</p>
          <p>So do we need to consolidate? I don't think so. I think Vittorio, Andy, clearly explained we have a national footprint. We have national coverage. We're performing very strongly. So we don't need consolidation. We think it's healthy for the market. We think it's taking place today.</p>
          <p>I think if you're talking about spectrum, yeah, do we have enough? Well, clearly, we'd always like more and we'd like low-band spectrum as well for LTE in the future. So, the answer is, yes, we'd like more if the price is right. Clearly, the pricing being discussed at the moment is not right. We will struggle to make a business case on a number of circles if it stays at this level.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a function of the price of the spectrum, a function of the pricing in the marketplace. If spectrum is as the year is being discussed, then pricing will have to go up dramatically in the marketplace to make the business case, which in itself will have an effect on volumes of minutes, et cetera. So, very fluid, but what I'd say is at this point in time, we have in enough spectrum for the current environment and we assess given the pricing of the spectrum in the market going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Robert from Deutsche Bank. Serves me right for sitting in the late arrival seats. On the interest rate fix and the impact on earnings, Andy, please could you say what that impact was again and when does it drop away assuming interest rates remain stable?</p>
          <p>Secondly, any sign that LTE customers in Germany are dropping their fixed lines because the broadband LTE experience is so good? And then finally, when you do a big RAN upgrade, aggressive, I think, Steve called it, in places like South Africa, can you recycle some of the old equipment into less mature markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the finance costs &#x2013; the EPS was down 11%; 8% was disposals of businesses, so minus 3% was the net number. There was about, I think, a plus 3% from reduced number of shares in issue, a plus 1% from underlying trading and minus whatever the balance is was the finance cost to &#x2013; essentially, the finance cost was the result of it. The fixing we have done should give us the confidence that we will hold at this level for the next year. So, therefore, year-on-year, this should not be an impact in financing costs this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On LTE, so at that stage most of the 130,000 customers who have referred to are customers which didn't have a fixed alternative before, so it's in rural areas where there was no DSL. As you know, we are now expanding the coverage of our LTE network, starting to move in cities. And so we start to see some move from DSL customers to this new proposition.</p>
          <p>Many customers shooting for what I would call a DSL On-the-Go or a DSL nomadic, meaning that they want to have this access in, let's say, a few places. And so that's what we are going to focus on in the next coming quarters. And then, of course, a third piece will be we are introducing now LTE on mobile source, Smartphone LTE with new handset which are arriving in the next coming weeks. So that's the three markets that we are looking it: DSL substitution, DSL On-the-Go and smartphone 4G.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third question. Yes, we can recover and reuse equipment depending on its age. When we do a single RAN upgrade, we very often reuse the 3G equipment, not the 2G equipment, that's quite often junked. In addition to that, the suppliers quite often offer a buyback incentive along with the refresh. So there's two ways of attacking that opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Beale from Arete Research. Just wanted to come back to the network quality and investment area. I guess if I look at your balance sheet, it's better than most of your rivals, and the EBITDA measure doesn't include the cash you get from Verizon. So, including that, it's really quite a bit better than many of your rivals. I saw your plans to 2015 and understand it's all fairly complicated and you can't necessarily see it from single set of numbers. But you don't have a huge amount of LTE targeted by 2015. And I guess, just sort of thinking about that in comparison, say, to Verizon which has created a very sustainable network advantage both in CDMA and now it looks like in LTE as well. Just wondering whether you're already doing as much as you could to create an advantage there?</p>
          <p>Just because the prize from differentiation and the pricing power that you might get from that seems a prize worth having, judging from Verizon itself. So I guess the question is, is it logistics, is it just it's very hard to go any faster than you're currently going? Is it a capital constraint in terms of your free cash flow or is it just that you actually think it's a zero sum game and your competitors don't have as much &#x2013; aren't leveraged enough that they will follow you anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's an excellent question. The answer is you're comparing a single-country operation, big but still single country, with a multi-country corporation like us. You're comparing a single-country operation where they've got loads of spectrum which were auctioned according to certain rules with a multi-country operation which has different rules, different &#x2013; I mean, look at the debate here in the UK still.</p>
          <p>If you compare Germany to the U.S., you would see that actually, we launched first LTE; as Michel said, we went first into rural but now we are getting into nomadic urban, eventually we'll test the system even into urban non-nomadic. So in places where we have the spectrum, where we have enough spectrum, and where we have the possibility of rolling out, actually we do. Of course, we are looking into it and that's not by coincidence I mentioned network as the first point. We are looking into ways of accelerating. But if we don't have the frequencies, there's not much that we can do.</p>
          <p>Keeping in mind that we have an alternative which is, in the meantime, increasing the HSPA speed, which doesn't deliver exactly the same experience in terms of latency and big speed and so on, but still has quite a long way to go which in the U.S., they didn't have. So, the answer is compared single country to single country, we're doing the best that we can. And we also are a little bit better off than Verizon because we have another intermediate step.</p>
          <p>Yes, I think you've been very patient for a very long time, so I have to come to you. And then we need to move back, I think <mark type="ph" /> Akil (1:49:16) you had raised your hand, yeah. And then I saw another couple, yeah, there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's [indiscernble] (1:49:22) when it's somebody short, it's difficult to be seen. So, three questions, if I can. The first one is actually very straight on numbers rather than strategy. Free cash flow, I just noticed that given timing difference on taxes, you generate &#xA3;626 million, so 12% of free cash flow with lower cash taxes. So I was just wondering what is timing difference all about. And going to next year, because you're guiding for flat free cash flow adjusting for the ForEx, how are you going to basically generate the &#xA3;626 million, it's just timing. So if cash tax goes up, cost really is going down in terms of cost or goes up in terms of revenues.</p>
          <p>The second one is on EBITDA. H1 EBITDA organic growth was flat. Full year is down to &#xA3;0.6 billion, so back on the envelope, is down 100 basis points on H2. So you're talking about stabilization on EBITDA. So what really makes you confident considering from H1 to H2 we're going backwards? And the third one, usual questions considering that you're the only company that guide on EBIT, what's your depreciation guidance for next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like Andy question. And, Steve, you can relax now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is one I can't hand off, so let me take them in order. The cash tax cost, as you say, was &#xA3;0.6 billion lower this year than in the previous year. A small part of that was in Italy, relating to some tax release in Italy. The bigger part was actually to do with U.S. taxes, where, because we actually receive a dividend from Verizon Wireless to cover tax costs, actually, when you take the dividend and the tax cash together, they are net neutral. So, hence, next year, when we'll have a higher cash tax cost in the U.S. because of the end of the bonus depreciation, we will equally have a dividend change that will cover it. Therefore, there is no year-on-year effect of any consequence to be concerned by.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on EBITDA, a simple summary from me on margins would be that we had a 1.3 percentage point reduction in the margin between the first and the second half a year ago. This year, that reduction was 1.7 percentage points. But we took the restructuring charges in the second half this year. If you ex out the restructuring, it was 1.3 again this year. Therefore, actually, the pattern between half years is adjusted for restructuring unchanged.</p>
          <p>And to the final one, we haven't specifically guided on the non-cash item of depreciation, but given that we have had pretty flat CapEx for a number of years, I would suggest that one should expect the depreciation charge to be pretty similar next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Thank you. <mark type="ph" /> Akil (1:52:40) from JPMorgan. Just a couple of quick ones. On competition, just interested in your comments that you think or you seem reasonably relaxed, let's say, on competition in Europe at the moment, particularly in the context of moves from T-Mobile in the UK, E-Plus in Germany. I just wondered how we should think about that. Does that mean that you think about those as relatively isolated pricing moves or is that just a reflection of your confidence in your network advantage?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on Italy, the H2 margin down about 3 percentage points, which was a little bit unexpected, so just interested to understand what's driving that, how we should think about Italy going forward? And then finally, just in terms of buybacks, just wondering with the buyback expected to end this year, how we should think about the scope for a potential new buyback announcement? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, on the first question, we are monitoring very carefully what our competitors are doing in the different markets. T-Mobile and E-Plus, I guess, that you are referring to these low-end, no-frill offers which have been introduced in the UK and in Germany. Of course, we believe that's what it's said, there is probably a little bit of depolarization of the markets. So, let's say, most of the market remains on these high-end or rich tariffs on which, let's say, we are competing and we're trying and we are leading the show and enriching our services, differentiated as it has been explained through network and customer experience.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we are also targeting the no-frill end, either directly or thru letters of partnerships <mark type="ph" /> in Vienna also whatsoever (1:54:15). So, in both markets, but it's a market-by-market answer which has to be driven in order just to make sure that we are back in this game without driving it too fast because we believe that we are better off to differentiate in the other side of the market. So, that's it for the first piece.</p>
          <p>Second piece, in Italy, so I guess that we're performing well in a market which is quite tricky and quite tough. Macroeconomic situation remains very difficult, but we have gained market share, we have extended the gap with Telecom Italia in the year. Last quarter, Telecom Italia is recovering a little bit, obviously coming from a lower base and very, very, let's say, aggressive on <mark type="ph" /> LNP (01:54:54). We remain, again, very focused on our Supermobile strategy. You have probably seen that we have even increased our prices for tablets or for data because you are really trying to play the differentiated game and to remain ahead of the market in that space.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBITDA or margin in H2, slightly impacted by slightly, let's say, over expenses in commercial spends in order to push this data story and just to make sure that, let's say, we can deliver these improvements in terms data ARPU.</p>

          <p>And on the buyback, we've not announced anything today on further buybacks. The current &#xA3;6.8 billion program has still got a few months to run, so it probably will be over in the summer. Clearly, the debt level is fairly low. Equally, we've got one or two more unpredictable events still out in front of us and I think we just want to see how those resolve and then we'll see where we're at at that point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. It's James Ratzer from New Street Research.  I had two questions, please, both indirectly related to the U.S. On the first question, I've seen your &#x2013; you look with some interest at how Verizon's own share price is performing now up over $40 a share. It strikes me the rise they're seeing in their share price hasn't fully been reflected in your own share price, despite on my  numbers I think this year around 60% of your earnings will come from the stake in Verizon Wireless. When you look at your share price, I mean, how do you think about that value discrepancy? Is that something you hope will naturally close over time or do you think you might need to take more proactive action on that front?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, also looking at the U.S. and related to the questions we've had already on the subsidy &#x2013; introducing handset upgrade fees on contract renewals, some to try to reduce subsidies and increase handset longevity, are you considering similar sort of moves here in Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe Andy can kind of give you the right numbers because I don't think we have 60% of our profit coming from...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unless Verizon has an extraordinarily good year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, unless you know something about this current quarter that we don't know yet, I think it's a little bit less. Nonetheless, your point is very valid. I think Verizon has got a fantastic performance, which is why Andy was showing the 3% kind of pro forma integrated thing. The best thing we can do, to be honest, is to get the dividends and to distribute the dividends to our shareholders, which is what we did last year and what we plan to do. It's getting credit for &#x2013; reward for the good performance that they have. This is the way, I think &#x2013; I would not comment on relative stock prices because these are volatile and they can change. But the operational focus is clearly on improving what we do together and getting money out of them.</p>
          <p>The subsidy and everything they do is an area that I have to tell you we study, as you might have heard from or understood from some of my comments, incredibly &#x2013; Morten Lundal, who is sitting here, is in continuous contact with his opposite member there. It's a very healthy market where the market structure allows players to experiment more.</p>
          <p>To be honest, we were doing some of those same things ourselves. I mean, we moved in Italy to 30 months from 24 months. We are trying to lengthen in Spain. We are lengthening in Greece. I think everywhere we are moving to different type of models. What <mark type="ph" /> Robin (1:58:44) asked before but the split between the financing and what was commented by my colleagues before, making evident to the customers a trade-off choice between different types of smartphones is clearly part of our strategy. It's what I indicated as point number six of our strategy; it will be more and more evident in the coming months every time you &#x2013; in the second half of this year, I would say, every time you will walk into a Vodafone shop. So, yes, we are trying to do the same things market-by-market, depending on the degrees of freedom that we have. I think we should really...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yeah, it's Emmet Kelly from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just have one question, and the question is Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil has made an offer to acquire a large stake in KPN. Just wondering what you think about that and whether KPN and E-Plus with a strong financial backer, do you see that as a greater threat in Europe? And I guess all players in Germany will be monitoring this situation closely, given KPN's ownership of E-Plus. Could you just remind us of what your view is on German wireless consolidation, your existing position? And whether something worked to develop there, whether you would be willing to be an active consolidator or merely a passive one? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always look at consolidation in positive terms, in general. We follow the situation of KPN and Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil carefully. We will look at what they do. Honestly, are we concerned? No. I mean, having a good solid entrepreneur who wants to make money is not a bad thing to have as a competitor. So I don't think we should be really concerned by any possible development if they take place.</p>
          <p>Any other question on this side or should we go back there? Back there, then. Yeah?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's John Karidis here from Oriel Securities. I just have two questions. Firstly, when do you think Microsoft will be a better, stronger competitor to the likes of Android and Apple from what you're seeing versus what we're seeing?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, mercifully, mobile termination rates, I think, won't go negative. So, it sort of feels that although you've been hit harder this year, maybe the following year you might have some good news in terms of the impact of MTRs on your service revenue. Can you give us an idea of what the scale of the switch will be between this year and next in terms of, everything else being equal, the MTR changes to your service revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first question, I expect the Microsoft environment to become more competitive and more appealing towards the end of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fiscal. Fiscal, calendar hopefully, it depends on their logistics, to be honest. I hope calendar, but it could be fiscal. I don't know. But at around the end of the year, Windows Phone should be more than coming out of &#x2013; they have a clear priority, which is the fixed side, and then they will move to the mobile &#x2013; or the laptop, and then they will move to the mobile one. And I think Nokia is working towards that objective as well together with the others. So, we will see.</p>
          <p>The question on MTRs, yes, they cannot go negative. I have to say, I also see some positive change of language. Yesterday, there was a speech by Commissioner Cruz where she has marginally relaxed some of her initial timing positions. There is a healthy debate between some regulators in Brussels. I think it will hopefully ease off a bit, I don't think it will change direction. In terms of impact, Andy?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Jerry Dellis from Jefferies. Two questions, please. When you talk about the group EBITDA margin stabilizing by March 2014, I just wondered if you could explain to us how sensitive that is to your revenue growth assumptions on that timeframe? And then, secondly, just in terms of tiering, I sort of wonder what percentage of customers are trading up through the tiers at this point? And as you track usage growth in the home and office environment, which I guess is really where Wi-Fi is actually prevalent rather than in the public arena, what are you seeing in terms of usage growth in that environment?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On tiering, so, I would say that probably we have not, let's say, given any figures at that stage. It's still a little bit early days because our tiered pricing have been introduced 18 months ago. And what we see is that usually gets some upgrade or uplift when they come to the renewal of their handset. So, meaning that at that stage, we are still in single-digit figure in terms of increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On also on the margin guidance, I suppose two comments. One, clearly the margin is sensitive to the revenue profile. That guidance is consistent with, I think, a fairly cautious view on the revenues. The other thing is that actually, as we are increasingly diminishing these ranges, it is becoming very precise in a very big business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Paul Marsch from Berenberg. I'm just wondering how easy is to switch some of your Southern European billing systems to escudos or drachma or lira? How seriously are you thinking about contingency plans for such an eventuality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take it not because I'm an IT expert but because I'm responsible for the company. We do really hope and we do support the single currency and single market concept and we really hope that the leadership of Europe is able to push a constructive solution through. However, I also have the duty to ensure business continuity. So for many months, we have got business continuity plans developed in a variety of scenarios, one of which also includes that some countries might theoretically get into different currencies. It's not the biggest complexity, the IT, the billing one, the one that you referred to, the one we are facing. So, I think we can &#x2013; as Steve say, we could handle it...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nick Lyall from UBS. Can I ask two questions, please? Firstly, on Italy, it seems every time we have a quarter, we get different answers from your sales in TI in terms of who's being most aggressive in the market. So could you maybe just give us an idea of exactly where TI's aggression comes from, if you believe it's them being aggressive? And maybe qualify their points on their call about this sort of olive leaf or sort of gesture of pricing they offered maybe to...</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It's the extension of the rebate from 12 months to 24 months. So, very aggressive on MNPs, pricing and commissions, fact-based. When we have increased value base again our prices on data, we'll just get rid of, let's say, the low entry price point on data. So, that's really <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:07:44).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then second one, then maybe I've <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:08:01) not sure. But the waterfall chart on the margins, just for the guidance for this year, for March 13, it looks like getting rid of an Australian problem plus removal of the restructuring gets you to more or less halving of the margins. So, is there any prospect that actually the mix could improve in terms of margins, or you can have proper underlying savings coming through, and we can see...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thank you for this question because this is a final good question, and, Andy, maybe you can comment about it. You actually got it right. When we say minus 0.8, in reality it includes 20 basis points of Australian 20 basis points of restructuring. So, when we said last year we're going to do another slowdown of margin decline, that's exactly what we had in mind. Now, looking &#x2013; going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean there's a lot of ways to look at that. But I think the restructuring clearly was a factor last year. Australia, if we are at the bottom on that, then just mathematically, your point and Vittorio's response is absolutely right. But, as I said earlier, trying to guide a business with such big revenues to 0.2s, 0.3s, 0.4s of margin is really quite a tough thing to do. And I think the general trend that we are on the margins I think is good. It is now 2% two years ago, 1% a year ago. Strip out the restructuring, just over 0.5% this year. We are heading the right way and, therefore, I am very comfortable with the statement that by March 14, we should get to stability.</p>
