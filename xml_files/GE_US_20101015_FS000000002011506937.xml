          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the General Electric third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Noelia, and I will be your conference coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Noelia.</p>
          <p>Good morning and welcome, everyone. We are pleased to host today's third quarter 2010 earnings webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued a press release earlier this morning, and the presentation slides are available via the webcast. The slides are also available for download and printing on our website at www.ge.com/investors. We'll have time for the Q&amp;A at the end.</p>
          <p>As always, elements of this presentation are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes; please interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>For today's webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO, Keith Sherin. Now I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, Trevor.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. The team had a good quarter in an improving environment. The environment generally continues to get better. Some of the things that we look at like media buying, credit demand, our losses are declining, equipment orders growing. I think those are all positives for GE.</p>
          <p>We're seeing a slow recovery in a few areas. Commercial Real Estate is performing as expected in a tough cycle. As you know, in 2009 we had negative demand for electricity, and that's slowly getting better, but it has had an impact in our Energy orders, certainly in '09. And the appliances market was tougher as we went through the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We had good earnings growth. EPS was up 32%. And GE Capital, really the team did a great job.</p>
          <p>You'll notice, as Keith will talk about in a second, GE Money discontinued operations reserves substantially increased. We believe that that reserve update fully addresses our Grey Zone risk.</p>
          <p>Execution is very strong, $78 billion of cash and equivalents. And operating margins grew in the quarter ex-NBCU.</p>
          <p>And we are doing what we said we'd do on capital allocation. We had about $900 million of stock buyback. The dividend is growing by 20%, and we did a couple what we think are value creating acquisitions. So we made progress in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If you go to the next page on GE Capital, no need to dwell on this page. I think all the metrics are fundamentally getting better. Funding is in good shape. Commercial paper is way down, particularly versus where we were two years ago. Leverage has been reduced.</p>
          <p>If you look at our Tier 1 common ratio, it continues to strengthen. And we're well positioned within the Basel III outline, and our ending net investment plan is on track. So we have very strong liquidity and capital positions on GE Capital.</p>
          <p>Orders grew by 7%. It's the first time in two years that equipment and services orders grew at the same time, so we view that as good sign. Tech Infrastructure orders up 33%; it's really great. It shows strength really across Healthcare, Transportation, and Aviation.</p>
          <p>The backlog was stable. We had several big push-outs in our Oil &amp; Gas business that should come back to us in Q4. In places like Healthcare, the emerging market orders are up substantially.</p>
          <p>Order pricing was only down slightly. It was down about 0.8% in the quarter, so I think that's a pretty good sign for the quarter itself. And as we said in the press release, we think Industrial revenue in the fourth quarter will be up sequentially and roughly flat with where we were in the fourth quarter of '09. So I think there's a lot of good news on the orders page that's going to help us as we go into the fourth quarter and beyond, into 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>We always talk about execution in both margins and cash, and I think the team has done a good job on both of these. Our operating profit rate grew by 40 basis points. That's excluding NBCU.</p>
          <p>Particularly strong performance by Energy. We had a positive value gap of about 190 million, and a big chunk of that driven by material cost deflation. Our operating teams continue to do a good job. And at the same time, we absorbed the initial shipments of the GEnx engine, some of the launch cost. And that took place in the third quarter, as well.</p>
          <p>From an R&amp;D standpoint, we're investing above 5% of our industrial revenue back into R&amp;D. It's growing 21% year over year. Again, focused on product leadership, expanding our core technologies, and creating a lower cost position.</p>
          <p>Just a couple highlights. We have a strong position on the 787 launch. As that goes forward, that will pull a lot of GE systems and engines with it. Very strong new NPI [New Product Introductions] development in our Energy business with new 7F, 9F, and a larger size Jenbacher engine. And our new investments are scaling in areas like battery, home health, and solar. So we're maintaining margins while increasing investment in technology and absorbing some of the initial GEnx launch cost.</p>
          <p>Also from a cash standpoint, our cash performance was very strong in the quarter. We generated about $3.8 billion in 3Q. Its cash flow from operating activities at 1.3 times net income and depreciation. And as expected, our progress balance continues to decline, offset by working capital improvements. And our working capital turns continue to get better.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the page, you can see the cash walk. Our consolidated cash is almost $80 billion, $78 billion. Again, we've announced the increase in the dividend and the buyback. And again, our cash performance is in good shape.</p>
          <p>Last year, we said our framework for CFOA for the year was between 13 billion and 15 billion. We now think we're on track to be at the high end of that range, so it will be somewhere between $14 billion and $15 billion as we finish the year in 2010.</p>
          <p>So a good job of execution by the team. And now I'll turn over to Keith to go through the financial performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start with the third quarter summary. For the quarter, we had continuing operations revenues of 35.9 billion, which were down 5%; Industrial sales of $23.6 billion, which were down 6%.</p>
          <p>Industrial sales were in line with our expectations. If you look at the last 18 months of orders, we had said that Industrial sales would be down. And through the first half, we were down 5%. The third quarter was down 6.</p>
          <p>Financial Services revenues down 2%, as we continue to shrink the book. And we earned 3.2 billion in net income, which was up 29%. And for earnings per share, we earned $0.29, including the cost of the preferred dividend. And earnings per share were up 32%.</p>
          <p>As Jeff covered, the total cash flow from operating activities was very strong, 10.1 billion year to date, putting us at the high end of our original range.</p>
          <p>And taxes were pretty steady in the quarter. The consolidated tax rate for the third quarter is 9%. That rate is up from a negative 25% in the third quarter of '09, mainly because of the improvement in pre-tax earnings at GE Capital.</p>
          <p>If you look, the GE tax rate is flat with 2009 at 22%. And then on GE Capital, the rate for the third quarter goes from a large positive in 2009, where we had a large credit, to a negative in 2010. The negative rate in 2010 reflects a net tax benefit or a credit on 1.5 billion of higher GECS pre-tax income year over year.</p>
          <p>We expect the GE rate for the full year to be in the mid-20s, excluding the NBCU disposition. And that would be a bit lower than the third quarter year-to-date rate of 26% due to some likely audit resolutions that we see &#x2013; are working on for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the right side are the segment results. Our Industrial businesses ex-media had 3.2 billion of segment profit. That was down 5%. You can see NBC Universal's operating results are down 15, but the real results are better than the reported results. I'll show you that on the details of the upcoming NBCU page. And GE Capital continues to demonstrate it's in a rebound. Net income of 870 million. It's up six times from last year. So overall segment profit was up 11, and then with lower restructuring at corporate versus last year, total earnings were up 29%.</p>
          <p>We always show you the items that happened in the quarter that we want to report separately. If you look at the top left, you can see that in the third quarter, the corporate restructuring and other items were insignificant. We had net of zero on restructuring and other items, and no gains in the corporate line.</p>
          <p>The item that we have to talk about today is in discontinued operations. As you saw in our press release, we added a significant amount to our reserve for the losses related to our Japanese consumer Grey Zone exposure. We booked a $1.1 billion charge in the quarter in discontinued operations, and I'll take you through the details on the right side.</p>
          <p>The chart on the top right, that's an update from our second quarter call. And as you can see, the average daily claims which we experienced in Japan continued to decline in July and August. However, they increased in September. One of the independent personal loan companies in Japan, Takefuji, was rumored to be in financial distress during the month. At the end of the month, they filed for bankruptcy. We don't know the specific impact of that event on these claims, but we do know that September daily claims were up after declining for six straight months.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we completed a significant study of the Grey Zone claims trends. We made a decision in the quarter to adjust our reserve estimate to our best estimate of the ultimate exposure. If you remember, previously we were booking to the low end of our range, and that resulted in a 1.1 billion addition to our reserves, bringing our total reserves to 1.7 billion at the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>Now the average monthly losses for the Q3 incoming claims are about 60 million a month. And so our current reserve represents over 24 months of future coverage, even if you assume there's no further reduction from today's levels. If you look at history, though, we do believe claims will continue to come down. If you go from the first quarter to the third quarter, claims are down 27%. If you go from last year to this year, claims are down over 35%. So we do believe claims will continue to come down, and we're going to continue to aggressively manage the claims process in Japan with Shinsei. At the end of the day, we moved off the low end of the range to our best estimate. And based on what we know today, we believe we fully addressed this issue.</p>
          <p>I'll go into the businesses. For the business results, I'm going to start with GE Capital. Mike Neal and the team had another very positive quarter obviously. Revenue of 11.6 was down three, driven by lower assets and some dispositions. Pre-tax earnings of 527 million, they were up 1.5 billion versus last year, a tremendous improvement. Net income of 870 million was up over 700 million versus last year. And that's a result of lower credit costs, higher margins on the business, partially offset by lower assets and higher impairments in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We ended Q3 with 489 million of ending net investment [ENI]. That's down 7% from last year. And we're well on our way to hitting the 440 billion ENI target by 2012.</p>
          <p>Another highlight in the quarter would be the new volume. If you look, commercial volume was up 45% over last year to 10.6 billion, mostly driven by CLL [Commercial Lending and Leasing] with very strong margins. And overall, we did 40 billion of volume, and that included consumer coming down too as we shrink in the places we want to shrink.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to cover the asset quality metrics in the next few pages, so here are a few comments by the main businesses. First is Commercial Real Estate; the environment continued to be challenging, as we expected. The business lost 405 million in net income. That was 133 million better than last year and also over 100 million better than Q2, but it's still a large loss. We recorded 178 million of after-tax credit losses on our debt portfolio. And the declines globally have started to really abate. The average decline in our global property values was zero to 1%. But for the properties where we took a reserve, the decline was an average 7%.</p>
          <p>We also incurred 315 million of after-tax marks and impairments on our equity portfolio.</p>
          <p>There were some positives in the quarter. We sold 90 properties for 700 million. And overall, our assets are down to 75 billion, down 10% from last year and down 2% from Q2, even with some impact from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Non-earning assets in real estate were down 200 million. However, as you look forward, we still expect the real estate business to remain under pressure for the near future.</p>
          <p>Commercial Lending and Leasing also had a very strong quarter; earnings of 443 million, up 313 million versus last year. Those results were driven by lower losses, lower marks and impairments, and higher core margins. That all reflects the improvements in asset quality.</p>
          <p>GECAS [GE Commercial Aviation Services] of 158 million, those earnings were down 16% as we completed our annual impairment review in the quarter. Impairments of 260 million pre-tax were higher than last year, driven by some valuation declines on 737 classics and 50-seat regional jets. Those impairments were partially offset again in GECAS by lower credit costs and higher core income. And the portfolio remains in great shape, where we have zero non-earning assets.</p>
          <p>And Energy Financial Services [EFS] also had a good quarter, with earnings up 34.</p>
          <p>The real highlight in the quarter is our Consumer business. We had another great quarter there. It delivered 826 million of net income, up 380 million. The earnings growth came from lower credit losses, partially offset by some lower assets. U.S. Retail Finance earned 329 million, up over 100%, driven by portfolio quality improvements and better margins.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer business, Global Banking had a good quarter. Global Banking earned 293 million, up 80%, driven by lower credit costs.</p>
          <p>And UK Home Lending also earned 45 million in the quarter. And our owned real estate stock in the UK is the lowest it has been since the second quarter of '08. We ended the quarter with 746 properties, and we continue to do better than our marks on the properties that we do sell. The realization in the quarter was 116%.</p>
          <p>So overall, a really positive outlook for GE Capital, the second positive growth quarter in a row, demonstrating the turnaround and the recovery that we're having in GE Capital.</p>
          <p>On the next page is the asset quality, delinquencies, and non-earnings. In the interest of time and as these metrics are all improving, I'm just going to summarize a few key points. If you look at both equipment and consumer, our delinquencies and our non-earning balances and our percents continue to improve. All the trends are down slightly from Q2. Down on the bottom left for real estate, the delinquency dollars were flat, but our delinquency rate went up slightly because the book is down a bit, and real estate non-earnings were also down 200 million. We have a GE Capital analyst event that we scheduled for Tuesday, December 7th, and the team is going to provide a lot more detail on this and other topics at that time.</p>
          <p>Next is an update on reserves. If you look at reserve balances, they were flat from Q2 to Q3 at 9.1 billion. Reserve coverage increased slightly to 2.69%. We had 1.7 billion in new provisions against 1.8 billion of write-offs. Some rounding and foreign exchange impact left the reserve flat at 9.1. If you look at the two business segments, commercial reserves are up. That's driven by real estate, but coverage is up. And if you look at the details, both our commercial 30-day delinquency dollars, so the actual dollars that are past due, and our commercial non-earning assets are both down 300 million Q3 versus Q2. When you look at the collateralized position, we feel confident about the recovery we're going to have relative to the non-earning amounts that are out there.</p>
          <p>For the Consumer businesses, coverage is down slightly, driven by the continued improvement in the portfolio quality metrics. Even for Consumer, the managed delinquency dollars are down 250 million in Q3 versus Q2. And non-earning Consumer assets are down about 60 million Q3 versus Q2. So we feel great about the overall GE Capital asset quality and reserve coverage. And Jeff Bornstein is going to cover this in more detail during the upcoming GE Capital analyst meeting.</p>
          <p>I'll start the Industrial businesses with NBC Universal. Jeff Zucker and the team had a pretty solid quarter, adjusting for the non-repeat of last year's AETN [A&amp;E Television Networks] gain. If you look, the reported revenues on the left side of 4.1 billion were flat, and reported op profit of 625 million is down 15%. However, the operating performance was better than that. On the right side, if you take out the net impact of the AETN gain and impairment charges which we highlighted last year, those netted to a positive 137 million in Q3 '09. If you adjust for that, the operating result for the quarter would have been up 5%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the dynamics for the business, cable continued to deliver strong performance. Revenues of 1.2 billion were up 8% and segment profit was up 22%, led by strength across the entertainment portfolio. If you look at broadcast, the revenues of 1.4 billion were down 2%. And the segment profit here was down about 80 million, driven by the significant investments that the team has made in primetime. Local market remained strong in the third quarter. Local markets were up 18%, which is a good sign. And the scatter market remained strong. For the third quarter, it was up 20%-plus on the network and on cable. And we continue to see scatter up double digits in the fourth quarter versus the most recent upfront.</p>
          <p>Film and Parks had a strong quarter. Revenues were up 16%. Segment profit was up more than two times from last year, a great result with the movie Despicable Me. And our Parks business had their best quarter ever, driven by success of Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. They had a record quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to work with the regulatory reviews. We're cooperating fully. We hope to close the transaction with Comcast by year end, and continue to prepare for the closing. We had a successful debt offering, so we've completed the JV's financing. And we also completed the initial partial purchase from Vivendi for $2 billion, increasing our ownership stake by about 7.5%; so lots going on at NBC and a pretty good operational quarter.</p>
          <p>Next is Technology Infrastructure. John Rice and his team delivered a third quarter in line with our expectations. The outlook was consistent with what we delivered in the second quarter, as we said.</p>
          <p>If you look at the key businesses, I'd start with Aviation. Orders of 5 billion were up 10%. We're definitely seeing a pickup in aviation equipment orders. Commercial engine orders of 1.5 billion were up 57%. CFM orders were up 196%. GE90 orders were up 70%. GEnx orders were up 100%. So the increase is very broad based. Military orders of 500 million in the quarter were down 9%. We ended the quarter with our major equipment backlog at 19.6 billion, which is up 2% from the second quarter.</p>
          <p>For Service, orders in the quarter were down 6%. Our commercial spare parts orders were 22.2 million per day, which is a pretty good rate. The rate compared to reported last year is down two, but we continue to report we had an Aviall order last year. If you adjust for that Aviall order, the rate in the third quarter would have been up 25%; so we are definitely seeing a pickup relative to last year. We had a real decline in the third quarter. And at 22.2, that's a good healthy orders rate for the spares business.</p>
          <p>Revenues of 4.4 billion were down 3%. That's driven by lower military unit deliveries, which were down 14% in the quarter. And that was partially offset by higher commercial deliveries, which were up 2%. We had 463 deliveries of commercial engines this year in the quarter versus 456 last year. So our revenue, Service revenues were down 3%. That was driven by about 4% lower overhauls.</p>
          <p>Segment profit was down 17%. That's consistent with our results in the first half. Basically the Aviation business has had 16% down in profit through the half. And the third quarter included one difficult comparison against the gain on Wolverhampton sale in the third quarter of '09. And we also started shipping the new GEnx engines, as Jeff said, which pressured our margins a bit in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For Healthcare, the Healthcare team continued to see a stronger market. Orders of 4.2 billion were up 6%. Equipment orders were up 8%. If you look at some of the pieces, diagnostic imaging was up 5%, driven by double-digit gains in both CT and MR globally. U.S. diagnostic imaging was flat. Clinical Systems was very strong, up 16%, and U.S. Clinical Systems were up 17%. China was up 18%. India was up 36%, and service orders overall were up 1%. We ended Q3 with a $4 billion equipment backlog. That's up 18% versus last year and up 5% versus Q2. And segment profit was up 14% as the strong volume and productivity more than offset the impact of pricing.</p>
          <p>Next is Transportation. Transportation's results continue to be impacted by a tough operating environment. However, if you look at all the indicators, the market outlook is getting much better. Orders of 1.4 billion in the quarter were up 122%. Equipment orders of 900 million were up five times over last year, and that was split both domestically and internationally. Service orders were up 15%. The number of parked locomotives declined from 3,000 at the end of Q2 to 2,350 at the end of Q3 as rail volumes were up 13% year to date. In the quarter, revenue of 869 million; that was down 10%, driven by 18% fewer locomotives. We shipped 96 locomotives this year versus 117 last year. And services were also down 10%.</p>
          <p>Segment profit of 101 million was down 43%, reflecting the lower volume. So while the business results were down in the quarter, the environment here definitely is improving.</p>
          <p>Next is Energy. John Krenicki and the Energy team held profits flat despite having lower equipment volumes. Revenues of 8.4 billion were down 14%. Segment profit of 1.7 billion was flat. If you look at Energy, Energy orders of 7.5 billion were up 2%. Equipment orders of 3.2 billion were down 5%. That was really driven by Power &amp; Water. Power &amp; Water equipment orders were down 9%, driven by thermal. We had orders for 15 gas turbines this year versus 23 last year. The 23 last year included 15 of the Iraq units, so it was one large order. Wind orders of 1.1 billion were down 15%. We received orders for 500 wind turbines this year, which was down about 60 units.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we had orders 25 Aero units this year versus six last year, 290 Jenbacher units versus 206 last year. And service orders of 4.2 billion were up 8%, driven by strong growth in core energy services.</p>
          <p>Revenues of 6.8 billion were down 15%. Equipment revenue was down 21%. That was really driven by lower wind units. We delivered 616 units this year versus 935 last year. And also less non-GE balance of some of the big projects; that was about 325 million less revenue year over year. That was partially offset by higher gas turbine units. We shipped 24 units this quarter versus 16 last year.</p>
          <p>Service revenue 3.1 billion was down 6%, driven by lower outage and parts revenues. And segment profit of 1.4 billion was up 4%. The team did a great job managing margins. We had price increases. We had material deflation, and we had good variable cost productivity more than offsetting the impact of lower volume.</p>
          <p>Oil &amp; Gas orders of 1.7 billion were down 22%. This is really a tough comparison quarter. We had equipment orders of 700 million. That was down 44%, mainly because of the tough comparisons. Last year, we had 500 million of one order. The Gorgon order was booked in Q3. And we also had about 370 million of equipment orders pushed out of Q3. So year-to-date equipment orders of 3.1 billion are down about 10%, a lot better than what we had in the quarter with the lumpiness we have here. And we expect the fourth quarter to be pretty good.</p>
          <p>Service orders of 950 million were up 12%, driven by strong spare parts sales and also upgrades. For the quarter, revenues of 1.8 billion were down 9%. Equipment revenues were down 14, driven by lower downstream volume. Last year in the third quarter, we delivered five reactors for the petrochemical industry, and this year we didn't have any. So we're really making a shift from the downstream business to the upstream business as we go from petrochemicals and processing up into LNG. And you're going to see that shift over the next year and a half.</p>
          <p>Service revenues in the quarter were down 1%, up 6% ex-FX. And segment profit of 287 was down 15%, driven by lower reactor volume and the impact of the stronger dollar year over year, which hurt Oil &amp; Gas. If you exclude those two items, segment profit was about flat in the quarter. So the Energy team delivered flat profit in a little tougher comparison and tougher environment quarter.</p>
          <p>Next is Home &amp; Business Solutions. Charlene Begley and the Home &amp; Business Solutions team had a flat quarter in Q3. It's really driven by weakness in the appliance market. Revenues of 2.1 billion were down 1%. Segment profit of 104 million was flat with last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the market, we saw really good strength, continued strength in lighting. And it's driven by the energy efficiency trends. We had great volume in those products, including compact fluorescents, LEDs, and new ballasts. Orders for lighting in the quarter were up 9%. For appliance, the market was down 4% in the third quarter. And our orders were down 6% with continued weakness in the contract channel. Multi-family was very weak in the quarter, and that's affecting the overall business.</p>
          <p>If you look, segment profit at 104 was flat. That includes the impact of higher costs that we've put into the appliances to meet the new ENERGY STAR standards, which on a net basis is a positive because it resulted in 51 million of tax credits that aren't included in the pre-tax numbers above.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in Home &amp; Business Solutions. If you look, in the quarter R&amp;D was up 27%. We're also going to be doing more investments over the next several quarters, and you'll be seeing announcements on things like the lighting expansion in Ohio and other plants that we're going to be working on. So the markets are mixed, but we're maintaining our profitability and we're doing a lot of investment for the future, especially around energy.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Jeff.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Keith. Thanks.</p>
          <p>And just to give you some more color on the year and going forward, going back to the 2010 earnings framework, as we finish the year, we expect positive earnings growth in the fourth quarter in our Industrial and at NBCU and then our GE Capital business based on improving markets and solid execution. So we're going to see pretty good momentum from a business standpoint and operating standpoint as we get into fourth quarter; good margin performance in Media, strong markets and good performance in Cable and Parks. And in GE Capital, the recovery continues.</p>
          <p>We'll have several fourth quarter items on the corporate line. These will include some gains. For instance, if we close NBC Universal, there will be a gain associated with that and some tax settlements, offset by restructuring and some other items. One of those items might be for instance, we're in discussion with the EPA on phase two of the Hudson River. And even while we have a good reserve already set up for phase two, we don't know where those discussions will go, and we'll work on that with the EPA in the fourth quarter. So in all, this will likely be a slight negative in the quarter in the corporate items.</p>
          <p>We've done a lot to strengthen the company for 2011 and beyond. We have a very strong backlog and are executing well. And as we've said all along, the capital allocation optionality is very sound for the company. I'll give an update this in December.</p>
          <p>But as we sit here today and I think about the company going forward, we really expect Industrial earnings to grow; and by that I mean Infrastructure and Home &amp; Business Solutions. We expect growth in those segments going forward into the future. We expect solid earnings growth in GE Capital. We expect to have pension headwinds. And as we complete the NBC Universal joint venture with Comcast, we expect some dilution there; it's to be expected. So that's the way I think about 2010 as we finish the year, and a prelude into how we ought to look at the December meeting and the company going forward.</p>
          <p>And then just to wrap it up on a chart I've used in the past, I think the attractive financial profile remains intact with good momentum in the future, strong financial flexibility. This is parent cash. And again, the fourth quarter number reflects the increased dividend, the buyback, and the announced M&amp;A. So we can put that cash already to work, and that financial flexibility grows over time.</p>
          <p>And the things that we said we were going to work on, we've made good progress on, repositioning GE Capital to have good profit growth and competitive advantage. I think third quarter gives you a pretty good sense of that. Growth and return on infrastructure over time, you can see we're investing in R&amp;D, and the product pipeline is robust.</p>
          <p>Building enterprise value around process excellence, we had very high margins through the downturn. And our working capital turns are very strong inside the company.</p>
          <p>And then capital allocation will create long-term shareholder value. We've started the buyback. We've increased the dividend. And you've seen what we've done on strategic M&amp;A, so we've done what we said we would do over the last year or so on capital allocation.</p>
          <p>So that's it for the quarter, and now we have a chance to take some questions, Trevor. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question around the order rates for 2011, can you give us some perspective on this quarter, the conversion rate into next year? Based on what you're seeing now, how much of that converts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look historically, somewhere between 85% and 90% or so of the orders you bring into the backlog at the end of the year would convert into sales in the next year. If we end the year, for example in Energy, with 13 billion of backlog, you're probably going to get 90% of that converting into sales on average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's true for the current Aviation profile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aviation is a little longer backlog. If you think about that, I'd use run rates in Aviation more than a backlog conversion because if you look, the air framers are pretty much full. They're increasing their rates a bit. If you look at the announcements between now and 2012, they're going to have a significant increase in their production rates. But I'd work off of run rates there. The 777 is going to go from five to seven a month by '12. The 737 is going to go from 31 to 38 a month by '13. The A320 is going from 34 to 40 a month by '12. So that's the thing I'd look at as the air frame run rates for Aviation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think beyond that, Keith, on Aviation, you should just have the Boeing forecast on 787s &#x2013; you've got a lot of juice there given our penetration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And am I correct, if I exclude the Iraqi order and at least normalize it from Q2, equipment at the time instead of being up 17% was probably up mid-single digits. So this 9% increase I should think about relative to a mid-single digit increase in the last quarter if I normalize for that, or is that not right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third quarter year-to-date equipment orders are up four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the longer period should take for the long-cycle orders to give you a better feel for the run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steven, the way I would look at it, I'd divide Energy more or less into four buckets. You've got the Service business, where orders are picking up and are going to stay really very strong. And then you've got Oil &amp; Gas, where Keith really talked about some of the transitions in Oil &amp; Gas, but they're probably flattish to down slightly so far. But there's no reason to expect Oil &amp; Gas not to be decent as we go forward.</p>
          <p>What I would call the fossil fleet in total, which is heavy-duty gas turbines, Jenbacher, Aero derivatives, all that stuff, those are flattish and I think will probably stay in that range. And then renewables we expect to be down slightly as you go. They were down year to date and will probably continue to be under pressure as we go forward. So I think about it in those four buckets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And just on GECS a little bit, the E&amp;I I saw was just up a little bit in the supplemental on the quarter versus the last, 49 versus 47. Is that trending &#x2013; anything we should note about the trend relative to your targets on reducing the size of capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think if you look at page three of the presentation, we show you that the business reductions in the quarter were strong again. The business reductions were down 9 billion. But with the dollar in the mark from the second quarter to the third quarter, that increased assets by 11 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of our business reductions, we're still ahead of schedule, and we're well on track to hit the 440. One of the things that we did in the quarter, as you saw, we also purchased some assets from Citigroup. It's another indication that we're ahead of our shrinkage targets, and we have room for some bulk origination as well as the good underwriting and the origination that we're seeing from the Commercial teams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on Shinsei, just a little bit more clarity. The 11% assumed claims per month reduction, that was the run rate that we had from you guys before. So what number are you thinking of now based on the additional reserving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically when you look at the last 12 months of claims activity and you include September, where September went up; and as we said, obviously the Takefuji event had some impact on it, but I don't know how much. If you look at the rates: three-month, six-month, nine-month, and twelve-month, reductions in claims per month, they range from 2% to 6%. So we basically have taken the midpoint of the range, which is the twelve-month reduction of an average of about 4%, Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. What was the organic growth for the Industrial business, Keith or Jeff, this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, organic, let me grab that for you. If you look for Industrial, total was down four. Energy was down 12. Tech was flat. And H&amp;BS was up one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. There was no corporate restructuring, and I think &#x2013; and I can't remember if you noted this officially or just it was suggested that I think you did about $0.03 in the first half. And I had thought the second half was actually going to be an overall ramp from the $0.03 rate. Does that imply, and I think this goes back to Jeff's comments, does that imply there is a potentially fairly large restructuring action coming in the fourth quarter, maybe offset with BAC sale gains and possibly NBC or some other stuff? How should we think about that? What really would be the nature of it? Is it a cleanup heading into 2011, or is it catching up with other things, or how would you like us to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as Jeff said, in the fourth quarter we have a number of items that are potentially going to happen. We're expecting the NBC deal to close. If the NBC deal closes in the fourth quarter, that should result in a small after-tax gain. We do expect some tax settlements. We're working right now on years 2003 to 2005 with the IRS, and we're in final discussions. Will it happen and what will the amount be is hard to say, but that could be in there.</p>
          <p>So offsetting those things are a variety of opportunities, whether it's asset sales or it's continued restructuring like you've seen us do in terms of taking the cost structure down or other charges like the environmental that Jeff said. I think our anticipation is that the negatives will likely be more than offset by some of the positives that we have in the quarter. We don't know. At the end of the day, when you do &#x2013; year over year I think is the way to look at it, John. We had a net last year in the quarter of about $0.06, about $0.06 of gains that we had and $0.09 of negatives if you look at last year's fourth quarter, for a net of $0.03 of restructuring in the quarter. And our view is that right now, the restructuring in the fourth quarter and other charges will probably be a little higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't really time these things. A lot of them are under discussion. I think we always anticipated some of them would be back-end loaded, and that's where we are. I think all of them in many ways take risk out of let's say 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like you're just being opportunistic. There's not some big thing you're working toward, if that makes sense. Just lastly, the market has been antsy towards the banks possibly having to repurchase bad mortgages. I was just thinking out loud. Are there any implications as it pertains to your previous ownership of WMC? I know you've got to go back. I glanced at the K, and it says that you do actually retain some sort of obligation for liabilities or loans previously sold. So how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We obviously are watching that. I'd say that we've had a very good experience in 2010 and 2009. When we first exited WMC, that's when we had our wave of negotiations and settlements with the banks around mortgages that the team had underwritten and sold. At the end of 2009, we had a reserve of about $200 million. The current reserve is about half of that, but we had pending claims at 2009 of close to $800 million. And the pending claims are down over around 250 million. We've had very favorable settlement rates on the claims, and the claims per month have come down in 2010 versus the 2009 levels.</p>
          <p>I think our team is on top of it. I think we've dealt with most of what we had to deal with as far as we know. We dealt with everything we had to deal with back when we first exited WMC, and we had a big reserve and we had a lot of settlements. That activity has really declined substantially. As far as our view of this right now is that we're in pretty good shape here on WMC.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question on your comfort zone around non-earnings coverage, it has continued to tick up here; now we're at 74%. In the back you show where you think you are versus Commercial and Consumer at like 260 for Commercial, 298 for Consumer. Where does this 74% go? Obviously non-earning dollars are down, and you expect losses to be better than non-earnings. Where does that 74% go from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to depend upon how we do in terms of working out the collateral positions we have. But I feel great about our non-earning coverage. If you look at the data that we've had where we put up a certain amount of reserves and we had a certain amount of non-earnings like if you go back to the third quarter &#x2013; or the fourth quarter of 2009 and look at the amount of non-earnings in the reserves, we basically worked through the majority of those non-earnings by the end of third quarter. And then as we have additional new non-earnings, we're continuing to work through, and we work through them in a way that's generally favorable versus our reserve position.</p>
          <p>So we feel strongly about our collateral coverage. And that's one thing that we're going to have Jeff Bornstein give a bigger update on when we get to the December meeting. We have charts we did in July last year where we went through the details of non-earning revisions that we had and what would actually happen. We're going to update those in December and go through them with you. But we feel pretty good about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It just seems like you're selling things for greater than the carrying value and things like that. And you've got this big &#x2013; I'm just wondering when that 74% goes down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really the driver is going to be how you think about new provisions on losses relative to the quality of the book. And as delinquencies and non-earnings continue to improve, as you say, those additional provisions quarter to quarter are going to continue to come down. And that's going to be really what drives the future profitability here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the Industrial side, just a question about the improvement you're talking about in the aerospace aftermarket. On the last call, you said airlines were deferring overhauls and things. What are you seeing in terms of changing behavior on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're seeing quite a bit of activity in the marketplace, obviously. If you look, revenue passenger miles were up 6.4% August year to date. Cargo is up almost 20% August year to date. The parked fleet has started to change a little bit. About 13% of the world's fleet was parked in the first half of the year. That's down to 12%. We've seen a number of cargo planes come out of the parked fleet. And we saw the orders picking up if you look at spares relative to last year ex the Aviall. So I think it looks pretty good. We feel pretty good about the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the last one and then I'll go. Just on Basel III requirements and an update there on your thoughts; it sounds like you're pretty comfortable. But just in terms of where you are risk-weighted asset treatment and things like that, any color?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot is still to be determined. I think first of all, most of our entities are not subject directly to the Basel standards. So I think we're still going to have to work through how much and what is going to be impacted by Basel III. We've looked at the main published criteria for capital levels and for liquidity. And if you look 7% Tier 1 capital requirement, Tier 1 common capital requirement by 2019, I know everyone is going to get to these requirements much sooner than that. And you look at where we are today, even with adjustments we think we may have to make to the risk-weighted asset measurement or what's accounted for as Tier 1 common capital, we feel pretty good that even by the end of this year, we're going to be in the ranges here that we need to be in.</p>
          <p>So there are still more details to be worked out. But obviously as we shrink GE Capital and we continue to leave that capital in through 2010 and through 2011, we continue to strengthen the capital ratios that we think we'll be in good shape. We don't have any of the big adjustments that some of the banks have on risk-weighted assets for a couple of things, like we don't have a lot of subordinated capital. We don't have any mortgage servicing rights. We don't have some of the bigger things that are creating some of the adjustments out there. And I think that bodes well for us as we go forward.</p>
          <p>And then on the liquidity measurements, we feel great about that obviously with the amount of cash that we have and bringing down the CP balances, we feel like the outlook for that is in pretty good shape as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with a two-part question on M&amp;A, and I'd like you to put the announcements last week in context, if you could, especially in the acquisition the Consumer Finance portfolio. Would that suggest &#x2013; are you seeing bottom of the cycle there? You're not just shrinking that book, but you're also selectively looking to grow? That's the first part of the question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, as you do look at allocation of capital, and by our assessment this would potentially be the biggest M&amp;A cycle for GE, are you changing any of the processes of how you're vetting acquisition candidates, and what does the environment look like today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say just first on Consumer Finance, and I'd like Jeff to comment on overall M&amp;A and ROI, I think if you look at what we were able to do, we were able to add to a space where we've got a real competitive advantage on distribution. We're basically a unique provider of capital to retail distribution in this country, and we have a tremendous franchise that Mark Begor and Glenn Marino run. And they are performing extremely well in the current cycle in terms of their asset quality measurements. And you saw the income in the Consumer business and the U.S. retail business. A lot of that is in this retail distribution.</p>
          <p>What we acquired were additional retail distribution arrangements. It's more like a B-to-B financing. And it wasn't in the private label credit card, which is also doing extremely well. I feel great about that. Adding to that is a place where we've got a nice competitive advantage on distribution. We've got a tremendous business franchise. And we bought assets at a very attractive price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Deane, on the other part of your question, I'd first say our teams are doing a great job on cash generation. I think everybody is really focused on it. B), with the incremental capital that we have from the NBCU transaction when that takes place, that really gives us some real tailwind there. The third thing I'd say just to reiterate what Keith said earlier, is that we think GE Capital is going to create its own strength, and that's well underway. And so I think GE Capital is in great shape.</p>
          <p>So we started the buyback. We've increased the dividend. And on the strategic and Industrial M&amp;A, I think some of the things that we talked about at EPG on the size of deal, we'll be disciplined on the size of deal. These will all be infrastructure. All the deals we do will be infrastructure deals. They'll be bolt-ons to the core of what we're doing in terms of inside the business. And we think that as we do these kinds of deals that they will be able to accrete in a relatively short time period from a standpoint of what we'll pay and how we value them. They all return greater than our cost of capital. So just the things that I've talked about in the past, I would say what you saw last week is what we'll continue to try to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you're limited in what you can say about Wellstream, but should the takeaway be that there are valuations at which they're considered just too expensive? And will you &#x2013; if you can't spend all this capital, should we infer that there would be more buybacks potentially and higher dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what? I would say I can't say anything about Wellstream, period. The second thing I'd say is that there are good opportunities out there, we think. And the third thing I'd say is that if we don't see good opportunities, we'll increase the dividend and do more buyback.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on the GE Capital operating cost structure. Do you think you need to do some more dramatic downsizing there to trend to a smaller, more focused GE Capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will be pruning. I think we've done a dramatic restructuring if you look at the change in the cost structure and how much we've taken out of the SG&amp;A of that business over the last 18 months. Today we're going to continue to shrink the things that we're running off. The global mortgages will continue to shrink. But we've really cut the cost base dramatically.</p>
          <p>Today we're looking at some things in investment around the mid-market on distribution in the areas where we may be able to take advantage of some of the disruptions because of the capital requirements of the banks or other things where we provide a real competitive advantage. We get local. We're totally connected to the mid-market customer. We're underwriting their assets. We're willing to take the residual risk because we know the assets, and we've got a pretty good value proposition. So I don't think there's going to be a dramatic change in the cost structure there. I think we're going to continue to run off the places that we've said are red assets. You've seen us doing that. And we're going to incrementally add in places where we think we have a competitive advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the cash balance at GE Capital, how should we think about when that could start to trend back in the direction towards historical levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way I think about it, it's significant today. It's high today as we brought the CP down, as we continue to maintain the bank lines. That basically is allowing us to continue to prefund in advance of maturities. And I think what we're going to do is work our way through 2011. And then obviously we have the TLGP maturities in 2011 and in 2012. And when we get through into what I call a normalized period, Christopher, we're going to definitely be able to bring the cash balance down. We're going to bring the CP down, and we'll probably operate with less bank lines as we go into that environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of ratios and safe and secure, we're going to be able to keep our cash plus our bank lines at two times our CP. And I think until you work your way through to a normalized period, which we should work through in '12, we're probably going to have the $60 billion range cash, 50 billion to 60 billion, as we work our way through that.</p>
          <p>But I think after that period in a normalized place, you're going to be able to bring that down to a lower level and still be above &#x2013; well &#x2013; above whatever the standards are for the important liquidity measurements for the regulators.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to touch on Energy for a second. So wind was obviously pretty bad. I think you said the thermal deliveries were up nicely, yet the revenues were still pretty light. Can you maybe just talk about what else happened in the segment there?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the margins, pretty good margins on the revenue performance, yet your value gap closed relative to last quarter. So is there something in the mix there that drove that margin, that we should be aware of going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say on revenues, if you look, again, the biggest item was renewables. And if you look with the Wind volume, it was down &#x2013; wind turbines were down 300 units. It's down $600 million of revenue in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Then we had $300 million of balance of plant. When we do a large power plant, a lot of the times, we source material and just include it in the project, but it's not GE material. 300 million less. That doesn't have a lot of calories in it, obviously &#x2013; margin calories for us. So that's almost $1 billion of the revenue decline.</p>
          <p>And those were the biggest factors, I'd say. We had some lower steam turbine units. We had a couple lower generators, but the biggest were those two items.</p>
          <p>In terms of margins in Energy, the team is doing a tremendous job. They're really working on protecting the price and the backlog. They're doing a great job on sourcing and getting deflation. They're working their way through a wind market that has really collapsed in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And we've got a very attractive position there. And they're adding value by putting new products in place that give customers a little more value, the 1.6 instead of the 1.5 on the wind turbines, and things like that. They've done a good job working their way through this. I think Services margins have held in, in all the infrastructure segments. They've stayed strong.</p>
          <p>I don't have one specific mix item. With the revenue down and we're continuing to provide high margin equipment in places like the gas turbines, and the wind margin that's in backlog is very high, these guys have done a good job, combined with sourcing benefits we're getting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd say, Steve, is the power gen units are being used right now in the customers' fleets, and that bodes well, I think, for Energy Services in the rest of this year and into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you use the term collapsed in the wind market. How is renewables down modestly next year in the face of what looks to be a pretty horrid environment from an order perspective in wind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of that's going to come globally, Steve. Canada, Brazil, Turkey, places like that, I think, are where a lot of the demand is going to be. I'd say probably at lower margins than the U.S., the ones we booked a year or so ago in the U.S. But that is where the demand will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one last question on GE Capital. You talked about holding 50 billion to 60 billion of cash. That seems to be significantly higher than the 25 to 40 you guided to last December in that strategic funding plan slide you gave. Is that just driven by lack of visibility on the new regs?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you gave us a nice margin number, a portfolio margin number last quarter. I think it was somewhere in the 5.2 range year to date. Can you maybe just update us on whether that's tracking towards that number or what it did in the quarter, and how we see that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we haven't changed the cash outlook. I guess I'd ask Trevor to look at the chart with you and see what we're dealing with.</p>
          <p>I think we've been saying 50 billion to 60 billion of cash in GE Capital. We just did a bunch of bonds at the end of the quarter that gave us a little bit of cash in advance. We're going to look at when the market opportunities are there for us to fund ourselves, and we did 5 billion right at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>I think when you looked at the numbers on that, maybe we're dealing with 40 billion in '13, and that's consistent with what I just said, I'd say.</p>
          <p>In terms of margins, I think the quarter was about 5.1 in the margins, so it's pretty similar to what we had in the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to follow up on Steve's question a bit because I think from the phone calls I'm getting in, the biggest angst out there is coming from the revenue decline in Energy infrastructure.</p>
          <p>How much &#x2013; I guess my question is were you guys as surprised as we were at how bad things got in Wind this fast? Or was it something that we just modeled out wrong and missed the rate of change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been talking about the wind market for quite a while here, and we weren't surprised by it at all. Maybe we've got to look at how do we model it with you guys a little better. But really it's something that's consistent with what John Krenicki and the team have basically been saying to us all along, and the way we've been planning to run the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. So let's dig into that a little bit. If you think in terms of Wind revenues down 32%, can you make money in the business at that kind of level? Do we have a much bigger swing in profits? I know you outsource a lot of components here and so can moderate production down pretty fast. But how do we think about decremental margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Wind can stay very profitable for us. It's an attractive business. We don't disclose the specific profit numbers, but I would say that relative to our equipment margins, it's a very profitable business.</p>
          <p>And as Jeff said, we'll probably have a mix shift as we go from some of the backlog stuff that we have in the U.S. We worked through that in '09 a little bit. We worked through it in '10. We have some more of that in '11. And we're going to shift into international at probably what will be slightly lower margins.</p>
          <p>But it's at a very good profitability level. We're building our service business as we built out a huge install base, and that's going to, over time, contribute.</p>
          <p>We like the business. We're investing like crazy. We've got a big investment in larger wind turbines. We've got a great position that we're working on for offshore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, if I could just take you back to the mosaic that we talked about in May and then again in the second quarter, we always flag renewables as a risk. I think that's well recorded and well written about, not just with GE, but others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we've always said that, on the other side, the way the industry typically works is you get pretty good orders for the Aero derivatives and the gas units, like Jenbacher. I think that has taken place. And then that leads to a rebound in the heavy-duty gas turbine market. That's going to take place. We see pretty good demand outside the U.S. That's taking place. And our Service business is dramatically strengthening.</p>
          <p>So I think when you think about '11 and '12, we think the diversity of this business is just quite strong.</p>
          <p>And then like Keith said earlier is we remain deverticalized, so we can keep pretty good margins on something like Wind, even when the volume &#x2013; because we've seen this rodeo before, in terms of how the industry can go through these peaks and valleys.</p>
          <p>Again, I think the revenue number, I get, but I think if you look at the margin number and the diversity of the Energy portfolio, we feel pretty good about how this business is positioned to fight through the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. So let's move to something more positive, and that's Dresser. Clearly the market liked that deal. And it's the type of acquisition I don't think we've seen in a while with you guys, so it's great to see you get back to your roots again.</p>
          <p>When you think about size-wise, that's $3 billion, which is about &#x2013; if you're talking about 30 billion over three years, should we expect somewhere &#x2013; are there more deals in that size range that can move the needle? Or was that a bit of a one-off, and now you're probably looking at more like &#x2013; you call them bolt-ons, but Dresser is pretty big, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, we like Energy. We think we have a good, executing team there. And in the one to three range, really if you think about Energy and Oil &amp; Gas, there are just lots of companies in that range.</p>
          <p>So I think we have a pretty repeatable process in terms of how to get cost synergy. We don't really count on revenue synergies when we evaluate the deals. We like the supply chain. We know how to get cash out of the supply chain. So I think those are all the positives.</p>
          <p>And so we think, in an orderly way, we can chunk through and do a bunch of deals in that range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of cleanup items I think on some of the things you mentioned, just some clarifications.</p>
          <p>I guess first, Jeff, you made a number of comments on 4Q orders, and I'm trying to wrap all that up. And it sounded to me net-net that orders would be up sequentially, but probably down year over year given the tough comp in some of the businesses you had last year. Is that the right way to translate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think orders will be flattish, Terry, would be my assessment. But again, I hate to give guidance point to point, but I'd say we talked about orders should be flattish. Revenue in Q4 Industrially should be up Q over Q and flat versus year ago. That's how I'd look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the orders, you were just talking equipment, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Equipment and service.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; I was just talking equipment then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think equipment will be up slightly, flat to up slightly, in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I'm just wondering. Is there any update on some of the key Commercial Aero headwinds on R&amp;D and startup losses that we talked about last quarter, or are those numbers still roughly as you thought they were a quarter ago? In terms of the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the question again, Terry? I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about some of the 2011 headwinds in Commercial Aviation. The R&amp;D increase that we talked about last quarter as well as the startup losses on GEnx, have those numbers moved around on us at all here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a little bit that's going to happen in '10 versus what we had planned. But there's still going to be a chunk in '11 as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's still 500 to 700, if I'm remembering correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less than 500.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we looked at 500 and we said that's completely consistent with what we've -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's no worse than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, no change there. And then any update on pension headwind for next year? You did mention that I think we all can see what's happening with rates, but any finer point you want to put on that for people?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at pension, Ross, this year we're experiencing about a $1 billion pre-tax headwind. Without any other changes, that would be a similar amount next year.</p>
          <p>Today &#x2013; there's two unknowns, really, right? There's the discount rate, and then there's the &#x2013; what do you do with the earnings rate? Those are the two things being debated a lot in the world.</p>
          <p>I'd say from a discount rate perspective, today, if you had to do it, it's somewhere between &#x2013; around 70 basis points probably &#x2013; lower. But who knows what the 10-year is going to do and what the 10-year AA is going to do between now and year end?</p>
          <p>So there's variability there. We said that 25 basis points of discount rate is about $200 million of increased pension costs.</p>
          <p>And then what's your return on assets? We have an 8.5% assumption. Over a long period of time, we've more than made that. In the short period with the 2008 losses, you don't get that in the 5 and 10-year averages. But excluding that, the returns have been very good.</p>
          <p>We've got a very high equity allocation. We've got a long-term liability we're dealing with here. We're 7% through &#x2013; roughly, today, through the third quarter, up in the pension in terms of the return.</p>
          <p>So how will that play out? We'll have to see. We've said that a 50 basis point change there is somewhere around $300 million.</p>
          <p>So those size the dimension of what we may be dealing with and we'll have to give that update in December when we get to there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Just a couple other quick ones.</p>
          <p>First, Keith, on tax, I think maybe I missed it. I apologize. But the lower rate this quarter than I think you had been looking for, what was the driver there? And then it sounds like fourth quarter is closer to 20% maybe to get full year to the mid-20s. And then any counsel on '11 at this early stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the tax rate is exactly what we were expecting in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at it, it's flat to last year in terms of rate. It's 50 million higher of a provision for the Industrial. It's 750 million higher of a provision in GE Capital. So taxes are 800 million higher year over year and flat from a rate on the Industrial, and significantly higher obviously on the Capital side in terms of dollars.</p>
          <p>For the year, excluding the NBCU sale, which will create volatility in the tax rate, we're saying that we estimate the Industrial rate, which is 26% year to date third quarter, to be somewhere lower than that, and that depends upon whether or not we do reach a settlement on the 2003 to 2005 tax year. Because we're in negotiations on that, I do not have an amount on that. But the tax rate in the fourth quarter would be lower for Industrial but bring the overall rate down a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keith, if we complete NBC, that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That raises the tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will raise the tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will raise the tax rate. Because we've got a low basis, it will be a high tax on that gain. Absolutely.</p>
          <p>For '11, we'd say that Industrial rates are going to stay in the mid-20s. We don't have a change in anything structurally.</p>
          <p>And then in GE Capital, we'll have to see how things go. We would expect the rate to be similar to what we get as a total year rate this year. And we expect structural benefits of between somewhere of $1.8 billion and $2 billion.</p>
          <p>This year &#x2013; should be similar next year. And obviously we need legislation to get extended to get to those rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one last quick one. Should we anticipate a WMC reserve increase of any meaningful order of magnitude in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't foresee that at all.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Julian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Julian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question was really on the Power side, in terms of not so much volumes but what you're seeing on pricing? Because you mentioned it being high single digit negative in your order backlog at Q2. Siemens said something similar about a month ago.</p>
          <p>So I wondered if you had seen any change in pricing trends very recently, because I guess there's a sense in which the large thermal stuff &#x2013; in particular, gas &#x2013; is near its volume trough. So if you're seeing pricing starting to firm up there? Wind obviously, you're not near that volume trough, so pricing remains very difficult. And what you think that means for your value gap going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the pricing remains challenged, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, energy overall was down 2.8, Jeff. Thermal was down 5 on not a lot of orders. And obviously, Wind was down about 12 for renewables. So overall about 2.8 because you got a benefit in services. The other &#x2013; aero derivatives and stuff like that is pretty strong.</p>
          <p>And I think we're still seeing pretty good deflation, in terms of what the teams are doing in terms of productivity and material cost out and sourcing.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; we haven't gone through the budget for next year on value gap and things like that, but this team does a pretty good job in those areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I guess the &#x2013; is there still a big gap between the pricing effect in your P&amp;L and the pricing effect in your backlog, or is that gap closing already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's closing, Julian. In other words, I think if you look at &#x2013; I think things aren't getting worse, and I think it's closing. But we'll be able to reflect more when we get together in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And then secondly, just on the Healthcare market, you mentioned cost saving initiatives offsetting pricing there. I guess pricing is always a feature in Healthcare. Has there been any change there recently? And also I guess on the demand side in the U.S., has there been any change in the last three or four months, or everything is as it was in June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julian, I would say that their margin rates are pretty good. And the pricing is, if anything, slightly stronger than they had anticipated, or at least no worse.</p>
          <p>And so I think they've done a nice job there, and they're building a lot of backlog. I think the U.S. market is &#x2013; vibrant is the wrong word, but I think people are redoing their planning post-reform, and that has been generally positive.</p>
          <p>So I think the market itself and our performance is pretty good.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Deutsche Bank.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>

          <p>Hey, Nigel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hate to go back to Wind again, but I thought that Jeff's comments about the margin and the backlog on Wind is very good. I think you might have said actually improving, yet pricing down I think 8% last quarter, down 12% in this quarter.</p>
          <p>It sounds like you had a lot of success in passing through that deflation to your supply chain. I just wondered maybe if you're getting more success in going back and shaking those guys down. Maybe that's the wrong word, but certainly tremendous job with the margins. And I just wonder if you could just go into that a bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the strategy has been for a long time &#x2013; on all the stuff we do &#x2013; is to be pretty deverticalized. And I think we do a good job of working with our suppliers on productivity and cost out.</p>
          <p>All that being said, my suspicion is that the margin in the renewable business will be down year over year, and that will be offset by improvements in Services and Oil &amp; Gas and some of the other areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just it sounded on your 4Q revenue comments, I think you said flat year over year in 4Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Industrial side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Industrial side, but that implies about a 20% pickup from 3Q levels. Can you maybe just go into what's driving that pickup because it implies a nice reversion in both Energy and &#x2013; primarily Energy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it has been typical over time is that you've got &#x2013; people finish out the year, and that's when a lot of the projects complete. Healthcare in particular, there is a budgeting cycle by the hospitals that impacts Healthcare, but in some ways almost every one of our Infrastructure business has a stronger fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This has been a pretty consistent quarterly annual pattern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third quarter, a lot of our customers do shutdowns and power plants do turnarounds and stuff like that. So this is not atypical, I don't think, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that 4Q is usually higher, but at the same time, the pickup is a little higher than we usually see, but that's great news. Then Keith, on the NBC gain offset by some items, we've done some back of the envelope calculations that suggest the gain could be close to $1 billion pre-tax, and it sounds like it's going to be lower than that. Can you maybe put some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't done what the pre-tax number is. I think what we said is we'll have we believe a couple hundred million after-tax gain. As I said, it's a high tax transaction, so we're still finalizing so much around that valuation and accounting and tax. But our expectation today, my expectation today is we have a couple hundred million dollar after-tax gain. Does it have some range around it? Sure it does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one quick one, then I will pass it on. The losses have been coming in very nicely on GE Capital, $1.7 billion this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the E&amp;I target that you have, the $400 billion long-term target, what neighborhood of losses would you think is a good run rate on that asset base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you go back to our pre-crisis levels and you take a look at our average normalized Consumer losses and our average normalized Commercial losses and you look at mix of the business, our traditional loss rates are down around a little over 1%, 1.5% with a good Consumer mix. Our expectation is that we go back to pre-crisis loss levels. And then if you adjust for the mix between Commercial and Consumer, you can get a pretty good number there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Could we make sure we've got the Aviation R&amp;D thing straight? So you gave a generalized answer to Terry, but my understanding is you're thinking there's a $300 million to $500 million R&amp;D headwind next year. But that was allowing for the possibility of a 737 re-engine, which clearly isn't going to happen, and possibly allowing for an A320 re-engine, which is maybe not happening, certainly sliding further to the right. So as you look at what actually might happen as opposed to what you were conceptually prepared for, what do you think the R&amp;D headwind actually looks like?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, we haven't done our formal budgets for next year, and there's a lot I'd still like to go through. But we're shipping the GEnx engines in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year, right, so those are some of the costs associated with that. And look, it's certainly not going to be any worse next year than we've already said, and could be better. But I'd rather go through that with you as we finish this year. And I think we've made it a little bit better through stuff we've done in '10, and then we'll just see where the R&amp;D goes as we go into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a big category. The 500 million that has been discussed is not one thing. It's a total set of things, including the launch of the GEnx, including the new programs, including other expenses we have with those programs, including China, so it's a lot of things.</p>
          <p>I think if you think about it in a macro sense, it's built into our run rates. You're seeing some of it in the run rate in the third and fourth quarter here with what we've talked about in Aviation, and there are other things in 2011 that offset that. If you look, we expect to have a good improvement in the Services growth. We do have some other volume growth across the other commercial engines that aren't as pressured when you look at that compared to the GEnx. And we've got pretty good margins in the rest of that business.</p>
          <p>So it's not one lump sum thing, down X year over year. It's included in a lot of the run rate. It's just pressure that does have to be absorbed by the business as we go through a lot of development. And those development programs are multiyear. We're investing in the LEAP-X; we're going to continue to invest in the LEAP-X. I think it's a part of the fabric of that business, but it's not one lump sum number that's it's just down next year because of that. That's never what we intended it to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. So then just maybe to understand the run rate then, obviously the margins did step down in Q3. Can you give us a sense of what the GEnx impact was in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not giving out individual product margin, Jeff. These launch engines are definitely pressured when you look at the concession levels and also the learning curve on the engine, and that will improve as we go through 2010 and go through 2011. We get up to normal volumes, and it's more normal launch prices and concessions. You're going to see that continue to improve. We're not giving a specific margin per engine on a product line. We haven't traditionally done that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You ship...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's part of the fact that the business was down 17 in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you shipped physical GEnx engines in the quarter though, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We recorded revenue on about 18, and those are for the 747 so far. That engine was certified in the fourth quarter. The engine for the 787 will certify, we believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of ground has been covered here, but just over on to Oil &amp; Gas, what are the margin ramifications for this transition in the business from downstream to upstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the equipment margin ramifications are not &#x2013; it's not a change. It was really a volume thing that we were talking about. The LNG margins are at least the average margins for the equipment of this business. They've done a tremendous job on winning the LNG orders around the world. And those will be &#x2013; we had a little bit of Gorgon in the quarter, actually. So it's not a margin shift issue. It's really a timing of volume issue. And we'll show you that when we look at the fourth quarter. When you see the orders again and you look at the total year orders, you're going to feel pretty good about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there something that's driving the delay? Is it financing? Is it uncertainty about energy prices? Or is it just malaise, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we saw projects push in the quarter across the business for whatever reason, whether it's financing or it's the ability to get the resources they need to do the project in certain parts of the world. We have some constraints. If you look in Australia, the place is just packed with orders and opportunities, and they're trying to get the ability to execute. So it's a combination of things, but it doesn't change our outlook at all on the view for Oil &amp; Gas, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is mainly noise, Jeff. I really do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, just one last one. Did you say Aero spares were up some 25%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look, the reported is down two at 22 million a day, Jeff. But we have this Aviall order that we did last year and every quarter that it was for not the core business production spares where they're going to handle that for us, and that distorts the average daily order rate. If you compare it ex that Aviall order, it's up about 25%. So at 22 million a day, and again I think part of that is the comparison last year. We really dipped in the third quarter last year. As the parked planes went in and just people pushed out maintenance, we were down in the $17 million to $18 million a day range. Part of it is that. But 22 million a day, that's a really good order rate for us and a very healthy order rate for the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the Aviall comp the same in Q4, and is it totally burned off at that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q4 is the last quarter of it. I don't know the exact number, but in the Q4 numbers that I saw, I saw some Aviall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our last question comes from the line of Bob Cornell from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You always save the best for last.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Bob. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The pre-provision earnings at Capital were less than I thought at 2.2 billion versus an estimate of 2.7. But from what you said, it sounds like impairments were over 1 billion because loss impairments were 2.8. My point is it looks like that pre-provision earnings, the net interest margin actually was a positive in the quarter. Could you just take us through that a little bit and tell us what's going on in the impairments and what might happen in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First in terms of pre-tax, pre-provision, I'll go from 2Q to 3Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were 2.7 in 2Q and 3Q, so it's down about $500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>300 added due to higher marks and impairments. You've got to remember, in the quarter we had about 200 that comes from the GECAS annual impairment review. And that was a little high. It was higher than we had last year obviously. We had another 100 in Treasury in marks and impairments that again at the end of the day, those hedge marks go to zero and the instrument gets to the end of its life, but that was 100. And then we also had a little bit year over year or quarter over quarter, when you look, we had a regency positive in the second quarter that doesn't repeat. So I think if you look at it, our view is if you do pre-tax, so if you just do pre-tax, Q2 was 700. Q3 is 500, down 200. It's really all the impairments in GECAS, higher impairments in GECAS quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>And even at that level, that's pretty good profitability for GECS since part of the turnaround. It gives us plenty of pre-tax. We don't believe we're going to have any payment other than income maintenance agreement. And again, I think the impairments &#x2013; at the end of the day, those are not run rate types of things. Those are things that we're having to deal with on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and they're not going to be staying at those levels in the run rates forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the net interest margin third over second, and was that trending up or trending down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what that number is, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the point is are you seeing some margin compression in the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, we were at 5.2 versus 5.1, so a 5.1 versus 5.2 in the second quarter, 5.1, so it's running at about that rate. But I think the bigger thing if you look at the new volume we did, and we covered that in here in the amounts and the ROIs, you're talking about 2.6 ROI on the new volume we did. That's really attractive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Great, Noelia. I think that's the end of the Q&amp;A. Thank you, everyone. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon. Just a few housekeeping items, if you can stick with me for a minute; we will be distributing our quarterly supplemental data schedule for GE Capital later today, as we started doing last quarter.</p>
          <p>And I do have several events to announce. First, we'll be hosting our GE Healthcare analyst meeting in New York City on November 9th. Please visit our website for details. Second, we will host our GE Capital webcast on December 7th. We'll send out details once that's finalized. Third, our annual outlook meeting with our Chairman and CEO in New York City, which we hold every year, will be held on December 14th. More information will be sent out closer to that date. And then finally, our fourth quarter 2010 earnings webcast will take place on Friday, January 21st. So if you could put those on your calendar and join us, that would be great. As always, JoAnna and I will be available to take questions later today. Thank you, everyone.</p>
