          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter Analyst Conference with a simultaneous webcast. The earnings release, the Flashlight and all other documents were published this morning, 7 a.m. Central European Time. You can download these files including the afternoon's presentation on our website. You will also find there a replay of the webcast, which will be available later.</p>
          <p>I would also like to refer you to the Safe Harbor statement on page number two of the presentation. Siemens' President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher and Siemens' CFO, Joe Kaeser will present to you this afternoon Q4 and full year results as well as you're all expecting the outlook for fiscal year 2010. They are joined by Barbara Kux, member of the Managing Board, who will outline the progress we are making with the supply chain initiatives. After the presentation, we will have time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand over to Peter.</p>

          <p>Mariel, thank you very much. Welcome to the analyst conference. We have changed slightly the order today. I will lead and then Joe will go into the details of the financial and then Barbara will update you on the supply chain management initiatives and afterwards I will wrap it up.</p>
          <p>Before we go into the numbers, let me give you a brief commentary and overview in terms of the environment and the performance and leadership of what we have achieved in 2009. From an order perspective we are looking into &#x2013; from the short-cycle businesses and with this I specifically mean Industrial Automation and OSRAM have reached bottom. But we also believe that the next two quarters will still be tough quarters to go through before we might see actually a steady recovery path for these businesses.</p>
          <p>At the longer-cycle businesses, we expect continued slowdown effects going into 2010. And on the back of this we delivered revenue and profit figures, which are clearly ahead of the revised 2009 guidance given to all of you in April. We have grown during this very difficult year 2009 our market share. The last couple of quarters we are proud of that we have actually over-performed significantly on our SG&amp;A program and we are able to close it off from a corporate perspective by the end of 2009. We have delivered steady delivery on the supply chain management initiative and Barbara will update you and we have also continued to restructure the businesses as we went through 2009.</p>
          <p>Talking specifically about the numbers, as you can see, the Q4 given market conditions, both in terms of orders on an organic growth perspective as well as sales are down minus 14 and minus seven. The overall book-to-bill was down to 0.95 coming from 1.03 times earlier in the year, which is an excellent performance if you compare this in the current market environment. And we were able to keep our financial year 2009 stable from a sales perspective. We reduced our workforce at the same period from 427,000 to 405,000. So we decreased the workforce by 22,000 and which equates to a 5% reduction on head count.</p>
          <p>Let me now move onto the profit lines. We saw substantial improvement on our Q4 total sector profits. However, the 25% increase in sector profit was not enough to compensate for the charges booked at NSN, and obviously we are not pleased about it. Despite this fact, we have the intention to pay out 1.60 euros as a dividend for the year, which we would like to propose to the AGM end of January.</p>
          <p>If we look at the different sectors, the economic decline still impacted industry the most, although slightly less than we have experienced in Q3. Looking at the fourth quarter total sector profits, we saw substantial improvement led by Energy that more than offset the decline in industry. Even though we experienced some improvement quarter-to-quarter, we continued to be cautious, but please bear in mind also that the last quarter of our fiscal year usually is a very active one. So as we believe the next months ahead of us will still be tough.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to turn over to Joe to go into the details of the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Last time when we saw each other, I think it was September 29 at our Healthcare Day here in London. I was doing some sort of a quarter update on what the community could expect in fiscal Q4 2009. I was actually saying four things.</p>
          <p>First, was fiscal Q4 2009 above the sector line, we feel extremely confident. Number two was there are material challenges below the sector line in fiscal Q4 2009 and there remain to be challenges also in 2010. Third, I also said that I did read some sell side reports regarding forecast 2010, and that I felt that the forecast for below the sector line items seemed overly optimistic to me. Statement number four was that free cash flow may not see such a strong finish in Q4 2009 as it used to be in prior years. If I sum it up today, I guess I was wrong on item number four.</p>
          <p>Peter mentioned already that Siemens for the year I just believe has done very well on the total of the three sectors. We originally finished the year with 7.5 billion sector profit.</p>
          <p>Now let me show you what happens below that sector line because obviously we do have a series of challenges there. Also, of course, one of them materialized in fiscal Q4, and that has been the impairment of the equity value of our NSN, part 50% of NSN, valued at 1.634 million. You may remember, at least the ones who were in business already in 2007, that at the time when we put those two assets together from Nokia and Siemens to become NSN, we actually booked a partial gain of 1.627 million at that time.</p>
          <p>The equity investment also of course has seen some volatility, some weakness, as a result of a difficult market environment. Enterprise, again was down 54 million including of course some restructuring charges and there there've also been other topics such as Voith Siemens <mark type="inaudible" /> which actually contributed 34 million. So all in all, the loss on equity investments in Q4 was totaling up to almost 2 billion.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the whole fiscal year on equity investments, the total loss of equity investments in 2009 was 1.851 million. If we now kind of deduct NSN impairment of 1.6 billion, then also consider the Fujitsu Siemens sale of the asset, which at that time resulted in a gain of 327 million, a kind of an underlying number for fiscal 2009 would actually be 540 million loss.</p>
          <p>If one also considers the write-down of the deferred tax assets as a one-off, then it would be at about 300 underlying. And for 2009 and I honestly do believe that it would be way too premature to think that this could change in a sort of material way in 2010.</p>
          <p>If we now look at the right half of the chart here, which is obviously the corporate items, you see how the corporate items total all together, and then you find the 700 million which you also have been describing in the earnings release. Corporate cost of 208 million, of course also include our as you have probably have seen, our Siemens Answers campaign, which we believe is very successful. We just launched the U.S. part of it and we get very, very favorable responses. But it is a material part, in Q4 alone corporate communication as an important means of transporting our messages totaled up to 60 million.</p>
          <p>So everything else, I think, what you see here is pretty much self-explaining. The question would be how would that look like going forward into 2010. And as a rough ballpark number let me just give you a few indications on that. So on the total corporate items, okay, if you expect about 300 million per quarter, you probably would be in a decent site. That of course also includes our marketing communications campaign, which, as I just said, we launched also in the United States.</p>
          <p>On pensions, that's just about a 100 million item per quarter. As it has been here, it's a little on the high side, at 114. So I think a 100 million per quarter would be a decent assumption. Other interest expenses, which you see, we've got a 100 million here. It's probably just about the run rate one could expect in the next quarters to come.</p>
          <p>In terms of the asset retirement obligation, this is a liability, which we have with regards to the nuclear correction, if you want, on some assets in Germany. I mean this can go both ways, because on the IFRS, as you know, we always need to reconsider the total obligation we expect to come under the current interest development so it could go either way, difficult to judge. If one assumes that interest rates stay the same, then we probably are just about in that ballpark. If one believes that interest rates go up, which we expect in the mid-term, that would actually become more favorable going forward.</p>
          <p>One item you don't see here is the so-called centrally managed assets. We`ve got one asset in that category and that's the electronic assembly, which used to be at BT and now has been moved down to below the line to be restructured and then eventually sold to an interested party or if that doesn't work, closed in the worst case. That will remain a material challenge also in 2010. The total loss on that asset in 2009 underlying was about 370 million total for the whole year, and this is not going to go any better in 2010. So it's probably even worse if we consider adverse impact from a continued weakness in the electronic assembly environment.</p>
          <p>On SFS, if one expects a flattish underlying profitability which we believe was at record high in 2009 with around about 300 million profit. That's probably quite a good goal to have also for 2010, and then SIS, you probably heard the news this morning already, if one considers just about the same on underlying as in 2009 would also be probably something to consider in the model. As reported, the numbers for SIS will likely be down because we also may have some costs related to the <mark type="inaudible" /> have just concluded.</p>
          <p>Now on top of the items that you see here, we also have set aside some money in 2010 for what we believe compelling and important innovation topics such as e-car or clean cities and the like. So that also will in some way weigh into the 2010 below the sector numbers.</p>
          <p>So with having said that, let me then now move on to what I believe is a much more favorable, and definitely also message about SCSG day program. You have all been familiar on how it started, especially when it started, and I'm happy to report today that we started early, but we also finished early. We finished one year ahead of time. We made good on what we promised one year earlier. We were able to reduce the SG&amp;A in percentage of sales from 16.7 to 14.2% on 50 basis points, straight to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>If we consider the year-on-year comparison from 2008 to 2009 by quarter, which you can see on the right hand side here, you clearly can see first, it gained track over time, started with 6% in year-on-year cost reduction all the way up to 29% in Q4. Going forward, you can expect levels, which are just about that ballpark what we have been able to achieve in 2009.</p>
          <p>So people may say, "Well, why doesn't it go down any further?" Well, there is also life after the crisis, and Peter, later on, will also report about what we are planning on gross markets so that <mark type="inaudible" />. So just about flat sustainable with the SG&amp;A going forward, and yeah, I think that's pretty much it except the fact that on a year-on-year comparison 340 base points savings out of SG&amp;A contributed to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Another area where we believe we've made some progress, or at least have been able to control costs, assets, especially fixed costs is the asset management, and the asset management this time has had a materially positive impact on the free cash flow, especially also in Q4. Let me just show you two methods here, one is the working capital turns development, the other one is the CapEx spending. Working capital turns now have been improving since 2006 in a row. Of course it's becoming, the progress has become a little less, but turning working capital 8.8 times is probably something the industry is dying for having on an average. But we probably have few considerations on that anyway in the new database.</p>
          <p>Now on to CapEx spending on the right-hand side we've been very, very tightly in work and committed to be very, very close to what we expect the bookings to be. And if you now here, just compare the two charts here with the so called CapEx rate, which is CapEx divided by depreciation. It exactly, without any timely delay, follows the graph of order intake from an organic base, so we have been very, very tightly managing it. We are down at 96%. Just remember this is including inflation of equipment to be bought, and we do not expect this rate to go up materially in 2010, okay?</p>
          <p>I said earlier I was wrong on my assumption that we are not going to have this massive finish in 2009, as we used to have in 2008 and '07. You clearly see there is quite a strong trend over the course of the years. We've been following that trend again in 2009.</p>
          <p>I actually was more bearish about the billings in excess because I am expecting and still do expect that there's going to be a slowdown on customer prepayments going forward. It's only a matter of time. It did not happen in Q4. In a way, and then some weakness in the prepayments of our customers' orders have been compensated, if not over compensated by the fact that we have been decently successful in managing our working capital.</p>
          <p>So it's been, what we believe, quite a strong performance on free cash flow also in 2009, as we have been performing the years before. And that, ladies and gentlemen, goes on top of the fact that we have been paying more than 2 billion euros on cash in 2009 from charges which we had booked in 2008, just a little over 2 billion, which in a way would need to be added just to see what underlying flow would have been. This is why I'm getting and still continue to be, I wouldn`t say concerned, but alert about what our working capital will do going forward.</p>
          <p>And this, what you can see here, is the trend of our bookings per quarter, that's those are bars, and the curve here, the graph you see here, is the billings in excess, which in essence is what our customers finance our working capital with. And you can clearly see that there is a decent trend here over the years, but now since basically Q1, you know after that peak in Q1 2009 we see a deterioration on the billings in excess, and that definitely at some point in time will go at the expense of the working capital because we have gotten the customer prepayments, there is notice to proceed, and then we need to build up the working capital, and it takes time till we get the money.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of what can one expect in Q1 here? It seems that the Q4 sees a reversal of the bookings trend quarter-on-quarter. I would not think that this is going to be a sustainable development in Q1, 2010. So it's been a strong year-end quarter, but Q1 is likely not going to be as high as Q4, 2009. So we are still in a sluggish capital growth environment even though some data points may suggest that it goes only one way, which is up. The end markets do not suggest this development anytime soon. That's at least what we believe will show in the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me now look into the leverage. I guess in this time of the world and the year it's not bad to miss a target in terms of leverage. We have a capital structure goal of 4.8 to 1.0 adjusted net debt over EBITDA. We were somewhat close in fiscal Q3, 2009 with 0.72x. They're back down at 0.31x, and we are not in a hurry to reach that structural goal anytime soon because we do believe that the financial end markets remain to be potentially volatile in the near term.</p>
          <p>And by the same token, though, we do not believe that credit crunch matters or concerns will hit Siemens any time soon. They may hit us in a way because our customers could be affected by it, especially if it's going to be the mid-size credit companies, maybe some suppliers. But by the same token, we do have a very nice tool in place with Siemens <mark type="inaudible" /> services to help also our suppliers if they are getting close to their liquidity line because we do have a program to help them basically finance their own accounts receivables, which is our accounts payables, at a decent rate.</p>
          <p>Capital efficiency, definitely something, which is on the radar-screen, has been on the radar-screen but has not yet been satisfactorily developed. I just need to be clear about it. If you look at the return on capital employed in Siemens as reported for 2007 to 2009, we are still some quite &#x2013; quite some distance away from the 14 to &#x2013; for the 14 to 16. That's the target; it remains the target. It's going to be difficult to be there any time soon but we need to be &#x2013; more pushy on getting sustainable actions for improvement of the capital efficiency. And that also includes structural measures to improve the capital efficiency going forward.</p>
          <p>Now obviously one area to push capital efficiency is also the real estate environment and that's both the profitability side, that's saving costs, as well as getting real estate usage cheaper. We have, therefore, advanced our program, the right program, real estate improvement program and brought it to the next level up to a savings of 400 million per year by 2014.</p>
          <p>Now people may ask why does it take so long. It's a legitimate question, by the same token, as you know, buildings, floor space, is something &#x2013; you don't move around like working capital any time soon. So it takes time but it also takes a very distinguished and very straightforward approach. This is how we are doing it. By 2011 our real estate management division, we've managed 100% of the real estate in Siemens. We have 18 million square foot globally, and by funneling it, by transferring them, by making SRE responsible for optimizing the floor space and get down with the excess floor space over time we will also achieve the savings, which we have been promising, and very clearly quantified on the right hand side here of the chart. I think it's pretty much self-explaining. So, therefore, there's not much to say on what is read here.</p>
          <p>The only one thing I would like to add is the SRE number, which also is a below the sector line component, as you know. In 2009, SRE had a profit of 341 million. That included 221 million of asset disposals. So on an underlying base, if you want, the profit of SRE 2009 was 120 million. Now in 2010, as you can see here on the lower right, getting the 400 million is &#x2013; it's got a price. It's got a price tag related to it, and the price tag for 2010 will be a charge a one-off of about 100 million.</p>
          <p>So in our guidance, of course, we have not excluded that charge. It's part of the guidance so that definitely will then, if you compare year-on-year, will have a massive negative impact, but then again, SRE forecast is hard to tell because the moment we can sell assets, which are not being needed, the moment the real estate markets are back to a meaningful pricing level, we will continue to load off assets. So that could also be, again, a decent income from asset disposal, but we have not planned for significant asset disposals in 2010. So if one compares like-for-like, this just needs to be considered from 2009 to 2010.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand over to Barbara to give us the latest news on the success of supply chain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As you have heard from Peter and Joe, we have made great progress in 2009 in strengthening Siemens's competitive leadership, and I'm pleased to say that we have made significant progress on the supply chain management initiatives we've outlined last April. Let us focus on both our achievements in the previous fiscal year as well as SCM in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Looking back in 2009, we started the supply chain initiative at Siemens just 11 months ago. We knew we could accelerate the benefits from supply chain management more intelligently and more aggressively. Going back to the number for 2008, Siemens made about &#x20AC;40 billion worth of external spend; less than a third of the total, about &#x20AC;12 billion, was done centrally. It was pretty clear that we were not gaining the full scale &#x2013; the full value for that size and scale because the supply chain management functions were not centralized sufficiently.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2009, we have moved up by &#x20AC;4 billion the amount of material that is purchased centrally. This amounts to roughly a 50% increase from the level at end 2008. And the percentage that is centrally managed rose to 44%. In order to make this stick and to have sustainable improvements, the supply chain management organization had to be adapted. With all this, we ensure that we leverage this spend fully for Siemens as a whole.</p>
          <p>Next is global value sourcing. We are moving as fast as possible to shift sourcing to countries where we can realize long-term benefits of rising quality and market growth. This is more than wage levels. We want to make sure that we have put in place whole value chains of R&amp;D, procurement and manufacturing which can service the local and global markets. And in the more turbulent markets you see today, global value sourcing also means ensuring reliability and availability of the high-quality materials and components that go into our products and services.</p>
          <p>We've made a lot of progress here. Let me give you some examples. We speeded up supplier evaluation &#x2013; 1,500 suppliers in the global value sourcing countries. A pilot program at building technologies in China that increased local content of the program up to 74%. Overall, our broader supplier interfaces have yielded enormous benefits, increasing cross-sector pooling volumes from China. And we've moved now in bringing together our second tier suppliers into our supplier community. We've also strengthened our organization in China, hiring a new Chief Procurement Officer there. At present, we've moved our percent of sourcing from global value markets up to 21%, which is a lot to shift in 11 months. This will accelerate in 2010 to reach our goal of 25% in the mid-term as planned.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn <mark type="inaudible" />. We said in April that this will be concentrated, and we have done so. And again, we've been selective. Some relationships we have ended, some have gotten deeper. From 113,000 suppliers we've reduced this to 97,000, or about 15% already, with the eye to getting our preferred supplier group to 91,000 in the mid term. We will be moving to a preferred supplier list in 2010. This will increase competition and drive suppliers to want to be part of the Siemens community. Of special note is our Siemens Supplier Forum. The 30 strategic partners have been selected as key partners for growth and innovation. The forum is one example of how we want to integrate key supplier relationships more deeply into our present and future needs. We are focused making the Siemens supplier community more committed and robust than ever before.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond what we have achieved in 2009, we are focused on making supply-chain management a source of permanent value enhancement, now and in the future for Siemens. In the relatively short time that the SCM has been a focus, we've made a substantial improvement in material cost productivity, a measure which blends procurement and supply efficiency with quality and reliability.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to 2010. Our SCM initiatives have already had a substantial impact as I've shown, and these will continue 2010 and beyond. Benefiting from what we buy and how we buy it is now part of Siemens' culture. The SCM team has accomplished a lot in a short time. They are motivated and focused, and their capabilities and talents will continue to grow in 2010 and after. We are rolling out the SCM skills and approaches to the sectors and regional clusters. We've also put financial incentives throughout SCM to spur the drive toward cost down and value up in each unit. Progress toward centralizing purchasing and procurement will gain further traction in 2010. Where we can, we will pool direct material purchase, those materials which are part of our finished goods. Indirect purchases have already been centralized in October 2009. The full value of these efforts will come evident in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>As you know, SCM is a real detail-oriented story. We have more than 20,000 concrete measures on the way to improve our quality and reduce our cost. It's all part of this process; a lot of efforts that all add up to big improvements. E-auctions, where suppliers compete to supply Siemens, we plan to grow to 8% in the next 12 months. Preferred supplier lists published and public will increase transparency and competition, driving costs down and quality up. And we are also increasing our market intelligence, for example, by smart usage of market indicators.</p>
          <p>This ability to understand our supplier market is key: what is driving our suppliers, what are their needs, competitive pressure and new entrants. We want the best suppliers for the longer term. Additionally, we are focusing on our payable turns and setting aspiring targets for 2010 correspondingly.</p>
          <p>To sum up, SCM is driving value up and cost down throughout Siemens and this will accelerate as we move into and beyond 2010. Let me now turn it back to Peter.</p>

          <p>Barbara, thank you. If we look into the target achievements quickly. We have obviously achieved two times global GDP. We have gained market share against the backdrop of a minus 2% decrease of the global GDP, but we also have to bear in mind that the industrial markets were actually down minus 9% globally. I think we have achieved an excellent operational performance versus the target of 6.6, 7.5 and despite the NSN impairment, we achieved income from operations up by 31%.</p>
          <p>If we look into the next page, on the left hand side you see the order backlog. We still have a very strong order backlog in comparison to 2008 where it used to be 83 billion but the 81 is actually significantly above the pre-crisis 2007 year. 2007 we had 73 billion in order backlog. So a strong backlog going into 2010; turnover relevant, 36 billion, as you can see, a major portion of it obviously the energy piece. But also, and within &#x2013; we have actually six billion of, for example, renewable, but also mobility and industrial solutions from the Industry business.</p>
          <p>Where are our big drivers in terms of going forward? Next slide please. And that's a chart which clearly shows you in terms of how established are we in the emerging markets. New orders, and obviously you have to take a time period where you look at it. It's a third of it in terms of order growth coming out of the emerging markets revenue, well above 30 GDP, and we have already almost 106,000 people in the emerging markets. So a strong emerging market footprint. And this obviously should help us to explore the growth opportunities going into 2010 where we see strong growth continue to be in China; growth coming back quite strongly in India, also part of the Middle East, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and also Brazil doing very well.</p>
          <p>So as Barbara has explained, we will also use now the next number of years to continue to build out the supply chain and build actually on a product initiative, what we call SMART products, which is exactly products which are coming out just below our top innovation line.</p>
          <p>Here on this slide you can see a big stabilizing factor is our green energy portfolio; 23 billion, growing 11% despite the economic crisis versus a target for 2011 of 25. I think it's safe to say that we are extremely well on track and this is probably as we speak today a conservative target. So great growth opportunities and certainly an opportunity which we exploit also as Joe has mentioned from a clean city, urban city infrastructure development program where plans and studies are showing that within the next 25 years there's expected a 27 billion euro investment program. And of course London is just one of the examples where we are in detailed discussions with the Mayor of London and his team.</p>
          <p>Next, as I mentioned, SMART is a key initiative. Here you can see just a couple of examples on the right hand side where we take products which we have initially developed, designed, created a supply chain, manufactured for the local market, but in the meantime we are leveraging this across to a number of other emerging countries and other local and global markets. An example is, for example, DIS where we have in China working &#x2013; in China in total 43,000 people. We have 18 R&amp;D centers in China and where we have an attractive opportunity to actually leverage products, which we have initially designed for China, also for the world.</p>
          <p>In medical, I've mentioned it already several times, the SOMATOM Spirit, for example, is the most widely-used computer tomograph worldwide, which we have initially designed for China and it's now extremely successful globally. In the emerging markets they are also very important in terms of talent pool for us going forward, and we try to leverage the additional supply chain opportunities, what we see with the supply base coming out of these markets.</p>
          <p>On the lower right-hand side you see healthcare, a great healthcare example where we have initially designed an ultrasound machine for the local market, and in the meantime we are exporting it out of India in other 36 markets around the world. So that's a key strategy for R&amp;D going forward, which we try to exploit and drive out of the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>From a portfolio perspective, we continue to manage our portfolio actively. The most recent example is our acquisition Solel in the thermal &#x2013; solar power area where we have created an immediate technology leadership, and in the meantime we have actually in this important market 70% of the global value add of this technology, which is currently within Siemens, and we obviously believe, from a grid parity perspective we're able to push this technology within the next three to five years into grid parity. And here on the right hand side as you can see, numerous examples as we continue to manage and exploit portfolio opportunities going forward.</p>
          <p>I know that all of you have many questions around our guidance. Let me just lead into, and then Joe will just take over and share with you our thinking behind this. What are the targets what we have set in the Fit42010 program and obviously the Fit42010 program is valid. The first one is said that we will grow two times GDP. For 2010, this is no longer possible. Why? Because we have a clear decoupling between our industrial markets and the global GDP, and if your industrial base has actually decreased by 9% versus a global GDP of minus 2%, and we are facing numerous of our customer industries, like the automotive industry, like the machinery tool industry and others which have clearly a major reduction in their capacity utilization, and then, therefore, for 2010, we will not be able to grow two times GDP like all the other industrial companies.</p>
          <p>We have, therefore, set a very clear goal for 2010, that if you compare this in relation to our order intake decline over the last couple of years &#x2013; quarters, minus 14%, due to the fact that we still have a very strong order backlog, we believe that the decline in revenue for 2010 should be somewhere in the mid single-digit.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to hand over to Joe, who gives you a little bit the background in terms of operating profit and the continuing operations expectations for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Peter. Before I go into the three, actually the four bullet points here on the guidance, I'll give you a little more flavor on each individual bullet. Two remarks. First, we definitely have heard the feedback loud and clear and we do appreciate the feedback and we take it very seriously. Second, if I just look back one year ago, same place, just about the same time, a little earlier, we've got similar comments on our eight to 8.5 billion guidance. Completely out of line. Way too conservative. Don't know how the hell you could come up with such a low number.</p>
          <p>Then the third remark with regard to the topic, that's important, our forecast, which we have been giving for 2010, has been designed not to surprise the markets on the downside as we go during 2010. That's been the underlying assumption and it has been as such because of the item number one on the guidance here, that we do believe that the conditions in manufacturing and of course in a way in financial markets remain to be challenging. We do see continued low capacity utilization. And we do see continued volatility on the end market demands. So now if over time &#x2013; the assumption is, if over time capacity utilization remains to be low, market participants may feel compelled to drive down the pricing just in order to buy market shares. And I come to that a little later.</p>
          <p>So now let's go maybe through item number two. We said after a double-digit order decline, as you have seen also underlying in 2009, we do expect some impact of that in revenues in 2010. Now let me just give you a number here. It's mid single digit, if nothing else, one would take the linear between zero and 10 &#x2013; that would be 5%. And then if you assume 77 billion revenues last year and then you also have to assume those 5% if nothing else, then that would be a revenue decline of about a little less than four billion, okay?</p>
          <p>We do believe, well, whatever we believe, we have put into our guidance that about half of that is going to be price decline. And as you all know, price decline just does not reduce revenues only, it goes straight to the bottom line. Or in other words, if we took the same price decline which we had in 2009, in 2010 the guidance would have been one billion higher. So just understand the assumption which we have on an underlying base when we did the forecast. So just about half is going to be price decline goes straight to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>The other half, just expect some 40% coverage, missed coverage on volume. So two billion times 0.4 is obviously 800 million. So 2.8 billion adverse impact to the bottom line coming from the top line. So our guidance has been about a billion or a billion and a half lower than our 7.5 billion, which we achieved in 2009. So if you take a billion on average, it still takes us 1.8 billion to find the cost savings. So based on the assumption, it's quite a task to find the cost savings. But we do feel comfortable that we will find them going forward on that base and this is how our sector forecast has been derived. So if we are wrong on the pricing, that definitely would help everyone in the industry and of course also the bottom line.</p>
          <p>There is also a topic, two topics I want to mention which are sometimes lightly forgotten. One is the foreign exchange rate. We have seen a material decline on the U.S. dollar and it's yet too early and, of course, also too difficult to speculate on what that will do to competitors which are operating out of U.S. dollar based value add structures, in combination with unutilized capacities. So it remains to be seen but you just need to know we have considered that.</p>
          <p>And the second topic is that it also goes into the fiscal Q4. We have actually had a materially favorable impact from the market values of the hedges which we are not qualifying for hedge accounting. And of course due to the fact that we are decently hedged, and then of course when the U.S. dollar goes down, the market values go up, and then those also will provide profits in Q4, which are not of course sustainable going forward. So also hedging may not gives us the favorable results in 2010 as we have done especially during the second half of 2009 when we saw the U.S. dollar decline, and we were fully hedged on the occasion.</p>
          <p>So that much to what I thought was important to understand. The sector profit of 6.0 to 6.5, the income from continued operations expect to be 10% above. I've given I guess some guidance already on the items below the line earlier in my presentation. Now of course the 20% is disappointing, which I can imagine but by the same token, please keep in mind that those 20%, and that's not a technical item, those 20% have been derived from the lower end of the sector guidance of the 6.0. So if you just, for example, take the 6.5 which would be the upper band, of course then this percentage would go up from 20 to 35. And if there was some upside for some reason for another 500 million because pricing would not be as unfavorable as potentially anticipated, it'd take another 500 million we will be up at 50. So just one should not underestimate the impact of a low base as compared to the potential and volatility we have on the sector end.</p>
          <p>I guess that would be as much as I would know or tell about the guidance.</p>

          <p>Very good. Thank you very much, Joe. I think that was helpful to get a little bit more light on the guidance. It was a topic very much discussed in the morning. I would like to open up the Q&amp;A session, and ask for the questions that you're having.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Starting off inevitably I suppose on the guidance and the pricing. Is this something you're seeing today? The pricing is deteriorating as you go into fiscal 2010? Or is it more a top-down view from your level, you are nervous about what might happen next year? And then secondly on China an emerging market, I see you had an organic decline in sales in China, despite very strong growth in China last year. Can you tell us what's happening in China? Are you losing market share? Or are there adverse trends there, which you can talk about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Peter. On the pricing assumptions, we do see some spots of weakness in the pricing area, and you may remember I have been addressing that already end of September in the shorter cycle environment of energy like T&amp;D. Seen that in some substation tenders, which were reasonably competitive. On the general term in industry, which had that low capacity utilization, we do not see it. It's a pure assumption based on the experience that over time, unutilized capacities usually have a tendency to be followed by some softness in pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Peter, on China this is really a comparison issue in terms of big projects. As you can see on the global, if you take the whole year, we have actually a growth of 7%. This is in China currently, a little bit related to in terms of which type of major projects do we win? So we are currently after for example a number of them in the energy transmission area. So it's more related to this than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll continue with Mark Troman, last row. And then Andreas Willi here at the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions, please. Firstly, just on the pricing issue again. Joe, in terms of the risk going forward, is there a geographical price to this? Is this a far eastern price pressure problem? And I guess are you implicitly assuming that the industrial business &#x2013; or where are these prices most likely to be concentrated within the portfolio, these &#x2013; the price pressure? And second, on the cost base, if we take the sector profit level, I wonder if you could provide a guidance as to how much lower the cost base, the run rate and the sector profit level is lower than it was the year before, just to help us building our profit bridges into next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Mark. On the pricing, let me just maybe come back to what I just answered to Peter. The price softness in the sales funnel, which is kind of here, what you can see coming, is more in the T&amp;D environment of energy. The assumption that continued weakness in capacity utilization &#x2013; which obviously has a very high fixed cost base and almost 50 to 60% of any additional revenue drops straight to the bottom line. That's what we anticipated in the industry, predominately in the products environment of industry, and that also goes for the assumption that currency related fluctuation may provide a better competitive environment to lower prices that's also predominantly industry.</p>
          <p>So on the sector profit level &#x2013; maybe I should again come back to the example on the guidance, six to 6.5. I said that we do expect &#x2013; that if you assume 5% revenue decline, that you would expect this to be 5% of 77, that's about four billion. Half of that we expect to be peer pricing. It's been significantly lower in 2009, way below one billion. So we assume much higher price decline in 2010 in our model.</p>
          <p>And then the rest, the other two billion, you need to multiply by about 40% to get the loss of coverage, if you want. So then that's two times 40, that's 800. So it's 2.8 billion, straight drop from the bottom line. So &#x2013; but then if you are only one billion to 1.5 billion less zero near from 7.5 to six to 6.5, you can assume that the cost base in the sector, this will go down by 1.8; but we see the 1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>And as I said, maybe a little less loud than usually, we do feel comfortable in getting those cost reduction down during the course of 2010. Okay? That will give you some impact on how the cost base will develop.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andreas Willi at JPMorgan. Two questions as well, please. The first one on SG&amp;A. You said the program is completed. Previously, there were savings expected in 2010 from, for example, people that still had to leave the organization because that normally takes a year. What happened to that, those savings? And also the run rate increased during the year, so we should still see benefits next year on a year-on-year basis. And the second question on Nokia Siemens Networks and Enterprise, are you willing to give a commitment that if those two businesses look for more cash, that you would basically say no, they need to find additional third-party shareholders? Or is Siemens willing to fund also some of the big restructuring efforts these two businesses need to undertake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well let me start on the SG&amp;A. What I said was that the corporate program to make SG&amp;A more efficient has finished. We made good on the promises, we put those structural settings in place, and the fact that we were running the SG&amp;A program from corporate under the leadership of Peter and myself, was that we wanted to make good on the expectations we have been setting by the organizational setup of the company. Remember, January 1, 2008 from 13 to, how did you say independent considerations of groups to three sectors, from more than 70 original companies, which were all little Siemenses to 17 cluster. We expected that to pay back in SG&amp;A, and that was the reason why we have been driving it from corporate, and this one &#x2013; this mission now is finished, so the expectations which we were having out of the reorientation of the company structurally by organization and by clustering, those ones we have bee drafting and we are through.</p>
          <p>That does not mean that we lose focus on SG&amp;A efficiency, but that's now the sole responsibility of the sector CEOs, together with the CFOs and the management team to drive that forward. And yes, there will be savings from the fact that we had a considerable amount of people in Germany who were electing these so-called early retirement option, which makes them still stay during the course of partly past 2010, and then they go and retire for good. And that is yet expected to materialize.</p>
          <p>By the same token there is life after the crisis, and as you have heard from Peter, we are committed to actually win, and take that also as an opportunity. So there will be new markets, there will be new activities, so there will be new sales people, but we are not adding people, pencil and paper again just as we grow the revenues. So there will be some selective &#x2013; some selective increase of sales and demand creation related activities, but the structural savings remain in place, and we expect the sectors to stay at the similar level as we had achieved them in 2009. And even when growth resumes after 2010, then we should actually see additional productivity coming out of that program. So that's actually what we were intending to do.</p>
          <p>Now on NSN and Enterprise, first I have to say Enterprise is actually doing a decent job. You will see a few more news flow coming out of Enterprise, which is not necessarily disappointing. So I would not expect that to require fundamental financing anytime soon. So we would rather prefer to have a third-party join the Enterprise shell, the community and make the asset even more efficient.</p>
          <p>On NSN, obviously we have &#x2013; there has been some disappointment on the development since we have founded the joint venture. And as you remember also on 9/29, I guess there was a certain wake-up call for whomever to look into the valuation of the asset, but that does not mean that this is not any good. It's had a few setbacks, the market conditions were massively more adverse than which would have been anticipated at the time. We do have &#x2013; currently we do have Nokia and Siemens together 1.5 billion shareholder loan at NSN, which actually was contractually agreed upon. So I would not necessarily rule out since that this is a subordinated shareholder loan that we would convert at least part of it into equity, to help the company also save money and look into the covenant side. That one I would not rule out, but I would be extremely difficult to be convinced about spending materially more money from the shareholder base rather than look into other options. By the same token, it's like in real life. I said that this morning. Children need the parents most when they are doing not very well, and so we have a responsibility. We made that clear time and again. We do not manage the asset. This is different operating contract, but definitely we give support, but we also have or thresholds. Okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Scott Babka with Morgan Stanley. Joe, in the past you've talked about the fact that we've got to come to the reality that we won't see 2008 revenue for a while, particularly in the industrial businesses. In that context, I mean A) do you still believe that? And B) are you happy with the capacity you have? And should we expect more significant capacity reductions in 2010 to accommodate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I'm not sure that I got the second one. But let me start with the first one. See, I mean, we also, of course, see the data points, you are seeing, we all are seeing in the industrial environment and they look encouraging and &#x2013; at first glance they look even bullish in some way. But then we have to realize that the level we are comparing those data points to are already 30 to 40% down from a year ago and you are looking into recovery. And if you look into process industries, for example, obviously in metals and mining, which has seen a massive downturn, which will negatively impact our I&amp;S division, as well as parts of what used to be A&amp;D.</p>
          <p>If a steel manufacturer operates at 50% utilization, currently and that steel manufacturer assuming that there is the same price on the steel, goes up now from 50 to 70 capacity utilization, that's a 40% increase. Of course they declare the crisis over. But we are still 30% away from the CapEx cycle. So that's we just have to keep in mind and this is also true for several industries we are considering to be our end markets. So we just have to be clear about the fact that it takes much longer than we would have liked it to take. So there will need to be structural matters to address that from a geographical as well as from the content point.</p>
          <p>But by the same token, I have to say, we have already seen one first pass where we were right to keep our people aboard and use the short-time model. Because when we saw in September, when we saw &#x2013; completely surprised, completely caught flat footed in a way that Disney channels that they are filling up some parts of their chain. That's why I&amp;A was so positive in Q4. Disney channels they're ordering for some reason. So instead of being really caught flat footed and not being able to ship, we took our people in, produced the goods and shipped.</p>
          <p>And then as you can see on the earnings conversion, industrial automation, Q4. That drops heavily into the bottom line straight away. So that was actually positive. Has that been already summer? Not it hasn't. It was a shorter POP, point of purchase, re-stocking but the end markets have not recovered for good at this time. So we do not expect them to recover, and as we said earlier already, we do expect some signs of life in the short cycle environment in the second half of fiscal. We do believe, and have good visibility, that short cycle, early cycle, short cycle it's like OSRAM, and industrial automation has seen the bottom. And I would expect actually OSRAM to be the first one to show it by the number. So that's as much as we could say on the matter. Question number two, I'm sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Can I ask you two questions about restructuring charges and one-offs? I think we've seen in the statement a number of comments about charges. I think in your guidance for the sectors there was already in last year probably 400 million of restructuring, and now we're looking at sectors versus last year. So I presume it looks like we're expecting something similar. We've got a 100 million for real estate, we've got 750 as a loss, whether it's restructuring or not for electronic assembly. We've got some restructuring charges coming through in IT. It seems that the year is just beginning and we're already pushing beyond one billion of restructuring charges. Could you give us a feel as to what you think the scale of one-off charges you're anticipating at the moment within your guidance, just in case some of those are underlying versus really big one-off?</p>
          <p>And also just following on from that, clearly this seems to happen every year. Do you sort of feel that there is a timeline when this won't happen? Or do you still feel that this is sort of something, which we should now look on as being a five-year program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Simon. On the sector restructuring in 2009 was a number of about 250, 300 million restructuring in the sector line. Total restructuring has been about 500 million in 2009, okay? And if and when we talk about restructuring, it's personnel-related restructuring. And as you have seen in the fine print of the guidance on page 22, we have been excluding personnel-related restructuring. We have not included, or we have not excluded general potential project charges. We just don't think this is a one-off. This is ordinary course of business. So if there have ever been one-offs in 2009 we have not excluded them. So that would create an upside if there wasn't any.</p>
          <p>Now on the ongoing matter of &#x2013; there's always something every year that's obviously &#x2013; the observation is definitely there. By the same token, I believe if we separate total sectors, the new Siemens, the directions Peter has been giving and he started and has not just been giving the direction, but also executed. Those three sectors, if you look at them, how do we compare with competitors? How much have those project charges go down over time? How have we been doing during that massive crisis? Then you need to judge how we have been doing on those three sectors. So that's the new Siemens approach. That's how we are going forward. And there are, of course, before the sector lines, there are matters which also could be summed up as missed opportunities at a time that we need to deal with them whether we like it or not.</p>
          <p>And, of course, it has been disappointing that we need to write off 1.6 billion. By the same token, it's a non-cash item and we need to manage right through it. The likelihood that Siemens is calling the 50% share from Nokia at the end of the contract is &#x2013; you probably can go low on that but we need to deal with it. And we have a responsibility also, which is below the new Siemens approach and we are dealing with it.</p>
          <p>And some of the matters are like valuation topics. Others are &#x2013; I mean, if you don't sell real estate in 2010 and and we still have sold them in 2009, then, it is what it is. You just need to deal with it. And so, therefore, there are also items, which may go up either way. The asset retirement obligation can also be, instead of 100 million negative, can be 100 million positive.</p>
          <p>So there are a series of topics, I believe we just need to be sure we understand. But the underlying performance, the cash generators, the ones who make us 3.9 billion free cash flow, those are above the line. And we believe that those are reasonably well matched. And I guess that's how I would view it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If you look at electronic assembly, what would be the turnover for that business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The turnover &#x2013; you mean revenues, right?</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the numbers are pretty similar to what we've expected <mark type="inaudible" />. There is not much difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that's the kind of theory is that when things are going well, they make normal margins and when they go wrong they sort of loose you twice the revenue over two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I understand the point, but by the same token it's been something, which hasn't been deteriorating. We could have sold the business five years ago. We decided not to do it and we deal with it. And we need to measure us that this doesn't happen again, trouble at the sector topics, which we have above the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think &#x2013; let me just add one thing here, what Joe has just highlighted. I mean obviously we have taken a massive, a very, very clear approach in terms of where do we believe the key focus of asset allocation should be, it should be sector related and we continue to manage this business. And if you judge it relative to competition, I think we've done pretty well.</p>
          <p>But due to the fact of the size of the organization and its history, this is a company who is in the existence 162 years. And unfortunately, our most &#x2013; our strongest businesses are not yet our legacy businesses. Now would we like to be out of them quicker than we could be? Has this crisis actually pronounced some of the competitive disadvantages what some of the businesses have? All of them is yes and yes and yes.</p>
          <p>I mean the Nokia Siemens Networks, for example, we have clearly <mark type="inaudible" />, for example, being far more aggressive and being far more successful all through Europe. And the latest example is that they win basically a major contract out of Norway. So there are competitive dynamics in these businesses.</p>
          <p>They are businesses that unfortunately we still have with us. But be assured that we will take all steps possible that we are able to. I mean maximize shareholder value is probably a relative term in this context but if we take, that we really have a clear look from a shareholder value perspective and that we will take all the action possible going forward that this is in size and scope a different animal than it is today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll continue with <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Soc Gen. Just maybe a follow-up on the portfolios streamlining strategy, do you still consider SIS as a key business for them now that it is to be put into a separate legal entity; maybe the same kind of question for your Hearing Aids business. Is it still a part of your co-business given its retail related profile?</p>
          <p>The second question would be on your real estate management program. Just maybe if you can elaborate a bit more on that? Just explain a bit more why do you expect some initial cost of 300 million euros, where did that come from, maybe a bit more precisely? And also related to the same program, what's the cost base related to real estate today from which you expect the 400 million euros cost savings? What's the starting point?</p>
          <p>And the third question would be related to some of the volatility in margins we have seen on a quarterly basis for some of your divisions. In particular in power transmission and distribution, the margins were pretty good, and you have clearly performed very well ahead of your competitors if we then arrive at this quarter. So where did that come from and is it sustainable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Let me start with SIS. We have announced today that we will carve out the SIS business risk guarantee cross-sector business and make it a fully self-contained legal entity. We want to focus the business in terms of geographics as well as applications, and I will make sure that the value creation potential, which this division has, can be fully accessible by the actions we are going to take. It's too early now to talk about them in more detail because it takes obviously also a couple of series of discussions with the constituents within the company such as workers council. We'll meet them today.</p>
          <p>But the clear goal is provide the environment to make the IT assets in Siemens a stronger business, access the value operation potential, and then if and when it is being created and a true equity story is not just tellable but also feasible, then I would also not rule it out that we see that as right given at some point in time, but we need to do one step after another, which has happened now so far today and we'll keep you posted on the developments.</p>
          <p>On hearing aids, there's a lot of noise in the newspapers about our Hearing Aids business. It's a very attractive business. Our margins are way north of average margins of the sector, and the free cash flow is also good. So I really would like to hear a compelling argument that it should be sold. As you know, selling and buying assets does not create value except sometimes massive goodwill. So, therefore, we are not overly excited about all those ANS devices, but still if we look at it and we'll see if we have something to tell about it, we'll definitely communicate the matter.</p>
          <p>On real estate and the starting point for the 400 in savings as well as the 250 for 2011 is fiscal 2008, okay? That's the base lining where those cost savings are going to be related to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the total customer base related to real estate today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; let me put it this way. We expect, generally expect, 400 billion euro more savings out of the real estate program. The cost base resides all across the sectors and the divisions. So basically 90% of those savings are going to go into the P&amp;L of the divisions and the sectors, and the other 10, 15% will bring down corporate tax and other costs across the board.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a certainly was one. I'm sorry, about the T&amp;D performance. I don't want to miss the good news. I mean, honestly we have been benchmarking ourselves, and this has been where the target margins have been derived from, and we have been preparing ourselves as the market leader. And I guess it's fair to say that we have been closing the gap massively to the market dealer, and it's been a series of good work in our division and this is sustainable. One can never rule out that there is going to be pricing issues because of overcapacities or this and that or weak demands, but on an underlying base the T&amp;D business has made one of the biggest progresses in all of our divisions and it's good, sustainable business, has its challenges. We do realize that there are a series of Chinese emerging competitors but we are a strong number too, and we welcome good competition.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Martin Prozesky from Bernstein. And two questions, please. The first on the supply chain program. Your gross margin has been slightly declining over the last few quarters. Is that pricing being reflected in the gross margin? And at what point should we expect to see the benefits of the program to start to reflect in the gross margin? So how does the pricing versus saving equation play out? And the second, in terms of the industrial businesses, you've booked restructuring in Industrial Automation in prior technologies and building technologies. Can you give us some more detail on where the closures or where that restructuring was booked? Was it closures of facilities, geographically where did it happen? You mentioned that you think you've done enough. Should we expect no more charges to come out of those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question on the supply chain impacting 2009, I can only repeat and say it is significant. Material productivity has been increased substantially. But as I also said in April, we will not give you the exact figure. I have indicated exactly the KPIs we are measuring. We are making great progress. And we just talked about T&amp;D as an example, and specifically, also there we have seen great progress in terms of leveraging the material spends the impact is there, but also the divisions themselves have accelerated their productivity. So the impact is there in 2009, on the cost base, clearly and for all our businesses but I will not give you the figure. But I have given the clear progress with the three KPIs that I've mentioned. The increase in the centralized spend by 50%. The increase in the global value sourcing by one percentage point. And last but not least, the reduction in our supply base by 15%. Out of this, you can assume there is a significant impact on the profitability of Siemens in 2009 and of course beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And on the Building Technologies, that is one like Industrial Solutions. That's one of the late cycle businesses. It's been holding up pretty nicely over the course of 2009. We actually had expected it to be a little slower in Q3 and Q4. You will be seeing restructuring at BT in 2010 and that will have a material impact to the bottom line. And I wouldn't be too surprised if that would actually cut the profit in half as of 2009. So this is late cycle. The number of buildings which are being equipped, you can see it, you can track it. Of course we do have favorable impact from our Green Energy program. We have many &#x2013; more and more customers are also convinced that this is sustainable and helps. But then again, they also want to see the payback. So there is some slowness on building technology due to late cycle nature and it will have material impact in 2010 as one of the assumptions we have shared with you, this division is one of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take Jochen Klusmann here, second row, and then Will Mackie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Jochen Klusmann from BHF. Two questions. One, you mentioned that you had in Q4 the positive impact from the hedge accounting. Can you give us a ballpark number how much that was roughly? And then on your guidance for the revenue for 2010, was just wondering 5% minus, is that in dollar, sorry, in euro terms? Or is that on a currency adjusted basis? Because you will face quite significant negative headwind from the currency side. So let's say if factore were then like-for-like, then probably we're talking about a reported number closer to minus 10. And then how would the math look like knowing you said the 10% been down over 77 billion? Maybe just get that straight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Let me &#x2013; maybe we'll get that straight here. Okay. So let me start with revenues because I just looked at it. So the &#x2013; when I was mentioning the 5% that wasn't supposed to be a more precise guidance, on the volume, just saying that if one &#x2013; you need to find a mid single-digit number then five obviously will qualify. So don't take it as granted but the number would be like-for-like, okay. So and the positive, as you all know, is that if we have to translate the dollar-based revenues, we'll translate the dollar-based costs. So and so, therefore, there is a limited impact on this one in 2010. There will be translation but that is not really posing a concern.</p>
          <p>On the transaction side, we are actually pretty nicely hedged. So we've got that one right, believe me. The only one point is that since the market values have already been appreciating in 2009 you cannot expect full incrementa appreciation, but we are nicely hedged all the way through 2010. So the transactional risk is limited, to put it carefully.</p>
          <p>And the issue we just don't have under control is the market risk. And market risk means what are &#x2013; what is the competitive landscape doing with the fact that the U.S. dollar deteriorates? And would that be having any indirect impact in terms of pricing or demand or financing project from our customers? So that's the big unknown and, and obviously no one can quantify that, but this has been a consideration which we took very conservatively into our assumption on pricing. As was other translation, it was about that favorable or unfavorable, depending on which side you are, currency exposure could trigger plasti line, and that could go into the bottom line straight away. So that's been the assumption.</p>

          <p>We are coming to the end. I will just take one more question. Will Mackie [MainFirst Holding].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Will Mackie from MainFirst Bank. Two questions, firstly on cash flow you already highlighted there was around two billion of drag from exceptional items last in 2009. Can you perhaps walk through the elements of restructuring and other positioning charges that you might term one time that you could see coming through in 2010?</p>
          <p>xAnd secondly, it's great to hear your margins in hearing aids are well north of average for the sector, but I fear what that means is within Workflow and Solutions you're carrying quite a substantial loss, even adjusting for the one-time charges this year. Can you turn that around? And if not, should you look at the structural setup of that division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, let us start with the related topic of hearing aids. It's absolutely right that it's north of average, and that's &#x2013; in order to make them work themath. The conclusion obviously is right, and then if you may remember that we said in the last conference call in Q3, also with regards to particular therapy and the like that this division needs structural help. And we definitely have not forgotten that, and the fact that we're not talking about it doesn't mean that we're not doing anything. So the demand remains that there will be structural optimization in that area, and that whenever we are ready we'll be happy to discuss it and walk you through the item. On free cash flow, the cash impact from charges of 2008 into 2009 was about a billng. That should actually ease significantly in 2010, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
