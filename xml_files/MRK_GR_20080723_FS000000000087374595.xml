          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Publication Results Merck KGaA Quarter 2, 2008 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Sascha Becker. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A warm welcome here from Darmstadt, great pleasure for us that you take the time and listen in our today's conference call for the second quarter 2008. I welcome today Dr. Michael Becker, our CFO and Dr. Bernd Reckmann, Head of the Chemicals division, both will be our hosts and happy to guide you through the second quarter results.</p>
          <p>I make it short and brief and kindly ask Dr. Becker now to start with his explanation of the second quarter. Please go ahead. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman, and also thank you for joining the Merck call and webcast. Our presentation will focus on the factors driving our results of second quarter and our guidance for 2008. I will take you through the quarterly highlights, group financial and Pharma sector, then Bernd Reckmann resumed responsibility for the Chemical sector on July 1st, will discuss Liquid Crystals and PLS, and after that I'll return to review our guidance.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide four of our analyst presentation, the Merck Group turn in strong results on the top-line in local currencies and experienced strong negative currency effects that impacted both revenue and operating results, particularly in Liquid Crystals. Organic revenues for the Group increased 12% and half of this growth was eliminated by currency. The organic revenue performance for the two quotation growth divisions, quotation was double-digit, with Liquid Crystals at 21% and Merck Serono at 13, while the other two divisions grew at a high single-digit rate. Importantly, Erbitux sales continue to grow, up 24% and we expect more good performance in the second half. Core return on sales was within our guidance corridor at 24.4% and core earnings per share improved by 13% to &#x20AC;1.53 due to improvements in our operating and financial results. Finally, it is worth noting upfront that we are reconfirming our guidance corridors that we provided in February, which I will review at the end.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the key figures for the Group. I start with slide six. As you can see there, Group revenue increased 6.1% to &#x20AC;1.9 billion, while the core operating results increased 2.5%. Cost of sales increased almost 10%. So the lower 4.8% increase in gross margin also shows the impact of currency on the top-line, especially in Liquid Crystals. Increase in marketing and selling expenses were offset by administrative savings. This translated into core operating results of 464 million and a core return on sales of 24.4%. For the first half of 2008 core return on sales is 25.7% and with our guidance corridor of 23 to 27% for the full year.</p>
          <p>The slide seven, as we have seen for several quarters now, currency has adversely affected the underlying performance of all divisions. The dollar depreciated to 1.53 per euro, off 15% from a year ago. This had a more pronounced effect on the bottom line compared to recent quarters.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals is the most extreme example since it has the highest foreign exchange exposure and no natural hedge. So in any quarter, 80 to 90% of the top-line currency effect drops through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, I would like to highlight several figures. First, the underlying tax rate for the quarter was 26.5%, about the same level as in the first quarter and in line with our expectation of an underlying tax rate for 2008, decreasing modestly from the full year 2007 level to 28.2%.</p>
          <p>Second, free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments was 79 million, a decrease of 98 million or 56% compared to last year's quarter. This decrease was mainly from working capital changes and from the timing of tax payments in the second quarter of this year. In addition, lack of 28 million cash flow were associated with our higher cash flow from generics in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the financial result for the quarter improved to 35 million &#x2013; 35 million charge, of course, mainly due to a 71% reduction in interest expense as a consequence of the substantially reduced net financial debt shown in the next slide.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, the financial result was slightly higher than in the first quarter due to the dividend payment at the end of March. For anyone interested, the reconciliation of core earnings per share is included in the appendix on slide 27. The reconciliation is relatively straightforward since there have been no impairments or exceptional charges in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Due to the purchase price allocation of Serono, there is always the risk for such charges going forward. If this risk materializes, we will be talking immediately about significant non-cash numbers. But we have seen no impairments so far this year does not mean much since they would most likely appear at the end of the year than during the year, because we are dealing with moving goalposts. I am predicting a couple of hundreds of millions of exceptional impairments by the time the year is done.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to the divisional results starting with Pharmaceuticals and Merck Serono. And I'm now on slide number 10. Merck Serono continued the trend of growth established by the division since its creation last year. Organic revenue growth for Merck Serono was 13% resulting from strong sales performance across our portfolio while the core operating results improved 14%. Marketing and selling expenses increased to support life cycle management project such as the Rebif new formulation launch and the rollout of differentiated new devices for Saizen and Gonal-f as well as launch preparations for Erbitux. These expenses were offset by reduced general and administrative costs, mainly from lower restructuring expenses compared to last year. Research and development expenses for the year remain on track to approach &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our most important brands continue to drive the top-line. Organic sales growth for Rebif exceeded 9% with European sales strength coming from the launch of the new formulation. US sales grew 15% due to both price and volume growth. EMD Serono announced a 9% Rebif price increase in the US at the end of May.</p>
          <p>Erbitux grew 24% in nominal terms versus last year, a 27% organic growth rate. The first quarter sales surge due to hospital budgetary cycles in some countries taking sales from May 2007 as well as some inventory stocking of the new formulation in France. We expect steady Erbitux performance throughout 2008. Following the Japanese marketing approval announced last week and the anticipated EMEA marketing authorization in first-line colorectal cancer in Europe, we look forward to sales in these additional segments during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Gonal-f sales grew 12% organically following the launch of the next generation pen as well as some regional strength in countries such as China where we have recently established our presence in the fertility market and in the US and Brazil where we have focused on improving patient access.</p>
          <p>Raptiva is continuing its growth &#x2013; to grow steadily and the EMEA recently approved an update of the summary of its product characteristics to include efficacy and safety data on up to three years of continuous treatment, the longest for any approved biological therapy for psoriasis.</p>
          <p>Saizen sales grew particularly well in Europe based on the success of the Easypod device. The classic products have continued to grow at double-digit rates and we are happy to have these products to have cover the cost of research as long as they last.</p>
          <p>Erbitux remains the key growth driver for Merck Serono. Nothing has changed from what our oncology team said at ASCO. They remain confident that Erbitux will be adopted by oncologists as a target therapy for first-line colorectal patients and that these specialists will be able to the access KRAS screening quickly at a reasonable cost.</p>
          <p>We expect to see initial sales this quarter from the expanded colorectal label in Europe and the initial approval in Japan. The FLEX data presented at ASCO demonstrated that Erbitux is the only monoclonal antibody to provide an efficacy benefit in lung cancer patients regardless of histology. We anticipate filing for lung cancer approval in Europe later this year. Merck Serono has recently filed for first-line approval of head and neck cancer and initiated the EXPAND Phase III study in gastric cancer. In conclusion, Erbitux is well positioned to become a blockbuster in Merck sales regions.</p>
          <p>I refer to the appendix of the slides we posted on our website for a summary of the Merck Serono pipeline and next move on to Consumer Health Care. So we are now on slide 14. CHC reported solid organic revenue growth exceeding 8% driven by performance of strategic brands within its four key health themes by providing positive cash flow. Focused advertising and intensified sales activities led to double-digit growth in strategic brands. Operating result for the recent quarter includes a 4 million settlement that received from a supplier as compensation for out-of-spec materials.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn over the discussion to Chemicals to introduce to you Bernd &#x2013; by Bernd Reckmann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon also from my side. Since it is my <mark type="inaudible" /> to most of our investors, I will share some of my professional background with you. I have been at Merck for 22 years, first in Diagnostic Research Unit then five years in Marketing and Sales within the Laboratory and Diagnostic business before becoming Head of the former Life Science Products division in 1989. I was then Head of Strategic Innovation at Merck before being appointed Managing Director of the Merck companies in Korea, an important market for the LC business. I have been a Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA since the beginning of 2007.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now review the results for the Chemical sector starting with slide 16.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, Liquid Crystal revenue increased by 7% to &#x20AC;283 million (sic) [&#x20AC;238 million]. Excluding the adverse currency effect of minus 14%, organic revenue growth was around 21%. Both the gross margin and operating result were strongly affected by currency with more than 80% of the &#x20AC;31 million currency impact on revenue dropping to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Gross margin decreased to 58.6% compared to last year and Q1. In large part, this is due to currency but also from expected price erosion and quarterly variations in our operations such as product transfer or quality maintenance.</p>
          <p>Q2 of last year included &#x20AC;7.2 million in favorable other operating income one-offs, which increased return on sales for that quarter. When you take these factors into consideration, this year's decline in return on sales is straightforward. In the first half, demand for display panels was stronger than expected and we sustained our market share in the overall LC market.</p>
          <p>You are probably aware, there are currently mixed signals in the market regarding the potential growth for the second half of 2008. Second half 2008 is compared to a strong 2007 period; however, we remain comfortable that our LCD business is on track to meet our guidance for the full year. Of course, we must see our currency develops during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>In the years to come, Liquid Crystals will remain a highly attractive growing business for Merck. Strong regional demand in Asia and Europe and the conversion of broadcast systems to high-definition and digital signals should drive solid growth for TVs in number of years. The experts at DisplaySearch are forecasting a compound annual growth rate in display area of 16% for 2007 through 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, consider where the market is today, LC is a clear winner in TV technology, while plasma is past its peak. We believe there will be further advances in liquid crystal displays and we are prepared to shape the technology for years to come.</p>
          <p>Our strategic goal is to grow with the market across the full range of liquid crystal technologies and applications and to maintain our position of leadership. This means enabling our customers' technology improvements and staying well ahead of our competition. To achieve this, we are focused building on our key strengths.</p>
          <p>First is innovation. To advance display performance and quality, we are working with our customers to develop new liquid crystal singles and plans, LC technologies and potential successor technologies including OLED. The recently launched PSVA or polymer-stabilized vertical alignment technology, is an example for Merck adding value. This technology speeds display switching times while improving our customers' manufacturing process.</p>
          <p>Next, continuous investments that drive production process improvements and in large capacity holds the key to sustaining our advantages in product quality, consistency and reliability with our customers. This goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence. This is essential for maintaining a highly competitive manufacturing cost structure.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are committed to sustaining our well established customer relationship that allow us to best understand our customers' need and to respond more quickly with new solutions than our competition. With our investment in our Korean Advanced Technology Center of Excellence we have consolidated all our local application research and planning in one location to best serve the local liquid crystal panel manufacturers.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, considering the market expectation and our leadership, Liquid Crystals remains a highly attractive business for Merck.</p>
          <p>Now coming to PLS at slide 18, a few words about the PLS division, which generated solid organic revenue growth of 7.1%, which is above the market growth rate. The strength of the business lies in its broad product portfolio and the diversification of its end markets making it a stable bread and butter business. During the quarter, regional strength continued in Asia and Latin America supported by investment in selling and marketing.</p>
          <p>This division also had a reversal of an environmental provision in last year's result of about &#x20AC;4 million, which explains most of the difference in the operating results between the two periods. PLS had a non-operating cash inflow of &#x20AC;18 million in Q2 2007 related to the sale of a minority interest in a lab distribution company, which explains most of the decrease in cash flow versus last year.</p>
          <p>That concludes my review of Chemicals. I hand it over again to Michael Becker to close his comments on our business outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bernd. With the half year over, we retained the outlook corridors for 2008 as established in February. We have only modified, slide 20 to include the half year performance figures for easy comparison. You can see that all first half results of the guidance corridors are targeted for the full year. Currency will further influence the full year results.</p>
          <p>We completed our 2008 planning in late 2007 and that's the time took the prevailing rate of one euro &#x2013; 1.47 per euro into consideration for this year. The excess currency development has been significantly worse than our original planning and expectation. Regardless of currency, Merck Serono is on a steady growth track and we plan to continue to launch new indication for Erbitux and other new products.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystal performance will continue to be exposed to currency effects on the top and bottom line making the high end of the return on sales corridor rather likely. For the Group, we can confirm our expectation to achieve revenue growth of 5 to 9% and core return on sales between 23 and 27%. We remain confident in our ability to meet this guidance.</p>
          <p>We are now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will now take our first question coming from Dani &#x2013; Erica Whittaker from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I have just got some questions on the Liquid Crystals. Now, in the second quarter which of the aspects that contributed to the margin decline we saw in the quarter would you say could be reversible in the next few quarters? For example, I understand that there is some restructuring in your singles manufacturing that was reflected in perhaps in lower gross margin in the second quarter. And secondly, regarding the outlook for the LCD panel makers is there any risk of sale &#x2013; of your sales decline in the second half of this year if your customers reduce their manufacturing capacity utilization due to continued inventory build? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here we go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'm happy to answer your questions. Number one, the major impact for the Q2 results in Liquid Crystals is currency. And currency is the major impact compared to previous year. We have mentioned the 31 million in translation effect, which drops down by 80 to 90% to the bottom line and this clearly explains the deviation you see. If we compare quarter one 2008 with quarter two 2008 then it's again currency as the major effect. In two &#x2013; in quarter one, we had an average US dollar exchange of 1.51 and now we have 1.56. At quarter two, this again is the majority of the impact we see on the result. The other effects like further optimization of manufacturing excellence is only of minor importance and it's in the range of the normal quarterly preparations, which does not impact the result that heavy. I think in conclusion, our clear statement that we will stay in our corridor with 47 to 52% clearly answers the question what we would expect in the next half of this year.</p>
          <p>With respect to the outlook, there are mixed messages coming from the market and from our customers. You know the announcements of some of the Taiwanese customers that they are thinking of reducing some amount of their capacity. There is some announcement of the Korean customers that they at least may think in this direction. So, overall, we can't clearly interpret whether they will do or whether they won't do. But we have to be cautious if we look into the second half, but definitely we expect further growth driven by the TV demand also for the second half in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Could I ask a question on Merck Serono, please? With the royalty income, which was quite a bit higher in the second quarter than the first, I was just wondering if that included one-off licensing fee. And regarding the Erbitux progression in the second half you said &#x2013; Mr. Becker you said that you expect steady Erbitux performance through 2008. Does that mean that you expect flat sales for the next two quarters? I mean, what exactly do you mean by steady, and if you could give us the basis for that statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the first question is, no. No particular one-offs included in that license figure. Just reflects the performance of our partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the steady performance of Erbitux, I mean that we are having reached a plateau, but that means that we are going steady from quarter-to-quarter. We do not expect a setback. There has been discussion out there that may be the KRAS issue may have a defeating effect on our sales, and we don't think so. And that is what we mean by steady.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, do you have any more detail on those exceptional impairments you mentioned coming through at year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm only saying that, we &#x2013; as I said before that we are dealing with high amounts in our balance sheet, remember 6 billion capitalized. And that smaller changes will have significant impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for example, we have, of course, capitalized our right that lead to the license income, they are all in dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if the dollars runs away, that is already an impact that goes in tens of millions. Interest, when we are calculating these values by the discounted free cash flow method. And our discounting factor is the WACC, the weighted average cost of capital. And if the interest raise with a normalized structure then we will also have a problem, an impact on the WACC. This can balance the currency effect partly because if the WACC is higher then the value is different. But these are developments, especially also expectations to the market, which will only materialize at the second half. But seeing the development in total, I think it's good to caution for things that happen only at year end.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just wondered, if I may come back to Liquid Crystals, just want to try and understand better the swing in the operating margin, the extent of that between the Q1 and Q2 and the swing in the currency, which looks like only a 3% deterioration shall we say Q1 to Q2, how does that lead to what looks to be a 700 basis points fall in the operating margin Q1 to Q2. Can you may be perhaps comment on any mix issues and any pricing issues? Secondly, just wanted to ask with respect to Kuvan when we might expect to hear something about that and timing of launch and expectations there? And just wondering if you could comment on with respect to the Classic sales, in particular what's been driving the strength of the Glucophage number and your expectations for Concor in the second half of 2008 and particularly, given perhaps increased generic competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very sorry. I'm afraid I didn't get the Pharma question. Can you repeat them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With respect to Kuvan with the timing of when that might be launched and your expectations there? And then secondly, with respect to the Classic sales, just trying to understand what has driven the strength of Glucophage number? And secondly, Concor, that's obviously been very strong. What are your expectations for the second half of 2008 given the, I think that there is likely to be increased generic competition in France for that product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Kuvan launch will be in the first half of 2009, but I repeat that this is going to be a smallest product and then we can't be compared with our US partners for the expectation of sales. Glucophage and Concor are doing well because we have excellent marketing people around the world, that's the only explanation for that. Unfortunately, they are fighting against constant efforts of the health systems to reduce prices or to give crosses to our competition and we are bracing ourselves for this headwind, which fortunately we have measures against other than the currency. But on the longer run, we are expecting a slowdown in these growth rates and finally a flattening and a decline of these products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to Liquid Crystals, as mentioned, the major impact from Q1 to Q2 is currency. We have the situation that all our manufacturing costs are in euro and that we sell in US dollar or Japanese yen. So, this is the majority of the deviation you see comparing the two quarters. Product mix is not of any material influence and there is an element in price reduction in this industry, which we face. And depending on the volumes of our mixture that we sell to our customers, it may be on a yearly basis in the range of mixed single-digit.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It just seems the magnitude of the margin swing perhaps should be more than just related to the swing in the FX. I mean there was a 12% hit in the first quarter on FX and a 14% hit in the second quarter and yet there is obviously a quite substantial swing in the margin profitability of that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The effect is currency and it's currently and currency, and then we have this element of price erosion, which I mentioned and in quarter two, some operation-related costs based on our current investments to further improve quality and also to transfer product from one facility to the next facility in our attempt to reach operational excellence and long-term very competitive manufacturing cost position.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question coming from Jo Walton from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry to come back to the same issues that we have been on already but you did point out that's Erbitux and Liquid Crystals were major drivers. Can you help us with the degree of visibility that you have for your orders. I know that you are confident and you speak to the manufacturers, and you have got display search demand statistics, but how far out do you have a degree of confidence in the orders, if you could just help us on some of that? And perhaps you could give us just a bit more sense of what the price and mix has been in the first half of this year?</p>
          <p>And on Erbitux, I know that you are expecting additional indications and you are not expecting a decrease in sales because of KRAS testing, but if you look at, let's say, an established center, one of your big customers, are you seeing them looking to adopt KRAS, and therefore this is something that might impact you or is your &#x2013; or are you actually just not seeing that actually coming into play yet? And the final question just on the exceptionals, will they be spread through the divisions or will that be something that hits you just in the finance line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With respect to the question relating to Liquid Crystals, that was first on &#x2013; or I'll start with the end. We see with &#x2013; from our contacts, we see manufacturers further demand in TV applications, and based on our orders, we foresee a period of six to eight weeks. Overall, of course, we have long-term estimations from our customers, but let's say the clear visibility founded by orders is for a period of up to two months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, this 21% organic growth is excellent figure for the quarter. We see volume increase, which is higher than this. Based on my statement of mid single digit price erosion on a yearly basis. There, we have kept our market share in the overall Liquid Crystal market constant in the first half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your comment about mid single digit price erosion for the year is also the same for the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay moving on to Pharma and Erbitux and the biomarker effect. We or my colleagues reported they see that the oncologists are taking on this biomarker issue, and are looking for the KRAS wild-type and mutated issue, which should take a bit of time, and maybe should also by focusing on the wild-type have a slightly slowing down impact on our overall sales. But this is only temporary, and will be overcompensated by our next indications coming into market like in the last quarter, we will have the new indications where we expect an approval very soon.</p>
          <p>So as I said in my introduction, we expect a plateau in the second half and not a decline. The exceptionals will be in our famous line, exceptions, so between operating result and EBIT, no, that &#x2013; EBIT. And as I said that we are cautioning exceptionals against the background of our high amount of capitalized intangibles and their sensitivity to even minor changes. It's clear that these will relate to the Merck Serono division, but it will be shown below operating result.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you. Just another question on LCD, again. I am sorry to ask this repeated question. But just in terms of Chiso, we know that Chiso now has a full quarter of production of VA mode. I mean, you say you have retained market share, I see &#x2013; is the price discount that you have been offering basically to maintain market share from Chiso, and how do you see that progressing in terms of the Chiso threat, firstly?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just a question on Erbitux. Will we be getting &#x2013; well, I should say, when shall we be getting the overall survival data in CRYSTAL, and in particular the resection data from patients who have KRAS wild-type?</p>
          <p>And an added question to that, the subset based on patients who had KRAS wild-type from the FLEX data? And then the last one related to Erbitux again, do you see any change in the EORTC European colorectal guidelines happening with respect to use of Erbitux? We saw in the Barcelona conference there was a positive sentiment towards Erbitux, but to Avastin's first line. Do you feel resection of formal guidelines at some point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As you know, Chiso is also selling VA material to our customers. This is based on a technology, which is different than the technology we use. So it happens without violating our patents. The penetration of competing material is quite slow, because our customers only switch the plan if they enter a new production of the unit, and then there is &#x2013; also cautious on the side of our customers until competitors have proven long time reliability and quality.</p>
          <p>Our main strategy to compete will be on innovation, not on price declines, and the example which I mentioned of PSVA, I think, is a very exciting one. This is a new technology offering better performance in the display for our customers, and giving all of the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, and PSVA is a technology, where we are not aware of any activities of our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as, Erbitux is concerned, the first part of the question, I mean, we haven't Elmar Schnee today with us, and we thought since he has been presenting with his colleagues extensively at the ESCO and had a investor's conference in San Francisco, where all these questions have been tabled something like in excess of 50 times. And that he then had made a road show, we though that everything in that regard has been said and there is nothing new, and I am really not inclined to repeat these detailed development questions that have been answered in full before.</p>
          <p>So the only thing that I would like to refer to is this recent guideline question where oncologists will have a different approach to the application of Erbitux and our colleagues out there in the field clearly believe that that will be not the case.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. The first, can you give us an update on Rebif new formulation in the U.S.? And also can you give us the split between the U.S. and rest of the world sales for Rebif? Also can you please give us an update on the oral cladribine program? Can we still expect results around April 2009 with American Academy of Neurology congress? And finally regarding Erbitux, can you please give us an update on the gastric cancer development? When will we have the results please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The new formulation of Rebif is still under review by the FDA in the U.S. And I don't know when we will have an answer from that. Maybe early 2009, that's the best guess that I can have. The oral form of &#x2013; the oral cladribine is on its way, and we expect early 2009, next news flow. And as far as Erbitux is concerned with gastric cancer we are just starting to enroll patients. And we have seen in previous clinical tests that this is a difficult task, and for me, I have no way to predict when this patient recruitment will be concluded, and therefore can make no concrete prediction on further news flow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Marcus Wieprecht, MainFirst. I have two questions. One is on the TV market, the technological developments there, and your view especially on the laser TV, there was some noise in the German press I have seen that this has several advantages compared to current technologies, including LCD in terms of brightness of the colors, in terms of energy consumption, whatever even price. So is that something that is visible for you &#x2013; from your point of view?</p>
          <p>And second question relates also probably to Chemicals and the issue of acquisitions. I mean, you still have pretty low net debt level of around &#x20AC;800 million. You have a to deal a lot with concerns on Liquid Crystals as a major earnings driver still today, so &#x2013; and you mentioned in previous occasions, you look for acquisitions, mentioned Life Science Chemicals as an example. So that would certainly help in terms of leverage, in terms of balancing of risks and earnings profile. So what is the status there? Is there anything you have particularly in focus? When can we expect news there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to alternative or potentially alternatives TV technologies, I think, actually LC is the clearly dominating technology. It has clearly surpassed plasma technology. The next thing which may come in our opinion is OLED, but this is something which we also have to put on a timely horizon later than 2012, 2013. We see actually a lot of other let's say initiatives in the research area, which sometimes get a lot of applications, but to our assessment, it would be truly speculative to say that some of these things really will have huge potential to penetrate the market.</p>
          <p>From our point of view, there is a lot to come on LC, because there will be further progress on the electronic side, there will be further progress on the chemical sides driven by Merck, so that we are not at the end of this development, and can expect long into the next decade growing Liquid Crystal business in TV. Chemicals is targeting acquisitions. We will talk on more details, if there is something to say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Hi, there. Just a follow-up. I just wanted to make sure we were doing the math right on your comments on the translational effect in the Liquid Crystal business in the second quarter, and how that flowed through to the bottom line. So, if you take the numbers, you gave us, that would give an actual, I guess, local currency EBIT margin for the second quarter of between 49 and 50%. Is that what you have been telling us? And then secondly you have been saying for some time that you didn't want to hedge U.S. dollar and yen, because the rates were so poor. Now it has come down again, is there a particular exchange rate at which you fell you would start hedging again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You did excellent math, it's in the ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The &#x2013; our approach to hedging is of course under review all the time. And we have seen that our expectation or hope that the yen and the dollar might recover has been frustrated, and we have adjusted our policy accordingly. And we are already since that time using little dips to hedge against further weakening of both currencies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Markus Mayer from UniCredit. One question on your PLS division, how was the current market situation for your effect pigments. According to my information, they are sold to the plastic producers and to the cosmetic industry, how is the demand in these industries for your product and different areas? And another question, today there was an acquisition in the effect pigment area from &#x2013; announced from Rockwood, are you interested to do some acquisitions in this area and if so are there several potential takeover targets you see there or is the market quite tight? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am pleased to answer your question. Last part first, we are targeting acquisitions in Chemicals, and I have said, we will give more details when it's appropriate, so no further specification on area of markets, targets, or something at this point of time.</p>
          <p>With respect to the PLS business, I think, the strength of the business as you know is really its diversity and its broad coverage of different industries, customer segments, and markets. In pigment, we currently see some weakening in the demand especially driven by the automotive industry/industry for our coating business starting in the US, but there are other segments which are still very robust. So that overall, I think, although this excellent sales development in this quarter supports our thesis of a very robust business although in let's say shady and cloudy economic situations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on operating margins, just in terms of currency. You mentioned in your presentation, your exports in the U.S. dollar, the yen and the Taiwanese dollar. Could you give any sort of I think flavor as to what's the proportion of balances between these three currencies, and also whether one of these three or some of them affect the margin more than the others? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think, the driving currency is the U.S. dollar, it's about 80%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, my question is, for example, the Taiwanese dollar has come up quite a lot, does that affect the margin any more adversely than the other currencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we &#x2013; our currency situation, Korea and Taiwan are dollar, whether they are Taiwan dollar or Won, they are really dollar. So we are dealing here with the difference between dollar and yen, and not Taiwan dollar, Won and Yen, that's &#x2013; the rest is dollar. And we have very little cost especially in manufacturing, we have only the manufacturing plant, the big manufacturing that you have seen, and that is what it is. All the manufacturing &#x2013; or nearly all the manufacturing costs are in euro, but if you want to make a judgment then the dollar, as Bernd Reckmann says, it plays the main role in our considerations with regard to currencies.</p>
