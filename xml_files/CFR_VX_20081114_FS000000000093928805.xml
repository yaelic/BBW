        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alan and good morning to you all. Despite the difficult financial environment, sales grew at 10% or 16% at current currencies, in line with last year. This reflects Richemont's high-end positioning and leadership extended to the so-called emerging clientele. Close to 60% of the increase of Group sales is attributable to them. Sales grew at double-digit rate in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Trading in Japan remains difficult, and has recently slowed down sharply in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The operating profit rose by 14%, leading to an operating margin of 22.8%. At constant currencies, all things being equal, the operating profit would have grown by 36%. This increase reflects strong sales and a tight control over expenses, despite a lower gross margin related to a very negative ForEx environment.</p>
          <p>Group net profit, including the BAT [British American Tobacco] contribution, rose by 5% to &#x20AC;864 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to &#x20AC;224 million.</p>
          <p>The luxury watch market has enjoyed a remarkable performance, in particular the high end. Sales grew by 27% for watches with export prices above CHF3,000 that is retailing for more than &#x20AC;6,000. Such performances were achieved against very challenging currencies and record prices for precious materials. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 11% versus the euro, while the average price of gold in euro terms appreciated by 16% over the period.</p>
          <p>Here is the P&amp;L of the Luxury business. Sales grew at 10% in euro terms. The gross margin rose by 8%. And because of good control over expenses, the operating profit grew by 14% to &#x20AC;639 million. The operating margin further improved to reach 22.8% of sales. This implies 1.4 times operating leverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Europe, Middle East and Africa is by far our main region. This region generated 45% of Group sales. Sales rose by 18% at constant rates, an acceleration over last year. This continued strong performance reflects development in Western Europe, where sales rose by 14% at constant rates, underpinned by strong sales of high jewelry and complicated watches to nationals from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p>
          <p>For this half-year, we estimate that above 50% of sales in these regions are made to this group of people. Sales in Russia and in the Middle East continued on a very high note. Altogether, direct sales in Russia and the Middle East contributed to 7% of Group sales, while sales from nationals from these two regions are estimated to generate above 20% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, since September growth has slowed significantly, turning negative in October, less 2%, due to poor domestic demand. However, up until now, demand from non-Western Europeans has remained strong.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific is our second largest region, with 26% of Group sales. Sales rose by 30% at constant rates, the fourth year of strong double-digit growth. Growth was solid across most of our Maisons and main markets.</p>
          <p>In October, sales grew by 12% at constant rates and by 16% in euros. Sales in Hong Kong and Mainland China grew by 22% and 52%, respectively, in line with last year. China is our number two market in Asia-Pacific after Hong Kong and our sixth market worldwide, ahead of Italy. China now generates 6% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>Our Maisons are extremely well positioned in Mainland China. This year Cartier has once again been ranked the number one jewelry brand by the best of the best-run surveys that focuses on the preferred brands of China richest and Piaget, the number one jewelry watch brand.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Americas grew at 9% at constant rates. In euro though, sales declined by 2%, given the 11% depreciation of the dollar over the period. As anticipated and disclosed, since August sales growth has slowed down and it turned negative in September and October.</p>
          <p>Given the financial crisis and volatility of the U.S. dollar, we have put in place measures to mitigate the impact of slower sales. However, despite the current crisis, we remain confident over the long-term prospects of this region.</p>
          <p>Sales declined by 7% in yen and in euro. As a result, Japan's contribution to Richemont sales declined to 11% of sales, while the contribution of the Japanese clientele worldwide is expected to be about 13% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>One piece of good news is the recent appreciation of the yen versus the euro after seven year of continuous deterioration; therefore seven years of uninterrupted price increases. Since September 2001, the yen has depreciated by some 30% against the euro. Since the lowest points of 169.54 to the euro on the 20th of July this year, the yen has recouped some 13% against the euro at the end of September, and some 27% as of this morning.</p>
          <p>In spite of this breath of fresh air over the short term, we maintain our conservative view on this market given its long-term structural issue. This half-year growth was again mostly driven by our jewelry Maisons and our specialist watchmakers.</p>
          <p>This all the more remarkable that in a comparative period these two business segments achieved a strong growth of respectively plus 15% and plus 24% at constant currency. As a result, these Maisons represented close to 80% of Richemont sales. This reflects an upgrading of demand toward the higher end of the luxury spectrum.</p>
          <p>Looking at the sales breakdown by product line, we note that watches remain the biggest contributor to Group sales, jewelry was the biggest contributor in sales increase in value, plus &#x20AC;119 million. Sales grew at 28%. The faster growth rate is reflecting the dynamism of Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Piaget and Montblanc. Leather was up 4%. Cartier and Montblanc did well in this category.</p>
          <p>Sales of writing instruments declined by 6%, impacted by the reduction in the number of wholesale points of sales and a more difficult trading environment for this category of products. Sales in other rose by 18%, reflecting mainly the integration of third-party watch components manufacturers.</p>
          <p>By network, retail sales, that only include sales to our internal stores, represent 40% of Group sales. They rose by 18% faster than wholesale sales. The higher performance of retail versus wholesale reflects buoyant trading at our Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Piaget and Montblanc boutiques, as well as some network expansions. Wholesale performance reflects mostly Cartier and the specialist watchmakers' trading.</p>
          <p>Gross margin rose by 8% to &#x20AC;1.790 million. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels particularly improved its gross margin. As for <mark type="inaudible" />, gross margin has been under pressure and declined by 110 basis points to represent 63.9% of sales.</p>
          <p>The stronger Swiss franc, plus 2.2%, played against us this first half, bear in mind that watches represent 50% of Group sales, all being made in Switzerland, apart from Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne. The weaker U.S. dollar and related currencies, as well as price increases for gemstones and precious metals had also a strong negative impact during the period.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses grew by 5%, well below the 10% growth in sales. Selling and distribution cost, 52% of total OpEx, rose by 7%, reflecting strong sales and network cost. There were 36 net openings of internal stores between April and September 2008.</p>
          <p>Communication cost rose by 3% to reach 10.4% of Group sales. For the full year, this ratio will probably be higher because of the seasonality of our business and the one-off cost of two SIHH [Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie] salons. Effectively the last watch salon took place in April '08, and the next one will take place in January '09. In H2, communication cost will be very closely monitored.</p>
          <p>Administration costs increased by 4% despite inflationary pressure, to present 9.4% of Group sales. Anticipating a slowdown, we have been cautious with our administration expenses. This performance also reflects the efficiency of our business model by leveraging on our shared service centers at headquarters and in the regions. Other income are flat and represent royalties received by Montblanc, Chlo&#xE9; and Dunhill.</p>
          <p>So Richemont continued to benefit from its operating leverage. With the rise of 10% in reported sales, operating profit grew by 14% to &#x20AC;639 million. The operating margin improved by 80 basis points, from 22% in September '07 to 22.8% this September.</p>
          <p>Most of our Maisons enjoyed robust growth, confirming Richemont's leadership, impressive jewelry and luxury watches. The jewelry and watch Maisons improved their profits, in particular, Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Piaget and Vacheron Constantin.</p>
          <p>The jewelry Maisons posted the best performance. Sales grew by 18% at constant currency, 11% at actual rates, reflecting double-digit growth both at Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, despite challenging comparatives, plus 9% reported the prior year.</p>
          <p>The jewelry Maisons saw their contribution grow by 22% to &#x20AC;449 million. The contribution margin increased by 288 basis points, to 32% of sales. Cartier once again has improved its contribution margin, in spite of tough Japan and adverse currencies. The operating contribution of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels continues to improve.</p>
          <p>Sales at our specialist watchmakers increased by 17% at constant currencies, or plus 12% reported, driven by a buoyant watch market. The operating margin contribution rose by 6%. This was 160 basis points below last year, very high level, due to adverse ForEx, higher precious metals, material prices, and continuing production constraint.</p>
          <p>The rise in net assets relates primarily to the acquisition of Roger Dubuis. Bottlenecks resulted in a significant increase in work in progress and delays in product launches. The coming product launches should help H2 results, all things being equal.</p>
          <p>Montblanc sales rose by 1% reported, or by 5% at constant currencies led by retail, up by 15%. Wholesale was impacted by softer pen sales due to the closure of 1,700 point of sales at the end of March 2008.</p>
          <p>The operating contribution of the writing instrument Maisons decreased by 19% to reach 12% of sales. Montblanc is operating in a price segment more affected by lower disposal income. In addition, its big exposure to the Western clientele, in the U.S. and in Europe, makes it more vulnerable than other Maisons given the slowdown in spending from these customer groups. At constant rates, Alfred Dunhill sales rose by 2% and declined by 5% in euros. Alfred Dunhill losses amounted to &#x20AC;9 million due to lower sales.</p>
          <p>Lancel sales declined by 4% at constant rates and by 5% in euro. Its losses amounted to &#x20AC;6 million. Its exposure to the local French market and the fact that it's still in a transition phase makes it more vulnerable. The good news is that the gross margin continued to improve, and that Sumitomo recently became their partner in Japan. They've also recently signed a distribution agreement with Fairton in China.</p>
          <p>This segment consists of Chlo&#xE9; family, thereafter Shanghai Tang, some non-branded component manufacturing activity, as well as other ventures. The other businesses saw sales rise by 19%. The growth is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions, such as the watch case company Donz&#xE9;-Baume. The decline of the operating contribution is largely attributable to a lower contribution from Chlo&#xE9;, whose sales have significantly slowed down. Sophie?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. And thank you, Richard. Once again, Cartier sales ended the half-year with double-digit growth. Cartier also improved its contribution margin, both in value and in percentage terms. High-end jewelry <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
          <p>The focus on excellent service, whatever the product price, has helped attract the broad array of clientele and develop customer loyalty. By consolidating its image of 'King of Jewelers' with stunning creations both in high jewelry, with unique pieces for the Biennale des Antiquaires in Paris and in high jewelry watches, with pieces such as the Santos Triple 100 Pav&#xE9;e, and with a sophisticated communications program, including a refined advertising campaign, selective PR events, such as the Polo Cup in Windsor and Stadt, exhibition of a Cartier collection in prestigious museum this year in Seoul.</p>
          <p>Cartier is penetrating the high-end segment of complicated watches; we will launch later this year of watches bearing the famous and prestigious Poin&#xE7;on de Gen&#xE8;ve, considered as the highest accolade for watch collectors. The new Ballon Bleu and Pasha Seatimer watches continued on a high note, with further models enriching the collection. In accessories, the Marcello Bag is confirmed as the bestseller.</p>
          <p>The half-year saw the opening of 10 stores, including the Beijing Parklife and the Seoul, where they have flagships. Nine openings took place in Asia and one in Russia. The number of watch point of sales stabilized below 1,700, despite openings in emerging markets. Overall, a very satisfactory half-year, which underlies the global appeal and the managements of Cartier.</p>
          <p>Sales of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels enjoyed the strongest double-digit growth, driven by the success of its high-end jewelry collections at l'Atlantide and Ballet Precieux, and of the continued expansion of a more accessible line, Alhambra.</p>
          <p>The recently introduced high jewelry collection, Jardins, and Bijoux Collection Perl&#xE9;e, had a promising start. Jewelry watches, like Lady Arpels F&#xE9;erie of a poetic complication Midnight in Paris, had a strong growth, but jewelry watches still represent less than 15% of sales.</p>
          <p>Geographically, all areas did extremely well, with China, Macao, Russia, and Dubai growing the fastest. Generally speaking, the brand is still under-represented in many countries, thereby still benefiting from an upside potential, including Japan.</p>
          <p>The retail network is expanding slowly, mostly in emerging markets, and an external store opened in Macao in July. This excellent performance led to further improvement in its contribution margin.</p>
          <p>Now, Piaget. Piaget had one of the strongest growths in sales. This strong performance led to big improvement in profitability. The unique Magic Hour and Possession watches outperformed, as did the Limelight party collection &#x2013; high jewelry collection, and the more affordable Possession wedding rings.</p>
          <p>Asia, excluding Japan, that represents about 50% of sales, enjoyed the fastest growth. Retail outperformed, in particular the Hong Kong and Macao stores. Increased product placements among American film and singing stars is further raising Piaget visibility, while exhibition spaces dedicated to its history in its flagship stores will reinforce Piaget's image as an innovative watchmaker. Initially in Geneva, this exhibition concept will be rolled out in the new Piaget boutique in Canton Road, Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Finally, a few days ago, Piaget won two awards for excellence from the international jury of Montres Passion, one for the Magic Hours ladies watch and the other one for the Altiplano Petite Seconds.</p>
          <p>Baume &amp; Mercier. Baume &amp; Mercier sales were once again hampered by component shortages. Latest launches did well. The Classima Executive, the Riviera, and Il&#xE9;a outperformed targets. The rest of the year will be tough, as it operates in a highly competitive segment, and 80% of its sales are made to westerners.</p>
          <p>Jaeger-LeCoultre achieved strong sales in most regions, despite major product shortages. The Master Tourbillon and Master Compressor Diving range did particularly well. The new Reverso ladies' Squadra and Master Tourbillon 175th anniversary, however, only reached the stores in September, likewise for the price-winning Journet and Reverso Grande Complication.</p>
          <p>Starting this month, two new ad visuals will be launched, one aimed at ladies and the other one underlying its corporate identity, to further raise understanding and awareness.</p>
          <p>IWC enjoyed the strongest growth among the specialist watchmakers. All regions and all lines did very well, notably the new vintage collection. The party celebrating its 140th anniversary gave IWC a fantastic editorial coverage. IWC continued to build a highly selective network of boutiques, mostly external, with the opening of Dubai and Beverly Hills last month.</p>
          <p>At Panerai, sales rose at a strong double-digit rate, despite continued delays in supply. The strategic Manifattura collection is confirming its success. And this season it was enriched with the Radionmir 10 days in white gold and the Luminor 1950 8 days Chrono Monopulsante GMT. With two openings this first half, its network rose to seven boutiques worldwide.</p>
          <p>At Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne, stronger sales in the U.S. were mitigated by softer sales in Europe, its biggest market. In the coming months, Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne intends to optimize its product allocations toward China and the Middle East, where it sees most potential in the short term.</p>
          <p>Product-wise, the Cabaret Tourbillon introduced in May is another technological breakthrough, further reinforcing the innovative and exclusive positioning of the Maison.</p>
          <p>Vacheron Constantin enjoyed a strong performance across the board, except in Japan, less than 4% of sales. It is particularly well positioned in Russia and China. To enhance its position in Haute Horlogerie, Vacheron Constantin has enriched its Metiers d'Art collection and launched a new segment of personalized watches. The Quai de l'Ile watches can accommodate up to 400 combinations and integrate the Poin&#xE7;on de Gen&#xE8;ve movements.</p>
          <p>Vacheron Constantin just opened a second mansion this time in Shanghai. This investment will reinforce its leadership in high-end watches in China. Of the 600 square meters, it accommodates collector salons with individual self-service, a special order salon, an exhibition area and a service center.</p>
          <p>Roger Dubuis. Roger Dubuis, founded in 1995, is our youngest Maisons. Its bold and distinctive designs complement our portfolio, while its mastering of Haute Horlogerie reinforces a high-end positioning. It enjoys the highest degree of integration, including escapements and spirals. 100% of its movements bear the prestigious Poin&#xE7;on de Gen&#xE8;ve. In terms of sales, it is the smallest of our specialist watchmakers, but its watches command one of the highest average retail prices.</p>
          <p>A fairly small company with a head count of about 420 people and no subsidiaries outside Switzerland, Roger Dubuis is undergoing an internal reorganization concerning its production and administration under the leadership of an experienced manager coming from Richemont. Starting in January, we will integrate the wholesale distribution within the Richemont distribution platforms. This will open the way to an international expansion.</p>
          <p>High levels of back orders for gold watches will also need to be addressed. In parallel, more work to reinforce awareness and visibility will be carried out. For the brand itself, it will take three years to bring it back to a level of profitability comparable to its peers.</p>
          <p>However, the Group is already leveraging on the Roger Dubuis manufacturing know-how in escapements and high-end movements. For example, this acquisition has helped Cartier establish an atelier to manufacture the new collections of Cartier's high-end watches bearing the Geneva Seal.</p>
          <p>Now Montblanc. Reported sales were flat, but up at single-digit rate at constant rates, driven by Asia-Pacific. With 39% of total sales, retail continues to outperform wholesale. This is due to product mix, the quality of the network and a reduction in the number of wholesale point of sales. Effectively, pen sales were declined. But the diversification products continued to outperform, such that their contribution to total sales rose to 50%.</p>
          <p>Most launches are happening about now, in particular the Star Rieussec collection, with prices starting at &#x20AC;20,000, the first Montblanc watch with a Montblanc movement.</p>
          <p>Montblanc is continuing its emphasis on women by extending its fine jewelry offer, with the launch of Dame Blanche collection and the development of bejeweled pens, with the new Etoile collection.</p>
          <p>Retail-wise, it opened boutiques in Beijing, S&#xE3;o Paulo and Dubai. The price positioning and the high exposure to the local Western clientele make it more sensitive to economic slowdowns. However, its strong presence in Asia-Pacific, notably China, should have a mitigating effect.</p>
          <p>Dunhill. Losses amounted to &#x20AC;9 million. Asia-Pacific, with close to 60% of sales, was up at 9% at constant rates. Within this, China grew by 8% to reach 24% of worldwide sales, as the decline in value of Shanghai Stock Exchange significantly impacted the wealth of our target customers. Japan was down 4% in yen.</p>
          <p>The recent appointment of Kim Jones as Creative Director will provide a distinctive creative thread across all product categories. This move confirms that Dunhill is committed to becoming the world's premier destination for men's luxury goods.</p>
          <p>After the first Home of Alfred Dunhill in Tokyo last December, London and Shanghai opened in &#x2013; last December, yes, London and Shanghai opened in September. Alongside the full range of products, these Homes offer a number of services, including barber and valet services. These Homes are essential to enhance the image of Alfred Dunhill globally.</p>
          <p>Now Lancel, which reported sales were down by 5%. Retail was up, but wholesale was down, impacted by the reduction in the number of wholesale point of sales in France. As a result, the 190 basis-point improvement in the gross margin did not prevent a worsening of losses to &#x20AC;6 million.</p>
          <p>Lancel's repositioning towards ladies' bags of high quality and high prices is well underway. Much work has gone into the attractiveness and spread of the bag offer. However, this new positioning has to be better known, hence the doubling of the A&amp;P [advertising and promotional] expenses.</p>
          <p>In addition, the fact that 80% of its sales &#x2013; over 80% of its sales are made in Europe, predominantly with local clientele, is likely to weigh on wholesale performance in the coming months.</p>
          <p>The good news for the next fiscal year, apart from the improvement in the gross margin and in the bag offer is a signing of a joint venture with Sumitomo in Japan, who was instrumental in the success of some well-known leather brands and with Fairton in China. This redeveloped international presence, at a low cost for us, will better balance revenues and will enable Lancel to take advantage of growing markets.</p>
          <p>Finally, Chlo&#xE9;. Lower sales overall masked good growth in Asia-Pacific and in licensed products. Shoes, eyewear, children's collection and the See By Chlo&#xE9; ready-to-wear did very well.</p>
          <p>The Paraty bag and the Chlo&#xE9; Perfume re-launched in February are outperforming targets. The licensed See By Chlo&#xE9; leather goods and shoe lines launched this summer is also having an encouraging start. With the arrival of Hannah MacGibbon, Chlo&#xE9; will strengthen its creative direction and strive to be repositioned as a high-fashion reference.</p>
          <p>In ready-to-wear, Chlo&#xE9; has to recover its position as a trend leader. And in leather, the offer has to be adapted and creativity reinforced. The shoes offer will be enlarged and harmonized to be more in line with the ready-to-wear collection. The advertising concept will be revisited, and Hannah MacGibbon put forward as Chlo&#xE9;'s spokesperson, all the more as she is perceived by the press as being a good illustration of Chlo&#xE9;'s identity.</p>
          <p>Given the segment Chlo&#xE9; operates in, the coming months should be challenging. Therefore we are controlling costs, notably freezing retail development until the sellout recovers strongly. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sophie. So let's come back to the financial figures now. Net finance income. Net finance income fell to &#x20AC;15 million. The &#x20AC;33 million of net interest were partly offset by temporary net foreign exchange losses on our hedges. Our funds have been predominantly invested in government bonds funds since December '07.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate decreased from 18.1% to 17%. Net profit from parent and subsidiaries increased by 11% to &#x20AC;543 million, representing 19.4% of Group sales, up 20 basis points on last year.</p>
          <p>Compared to the &#x20AC;268 million of cash flow of last year, cash flow from operations declined to &#x20AC;224 million, in view of higher working capital requirements. This is due to higher inventories of finished goods and work in progress, largely explained by higher precious material prices and by component shortages. Overall, our stock rotation rate on gross inventory has gone from 15.8 months in September last year to 17.9 months of cost of goods sold this September.</p>
          <p>Depreciation rose by &#x20AC;20 million as a result of higher investments in manufacturing and retail. Other items declined due to lower charges linked to the unit options and long-term incentive schemes.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow from subsidiaries became negative as a result of higher CapEx and the acquisition of Donz&#xE9;-Baume, 60% of Roger Dubuis, and other venture investments. This is reflected in &#x20AC;160 million of net change in subsidiaries and non-current assets. These investments have not been offset by disposals, such as our Egana stake last year.</p>
          <p>Gross fixed assets rose from &#x20AC;98 million to &#x20AC;128 million, accounting for 4.4% of sales. Net CapEx amounted to &#x20AC;122 million compared with a depreciation level of &#x20AC;75 million. Despite the fact that the biggest part of the cash flow is generated in H2, all pending projects have been reviewed given the economic environment. Only those considered as strategic are being implemented. This postponing of non-critical projects will impact fiscal '10 rather than fiscal '09.</p>
          <p>By segment, a quarter of the investments were made in the jewelry Maisons and another quarter in the specialist watchmakers. With half year, investments were pretty balanced between retail, manufacturing and others. The most notable retail investments were Cartier new and extended boutique in Seoul, Beijing, Kowloon, Dubai and Florence; Montblanc new store in Rue de la Paix; Dunhill new Bourdon House in London; and the Dunhill and Vacheron Constantin flagships in Shanghai.</p>
          <p>In manufacturing, the most important investment were the extension of manufacturer Val Fleurier, which manufactures in-house movements, the extension of the Jaegar-LeCoultre manufacturing facility, and the renovation of the Minerva facility. The majority of other relates to investments in our service platforms in China, the new Montblanc distribution center in Hamburg, and in IT investments.</p>
          <p>The net cash position increased from &#x20AC;904 million to &#x20AC;927 million. It is composed of &#x20AC;90.75 invested in government bonds fund, and &#x20AC;564 million of operational debt in yen, U.S. dollar and Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>Even after the transfer of 351 cash to Reinet <mark type="audio gap" /> our Group has a very healthy balance sheet. The strong &#x2013; the strength was nothing in a highly leveraged and unsecure environment. Richemont's effective interest amounts to 19.5% of British American Tobacco. For this half-year, our share results declined by 4% to &#x20AC;320 million. We will equity account for BAT through the 20th of October, net of the split.</p>
          <p>Net profit contribution from parent and subsidiaries represents 62% of the Group's net profit. After the contribution from BAT, the Group's net profit rose by 5% to &#x20AC;864 million.</p>
          <p>On the October 21 this year, Richemont became the only multi-brand Group focused purely on luxury. The philosophy, strategy and way the luxury group is managed remains unchanged. If anything, there is a stronger focus on cash flow generation and organic growth.</p>
          <p>The restructuring has no impact on our future operating profit. Our balance sheet is strong with a significant amount of cash. We want to continue building brand equity to ensure sustainable cash flow over the long term in order to create value for our shareholders. We want to consolidate our leadership in precious jewelry and watches, an area where we still see much potential despite turbulence. We are looking to grow permanently organically, but we'll contemplate acquisitions should suitable opportunities arise.</p>
          <p>For this fiscal, we are focusing and allocating comparatively more resources in Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe and the Middle East where we see most growth potential over the medium term. For instance, this half-year, our Maisons have opened 19 internal and external boutiques in Mainland China, bringing the total to 185.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, our regional platform in Dubai has successfully integrated Baume &amp; Mercier, Montblanc, Dunhill and Chlo&#xE9;, while eight internal and external boutiques were opened in the region. In parallel, we continue to roll out our integrated ERP [Enterprise Resource Planning] system this time in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>In June'09, products will be shipped directly from our central distribution platform in Fribourg to our point of sales at all our Swiss retailers, in addition to all retailers in Benelux, Scandinavia, U.K., and Ireland. The rest of Europe will follow step-by-step.</p>
          <p>The market increasingly demands enormous movements. Our Maisons are therefore extending their manufacturing integration levels. All these initiatives will help us better manage sales and our working capital, which is crucial to monitor our cash flow generation. More than ever, our prime objective is generating cash.</p>
          <p>Sales in October declined by 2% at constant rates and rose by 2% in euro. Over the 10 months to October, sales grew by 12% at constant rates, 9% reported.</p>
          <p>The slowdown that we're seeing is likely to persist throughout next year. We hope that our anticipation of this slowdown, combined with the much better diversification in term of brand, geography and network will help to mitigate the expected poor performance of the local, Western, especially USA and Europe, and Japanese markets.</p>
          <p>A significant reduction of growth in sales would put pressure on free cash flow. Despite a strong result in H1, we view the second half of the year and next year as very challenging, but fully mitigated by better products. Therefore, we are implementing measures to contain our working capital, reduce our expenses and limit our CapEx to strategically important investments.</p>
          <p>In the long term, we continue to see major growth opportunities, given the strengths of our Maison, the diversity of our clientele, largely untapped markets like India and a strong balance sheet with a net cash position. Thank you.</p>

          <p>So let's move on to the question-and-answer session. We'll do our best to answer those questions for you. Who would like to ask the first question? Patrik, you're in the front row.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Zurcher Kantonalbank. Good morning. First, regarding the October sales. Could you give us some information how &#x2013; of the split in the wholesale and the retail? And secondly, regarding the cost control you were mentioning, what is really possible, let's say, for H2 and for next year in terms of costs in &#x2013; if you take the selling cost, if you take the communication costs and the administration costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start with your last question first. Of course, operational costs have an amount of variables as far as sales and sales costs are concerned. As you know that in some countries that's &#x2013; it's not only fixed costs. So there is a natural digression if sales would slow down. Secondly, of course, advertising and promotion is a question of focus, even though we do not intend really to dramatically cut this, because we don't believe that this is good advice in a time where it &#x2013; everything is about market share. And we think that our brands, at least most of them, have very strong brand DNA. They &#x2013; this is a sober period, where iconic products are looked for. This is a period when people look for products, which are investment value. I recently read that it's very difficult nowadays to buy safes, private safes, and people have to put something into these safes.</p>
          <p>So we are, of course, looking at cost controls, very clearly. I think we have been prudent in the recent years, as you obviously can see that our costs have not been grown with sales. And, of course, we will look at all angles, starting from possibilities to renegotiate retail leases. There are many media buying &#x2013; there are many opportunities today where you have to look at and be not afraid to look at. We will be very careful with hiring or even replacement. That is very clear. And, again, that we have to be intelligent about this, there's no point to generally say no hiring, no increase of staff. That depends on region. As we've said throughout the presentation from Richard, we still have regions with considerable growth and we have still regions where Richemont has not been very active in the past, India to start, but also the Middle East and to an extent China. If you take Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne, they have just started to operate in China, because so far they indulged in the luxury, to say we have not enough product anyway for market like this. So we have to be specific and not when we talk about saving. But, of course, that is presently on the agenda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have an idea for the second half? I mean in the first half the net operating expenses increased by 5%. I mean is it really possible for the second half to have a lowering increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are asking always for guidance. And you know that we don't do that on a very concrete question. What do you expect me to say, 2%, 3%, 4.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's clear that the communication expenses, as we indicated, will be higher in the second half, just because of the seasonal, of course, impact of Christmas, plus the fact that we'll have the second salon in January, which is a one-off cost, by the way without any direct impact on sales. So it's clear that it will wait on the evolution of expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe in terms of &#x2013; for gross margin, which was hampered in H1 by currencies, but that's I mean the positive side to the story that this has dramatically changed, the currency environment will help in the second half, with strong yen and strong U.S. dollar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've already mentioned, it really depends on the evolution of the currencies. It's very important to bear in mind that we're very exposed to the evolution of ForEx. And it looks like the trend has changed, as far as the yen and the dollar is concerned. For how long, how deep? I don't know. But definitively, it may impact the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for October, retail and wholesale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question was the split of retail and wholesale sales in October, the growth in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no dramatic change. Retail is generally holding on a bit stronger, because you have today dealers, which don't find enough financing anymore and are in a state of extreme conservative approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Dennis Weber from Dresdner Kleinwort. Again, on October, could you tell us, or remind us, of the comp of the performance to last year? And then also specifically how brand Cartier performed in that month? And then also, obviously, in the light of the slump in demand in October and September, I guess, as well, could you talk a little bit about the situation on the watch component side, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comparative last year, I don't remember. Sophie, perhaps you can remind us. Anyway, we don't disclose by brand for the month of October. We disclose by regions. So I believe it's enough. And remember, that this time is very significant. One month, often we used to say that don't pay too much attention to one-month's performance. This one, perhaps, is significant. Per brand, you have the comments for the first six months, and I do believe that they really reflect the situation of every brand and there is no specific, I would say, indication to give for the month of October per brand that we don't disclose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In October 2007, sales were up 18% at constant rates and 11% reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite a strong base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert, would you like to comment on the watch component situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at the watch business, we still, today, are having a situation that our brands don't have enough components. There are still shortages. That has an effect on work in progress, because if one part is missing you can't finish the product. And subsequently, there are still, today, considerable backlogs &#x2013; considerable backlogs. Are these backlogs holding? Well, we don't know. I told you that the watch dealers, and specifically, of course, in the United States are extremely careful in reordering. That is not surprising to you because you have heard that probably elsewhere. But a lot of brands are still struggling with output, with sufficient output, to meet these backlogs. That is probably going to ease, but we are still having, today, brands who have delivered only a fraction of their creative newnesses of the last years, I mean a small fraction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, Eifert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. I have a follow-up question to the watches. Do you think there will be the demand if these watches are finished when you get the components, because I have the impression that demand is just collapsing and once you deliver the watches, soft and maybe there is no more demand?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in September, when you gave us the five months trading update, you said there was already a weakness and lower entry price points, but the high end held up really well. Could you reiterate the same for October, or did we see already a change in the effect &#x2013; that the high-end really keep up holding well, can you comment on that? And considering the oil price now just around $50 or something like that, and collapse in the stock markets, do you really think that the Middle East will also hold up so well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a lot of questions. You guys should have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... most of the answers, not us, okay. You guys should have most of the answers, not us. Certainly, it's very clear that the Middle East is still making money at oil prices of 50 or 60, not as much as 140, which was a blip. And then, you can read all the same reports, which we guys read whether the oil price might stay low or go up in the midterm, or even go up considerably in the mid to the long term. We don't know. We have to see. Definitely we don't see any, and I mean any slowdown in the Middle East. And the mood is very good.</p>
          <p>We, for the time being, don't see any, and I mean any, slowdown in Russia, even though of course, the share markets, as we all know, have been tremendously affected. And you know that you have the same data as us. Is demand of watches dropping? Dropping to what, zero? As I said before, people buy safes. Most of our watches need a safe, okay. So most of our watches are investment value. They are for the next generation. They have potential. And don't forget we are in a love business. Love is not ending tomorrow just because people feel a bit less happy, and they feel a bit less happy because they have lost money in the share market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, also may add that we are in the harvest season, and that's clear that it's better to deliver the novelties now and we are starting to deliver immediately, because, of course, there is much more demand for novelties than for the current trend that are already in stock at the level for our retail trade partners. So, clearly, novelties is the main advantage in tough times. And the price that they're being delivered in the first half will help us somehow in the second half, for some brands at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about the price points that you mentioned in the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>High end is still dominating. I will say, high end is still very strong and continue because of the origin of the clientele. The Middle East countries and China are more driven by iron prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will there not be a dramatic slowdown <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I will say it was more or less at par with last year, which was very strong, as you know. So whereas the sales decline, I mean, on concentrates, we were down minus 2%. Yes, that's a small decline. In euro we were up 2%. That's an increase. We have often mentioned that if currencies will stay as they are, and we don't know, and we don't bet on that, by the way, okay? It would be naive just to bet that this stays like it is, with the volatility of currencies. That, of course, will have a positive effect on our company. So, there is &#x2013; where's the decline? I mean, a decline to me is &#x2013; it's in sales on last year very good level, so we have to put this in the right perspective. Is that nice? Would we love to see 20% growth? Yes. But, of course, it's unrealistic. But it's not a big decline. It's not a big decline. It's on constant &#x2013; at on par with last year, which was very good. Let's get that in your heads, guys. It's on par with last year, which was very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Fran&#xE7;oise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Fran&#xE7;oise Lauvin, Cheuvreux. I was wondering for &#x2013; to come back to the sales of October, if you were expecting this kind of movement, or if you were surprised by the figure, which you got in October in a positive or negative manner, given the turmoil? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, is concerns your measures maybe to postpone some capital expenditure? And could you update us on your CapEx budget for the full year? And maybe about the things you are thinking about delaying? And considering the very difficult situation in the U.S., are you going on with the Ralph Lauren project on time, i.e., at the beginning of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, first of all, CapEx for a running year is more or less committed, okay? So you will not see a huge decline of CapEx from what we have planned this year, obviously. In times like this, you will not continue to expand factories, at least not in a major way. So you know that in the last couple of years, we have almost expanded any watch factory, including Cartier, so we have spent quite a bit of money in capacity expansion. We will not do that next year, at least not on a big scale. That will reduce our CapEx. Will we continue to invest in retail? Yes. But more focused to growth regions, i.e., China, Russia, and Middle East. That will reduce CapEx next year. But don't expect that this is happening like tomorrow morning.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will now it was &#x2013; in January, introduce Ralph Lauren watches, the joint venture, which we have undertaken. That will come into the market in January. And, of course, the question of movement and less dependency on suppliers is a strategic issue that will not be changed. And, therefore, the commitment and investment in that area will stay. I mean we have been around for more than 100 years and we will be around for more than 100 years in the future. So we have to stay coolheaded and not panicky when we are looking at a more difficult period. And I don't want to tell you everything is wonderful. No. We have to be careful. It would be naive if you get the impression from us that everything is wonderful. And, yes, the decline in October was, at least in America, it was worse than we expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it was a very bad month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. I mean, I don't need to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, who are, most of you of banks who are in the middle of all that, what October meant to the feel good factor in the States. And we know the Americans. Now you could speculate, but I am not on one of these million of talk shows, which happen today, whether America will pull out, and whether there is a political good feel factor because of Obama, and whether by Christmas they will all be &#x2013; we are not in a talk show. We are, obviously, running a business with a conservative view on the next months to come, very clearly. Very clearly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also remember that our Chairman has a nickname called Rupert the Bear, and we have been wrong several times what may happen. And by the way, we are the first one to disclose that something was happening in the U.S., while some others were denying that. So we're &#x2013; of course, we were ready for that slowdown. Of course, it looks, every day, bigger than anticipated. We are taking action. Of course, the main challenge we see, as far as the expenses are concerned, they are contained and, of course, plan are in place to contain more. But the main short-term challenge is the working capital requirements. And we say that we are focusing on cash. It's not just words, it's really a reality. And you know and remember that we told you several times that we change the mindset, and we change the way that the CEO assessed and remunerated.</p>
          <p>So I really believe that it a real concern. But it's challenging times, very tough, very difficult. And that's clear that we are just facing the reality check now. And every month, every day, I would say, even, tell us more what may go on.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, including the U.S., when even the sales are down by 10, 20, 30%, it means we are still selling. And we need to have the best products to outperform the competition because that's now what is at stake, is how, probably, if we are stronger than the other, we should take market share. In growing markets, it's not so easy because everybody is growing, but in the tough market share, and we believe that the one having the best DNA, the best products, the best sales will make the difference. And it will not compensate completely, but may compensate significantly. And I think that's very important.</p>

          <p>There's a question in the second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm Aur&#xE9;lie Husson from SocGen. I have three questions. One is on &#x2013; one on watches, one on the Group and one on the market. On watches, I understood that the decline in margin in H1 was mostly attributable to Baume &amp; Mercier. So I was wondering if I understood correctly, first? And second, if it was linked to the positioning of the brand, or if there were some more company or brand issues that could justify that the margin was declining? My second question on the Group is what is the minimum sales growth that you must have in order to cover your costs and have a flat EBIT, let's say? And the third one on the market is, do you see more opportunities for acquisitions currently? There must be some brands that are suffering a bit more than you, so do you &#x2013; should we expect some movements in this industry in the months to come? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't know where you have had the information regarding Baume &amp; Mercier, because we don't disclose operating margin per brand. Even though we have never hide the fact that Baume &amp; Mercier being in the entry price market of the luxury, is more challenging than the other. You know that Baume &amp; Mercier did grow last year and was profitable. It's still profitable. But that's clear that it is challenging. On the other hand, Baume &amp; Mercier is not our bigger brand in the watch. So it may not be influenced so much, I would say, the global evaluation of the &#x2013; for the many years. You saw that this year it continued to grow by 6%, the operating margin of the segment of the specialist watchmakers, compared to the very strong basis last year. And the demand issue was, of course, the decline in gross margin because, of course, of the very high price increase of gold and the cost of goods, and especially &#x2013; and the fact that we have been late in delivering the novelties. That's the main explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I say something for what type of costs do you need to stay in the business that you asked, to stay in a business. You see, first of all, you have to look at &#x2013; in a business, which has factories, cost of manufacturing is an issue. We have retail stores; cost of retail stores is an issue. So personnel cost is an issue, right? I think next &#x2013; the year ahead will not bring us very high inflations on wages. That includes the management, where we intend to suggest close to a zero wage increase. This is not the time where you increase wages dramatically. You have retail costs, costs of rents, and I mentioned we are going to negotiate them where we can. It's also clear if you have AAA retail locations your negotiation power stays low, from past experience. Believe me. So, of course, you have, right now, a situation where costs are important.</p>
          <p>We are trying to contain this cost. So figures of the past, where you grow, and you grow in &#x2013; also you have a considerable inflationary pressure on wages is probably not happen next year. To put it bluntly, a lot of people, and you guys know that best &#x2013; better than us, will be happy to stay in their job. That is, of course, again, not across the world. If you look at the growth regions, China, you have inflationary pressures. So, that is, today, I think, a moving target. And certainly the cost pressure will be less than last &#x2013; than in times, which we &#x2013; I think, unfortunately, might have behind us, a double-digit &#x2013; comfortable double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Our brands suffering. Well, we don't comment on our competitors, as a principle rule. I think that a lot of, especially in the watch business, where you have seen in the last five years, maybe in the last 10 years, but specifically in the last five years, a lot of new brands popping up from nowhere to sometimes this very, very self-confident price positioning, there might be some surprises here and there. My colleague just mentioned that service is very important. We don't mean only after service, but service. Confidence is very important, that the watch you buy at high price might have a residual retail value &#x2013; resale value, sorry. I don't think that some of the new operators on the market have that value, which may be a Vacheron Constantin or Cartier or Piaget. So &#x2013; but otherwise, we will not comment on brands outside of the Group, if that is your question.</p>

          <p>I think we've got time for two more questions. In the center up here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. In your convergence slide, you're saying that &#x2013; Mr. Lepeu, that you're &#x2013; the measures that you're taking is limit CapEx and reduce net working capital. That we're reducing net working capital with reduction of the demand might be quite difficult. But I'm surprised if you say that you want to limit CapEx and then Mr. Platt in the answer of the question is saying that there is &#x2013; there won't be any decline in CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say that. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got the impression that you're not on the same page here, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I didn't say that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add &#x2013; my question would be to be what kind of measure are you really taking today to be facing maybe one of the worst declines that the industry might see for the next &#x2013; the last past 10 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say that, okay? It's very obvious, if you sign a contract for building a new boutique, you cannot stop that. I mean, you can, but it would be not very intelligent to do that. If you have ordered machines some time ago, you will not stop this. It's &#x2013; even if you could, you will not stop this, because I don't think that the suppliers with which we have worked for years and we have told them we need capacity, we need capacity, we need components, we need movements, we can leave in the rain overnight, overnight. Okay? So there is no contradiction that the short-term effect of CapEx reduction, I mean for the rest of the year, which is a couple of months, as you know, will be not very significant for that very reason. But of course, next year is a totally different story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Exactly what we said. We said no major impact this fiscal, major impact next fiscal, because we started, at the end of August, early September, to stop and to review all the commitment for next year, because what &#x2013; if you didn't take action now, and even before now, for next year, you will have a higher CapEx next year, because you have a lag time between your commitment and revision of CapEx, of course. Believe me, we're on the same page.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other measures you're taking? I mean reducing net working capital, that's something that Mackenzie would say sounds good, but it's difficult when demand is going down. So what kind of other measures are you taking to get ready for what could be this worst decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of production, of course, you know that we are not fully internalized, thank god. We are more or less at the rate of 60%, so we have some room for maneuver. There is, I would say, a natural slowdown, which is anticipated and which has started, for not renewing interim contracts for some workers. There is a quite a sizeable part of the workers in our factories who are on a short-term basis. And there are many other way of doing it. And for time being, I really believe that every brand is really working hard, under, of course, our supervision, to contain that, because we know that these are the main issues.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, nobody knows how deep would be the crisis. We know that we'll be around after the crisis. It's not the first one. Perhaps not &#x2013; perhaps for us it will be the last one we'll go through. But, we have experienced other, and we know that we have to emerge stronger. And by the way, we believe that we are stronger than we used to be seven years ago. Remember that we lost a significant amount, and let me just look at that.</p>
          <p>Last time, between <mark type="inaudible" /> we lost more or less &#x20AC;300 million. It will not happen this time. And our brands are much stronger than they used to be, with a lot of novelties, which was one of the lessons we learned, because we learned some lessons. We didn't say that we are not immune against a slowdown. We know and we always refer to the feel-good factor. The feel-good factor has disappeared in many regions. We'll have tough times and nobody is telling the contrary. And I really believe that we are realistic and we are taking action, but reasonable action, meaning that we don't want to change completely our business model. By the way, you know also that you have a payback &#x2013; when you cut expenses in many Western countries, it can cost between 12 and 16 months as a matter of payback. I don't say that the crisis will last just 16 months. I would sign for that immediately. But you have to really think twice before restructuring your organization. But we are really dealing and looking at that now. That's clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Natalie Longe, LODH. Just as a follow-up on this topic. So if I understand well, in your contingency plan, you're not prepared to close stores, if needed. So that's the first question. Second question is, given the strengths of the currencies we've seen recently, are you considering reducing prices in the U.S. and in Japan? And the third question is on your receivables. What risks do you see on your receivables at this stage? Do you have an exposure to a large retailer or what is the largest retailer as a percentage of wholesale sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't comment on brands' commercial policy, so regarding price increases or decreases, whatever. Regarding exposure to retailers, we have quite a unique business model. I remember that, sometimes ago, we have been criticized by having quite a large cost at the headquarters and at the region platform. But you know that the split of responsibilities between the brands and the regional platform allow us to have a double responsibility regarding financial exposure and that's very clear that it's very, very closely monitored. And you are right to mention that, because it may happen. It can happen. But first, we always have a tradition in our Group to have very short-term payment, so &#x2013; terms of payments, and then we maintain that. We monitor, I would say, financial exposure per client, because of course; we have several brands selling to the same clients. So we believe that we are quite safe on that side. And by the way, you know that some &#x2013; we have had one issue in Hong Kong, in China, and we lost nothing in this specific case, meaning that we are quite well monitored.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on store closures, is it something that you could consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tell me how big the crisis will be and we will tell you whether we'd close individual stores or not. That's a chicken and egg question. Of course, we will not close strategically important stores, even if the crisis would be deeper than we expect, because the crisis will not last forever. If we think it lasts forever, we'd better learn how to grow sheep and make cheese out of milk and we all look for this type of opportunity. But if we think it will not last forever, we will not close stores as a principal concept. If a store is anyway somewhere a pure commercial store in a not AA &#x2013; I'm not talking AAA, not AA, but maybe an A or even a B situation and it's losing money, we might close it. But that we do anyway, we do anyway, and the brands do that on a constant basis and monitor that. So there is no concept of let's close x, y, z type of stores.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for coming today. For those of you watching on the Internet, again, thank you. Crisis, what crisis? I'm not sure if I &#x2013; have I missed something? Hopefully, though, we will see some improvement in the situation and I'm sure we'll look forward to that. Thank you again and we'll see you in May next year. Thank you.</p>
