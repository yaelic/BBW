        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our 2012 first quarter results. With me today are our CEO, Asim Ghosh; our CFO, Alister Cowan; our COO, Robert Peabody; our Senior Vice President of Midstream &amp; Refined Products, Terrance Kutryk; and our Senior Vice President of Downstream, Bob Baird.</p>
          <p>In today's call, we will provide an update on Husky's business strategy and an overview of results, followed by a question-and-answer session. Later this morning, we will also be holding our Annual Meeting of the shareholders in Calgary. A webcast of that meeting may also be accessed from our website at huskyenergy.com. The presentation begins at 10:30 a.m. Mountain Standard Time.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments will contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual fillings, both which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. It's been another strong quarter for Husky. Our business is on course and we are consistently executing as demonstrated by the results. Production was up 3% in the quarter compared to the year ago period, which is about 10,000 barrels a day. Cash flow increased slightly from a year earlier to $1.17 billion. And we recorded net earnings of $591 million. We stood at 22% over the corresponding year ago period when adjusted for a one-time gain in the year ago period.</p>
          <p>So basically, this quarter, once again revealed the strength of our focused integration strategy which really adds value by minimizing risk in the increasingly volatile market environments that we've been seeing. The way I look at it, I see our Midstream, Downstream segments as an extra arrow in our quivers is how I've defined it during these times of market uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Some of the quarter highlights now. Overall, I would say the quarter demonstrated in sustaining the momentum we've built over the last year. I'll cover a couple of highlights. Starting first would be Asia Pacific. Fabrication of the shallow water jacket for the Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea is now more than three quarters complete. And now, it's kind of difficult for me to show the pictures in the medium that they're using right now. But when completed, this would be some 200 meters tall, about the height of the Calgary Tower, which in fact we also built, I believe, in 1967.</p>
          <p>Atop the shallow water jacket will be the top side, which is also progressing and that's about a quarter complete. This is really three decks, each about the size of a football field. So overall, we are making great progress and remain on track for first production in late 2013, early 2014.</p>
          <p>On the next big building block, Sunrise, last week we finished drilling all of the SAGD wells for Phase I. And the most important conclusion from the drilling is not just the fact that we completed them, but the fact that the drilling has confirmed the high-quality of the resource and that we are in line with our expectations of the subsurface. We visited the project earlier this month and the progress in visible. So also on this project as in Liwan, we are making great progress and we remain on track for first production in 2014.</p>
          <p>The results from this quarter show that we are on course to achieve our targets. But I do want to remind you, as I have in the past, that we will encounter one-off the events such as turnarounds of new projects coming on stream that will make our longer-term compound five-year growth target of 3% to 5% a lumpy one. It will not be a smooth line. That's not how we have planned it.</p>
          <p>One of those events, and again a planned event, is about to begin next month, the SeaRose FPSO. It's scheduled to begin 125-day offstation. And later in the presentation, my colleague, Rob, will provide you with some details about that. We previously advised you of these events and the SeaRose offstation actually is included in our annual production guidance of 290,000 to 315,000 barrels a day that we expect for this year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, the first quarter demonstrates we are on course, we are focused on execution to delivering again the plan and the results are being achieved. Alister, do you want to take over for the next section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. As Asim indicated, we have performed well for this quarter. A higher Upstream production, higher throughput through the Upgrader and higher averaged realized prices for crude oil have offset the impact we saw from the other areas.</p>
          <p>Our net earnings for the quarter were $591 million or $0.60 per share. And that compares to $626 million or $0.70 per share a year ago. If you exclude the after-tax gain of $143 million on the sale of non-core assets in Q1 2011, our net earnings from underlying operations actually increased 22% from $483 million. And this also compares to the fourth quarter earnings of $408 million. Our cash flow from operations was $1.17 billion or $1.20 per share. And that compares to $1.16 billion or $1.30 per share a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll remind of what I said at Investor Day last December about our cash taxes. And our cash flow this year reflects an increase in the cash taxes of $178 million compared to a year ago, mainly due to the removal by the federal government of the partnership deferrals. On the production side, we average 320,000 barrels per day, BOEs per day in the quarter. And as comparable to the fourth quarter of last year, that represents a 3% increase from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Downstream business was a positive story for us over the last year. We did, however, see some tightening of U.S. refinery margins in the first quarter. But overall, it does remain positive. We upgrade our contributed $48 million to net earnings in the quarter. That compares to $3 million a year ago as a result of normalized throughputs.</p>
          <p>U.S. refining operations contributed $71 million in net earnings compared to $116 million a year earlier. And this really reflects the higher priced Brent-based feedstock at Lima. Of course, we had a catalyst replacement at Lima that resulted in a 10-day hydrotreater outage resisting to volume. We were able to partially mitigate the impact of the higher priced Brent feedstock by utilizing some lower-priced Western Canadian sources of crude in the refineries. And as Asim mentioned, this is one of the benefits of our focused integration strategy.</p>
          <p>While the details of pricing are in the MD&amp;A, I did want to point to you a few highlights. The average realized price for the company's production as a whole was $65.26 per BOE in the quarter, slightly up from $61.03 a year ago. The average realized crude oil pricing with $87.11 per barrel, compared to $78.27 a year ago. The realized pricing in the quarter does include the impact of a wider Western Canada and heavy differentials. However, we have been able to minimize the volatility and capture a large portion of these differentials, and our Upstream infrastructure and Marketing business and the Downstream upgrading and refining operations.</p>
          <p>Natural gas, as you know, continue to drop with average realized pricing at $2.64 per Mcf compared to $3.87 in Q1 2011. As I mentioned, the realized upgrade in differential was $20.38 per barrel compared to $24 a year ago. And we saw a similar trend in U.S. Downstream with their realized refining margins were $14.14 U.S. per barrel compared to $16.83 U.S. a year ago.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, there are some events to bear in mind in respect of the second quarter and the remainder of the year. As you know, the offstation program for the SeaRose is about to begin. This will result in a reduction to our annual production of approximately 12,000 barrels per day, and has been included in our annual guidance.</p>
          <p>Later this year, our partner-operated Terra Nova FPSO will also undergo an offstation. And this will reduce our annual production by about 4,000 barrels per day. Planned outage is underway at the Upgrader to expedite hydrogen plant repairs and catalyst change-out which is just normal maintenance. And this outage, which required a complete shutdown of the plant, will last approximately three weeks. The Toledo refinery is scheduled to have a major turnaround in mid 2012 and that will reduce throughput levels during that period.</p>
          <p>From a financial perspective, we completed a $500 million U.S. public offering of unsecured notes at an interest rate of just under 4%. Proceeds will be used amongst other things for the redemption of the existing debt securities, of which $400 million are due in June this year. And finally, our Board of Directors have approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. Rob is now going to discuss with you the Upstream operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. As mentioned by Asim and Alister, we've been preparing for the SeaRose offstation. The SeaRose was commissioned six years ago and has had an outstanding safety record with no loss time injuries. Last year, the vessel achieved an uptime of 98% versus the norm of 92% for FPSOs throughout the industry. So, what we see is a very strong correlation between safety, operational integrity and business results. Early next month, the SeaRose will begin what is expected to be a 125-day offstation program. Production is scheduled to be shut in at the White Rose field in early May.</p>
          <p>Well in dry dock a variety of maintenance and inspection operations will take place. We will also use the opportunity to execute a number of system upgrades. This program will position us to carry out our full slate of planned and future production opportunities in the Atlantic region in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Turning to production, looking first at our activities in Western Canada, we were active across the oil resource portfolio in the quarter, drilling 24 wells. Activities were concentrated in the Oungre Bakken play in southeast Saskatchewan, the Lower Shaunavon in southwestern Saskatchewan, and the Redwater and Saskatchewan Viking formation plays. A horizontal well targeting the Muskwa shale at Rainbow at northwest Alberta was completed in the quarter with test results as expected. The well is undergoing pressure build up prior to being placed on production.</p>
          <p>Drilling operations commenced on a two-well pad, which will carry on through spring break-up. In the Northwest Territories, we drilled and cased two vertical pilot wells to evaluate the Canol shale formation on our two exploration licenses. A 220-square kilometer 3D seismic program was also finished there last week. We will use the results from this work to formulate the next stage of our evaluation program.</p>
          <p>In gas resource plays, our activities remain focused on liquids rich gas opportunities Ansell, Kaybob and Kakwa. At Ansell, we drilled a total of nine wells in the quarter including three multi-zone vertical wells, three Cardium horizontals, two Wilrich horizontals and one vertical Cardium well.</p>
          <p>In our heavy oil business in the Lloydminster region, the 8,000 barrel per day Pikes Peak South and 3,000 barrels per day Paradise thermal projects are both nearing completion. They remain on target to achieve first oil in the third quarter. Based on positive results from our pilot at Rush Lake in 2011, we are moving forward with the design of an 8,000 barrel per day commercial project. We also expect this project to come on stream in the 2015 timeframe. Preliminary planning for three additional thermal projects is also underway.</p>
          <p>Turning to our growth pillars, first looking at Asia Pacific, where the Liwan gas project is really taking shape. Fabrication of the shallow water jacket is nearing completion. Preparations are underway for the installation of this jacket this summer. As you may recall, we are developing three fields on the block. The first two fields are being developed in tandem in Phase I of the project. Front end engineering and design for the third field commenced in February.</p>
          <p>Also, in the Asia Pacific region, offshore Indonesia tenders have been issued for drilling rigs to drill around six exploration wells commencing in June. Meanwhile, work continues brining the BD, MDA and MBH fields towards production. But first gas from the Madura Strait block expected in 2014.</p>
          <p>In oil sands, Asim gave you a good update on the Sunrise Energy Project. So I'll just add that we're making progress on development work for the next phase at Sunrise. The design base memorandum and FEED work has been awarded and FEED is expected to be completed in 2013.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the Atlantic region, the North Amethyst satellite field continued to perform well with three production wells and three water injection wells on stream. We plan to drill an infill well at the main White Rose field this year and continue development drilling at North Amethyst. At the end of 2011, we filed an application to amend the North Amethyst development plan to include the Deeper Hibernia formation. We also recently awarded the FEED contract for the next phase of the White Rose developments, which will include the West and South satellite fields.</p>
          <p>In summary, we've made steady progress in executing the Upstream strategy we laid out at our Investor Meetings in 2010 and again in 2011. The transformation of our foundation businesses in Western Canada and heavy oil is on track. And our major growth projects are advancing on schedule.</p>
          <p>I will now turn you over to the moderator for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Curious on the oil research plays in Western Canada with the number of wells drilled here across the quarter. Any update you're able to provide in terms of how you're thinking about the long-term contribution from the various plays in light of how the results are trending here? I think you've suggested in the past that you can get to 30,000 barrels a day in aggregate by 2015. I'm curious where you stand today in terms of how you're feeling whether it's better or worse at this point than the 30,000 that you have suggested before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take that. This is Rob Peabody. We're continuing to work the agenda, of course, on oil resource plays. Good progress being made to-date. Just to remind you of the overall strategy, in our Western Canada business, we are transitioning that business over time to oil resource and liquids rich gas resource plays. So we've said before we expect over the planning period to move that business strongly in that direction. But it takes time to achieve this process with ultimately moving about a third of our oil production into that area. And what I'd say is we're on track on that and we're seeing good results to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Joe, it would be fair to say that at this point in time, we are pleased with our land position. We are where we are at this point in our exploration. And in our plan, it does not call for us to have firm definitive conclusions on where we stand. But there's nothing we've got that leads to any concerns about our long-term plan. Our strategic plan continues to be that we will reposition this basin and we have confidence in the ability to execute against that strategic plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe more on a similar point just on a more micro level. Are there any results you can share at this point across any of the different plays in terms of average production rates per well or what is it you're expecting that you're able to share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think basically, you know the resource play game, okay? You drill a well, you frac it, and you don't really know for a year what a dependable type curve is. So early into the exercise would really be very premature for us to draw any conclusions. But clearly, as I said, we've got the land positions and we've got enough optionality out here that we have some confidence that we are not chasing a pie in the sky dream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning, guys. My question is really around the Downstream. If you could provide some insight into a couple of things; first of all, your heavy oil percent and capacity in your Downstream business. Secondly, you talk about higher input costs that impacted the quarter here. If you can sort of give a little bit more color around that in the context of what we've seen some of your peers do here, that will be very helpful. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. George, to answer your question, basically, our heavy oil capacity in Canada is primarily the Upgrader and the asphalt plant which is about is 110,000 barrels a day. In the U.S. operations, we run a very high volume through our Toledo BP Refinery. And Lima does take a small portion of the heavy crudes that we can run in Lima. As to your second part, the issue that we have, it really is around the Lima refinery. At this point, we don't have all the WTI type price barrels going into Lima. There is a percentage of our barrels that are still Brent priced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you able to &#x2013; you did provide some insight on the U.S. Can you put numbers around that or not? I mean you did put numbers around Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, I'll answer that, yeah. On the Lima side, very small amount, a few thousand barrels of heavy are going through there. That's about the maximum we could take on the current configuration.  And on Toledo side, I mean it's a heavy refinery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The majority of the throughput that's going through there is heavy barrels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so the impact for the quarter, was that in Toledo, I assume then?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. A couple with three questions. So just with -question maybe for Alister is, where's your head at just in terms of cash taxes for this year, just to check models? Rob, you talked about the Muskwa in terms of results being as expected. Just curious if you can provide anymore color around that. And then the last thing, just intrigued with potentially using a platform with White Rose; you've talked about that before. I'm wondering how far along your thoughts are with the proceeding with that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Greg, well I'll start off on the cash taxes. So you recall, I said in December there was a removal of the partnership deferrals by the Federal government that would have an impact on us. Two impacts really, one is the tax on current year earnings is going to have to be paid out in cash in the year we earn them. And then secondly, we have a catch up payment to make over the next five years through the transitional arrangements.</p>
          <p>So I said at that time that I thought the cash taxes would be equal to current tax expense. My head is still there. That's what it's going to be, but slightly different. Cash taxes were slightly less than current tax expense in the first quarter. But I think by the end of the year, they'll equate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We move to the Rose plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly on the Muskwa. Asim more or less told you about as much as we're going to tell you on this. Other than to say we clearly, and we've disclosed before, we have an extensive land position up here. We have drilled previously a number of vertical wells and tested them. That caused us to decide to go ahead with the horizontal well development.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; that well in fact was put on normal production yesterday. And as Asim said, it's just too early to call these type curves. And I've heard other companies disclose IP rates over a day and things like that. But we want to get some real solid data behind this before we start disclosing further data to the market. And really looking forward, it's going to be towards the end of this year by the time we can actually see how that type curve is developing. So overall, we're very encouraged, but it's too early to get definitive about the play.</p>
          <p>In terms of White Rose and the platform and where we are, as we said earlier in the discussion today, we are actually &#x2013; we've started engineering on the preliminary engineering on that development. It will include the west White Rose development and the south White Rose development. Our preliminary screening economics indicates this is going to be a very robust project. It is going to continue to use the FPSO for processing, which makes it a very capital-efficient sort of way to move forward.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just three questions. First, I'm kind of wondering if you can give any comments on cost pressures you might be seeing in northern Alberta. Specifically, I'm thinking with the Sunrise project. Second question, I'm wondering if you guys are seeing any cost pressures you could talk about for Asia Pacific. And I'm really just thinking anything out of the ordinary here for your off-shore projects. And the third question is just kind of your thoughts on the potential impact from the Seaway reversal as it relates to the heavy oil differential. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me just pick them up one by one. In northern Alberta, definitely it's a more competitive labor environment than we experienced a year ago. But I wish to remind you of our contracting strategy that by the latter part of this year, by the last quarter of this year, we will actually have converted a vast proportion of our costs to either fixed cost or lump sum, either fixed unit rate or lump sum.</p>
          <p>And also at this point in time as we speak, we've already executed &#x2013; we've already got cost certainty on the field facilities as we've completed the Phase 1 drilling. So far, a big chunk of the project has been executed. That's on track. And in the second half of this year, a very major proportion of the rest will have been converted and we will have cost certainly.</p>
          <p>And the final point to remember is that the way we have conceived of the project is a big chunk of the work is done in modules outside of the basin and the stuff is brought in. It's actually assembled in Edmonton rather than in Fort McMurray. So these are a number of very tightly planned strategic initiatives that we have undertaken to give us a high measure of cost certainty and prevent crazy cost overruns in Sunrise. In summary therefore, yes, cost pressures in the environment. But we see ourselves being materially insulated by plan.</p>
          <p>In the Asia Pacific, as I said, again if you look at the jacket, its three quarters complete. The drilling is all complete. The subsea well heads are installed. And the top side derrick was a quarter complete. So we are advanced enough in the project that, yes, we are seeing cost pressures in Asia, but we are kind of far enough down the road that we don't have a fear of a blow-out that we are past the blow out stage.</p>
          <p>On the Seaway reversal, we see it as a material event. And I remind you of what I have called our focused integration strategy, that we, in fact, are really creating optionalities around pricing volatilities in an increasingly volatile price environment. And the WTI-Brent reversal is without precedent. The size of that differential is without precedent. The location discounts we are seeing in our Canadian location discounts and vis-&#xE0;-vis the U.S. is without precedent.</p>
          <p>And the limpidity of those changes is without precedent. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:49) and in spite of that, because we have by plan created this very focused integration strategy, we've in fact been able to ride out these discounts, as the results for this quarter show. I'll remind you that something like a quarter of all Canadian crude that leaves Western Canada goes through our system. And therefore, it gives us a number of mitigation opportunities as we see these discounts. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch on the North Amethyst Hibernia amendments. I mean curious to how that's looking; is it still on track for approval sometime middle of this year and then would you start drilling that some point later next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Asim. Yeah, we don't &#x2013; approval doesn't look like it's going to be a rate-determining step here or anything. And we can &#x2013; those wells will just be drilled from the existing North Amethyst drill center. So it's not &#x2013; it will just be kind of encompassed within our normal operations going forward.</p>
        </plist>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> The next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good morning. I just have a quick question. Alister, can you give us what is the <mark type="ph" /> FIFO (30:27) gain in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We experienced a small <mark type="ph" /> FIFO (30:32) gain in the quarter. It's not something we would typically disclose, Paul. So it was relatively small in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So less than $5 million or $10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose it. It's relatively small in relation to the overall results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know that you don't want to give too much information since its early stage on the oil resource play. Is that enough of the well that you can give us a rough estimate what is the 30-day IP average?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In any event, Paul, I think as I said very early in this call, we don't want to take a call on what the type curve is till we have about a year's data on the well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it's just premature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you tell us that how many days to take to cure the well and how many are then the total completion days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are still at the early stage. We haven't gone to what we call factory drilling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So whatever information I give you at this point is kind of one-off pilot and is irrelevant to the modeling of the economics of this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I understand. But I'm trying to understand that how many wells that end up that we may be drilling this year. And then also on a factory manufacturing process that how many days that you expect that is going to cut down till you can share some of those information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to go into a tremendous amount of detail on that. But by the end of the year, we expect to have about between five and six wells on production. So we are going to continue to drill these wells going forward and that's the game plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Well, can you remind you then, how many rig currently you have and how many rig you going to be average for this year and next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of rigs overall, we've been running &#x2013; it varies week to week and time like that, but somewhere in the 40 range sort of across...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm just talking about on the oil resource play. I'm sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd have to get back to you at the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:55) numbers. But we're talking...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you a rough picture, okay? I think basically if you look at all the wells we are drilling in Western Canada this year, over a third are going to be resource plays, okay? And then, of course, a big chunk of that is our first phase of Ansell which is a liquids rich gas resource play. And the rest are going to be oil resource plays. But basically, that's about as much guidance as we are giving.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you very much for joining the call and thanks for your questions. Later this morning, we will hold our AGM in Calgary. And the message I'll be telling our shareholders is that in 2011, we put our heads down and focus and execution. And I think we are on the way to unlocking the true potential of Husky. I hope you can join us in person if you have the time or listen in on the webcast. Thank you again for joining us.</p>
