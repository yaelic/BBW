        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Apache's second quarter earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter was marked by record financial results, continued exploration success and sustained progress in delivering on our pipeline of development projects. As Bob pointed out, we achieved record financial results for the quarter, with $4.28 per diluted share of earnings and cash from operations of $2.3 billion for the quarter. Not only did we exceed $4 per share of earnings for the first time, but it exceeded our highest previous total by over $1 per share. Cash flow of 2.3 billion exceeded the previous record set in the fourth quarter of 2007 by over $400 million.</p>
          <p>Our exploration achievements during the quarter again reflected our ability to identify and control profitable opportunities to build value for our shareholders, and I'd like to just give you a few highlights. In the Gulf of Mexico of the U.S., we made a major discovery at Geauxpher-1X, which holds an estimated recoverable reserves of 100 Bcf, and we have a 40% non-operated interest. In Egypt, the Heqet-2, which is located in the western part of the Greater Khalda area, tested 2,100 barrels a day from a deep horizon. And that opens up a new play potential, which potentially could extend hundreds of square miles, primarily on our acreage.</p>
          <p>Also in Egypt, we achieved 4,300 barrels a day of production from a new well on the Umbarka field in the Greater Khalda area and have identified a new waterflood project in East Bahariya Concession in Abu Gharadig Basin. In Canada, new drilling results by our partner in our Ootla shale play further supports our estimates of 9 to 16 TCF of net recoverable reserves to Apache. In the North Sea, we had five new wells in the Forties Field that have aggregated 8,900 barrels a day during the quarter. And I'll point out that all of those wells that I just mentioned will contribute to the second half production.</p>
          <p>On the development side, we made progress on our pipeline of seven new projects, which continue on track to add 135,000 barrels a day over the next four years. And I'd like to just mention two. Our Egyptian waterflood project is already ramping up. We've increased production output and should see that production output increase over the next several years. Second, our new natural gas processing plants in the Khalda area of Egypt are on track to begin commissioning in October and should contribute an additional net production of 100 million a day and about 5,000 barrels of liquids a day by the end of the year. I might point out that by the end of the year we should nearly double our gas production in Egypt to over 750 million a day. So far we have not added our Ootla play to our pipeline potential because we're still scoping the capacity and the timing of getting that on.</p>
          <p>Our daily production for the quarter was down 1% from the first quarter of 2008 and primarily due to two non-recurring events. First, in the North Sea, we were impacted by maintenance turnaround and refinery strike &#x2013; that we have no commercial interest in, I might say &#x2013; that reduced oil production by 5,150 barrels a day for the quarter. Secondly, we had a pipeline explosion in Australia on June 3, and caused us to shut in all of our production at Varanus Island. And this incident alone reduced natural gas volumes by 60 million a day and oil volumes by 1,900 barrels a day during the quarter. And that will impact us during the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>The one thing I'd like to say is we'd like to assure the citizens of Western Australia that we fully understand the hardship that they've experienced. It will continue to command our highest priority until production is fully restored. We are bringing every conceivable resource to bear to restore production as quickly and as safely as possible. And I'm pleased to announce that we're ahead of schedule and expect to commence production over the next few days at an initial rate of 110 million cubic feet of gas a day. And by the latter part of August, we expect to increase production, which should double that to about 220 million a day.</p>
          <p>The remaining gross production volumes of about 95 million a day should be restored by year-end. And this volume is associated with the Harriet Joint Venture facility that was directly adjacent to the explosion and will require more significant repairs. We expect net production to average roughly 65 million a day and 7,000 barrels a day of oil in Australia in the third quarter of 2008, before returning to full volumes by the end of the year. I might point out that the Van Gogh, Pyrenees, Reindeer and Julimar development projects, also in Australia, are not associated with Varanus Island, and the incident will not delay our timetable of first production on any of those projects.</p>
          <p>Despite the non-recurring events in Australia and the North Sea, we still expect production to increase in 2008 around 2% relative to 2007. That is provided we meet our timetable for restoring production at Varanus Island. I might note that our income and our cash flow generation remained remarkably strong, and although these events affected our current production profile, they have no impact on our ultimate reserves. Our long-term outlook hasn't changed. Frankly, it's never been better. Driven by our successful drilling programs and a very strong development pipeline, we're confident that Apache is entering into a period of accelerating production growth, 2009 through 2012. We do intend to give an outline of our production growth at our analysts meeting that we're going to hold in Houston on October 23, and I would invite all of you to join us.</p>
          <p>I'd like to go over a few regional highlights now with you. In Australia, which I've covered most of the major projects, I'd like to go over some of our major development projects. Van Gogh oil development remains on track for first production in mid-2009. That should bring on about 20,000 barrels a day net to Apache. The Pyrenees development, which is operated by BHP, will most likely come on stream at the end of 2009 or the first part of 2010m and that will be an additional 20,000 barrels a day net to Apache.</p>
          <p>Our Reindeer gas development is on track for mid-2010, with a start-up of 60 million a day net. And we are closing in on signing our initial gas sales contract. In fact, we have an all hands on deck meeting scheduled in Perth tomorrow to walk through the remaining issues. We continue to study options for marketing and developing our Julimar gas area. First production is scheduled for 2011, 2012. We're considering delivering the gas either into the domestic Western Australian market or into the international markets.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter we made a nice discovery called Halyard that tested at 68 million a day. We received governmental approval on the Halyard field in the second quarter in this year. Actually that's only 90 days from the discovery date. We're working to establish first production by 2010. In addition to our activities in the Carnarvon Basin, we have an exploration program that is set to begin around the end of the third quarter in the Gippsland Basin. And all told, Australia will be a large and important growth driver for the company for many years, mainly driven by the materiality and depth of our exploration and project portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Canada, we drilled 176 wells in the first half of 2008. We intend to accelerate activity in the second half of 2008. We plan to drill 415 wells in our shallow gas areas of Alberta and drill 46 deeper wells for the Kabob. We also plan 24 wells at Midale and House Mountain. But the big story in Canada continues to be our Muskwa Shale play in the Ootla area of northeastern B.C.</p>
          <p>Apache has a 50% interest and operates approximately one-half of the over 400,000 gross acres that we have in this play. In April, we announced the results of three horizontal wells we'd drilled during the first quarter. We had 24-hour test rates of 5.3, 6.1, and 8.8 million cubic feet of gas a day, respectively. EnCana, our 50-50 partner, has also drilled three wells this past winter. They have recently completed, tested, and hooked up two of those wells, which are now currently flowing through Apache's Missile gas plant. The average production rate for both those wells &#x2013; individually, both of those wells, after the first 30 days was about 5 million a day. And yesterday's rates were about 4.5 and 4.3 million cubic feet of gas a day.</p>
          <p>We estimate our net reserve potential to Apache in this play to be 9 to 16 TCF of gas reserves. And for reference, our worldwide proven gas reserves at the end of 2007 totaled 7.8 TCF. We have yet to finalize our 2008-2009 winter drilling program and infrastructure at Ootla, but I anticipate a step change in the activity level this coming winter.</p>
          <p>Ootla has the potential to not only be one of the key growth plays in North America, but also a major driver for growth for Apache over the next several years. We anticipate significant volumes coming from this area in 2011-2012 timeframe. I should also note that we closed a minor asset sale in Canada at the end of the first quarter that was about 12 million a day effect on our production.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, our diversified portfolio across several basins continued to yield drilling successes during the quarter, and I'd like to cover four highlights. The first one is an East Bahariya Concession, we operate and own 100%. The C1X well tested 584 barrels a day before frac from 45 feet of pay and a 1,400-acre closure. We'll frac that well as soon as we get governmental approval for our developmental lease. And what we'd expect, like all the other wells in that area, that we'd make over 1,000 barrels a day. And we appear to have discovered another waterflood opportunity, similar to the five other fields we're currently developing in this concession. And for a reference point, we're currently producing gross production from the concession primarily from waterfloods of over 27,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Second, also in the Abu Gharadig Basin &#x2013; and this is in the NEAG concession that we have a 48% interest in and Shell operates &#x2013; we drilled two good development wells in the JG Field, and those are expected to come on momentarily at 1,500 to 2,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>I'd like to move over to the western edge of the Greater Khalda area, and it's an area called the Faghur Basin. We drilled and fraced a well called the Heqet-2, which tested 2,100 barrels a day from the Jurassic Lower Safa at 14,700 feet. This is an unexpected depth and horizon to find oil instead of natural gas, and the Faghur Basin is cooler than the Shushan Basin, where our Qasr discovery is. We fracture-stimulated this Heqet-2 with excellent results, and we potentially have several hundred square miles of fairway that may lend similar opportunities, mostly already on our concession. Finally, we drilled an outstanding development well in the Umbarka field in the north-central portion of the Greater Khalda area. The Umbarka-174 tested 4,300 barrels a day, in a main AEB field pay, and Umbarka is one of the eight different fields in Egypt presently under waterflood.</p>
          <p>On the development side in Egypt, as I mentioned earlier, we're looking forward to increase our gas volumes from the Salam plant expansion project in the Khalda area during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition to this capacity, we've also had capacity increases at the Salam plant.</p>
          <p>We have also been increasing volumes through that Obayed plant. We began the year averaging 160 million cubic feet of gas a day, have gradually increased that to over 180 million a day, with additional processing available. In the fourth quarter, we expect our throughput to increase to 210 million a day, as Shell increases their compression capacity at the plant.</p>
          <p>On the waterflood activity side, it continues to post gratifying results. In aggregate during the quarter, we drilled 43 waterflood wells in eight separate projects. Quarter-to-quarter gross oil production increased 5% to 44,700 barrels a day, and we're now injecting 61,000 barrels a day. With the combination of our large and diverse exploration portfolio and our low-risk development, there's no doubt that Egypt's growth will continue for many years.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn now to the North Sea. Production average for the quarter of 56,570 barrels a day, despite as I pointed out earlier, a maintenance turnaround and a strike at Grangemouth, a Scotland refinery, that negatively impacted our production by over 5,000 barrels a day for the quarter. The refinery strike caused the Forties pipeline system to shut in, which in turn caused Apache to shut in its Forties Field. I might point out, we do not own interest in the Forties pipeline system or the Grangemouth refinery.</p>
          <p>Drilling results have been excellent this year in the North Sea. Five successful wells have been drilled, and that aggregate produced 8,900 barrels a day for the second quarter. Since the strike, fuel production has averaged over 63,000 barrels a day, which makes us optimistic that volumes in the second half of 2008 should be relatively strong to the 56,000 barrels a day we averaged in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Argentina. In the first half of 2008, we drilled 33 new wells. We had an 88% success rate, and we have six drilling rigs working in the Neuqu&#xE9;n and two working in Tierra del Fuego. During the quarter we finished acquiring a 522-square-kilometer 3-D survey at Lago Fuego in the southern part of Tierra del Fuego. That shoot, as well as our earlier 2,000-square-kilometer survey completed during the first quarter has truly provided us a very large inventory of drilling opportunities. In fact, we intend to pick up a third rig in Tierra del Fuego in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin we're developing shallow oil play, which is present in many of our producing and shut-in wells in the heart of the basin. Shallow zones have tested up to 150 barrels a day and appear to be present over a fairly large area. We're actively evaluating recompletions in drilling locations in that play. Finally in Argentina, as many of you may have seen, have now received their first carloads, shiploads of LNG, which is being a landed price of 16 to $20 an Mcf, which really underscore the fundamentals that &#x2013; providing upside to our realizations and our returns.</p>
          <p>In the Central region of the U.S., we have 25 drilling rigs working during the quarter. We spudded 148 operated wells. We had a 99% success rate on the 124 that we actually got down. And I'd like to mention two of the highlights in the Central region. In the Permian Basin, on the properties we acquired last year, we drilled 13 successful wells during the quarter, which tripled the pre-drill expectations, really due to the completion techniques developed through Apache's expertise elsewhere in the Permian.</p>
          <p>The acquired properties are currently producing at a gross rate of about 11,300 barrels a day, which is a 10% increase since the acquisition last year. Secondly, our positive momentum at the Stiles Ranch, which is an Atoka Granite Wash natural gas play in the Texas Panhandle, continued during the quarter with production now over 70 million a day. We control 38,000 gross acres in this play, which is up from 10,000 gross acres we had at the beginning of the year. And we have recently doubled the number of rigs we have drilling in Stiles Ranch to eight.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we averaged 18 operated rigs during the quarter, which included nine jack-ups and one semi. We also have two platform rigs and a couple of barge rigs as well as four land rigs running. The big news in this region during the quarter is obviously our Geauxpher-1X discovery in 2,700 feet of water at Garden Banks 462. We obtained that lease in 2004, and our technical team developed the go-for-prospect late last year.</p>
          <p>Regrettably, we were faced with a lease deadline late in 2007, so we found a partner, Mariner Energy, who had the floater rig and the equipment window required for exploration and a quick development. We estimate the discovery contains about 100 Bcf of gross recoverable reserves, and we are hopeful to initiate production of over 100 million a day by year-end using a subsea tieback development. As I pointed out earlier, we have 40% interest. We also have a second well currently drilling on that block.</p>
          <p>One more highlight in the region I'd like to point out, which is that our Ewing Bank 826 field that we own 100% of, we completed our fourth well since fourth quarter of 2007, which has increased field production from only 700 barrels a day at the beginning of the year to over 4,800 barrels a day. We have one well that's currently drilling, and we have eight locations remaining in our inventory. And I hope you can see we've had excellent results from our drilling in the Gulf region.</p>
          <p>And summing up, I'd like to make few comments. We take stock of the second quarter as being yet another period of outstanding drill-bit success for Apache. With 40 million acres across our diverse areas of operations around the world, we continue to identify high profitable exploration, exploitation opportunities from the U.S. Gulf to Egypt, from British Columbia to Australia. Our drilling achievements during the second quarter across all of these regions have moved this strategy another step forward.</p>
          <p>In addition we have net production of 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent coming on from our seven major development projects, and we are working to add the Ootla shale gas play in Canada as the eighth and potentially largest major project in this pipeline, which extends our visible growth far out in the future. We obviously continue to be very optimistic about the forward momentum of Apache.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. What a quarter. Apache turned in outstanding financial results that eclipsed all prior records as well as consensus expectations, despite our production challenges during the quarter. This obviously speaks to the impact of substantially higher prices, but it also speak to the effectiveness of Apache's balanced portfolio approach that we could absorb both the pipeline explosion in Australia and a strike shutting down Forties Field, our largest field, and still have the rest of our portfolio's production carry the day and enable our best quarter ever.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas revenues climbed $1.5 billion to a record $3.9 billion from second quarter of '07. $1.1 billion of the increase came from oil alone, another pleasant reminder of the benefit of Apache's balanced production mix, which remains around half oil and half gas. Over one-third of these revenues made it to the bottom line, as earnings more doubled to $1.4 billion from the same period last year and handily outpaced our previous best quarter by $370 million. As Bob and Steve mentioned, earnings per share of $4.28 were also a record, beating our previous record by over a third. Cash flow of $2.3 billion exceeded second quarter a year ago by $853 million and bested our former high by $400 million.</p>
          <p>Apache's record profits yielded exceptional returns. Second quarter annualized return on capital employed averaged 29%. Return on equity was 35%. Turning to detailed comparisons of second quarter versus the first quarter of '08, our oil realizations rose $21.07 or 24% from the first quarter, while gas realizations rose $1.67 per Mcf or 26%, driving up oil and gas revenues by $726 million or 23%. I want to take a moment to remind everyone of the impact that higher prices have on production volumes in countries with PSCs and cost recovery mechanisms. Basically, the higher the price, the fewer the barrels needed to recover costs. So, higher prices are a bit of a double-edged sword benefiting revenues and profits, but hurting production volumes.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, we estimate that a $10 per barrel increase in price reduces our volumes by approximately 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with Egyptian oil prices up $28 a barrel over the first quarter, oil production was reduced by an estimated 6,100 barrels of equivalent oil per day or just over 1% of our worldwide volumes. So that's another factor we considered in looking at our year-over-year production growth. Earnings increased 42% or $424 million, and cash flow increased 26% or $475 million from the first quarter. While the Varanus incident reduced production by 2% in the quarter, the earnings impact was a negligible $0.03 per share, primarily because, at present anyway, Australian gas is some of our lowest-priced gas.</p>
          <p>The real story for the quarter is the increase in our margins. While oil and gas prices increased 24% on average, our cash costs increased just 6%, while our non-cash costs rose only 2%. This means a substantial portion of the increased revenue from the strong commodity prices was captured in our profitability. Cash margins increased 30% sequentially to $59.71 per barrel of oil equivalent. Including DD&amp;A, our total pre-tax margin increased 41% to $46.69 per barrel equivalent produced. These margins are over 30% ahead of our best quarter ever. It's interesting to note if you remove the effect of taxes other than income, which are essentially price-sensitive production taxes, from our cash costs, our remaining controllable costs actually decreased 2% from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to costs in a bit more detail. Lifting costs per BOE decreased 1% to $8.90. Efforts to hold the line on absolute costs are bearing fruit. And as production grows in the second half, LOE per unit produced should drop somewhat.</p>
          <p>Full cost DD&amp;A increased 2% sequentially to $11.77 per BOE, consistent with recent drilling costs being higher than our historical average. G&amp;A costs decreased a nickel to $1.57 per BOE. Absolute costs were down, the results of lower second quarter payroll burdens such as FICA taxes, which peak in the first quarter with incentive compensation payments. Rising production should enable our future rate to fall below $1.50 per BOE.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than income in total increased $1.17 to $5.95 per BOE on higher commodity prices. The increase was primarily related to North Sea PRT, where the substantial increase in oil price drove a 34% increase in tax. Finance expense decreased $0.09 to $0.78 per BOE on lower average debt balances.</p>
          <p>Turning to income taxes, our second quarter '08 effective tax rate of 38% compared to 39% in the first quarter. Strong commodity prices have significantly increased current taxable income again this quarter, pushing the current portion of our tax to 78% from 75% in the first quarter. The problem with making money is you have to pay more taxes, and we are certainly doing our part in that regard. Given correct commodity prices, we presently expect a deferred tax percentage in the 25 to 30% range for the year and a 38 to 40% effective tax rate, absent the unforeseen, such as foreign exchange movement from here on out.</p>
          <p>For those that may think that our industry doesn't pay enough tax, and they seem to be growing in number on a daily basis, I'd point out that Apache anticipates paying some $1.7 billion of cash tax on income and production-related revenues for the first half of the year. At current commodity prices, the total cash tax for the year could exceed $3.5 billion, of which over $1 billion is a special non-income production tax reserved exclusively for extractive industries, of which oil and gas is the largest.</p>
          <p>Summing things up, Apache's outstanding second quarter results were underpinned by our portfolio approach, which has served us well in periods of rising costs and unprecedented commodity prices, and is also proving to be just as valuable amidst today's highly turbulent markets. Our balance of crude oil versus natural gas, geographical diversity, mix of long-life mature developments versus high-risk higher reward projects, and strong financial position are all designed to comprise an all-weather strategy.</p>
          <p>Our founder occasionally notes that ancient mariners navigated off distant stars in order to avoid being blown of course by whatever waves immediately confronted them. Similarly, we've charted Apache's course to execute on our growing backlog of E&amp;D projects around the world in order to continue delivering consistent, profitable growth despite short-term challenges.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I wanted to underscore Steve's point about growth. As was the case last year when most all our production growth occurred in the second half, we anticipate another very strong second half this year, and you can do the math. But achieving growth in 2008 entails a substantial ramp-up between now and year-end. So when we talk about growing production up to 2% for the year, we're planning on significant growth by year-end that will carry into the future. Bob?</p>

          <p>Now, the Heqet area is kind of in the southwestern corner of a &#x2013; obviously a huge acreage in our Khalda Concession. Many years ago, the Heqet &#x2013; the first well was actually drilled in 1991, the Heqet-1, and at that time &#x2013; we didn't really bring frac equipment into Egypt until about 1997. So this was the first time we had fraced one of those deep, deep Lower Safa zones in that well. We have a number &#x2013; there is a big east-west fault that runs through there. And I can't tell you all of those are going to be good, but we're going to drill four wildcats in that area here in the coming months. We think because it is a cooler basin that we have the real potential to add significant oil reserves down there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's probably a little premature. We're going to get &#x2013; we're actually going to recomplete two of our earlier wells drilled. We drilled some wells down there from 1991 through about 1996, and it'd probably be just speculation at the present time.</p>

          <p>Okay. Well, moving on to Canada and the Ootla play, the major pipeline infrastructure appears to be targeted for 2011 or 2012. Can you talk about what the planned capacity, if there's been those discussion, would be for that off-take capacity?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Well, that is a moving kind of unfolding events. One of the major pipelines up there was talking to us about &#x2013; not only for us but for other players up there &#x2013; actually them laying the line up into that area, which would create significant takeaway capacity. I think in the end, our largest investment will be in plants, because I think that over time there will be major pipelines that come up there and take that gas. Right now we probably have &#x2013; if we had the plant capacity we probably could take over 400 million a day out of there &#x2013; gross &#x2013; out of that Ootla area. With ourselves and our partners, EnCana, plus the other players, up there, you could see a time when 400 million a day is not going to be enough.</p>

          <p>Picking up on the end of some of the comments made on the second half production, I think depending on how you're calculating the 2%, it looks like you'd have to get to about 590,000 BOE a day in the second half to get to that 2%. And I was wondering what you're assuming in terms of contribution from additional gas in Egypt, from the Salam plant, in your numbers?</p>

I think the first &#x2013; October will be the first of any meaningful. It would be probably gross about 50 million a day &#x2013; that's gross. And then we would ramp up another &#x2013; actually by the end of the year, we would be up almost to the 200 million a day and about 5,000 barrels of liquids.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You mentioned that you are looking at international markets for Australia gas. I know this has come up before and you've discussed it. I wonder if there are any new thoughts on how actively you'd consider participating in LNG development and a timeline for that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at the infrastructure going in an immediate area to where our discoveries are, you can understand why that may be an alternative. Certainly, we've had discussions and ongoing discussions along those lines. And we don't have anything to report at the present time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also on the international gas front, any changes on the Egypt side? I think at the time of your last call you were about ready to potentially bring the topic up. But I was wondering what's the latest on the considerations for higher gas prices, if you build additional processing capacity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made a proposal to EGPC and also to the petroleum minister on our concession called the &#x2013; what's our concession? Up to the north.</p>
          <p>Hydra concession, I'm sorry, Brian. The Hydra discovery that we made, we made a presentation to them on a higher gas price. It's interesting &#x2013; I just read a thing out of the Egyptian paper that they are &#x2013; the Egyptians are working to incentivize foreign contractors to increase activity, which is going to cause prices in Egypt to go up. So I think we're beginning to see some traction in that area. And I don't have -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any sense on numbers, on where you think that could go?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>I don't have a timeline into that area. We've made a proposal that was pretty aggressive. If we get half of what our proposal is, we're probably going to be lucky.</p>
          <p>Now, the one thing I would say in Egypt, because I think some &#x2013; we don't do a very good job explaining it. We have one portion of our gas at 100 million a day gross, it's 50 million a day net, that actually sells for about $15 an M, because it wasn't capped back in 2001, so our average gas price in the second quarter was much higher than the July gas price of 2.65 plus BTUs. We actually averaged $6.25 in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if I could just ask one more. When you look at where oil prices are and also where some of the international gas prices are and the free cash flow that you are and are likely to continue to generate, any thoughts on the acquisition market, other international gas markets potentially or bulking up on North American oil?</p>

And we haven't stopped being an acquisitive company, but right now it's very difficult to make things make sense economically. We continue to look, but we continue to drill wells, which &#x2013; we have a tremendous opportunity to grow this company with the drill bit right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Steve, could you make a comment on why there was a sequential drop &#x2013; maybe you mentioned this earlier, but why was there a sequential drop in the Argentine gas price versus the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's we're going through winter. In Argentina, it's just the opposite of where we are here. I mean, in fact it's cold there right now. I just got back from Argentina a week ago, and it was about 37 degrees in the evening. So they use an awful lot of gas during the winter, and what happens is the residential uses a lot of gas and because of the tiered approach that they have to gas down there, you get about $0.50 for your residential price and they redirect gas to the residential market in the winter. So you will see that &#x2013; until they change their pricing, you will see that kind of counter-cyclical to the United States in terms of the prices in Argentina. So one thing I might point out is yesterday Argentina just announced that they're going to increase electricity prices, and that's not natural gas prices yet, but there's a real anticipation that natural gas prices will be right behind them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To get an appreciation that Argentina is headed in the right direction with gas prices, even with this sort of winter effect, the price of $1.39 we averaged in the second quarter compared to $1.02 year before. So we are making headway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, last year you didn't seem to have as much of an effect &#x2013; maybe I'm reading this wrongly. You didn't seem to have as much of a winter effect on pricing. Is that because of &#x2013; the industrial and the residential prices were more similar then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Gil, I don't know if you &#x2013; maybe we didn't explain ourselves. Roger pointed out that at the end of June of 2007, our average price was $1.02, and the average price for the second quarter of 2008 was $1.39. So, we increased about $0.37.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>36%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 36% from last year. And I'm optimistic because &#x2013; one of the reasons, I just got back from there and talked to a number of people. I think you're going to see &#x2013; we talked to the Finance Minister, and I &#x2013; my expectations &#x2013; obviously it's not going to look like Henry Hub, but we're going to start seeing gas prices start to trend upwards there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And related to that, when you look at &#x2013; in a broader sense as well &#x2013; when you look at capital allocation for the all the different projects you've got, and you look at Argentina versus Ootla versus Australia. But let me just focus on Argentina and Ootla. Are the investments in Argentina, are they economic at the current prices of oil and gas that you're selling? Or are you really &#x2013; is it a loss leader for the anticipation that prices will rise at some point in the future? And then with Ootla, how do the returns fit into the overall portfolio of returns you've got on your different projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to Argentina, we don't drill wells as loss leaders. Every well that we drill make economics at a price scenario that is under the current environment. It's interesting that &#x2013; we can find a lot of hydrocarbons. In fact my message even to the government down there was, Argentina has a lot of hydrocarbons. What they need is a little different pricing regime and they would have a lot more activity down there than they get today. And that provides jobs and lots other peripheral things besides the product itself. So, we make economics on the wells that we drill under our current price scenario.</p>
          <p>With respect to Ootla, I think we had a presentation after we drilled our three wells and tested them and actually publicly showed the results of those. And at 4 Bcf, at $8 at ACO, we were making about a 13% rate of return. If you get to 5 Bcf, it goes up, and obviously it goes up exponentially at 6 Bcf. So far, we're &#x2013; and that was using $10 million per well, to drill those wells. What we've found, and I think what we're going to continue to find, is that we're not going to spend $10 million to drill and test those wells.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is I think over time, you're going to see the reserves trend toward the upper number. If you look at the wells that EnCana drilled, and they put 10 fracs on those wells. We put six to eight fracs on our wells. They frac them larger, and if you just look at the early returns out of the EnCana wells, they are going to do better than our wells, which you would expect. And you would also expect those two wells to be in the higher end of that reserve number that I gave you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the &#x2013; going back to the no loss leader in Argentina thing, one of the things that's also going on down there is the way the market's currently structured, we have to deliver basically a relatively fixed volume of gas into that residential market. So once you get above that allocation by the government that you deliver into it, then you can sell your incremental gas at what the market will bear, and that's been 2.50 to $3.50 per Mcf when you don't have winter iterations going on. But the point is, the more incremental gas we bring on, the higher percentage of our gas will be sold at a more market-sensitive price.</p>

In fact Floyd Price, who is in charge of Argentina and Australia, we both went down there. Very, very optimistic about the ability to find things from that 3-D shoot and on some exploration, so a number of prospects.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have two problems with pipelines. One is there's not enough capacity. The other one is that we are at the tail end of that pipe, and what happens is a couple of &#x2013; Petrobras and Totale inject into that pipe up on the mainland and change the pressure regime down to our end. There is more than just a passing fancy to build a loop line. In fact we talked about it when we were down there. They've ordered the steel. It's a government sanction pipe that will take another 250 million a day by the middle of 2009 are what they are advertising, taking another 250 million a day out of Tierra del Fuego. So hopefully in the next year or year and a half we'll have excess capacity coming out of Tierra del Fuego. And then they have a longer-term plan to move that up to about 550 million a day by 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But going out 12 months, 250 shouldn't be that &#x2013; that should be more than enough for what you have, and Totale and Petrobras, correct? You'll have excess capacity once that starts up?</p>

          <p>Just a couple questions. On Egypt, the Heqet discovery you described as 835 acres on that structure. Trying to get an idea of scope and size of these structures. Can you give us a net feet of pay or a resource potential for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a little early to give a resource potential. We had about 40 feet of pay in that zone, which we fraced. And the most interesting thing about it, frankly, is that we've drilled other wells in that area, both &#x2013; on both sides of that big east-west fault. And all of those wells have the potential to be fraced, but have never been fraced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's a similar pay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you had a well drilling, Cygnus-3X. Did you give a status on that well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your memory is better than mine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was in Egypt. Offset to let's say &#x2013; let's see, was it -?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hydra-3X, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cygnus. That was the Hydra-3X. We found some pay; it was thinner. Actually, the well was up-dip and had a thinner pay, which was surprising, because on our seismic picture, we thought it would be down-dip. So it's going to produce, but it's not what we thought it was going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not the big discovery, it's the 100 Bcf, not the P3 potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got a Hydra-3 drilling as we speak, so we'll -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; we'll hold that open. That well was 8 kilometers away from the first well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one quick question, thinking about Australia volumes. You talked about the gas volumes coming on August and then late August and then by year-end. What's the appropriate ratio of oil ramp that comes with that? Is there any delays on the liquid facility or does it just match?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we should get a little liquids out of coming up in August. But we have a lot of black oil that goes through the Harriet facility. And that Harriet facility, the Harriet joint venture facility, that Harriet joint venture facility won't be on in December. So we're not going to see significant oil increases in Australia from where we are today until really the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was it. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And we will go next to Joe Allman with JPMorgan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Hi, everybody. I apologize if you covered this earlier, but could you give us an update on that Reindeer Gas contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; we've talked about it so much, we ought to be able to give you an update, but I can't. But we do have a large contingent, as I said on the call, a large contingent in Australia as we speak that are going to be meeting with various levels of the buyer in that. And I anticipate that we get this thing done here pretty quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's been the delay to settling this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The honest delay is indemnities, which is interesting. It's a lawyer &#x2013; we're down to lawyer negotiation about what happens if they don't take, what happens if we don't produce. And those events don't generally happen, but you've got to ensure that you have mechanisms on both sides in case that happens. But that is the hang-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay. Thanks. Then a different issue. In terms of &#x2013; could you just comment on concerns you might have about the availability of steel to drill and develop your programs, and also what are you seeing recently with drill and complete costs, just across the various areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steel is a very interesting issue. Probably for the first time in my career, because we do a stocking program, certainly it's for the first time in Apache, we are having to wait on steel. And if we don't take it immediately, sometimes even though we have a stocking program, that steel is not there. And I'm sure we're not the only ones that are suffering that event &#x2013; the reason you asked the question, I assume.</p>
          <p>Steel is tight right now. Steel is tight, more in this country or in North America, than it is in other parts of the world right now. We don't have that problem in Egypt, we don't have that problem in Australia, but in North America, that is an issue. And I think one of the reasons is, is that you've got an awful lot more steel being put in the ground. In terms of cost, as you saw, our operating costs are down a little bit in real terms. North American drilling costs, completion costs, are pretty level right now, frankly.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not seeing significant increases. We're still &#x2013; obviously your waiting time on machines, whether it's turbines or &#x2013; the waiting time is longer. But in most places, you can get around that. Like I'd mentioned earlier, the one place that we're beginning to see really, you got to be on a tight leash in this country right now and in Canada, is steel. Tubulars, oilfield tubular goods.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon here, folks. Question, your exploratory program in the second half of the year. You mentioned trying to ramp up activity in the Gippsland Basin in Australia in late 3Q. I was hoping you'd give a little more detail on what you guys plan to target out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have four wells on the schedule. The Gippsland Basin is a very oily area. It's produced over 4 billion barrels of oil. We are drilling a well kind of on the outer shelf of two major fields in that area; we call it Block 59. But we're going to drill at least three structures there, the closest of which is called MIMO. It's certainly not a step-out, but it's very close to Esso's and BHP's field that made over 900 million barrels. I mean &#x2013; I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we're in a good area. And I mean obviously they're exploration plays. But done an awful lot of seismic work and an awful lot of geology. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jumping over to Canada here. Obviously you guys have some pretty significant resource potential up there in your Ootla area. And obviously you've got a lot of land in Canada and some other places. Just curious to know if you folks have looked at any other sort of emerging resource plays in Canada that may have acreage exposure, things like the Montney or the Bakken oil play extension up into Saskatchewan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one of the things I will say, in today's hectic world, it does not behoove you to advertise where you're putting acreage together. Because, if you look at what happens to acreage costs, just like they did &#x2013; I'll give you a for instance. When we bought most of our acreage in the Ootla area, we probably have &#x2013; or not probably &#x2013; we've got less than $200 million in our acreage. If we sold our acreage in Ootla today for the latest land sale, it would be worth $1 billion. So we are putting acreage together in place. And when we get all of the acreage together that we want to get together, then we'll talk about where our acreage is. And again I'm not trying to be evasive, it's just &#x2013; acreage is key today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jumping over to Argentina, it looks like your oil price was up to about 50 bucks in the second quarter. My understanding, just hearing some chatter out there is the government's talking about partially easing some of the restrictions on the oil price ceiling. Do you guys have any kind of comments on that and how it impacts you all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're allowed some oil price adjustments, so some of that is catch-up on oil price adjustments that we haven't seen in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But they have allowed &#x2013; we were getting 42 and then 47. It's not just quality adjustments &#x2013; we have a group of people. It's not just quality adjustments, what's happening is the actual purchasers, you're allowed to actually pay a premium for crude oil, and without suffering the tax on it. And so what we've seen is, say, a market for crude oil that increases our price without affecting the excise tax. And I would expect that to continue. I mean, they need oil and natural gas desperately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing I would say, I apologize for interrupting, but the other thing I would say is Roger's comments about the different tiers in Argentina. When we're not redirected, we have contracts that go from 250, certainly, but up to 390. So you're starting to see prices in Argentina, market-driven prices, start to reflect what's happening with respect to limited supply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and it's happening in electricity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, they've been able to get away with fixed prices for a long time. I think there's a recognition that that just isn't going to work anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question relating to your U.S. operations. You're talking about an overall 2008 growth of 2% for the company with upticks in Australia, Egypt, and the North Sea. Is there an expectation for an uptick in the U.S. production in the second half of the year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly should see our Central region volumes continue to go up modestly. And I think from a quarter-over-quarter, you probably will see our Gulf region go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Turning back briefly to acquisitions, given that you're one of the largest CBM producers in Canada, is that a region where you think you'd consider making an acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it was the right opportunity, obviously, from our perspective, and I think most people's perspective. Alberta has shot themselves in the foot, and you can gauge that a number of different ways, the lease sales that are going on in B.C., the lease sales that are going on in Saskatchewan, the activity level in those two provinces versus Alberta. I think from our standpoint in Canada, the &#x2013; we add more value to our company and to our shareholders from land acquisitions and drilling wells than we do from acquisitions. And never say never, but that's probably not an area that we'd actively pursue a significant producing property acquisition. Not unless it brought a tremendous amount of acreage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And just turning back down to the Gulf of Mexico, following on Geauxpher, do you have any plans for any additional deepwater wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have any on our drilling schedule right now, but we have a team that is put together to look for those kind of projects, which is where this project came from. So as we continue to develop the geology, you'll be able to find more of these.</p>

          <p>We started out lower than that, but prices have held in, and our regions have been able to find some new and interesting things to do. And so we're going to let them expand a little.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what did you sell in Canada? And then the $142 million of property acquisitions, is that leasing or is there any production with that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit of production, but for the most part, that was a land purchase.</p>
