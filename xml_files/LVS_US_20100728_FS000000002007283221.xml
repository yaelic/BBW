          <p>Good morning. My name is Marianne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corp. Quarter Two Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Daniel Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Good morning to those of you back in the United States. On the call with me today are Mike Leven, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Rob Goldstein joining us from Las Vegas, our Executive Vice President, President of the Venetian and the Palazzo Las Vegas; Ken Kay, our Chief Financial Officer; and Gayle Hyman, our General Counsel. Mr. Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will be joining us for the Q&amp;A portion of this call.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption, forward-looking statements, for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mike Leven.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody. Sheldon Adelson has just arrived into the hotel. His plane &#x2013; he had to get off his plane, which was canceled because of the weather. And in about five minutes, he should be here. So I will start by reading some of his portion, and then he will pick it up as &#x2013; when he gets in.</p>
          <p>Good morning to those of you in the United States, and good evening to those of you in Asia. Thank you all for joining us today. I will begin today's call with some comments on this quarter's results, including our results from Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, which opened its doors on April 27. I will then hand the call over to Mike Leven and the team to provide some additional detail.</p>
          <p>Big picture, we are very pleased with our results. Our business in Macau is quite strong and is generating record revenue and EBITDA. Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, which opened &#x2013; which was open for only 65 days during the quarter, has received a wonderful reception from the people of Singapore and the wider region.</p>
          <p>The property is experiencing strong visitation and gaming volumes and is off to an outstanding start. In Las Vegas operating conditions are showing some signs of improvement, particularly on weekends, and occupancy has been strong even throughout the summer period.</p>
          <p>Our record results in Macau during the quarter included a strong contribution from each of our three properties there. Let me provide the details for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>At The Venetian Macao, net revenue increased 31% to 581 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 75% to 193 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 840 basis points to 33.2%. At The Sands Macao, net revenue increased 29% to 302 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to 81 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 26.9%.</p>
          <p>At The Four Seasons Hotel Macao and Plaza Casino, net revenue increased 196% to 144 million; adjusted EBITDA increased 493% to 33 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 1,150 basis points to 22.9%. And for our Macau properties in total, net revenue increased 41% to 1.03 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 74% to 307 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 560 basis points to 29.9%.</p>
          <p>We continue to lead the Macau market with revenue growth flowing through to market-leading EBITDA and EBITDA margin. This performance reflects strong revenue growth, coupled with the benefits from our cost containment and efficiency strategies.</p>
          <p>Construction activity on the Shangri-La Traders Sheraton complex, our latest integrated resort development on parcels five and six on the Cotai Strip in Macau, is progressing. We recently closed a credit facility for the development, and we thank our lending partners for their support on this project. We continue to work with the Macau authorities to ramp-up construction workers necessary to complete the project.</p>
          <p>Mr. Adelson just walked in. He will pick it up from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>As long as I have my glasses. Hey, glasses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, here you go. Right here, in Singapore -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In Singapore Marina Bay Sands generated 94 million in EBITDA in its first 65 days of operation and EBITDA margin of 43.7%. Low table games hold on our rolling business in Marina Bay Sands prevented us from generating even stronger EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the period.</p>
          <p>After opening 963 rooms on April 27 and most of the remaining rooms and suites on June 23, Marina Bay Sands has experienced strong visitation and healthy volumes in all three segments of the property's gaming business.</p>
          <p>We have seen increases in volumes in both our mass and rolling businesses since we opened the property and are pleased with both our volumes to date and the ramping up of daily play. We are confident that as the property and its marketing programs continue to mature and as its full complement of amenities, including additional high-end suites, retail and entertainment offerings come online, Marina Bay Sands will be an ideal platform for the company's growth.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a moment on Las Vegas. Gaming volumes were healthy during the quarter, but we experienced lower table games hold. Hotel revenues improved compared to the second quarter of '09. Occupancy is up, and group business is returning, although pricing remains competitive &#x2013; pricing on groups remain competitive.</p>
          <p>Forward bookings are increasing for both the remainder of 2010 and 2011, which is encouraging. We are also seeing stronger pricing trends that may affect key portion of our business, particularly on weekends.</p>
          <p>I look forward to addressing your questions later, but will turn it over to Mike and the team for a quick update first. Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sheldon. I will add just a couple of thoughts. First, let me cover our leadership change in Macau. The Board of Sands China made the decision that a leadership change was in the best interest of the company, its employees and shareholders. I will be serving as acting Chief Executive Officer for Sands China, while the Committee of the Board of Directors of Sands China conducts the new search for the new Chief Executive Officer.</p>
          <p>For at least the last six months, we have had the objective of augmenting the leadership team in Macau with additional senior operating management. We now have the opportunity to fulfill that goal, and I'm pleased to say that we have recruited two senior operating executives to join our management team in Macau on August 10.</p>
          <p>Ed Tracy has joined us as President and Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. David Sisk has joined Sands China as Executive Vice President and Chief Casino Officer. Both gentlemen have extensive experience in the hospitality and gaming industries and have developed a track record of success during their careers. We welcome them to the team and look forward to their contributions in the future.</p>
          <p>We are quite pleased with both our current operating performance and our strategic positioning in Macau. Our team members there have done an outstanding job during the last year, and we're very pleased with their hard work, dedication and performance. I'm confident that Ed and David, together with the leadership team already in place in Macau, are well prepared to lead Sands China as it grows in the years ahead. As strong as our results have been, these management changes are all about building on the solid foundation we have already established and making our properties work even better in the future.</p>
          <p>Let me make a couple of comments on our current quarter results. Our direct VIP play at The Venetian Macao grew to $2.4 billion on approximately 24% of the approximately $10 billion of rolling volume during the quarter. At the Four Seasons Hotel Macao and Plaza Casino, total rolling volume was $4.8 billion with direct VIP rolling business growing to $2.4 billion or about 49% of that's total.</p>
          <p>Retail is another bright spot with retail sales increasing nicely across our properties. Retail sales at The Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian Macao, for example, were up 56% in the month of June compared to June of last year. With respect to future development in Macau on parcels five and six, we remain confident that the introduction of additional destinations on the Cotai Strip will expand the Macau market, providing critical mass to drive greater visitation, mass table and slot play, hotel and retail revenues also to our current and future properties.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a moment on Sands Bethlehem before Rob covers Las Vegas. I'm pleased to share the news that Sands Bethlehem had its best quarter since we opened the property last May, generating &#x2013; May of '09, generating $12 million of EBITDA during the quarter. The improving results reflect stronger slot revenues and the introduction of additional marketing programs, as well as a concerted effort on efficiency.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that Sands Bethlehem has potential. We introduced 89 table games on July 18, which have broadened the property's appeal and should contribute to the greater profitability overall. Table play is off to a good early start and has already positively impacted visitation and food and beverage revenue, as well as slot play and profitability.</p>
          <p>In fact, last week we generated our highest gross slot win on record. We have also seen a marked increase in our Player Club Card enrollments with a significant portion coming from New Jersey and New York. We restarted the construction of our 300-room hotel and expect it to open in the spring of 2011. The addition of the hotel will increase the length of stay at Sands Bethlehem, while adding higher margin hotel revenues to the property's financial results.</p>
          <p>With that, let's go to Rob to discuss Las Vegas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Our Las Vegas properties delivered EBITDA of $66 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $78 million in the second quarter of last year. Gaming volumes remain healthy and were stronger during the quarter compared to last year; however, poor hold percentage negatively impacted table revenue by approximately $30 million. RevPAR is up for the quarter, reflecting stronger occupancy, and rates are modestly lower when compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we expect to realize more group rooms in 2010 than we did in 2009. The pace of group bookings continues to improve and 2011 should be stronger than 2010. In 2009, we realized approximately 478,000 group room nights or about 18% of our total room nights.</p>
          <p>Today we have about 550,000 in group rooms on the books for '10, an increase of 19% of what we realized in 2009. We expect our actual group rooms to exceed that number as we add additional business throughout the remainder of the year. However, rates are still under pressure in that segment. We do expect pricing &#x2013; that pricing will improve in the group segment over time as business expands. Our direct competitors in Las Vegas raised prices and the economic recovery continues.</p>
          <p>So, in summary in Las Vegas, our gaming business is healthy. Our costs are down. Given that backdrop, we are confident that our Las Vegas properties will exhibit significant operating leverage as pricing in the FIT segment and over time the group segment continues.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Ken Kay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. We made further progress this quarter on our deleveraging strategy. Excluding our development financing in Singapore, we paid down or retired approximately $420 million of our debt during the quarter. The repayments include $350 million on the Macau revolver and the purchase and retirement of approximately $27 million of face value of our senior notes, which were purchased for 96.1% of par.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, we had approximately $3.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments on our balance sheet. That cash provides us with significant financial flexibility and will enable us to execute additional components of our deleveraging strategy in the future.</p>
          <p>In addition to our cash balances at June 30, we had approximately $3.2 billion of availability under our undrawn credit facilities at current exchange rates, including amounts available through our U.S. credit facility and our new credit facility related to parcels five and six on the Cotai Strip in Macau. So together we have approximately $7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments and available sources of liquidity.</p>
          <p>The principal uses for that $7 billion include approximately $750 million of capital expenditures, pre-opening, FF&amp;E and construction period interest to spend on our Marina Bay Sands development in Singapore through the end of calendar 2010. Although we expect as much as $450 million of that amount to be paid out of cash flow generated by Marina Bay Sands during the remainder of the year, an additional $430 million, principally retainage payments on the development, will be paid out of cash flow from operating the property in 2011. In Macau, approximately $400 million in additional equity contributions will be made toward the development of parcels five and six on the Cotai Strip.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we closed the previously announced $1.75 billion credit facility to fund construction of parcels five and six in Macau. The remaining equity noted previously and the project financing together are sufficient to complete the first two phases of that development, which will feature approximately 6,000 hotel rooms and all the major cash flow generating components of the development.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, total debt was $10.4 billion, while our cost of borrowing remains low. Our weighted average interest rate for the quarter was approximately 3.7%. At our current levels of operating performance, our cash balances provide ample cushion for compliance with the financial covenants in our U.S. credit facility.</p>
          <p>At June 30, 2010, for the U.S. restricted group covenant compliance purposes, our trailing 12-month EBITDA was $432 million, our total gross domestic debt was $4.3 billion, our cash balances within the U.S. restricted group were $1.9 billion, and our calculated net debt was $2.4 billion. Our leverage ratio was 5.47 times compared to a maximum leverage covenant under our U.S. credit facility of six times.</p>
          <p>For The Venetian Macao restricted group at June 30, 2010, our trailing 12 months EBITDA for compliance purposes was $1.09 billion, total gross debt at The Venetian Macao restricted group was $2.27 billion, and our leverage ratio was 2.09 times compared to a maximum leverage covenant of 4.0 times.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on maximizing operating profitability to enable debt reduction. While our business will naturally generate a significant amount of free cash flow that will enable deleveraging in the future, we also expect to execute in due course the sale of non-core assets, which will enable additional debt repayments and enhanced returns.</p>
          <p>As part of our long-term strategy to delever the company and reduce our debt outstanding, later this week we will be launching an amend-and-extend transaction with respect to our U.S. credit facility. The transaction contemplates a paydown of our term loans and a reduction of a revolving credit facility commitment in exchange for the extension of maturities and other modifications to the credit agreement intended to increase the company's financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>While we are opportunistically looking to pursue this transaction, our current and projected liquidity and financial resources provide us with the ability to leave our U.S. credit facility in place without modification should terms not be acceptable to us. If completed, this transaction will accelerate our deleveraging process, enhance our liquidity and improve the overall credit quality of the company.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sheldon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken. I guess it's my turn to sing and dance. No, I'm not going to sing. Before we go to Q&amp;A, let me make a couple of final points. I have complete confidence in Mike and our leadership team. We just completed another outstanding quarter, contrary to what the shorts believed we would do.</p>
          <p>Generating record revenues and EBITDA in Macau and for the company overall, our operations are in outstanding shape, and we're making positive additions to our management team.</p>
          <p>We've also reduced our debt levels, and our balance sheet has nearly 4 billion of cash &#x2013; but who is counting, providing significant financial flexibility and enabling us to continue our industry-leading growth strategy.</p>
          <p>With the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we stand today at the beginning of our next major phase of growth. We couldn't be more enthused about our business today and about our strong positioning for the future.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll move to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey everybody. Good evening or good morning to Rob out in Las Vegas. Looking at the Singapore results, which were very strong, if I'm looking at gross gaming revenue per day, it's somewhere in the 3.6 million range in the casino. Win per day is 2.94 million. For the quarter, I'm presuming that there was improvement June versus May and May versus the stub in April. Can you talk about the monthly progression of casino win or gaming win maybe on a per day basis and maybe talk about how that trend is going in July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would ask Ken to answer that, but my recollection having glanced over the numbers that it was a substantial ramp from May to June.</p>

          <p>Maybe I will follow-up off line with you guys. Just on the topic of Steve Jacobs' departure, I'm presuming he has a non-compete. Can you confirm that, and how long does that non-compete last?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe he has a non-compete, Joe. Actually he did not have an actual employment contract. He had a signed term sheet. We never got to contract with it, and I don't believe he has a non-compete in that term sheet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mike, Sheldon, are you anticipating any other property management departures as a result of Steve Jacobs not being there, or are you aware of any that might be pending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the contrary, we have several people wanting to come back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're reviewing staff now, Joe, and Stephen Weaver has come back as a consultant to help us through the transition period and maybe even longer depending upon his personal situation. There were basically staff openings here over the last number of months. And I can tell you that I don't think there is any significant &#x2013; anyone of significance on the management team that is in a situation that could be contemplated as a change at this point. I mean, I've been here for a week and have not seen any indication that the problem is in the layer of staff below Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe you can just talk, Mike, a little bit, the two new guys that you announced yesterday. One has Macau experience, and the other has more U.S. regional experience. Can you talk about what you think they bring to the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of David Sisk, the casino individual, we have been looking for for months for someone to run, supervise the five casinos that we have that includes five and six as well. He has many years of very strong casino experience combined with some significant Macau experience in other <mark type="inaudible" /> marketplace.</p>
          <p>So I think he brings a very senior management approach to the casino business. This is a very complex business, multi-marketed effort, even though it's a significant amount of junket business, and we think that David Sisk's personality and skill set bringing into the table will provide some management daily attention to the full casino business.</p>
          <p>It is not possible for me to run all of the casino business here from the very top of the organization. There is just too much going on on a daily basis. So that's why we were looking for the individual, and I think David brings an unusual combination of understanding the VIP business, as well as having a real good organizational mind and experience for the rest of the casino businesses that we have.</p>
          <p>In the case of Ed Tracy, Ed Tracy has some casino experience, but we have bifurcated the building into two pieces, the casino side and the operating side. Ed actually began by washing dishes in a hotel, worked his way up through a series of properties all through his career, much of which none of the people on this call probably wouldn't have seen at low levels in the hotel business, built his way up through that business to various senior positions, and I think he can take the operation of these properties to the next level.</p>
          <p>The operations of the properties are doing well from a quality basis. It needs a little bit of work on the service side. Also, some substantial improvements can be made on the marketing and sales side, and I believe we will be able to accomplish that with Ed. I think the combination of having a strong operating situation, along with the gaming will give the next CEO the ability to deal in the financial, legal, government affairs area. So that's how we are structuring the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then back to my Singapore question, you mentioned there was a substantial ramp from May to June. How would you characterize July versus June? I'm not sure if you answered that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Joe, it's Ken. Just to give you an idea in terms of the May through June, and then Mike can tell you where things are currently. If you look at it from a rolling perspective, when we started out the property, we were probably hovering around, I would say, in the 3 to $400 million range on a weekly basis.</p>
          <p>But, as you have gotten past and gotten into the beginning of June, right that number has ramped up significantly where it then got above the $600 million range, and then is now in the 8 to $900 million range on a weekly basis. The other thing that I think is important with regard to the non-rolling and slot business, if you look at it on a win per day basis you &#x2013; and those numbers that I gave you before were kind of a per day during those weeks for the rolling business.</p>
          <p>But on the non-rolling and slot per day, when you started off in May, were kind of in the 2 million plus range per day, and then when you've gotten to the beginning part of June, it started to get upwards, pushing in the 2.5 million range. And now as we have progressed into late June and into the early part of July, it's kind of pushed up above the $3 million per day. So it has kind of ramped up quickly in that regard, and now Mike can probably give you an idea relative to the latest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the latest situation we are now seeing as we get to the latter part of June and through July so far, our rolling volume will probably hit in July a little over $3 billion enrolled.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's U.S. now, not Sing, right. And our ramp-up in mass-market and slots has continued in the month of July. Our hold number on the VIP rolling situation has been lower than expected, but we are very consistent in our mass market and slot wins, and what we are doing in the win per unit per days, as well as the hold percentages. So there is no question that it continues to ramp, and will continue to ramp, I think.</p>
          <p>I can't predict what's going to happen in August and September, but at this point when you look at our performance in the 65 days without any serious contribution from the hotel, which, by the way, is also ramping, we ended the quarter at 55% on the 65 days on 900 rooms.</p>
          <p>We are doing that level of business now in 2,500 rooms, which means that we are actually selling 1,000 rooms a day more, I believe, than we were selling before. So but once we get into the 70s and 80s in percentage-wise, there will be a major contribution there as well. So it would also help the casino numbers. But the encouraging thing is that all three areas of volume in the casino are moving forward and particularly in the VIP now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We only opened the electronic baccarat so far, which is about 90, 89 and 90 units. By September 3, we will have a total &#x2013; we will have over 300 electronics, including Rapid Roulette and Rapid Sic Bo. Some of that will come in in August, but the whole project will be completed by September 3.</p>
          <p>And the early results on baccarat were a little bit lower than expectation. But they are also ramping up as people know they are there. So we expect that's going to have a pretty good-sized impact with that number of machines.</p>

          <p>Thank you. As we are talking about Singapore and looking at the ramp versus the &#x2013; and the current trend versus the average levels of play and whatnot, could we look at the commission rates for a second? It looks like you're doing about 1.2% for the quarter. How is that trending? I know you tried to start out at a lower commission rate, and there were competitive pressures that made you ramp up higher. What do you think is sustainable over the next quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>We don't have Sentosa's numbers. We can't say; it would be pure guesswork. But I do think that &#x2013; well, it may sound like an optimistic statement, but we will get &#x2013; we will have more than our fair share given when we ramp up.</p>
          <p>When we are in the market as long as Sentosa has been in the market, we pick up that three months. By the end of the summer, I would expect that we would have our fair share and perhaps a little greater. But we can't know until the numbers come out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I looked at yesterday's &#x2013; this is Sheldon, Janet. I looked at &#x2013; we show the country of origin of the player. I looked at the top 20 players yesterday, and we have countries that I didn't believe we would get them from. We even get customers from Macau.</p>
          <p>We have Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea, of course, Malaysia and Indonesia, and Thailand. Those names are very difficult to pronounce. I guess they figure Adelson is difficult to pronounce. But clearly as we're ramping up we have no idea what they are doing. But we have reason to be optimistic and encouraged about our ramping up following the last number of weeks since we've been open. There's no reason to think we're going to have &#x2013; we are not at par with them. They have had a better time ramping up, and they have had a lot of experience in bringing in buses from Malaysia. They are doing very well at that.</p>
          <p>Genting is doing a lot better than what I thought they might do, and I think they &#x2013; the rewards program are kind of very rich for the player and also for the high-end. There is a lot of rationale that everybody is throwing around as to why they are giving out at least 20 bps higher than we are giving on any one customer category. So the biggest spread is on the last 10 million and over category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that customer mix as you expected, and what would you say are the most profitable segments right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, the mass as a margin, it's always going to be very profitable, but on the difference in the tax rates. So it comes out, even though it would figure out to about 11.5 to 12, it's coming in at about 10 because of the way that they do the calculation, and it's coming in at about 20 instead of 22 on the mass side. So theoretically, the reward program is much richer for the high-end player, but then again, it is offset by the lower tax rate. There are some days that we go by and we look at our contribution margin of 67%. I mean some days we are doing upwards &#x2013; many days we are doing upwards of 50 on the cost of sales, the net after cost of &#x2013; what you would think of as cost of sales, I call it contribution margin. So the margins at 43 point something &#x2013; 43.7 I think is probably a surprise to a number of people.</p>
          <p>It's not to us because when we look at daily numbers &#x2013; and we get numbers every day, it looks like we will have a substantially higher margin, probably industry-leading profit margins for both us and presumably for Genting. So but the fact that there are so many people that are coming from different countries in Asia, I did not see any Japanese, but I did see some Koreans. We have a group of Koreans flying in every week. And they are very good players, fine people and good players. So I think that the outer reaches of our radius, our marketing radius, is wider than what we thought before.</p>

The government of Macau is only responding to the need for us to try to put local people to work. If they're faced with the choice of not having any growth, on the one hand, or on the other hand, allowing more foreign workers in, I believe very strongly they are going to allow more foreign workers in.</p>

          <p>Hey, Dan. Three real quick questions by market. First, in Macau I was hoping you could give a little bit of color on July trends to-date. In Singapore I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the margin ramp as you layer on the other hotel components and start to ramp there in the retail mall. I think it would mean that margins have continued to ramp from current levels? And also in Vegas, a quick question for Rob about cash RevPAR trends. Certainly the RevPAR numbers looked impressive in the quarter, but I was hoping you could give us a sense of what the cash numbers look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Glad to hear it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In July, Mark, this is Mike, and July, Mark, July has been a terrific 27 days so far in Macau. I think &#x2013; I can't speak for everybody else on the peninsula in here, but basically we are doing extremely well at the EBITDA line for all properties. So you never know until it is over in July, but my guess is July will continue the trends of the last quarter. Or more. We are very optimistic about what is happening here from that standpoint. The question on &#x2013; what was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is about retail, Mike, retail in Marina Bay -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, retail in Marina Bay you will have 161 &#x2013; I think 160 stores open at September 3, and there is a big opening party there for that, of 280 stores. So we expect that to begin to contributing profitability, which, as you know, is high margin profitability in the retail area. Just to give you an example of the 43.7 percentage really had no &#x2013; when you are opening a property, you are basically &#x2013; your staffing levels and your volume levels don't really come together.</p>
          <p>For example, in the quarter, we averaged room contribution of about 70%. Normally, we would get somewhere between 78 and 82%. As the hotel begins to fill up, we will get that margin. That will be a higher level of contribution. So I think the answer to your question is, there should be no reason the contribution margin goes lower. In fact, there should be every reason the contribution margin or the EBITDA margin level goes higher as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, as far as your question, you're focusing on casino comps as a percentage of the net segment versus the group rooms and wholesale in FIT, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, think throughout the market, we are all pretty much aware that too many people &#x2013; ourselves included &#x2013; are comping or discounting in the casino segment more aggressively than we'd like to. We prefer to use sub-20 as a percentage of our mix, like to see our group rooms get back into the mid-30s, even higher, and our FIT in the 40 to 50% and the balance be casino.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately in this environment we're down from last year. We are comping less on a relative basis year on year, but it's still too high. We're still in the mid-20s. I think we're probably less guilty than our competitors, but we're still guilty of it. And I think it's indicative of the market that we can't in mid-week &#x2013; weekends are not the issue. We can get FIT and others on the weekends. The mid-week has been the challenge. And I think the market clearly, to break out the cash RevPAR from the comp, it's a legitimate question to ask. And I think across the market there is too much comping, but there is also too much supply in the market right now. So until we see stronger group, stronger FIT, I think you will see that continue to be a problem for us and for the market in general.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good evening, guys. Just one question, first of all, on Singapore. You guys gave a little bit &#x2013; Mike, you gave a little bit of color on the where you thought the contribution margin could stabilize on the hotel side. I was wondering if you could tell us just in the quarter what the contribution margins were for the hotel and for the casino? And then secondarily, I just wanted to ask a question &#x2013; a follow-up for Rob on Las Vegas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, I don't really have that. I can tell you the contribution margin from the hotel itself was pretty minimal in the first quarter in Singapore. In other words because -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is so early, and, as you know, you sort of overstaff and over think in order to get the service levels up. Plus, you have openings and all those expenses going in there.</p>
          <p>I can say the casino margin is over 50%. It varies by 52 to 55% depending upon the day. And but they also &#x2013; you can see that the overall margin of 43.7 is probably dragged by the hotel and the various expenses that go on there because the &#x2013; that is why the margin is below 50 on an EBITDA basis.</p>
          <p>We are carrying operating costs, energy costs and operating costs that run a significant amount on a daily basis that don't sort of get amortized when the hotel is not filled up and when all the food and beverage and everything isn't open. So the best I can say to answer that question is that north of 50 would be where I think we ought to be when the hotel is ramping &#x2013; or is ramped up.</p>

          <p>I talked to Ben in our C&amp;E, Conference and Exhibition, tonight about another issue, and I asked him how things were going, and he said, well, we have a little problem. He said, we have too much business. So part of the construction of something that has to be finished has to be done from 7:00 PM at night to 7:00 AM in the morning. We can't work during the today because we have too much MICE business. It is a great problem to have. But I don't know how big the MICE business is, but if there is any MICE business, you can't be doing any drilling or nailing or whatever. So that was very encouraging to hear.</p>

          <p>And I guess one more follow-up on Singapore would just be any update on the status for junkets in the market there? There has been some chatter about maybe some players acting as junkets for small groups of theirs in for some local trade press. But just wondering what you guys are seeing there, and do you have any application in for junkets under Marina Bay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to my knowledge. I have not heard or seen a junket application. About a month or two ago, there was some noise about &#x2013; that there had been some junket applications into the CRA at Singapore, but nothing has come out to us at this particular point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has been a lot of local gossip about how Genting is working with junket reps. We have no basis on which to make an accurate statement about whether they are or not. My inclination is to say that if they're paying 1.4 to 1.5, it's certainly an indication they may have to be working with some sort of intermediary. What was the other part of his question?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about where you think that's going to stabilize in '10, and what you think it can be in '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're hoping &#x2013; well, in '10, we are hoping to get into the mid 20s. I think we'll see '11 will exceed &#x2013; hopefully, will exceed 30, but we are not there yet. The real issue is really demand is there. The question is rate. Throughout the market if you look at the rates, they're just not &#x2013; the buyers are a lot tougher. The market both in Las Vegas and beyond Las Vegas is very rate-sensitive, and I think that has been a challenge. We would like to really exceed 30 in '11, but I think we will be in the high 20s probably is more accurate.</p>
          <p>Just one comment, if you don't mind, the Singapore issue you mentioned before to Mike and Sheldon, is just on the junket reps. From my perspective, I don't think we need &#x2013; this was an issue that a lot of people were concerned about. But demand on this high-end premium segment is so good that I just don't know why we need to worry about them either way. I mean I think if anything we're seeing, our premium guys keep seeing more and more demand, as Sheldon referenced, in multiple countries.</p>
          <p>If anything, I think they become more of a non-event than ever because the demand on the premium segment of the tables is extraordinary. I don't see a lot of credit problems. So I think we've played this very well, and the market has proven to be very, very strong on the premium side without junket reps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure &#x2013; I remember what I was going to say. I think that some of the press are talking about &#x2013; or some of the analysts are talking about, well, the junket reps are going to show themselves in the second half. I can be quoted on this, I don't think so. Because the probity checks of the Singapore government is so comprehensive, I don't believe &#x2013; it's only been a couple of small number of months ago that they've accepted that was the cutoff date for &#x2013; I don't think it was the cutoff date &#x2013; was since they received junket rep applications.</p>
          <p>So I am still convinced that the Macau style junket reps will not submit to the probity checks and provide the information that the government will need to put them through the investigatory wringer. And even if they do, and even if there are some Macau style junket reps that will do that, I don't believe it's going to be done this year at all. Now just like I could tell my wife, I'm not perfect all the time. So I don't &#x2013; she doesn't believe me. I don't &#x2013; listen, I could be wrong. I don't think there is going to be any junket reps coming in 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are in active discussion right now since we terminated Steve Jacobs about the wisdom of accentuating the effort for direct premium play. We're certainly not going to eliminate it. The question is, how aggressive are we going to be to try to get it? We certainly have a lot of it in &#x2013; I mean all that we have in Singapore is direct premium play. And consistent with what I've been talking to Goldstein about in our daily lunches, I believe that our credit default rate is going to be as low as that in Vegas. Do you have anything to say about that, Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's just a great comment in this sense one thing I have been surprised about listening to our credit and premium casino people is how &#x2013; to put it bluntly &#x2013; how important Singapore is in that part of the world to customers from Indonesia and Thailand and Malaysia. I've been taught a lesson just to how critical Singapore is politically, financially, in a lot of ways emotionally, just that's a very important country, city-state. And the customers have a lot of respect for it, and I have been pleased to find that people pay pretty quickly. We haven't had a credit issue yet.</p>
          <p>In fact, I think it is better than Las Vegas in terms of people wanting to pay, and in that part of the world, they come more frequently because that is their region. And they have a lot of respect for that country, and I think that has helped us a lot. And direct credit has been a pleasant surprise thus far to me and I think to our team over there.</p>
          <p>Sheldon referenced the amount of business and the diversity of countries we impact, we draw from. It is growing daily. Korea has been a surprise. Taipei has been a surprise. Indonesia, Malaysia less of a surprise. But to me, the direct credit issue has been really, really feel good to our team, our credit team and the sales team, because it doesn't appear to be an issue. And that, again, it diminishes the importance of the junk rep issue more and more. And that segment honestly it's just to me it is an amazing segment. So Sheldon has already commented the sky is the limit in that segment. I think that segment could be extraordinary for both Genting and us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But my question was on Macau and what your plans are for growing direct there. So am I hearing that you are trying to grow it there? Because I thought, Sheldon, you made a comment that you might pull back. I am just confused.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We may. We are in the process of discussing this amongst senior management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the difference in what you are seeing in Macau versus Singapore is what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Singapore, Singapore is all direct play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that. I guess what I'm hearing is that your direct play in Macau increased nicely sequentially, which is obviously beneficial to you. So I was just wondering if that was going to keep increasing? And you are saying that you are evaluating that now. So I was just wondering why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take it all. I mean the goal of the company obviously is to maximize value, which Sheldon and Mike referenced. When you take all aspects of whether it is direct or to junk rep, the only thing that is intriguing to us is that while the direct play has been very, very strong in showing growth, the real question is how much more we can get out of the junket side. Because the growth has been phenomenal on the junket side. So why not ride both horses if you can, why not anticipate management value &#x2013; what makes the most sense, but in the end why look at both markets? I think what Sheldon is referencing is that direct play is good, junket play is good. If it is profitable, take it all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can make an addendum to that. The idea of getting junket play with the expectation of lower cost has not been completely met amongst the various strata of direct premium player. Some of them are very high, and we may bifurcate part of the direct premium play, keep some and not keep others, because the cost of this is very high. And well, in some cases, it is high. So we are reconsidering as to whether or not it is going to be worth it to keep all strata of direct premium play because we don't want &#x2013; I have seen several analysts report that say, well, the scuttlebutt is that as SCL chases direct premium play, a lot of the players, a lot of the junket reps are bringing their business over to Wynn. Now we don't know that is the case, but if it is the case, we certainly want to reverse that trend. Although I do admit that Wynn does a very good job on the junket reps.</p>

I did see a chart today, and the chart showed that within a very short period of time, just weeks, we could catch up to whatever lag we have. Just goes smack on the original schedule. It's too early for us to tell.</p>

          <p>And then on the hold issue, is there &#x2013; it looks like revenues would have been above your range of normal hold, but I'm just wondering the EBITDA impact, if there is a way to quantify since the commission structure is not something we can calculate based on what you released.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the hold doesn't affect the commission structure because the roll is the roll.</p>

          <p>&#x2013; through junket versus direct, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if the direct &#x2013; we are not satisfied that direct is that much cheaper. And if, in fact, we don't have enough experience in it to save us the credit issues which are different here in Macau than they are in Singapore, it's &#x2013; we don't know yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could tell you that the percentage of drop &#x2013; sorry, the percentage of rolled and the commission that we pay is not impacted by whether we have a larger hold or lower hold. We had that discussion this afternoon. The roll is the roll, and if we hold more, it will be slightly less a roll because somebody will have lost money faster and the opposite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then two other questions. One is, is there a way to quantify in Las Vegas what the impact on group or occupancy in general was from conventions that shifted from Opryland with the flooding in May and what that may have added in sort of May, June, July and anything going forward? Is there any way to quantify the impact of that specifically on your group business?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot speak to the market, Robin, but I think everyone participated somewhat in what happened down there. We added a few significant groups. I don't think it is that material at the end of the day, but it did help the summer. I am going to &#x2013; off the top of my head, I can recall three very decent groups probably representing 25,000 room nights in the summer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, I want to ask you, how do you start a flood?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you &#x2013; very carefully. I think &#x2013; look, unfortunately what happened there did help Las Vegas. I think the whole town &#x2013; we lost some groups to low-rated other competitors in town. I think the overall impact probably was significant for the town. For us I think, if I'm not mistaken, I don't have hard numbers, Robin, but I think it was, like I say, a couple, three or four groups at maybe 25,000 room nights total for the summer. It was good for Las Vegas overall. It was low-rated business. It wasn't high-rated business. It wasn't significant food and beverage, but it certainly added body count and cash, retails, especially when we need it mid-week in summer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of our competitors who were much weaker than we were dropped their rates more significantly than what we were willing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We bid on significant &#x2013; to Sheldon's point, we bid on a significant piece of the business and lost a number of them to people who just cut rates in the double digits. We stayed triple digit, and my recollection it was good. It was 150, 160 a night. It was mid-week, but it wasn't monumental. It was helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just a last question, can you comment on in Singapore your occupancy trends in July, that was 2500 rooms just versus the sort of 50% range occupancy for the June quarter, how that is trending now in July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin, we basically ran about 55% in the quarter for the first 65 days on 900 &#x2013; well -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Averaged around 1200 rooms, which means you are selling about 650, 660 rooms a night. We are averaging a little over that percentage for the first 26 days of July. And so we are selling considerably more rooms because we are open at 2600 rooms basically, about 2400 keys. So we've got about twice the rooms running the same occupancy. So we are selling about 12 to 1300 rooms a night.</p>
          <p>We are ramping up in our leisure business. We started off at about 40 or 50 rooms a night. We are now seeing 250 or 260 coming into that segment. And we've been light on the corporate market, which we fully expected because our concierge lounge in that floor wasn't really done. It will be done in September, and we expect some ramping up there.</p>
          <p>As you note the Singapore occupancy, it came out today, for June was up significantly, 88% in hotels, et cetera in spite of the increased room availability, and rate was up a considerable amount. We really lifted the market in Singapore, and it should be only a few more months until &#x2013; it's really growing every day, not in leaps and bounds, but it is growing every day.</p>
