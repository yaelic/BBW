          <p>Good morning. My name is Felicia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felicia. Good morning. Today, of course, is our first quarter earnings report for the 12 weeks ended November 25.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that these discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week first quarter operating results for the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $0.95 compared to last year's first quarter of $0.73. As was noted in this morning's release, there were two one-time items that hit last year's Q1 results. The first of these was the settlement of an income tax audit at Costco Mexico last year in the first quarter. During that quarter, Costco Mexico recorded an after-tax charge of $24 million. The impact to Costco's net income as a then 50% owner of Costco Mexico was $12 million or $0.03 a share.</p>
          <p>The second item that hit last year's earnings results was a $17 million or $0.04 per share charge to SG&amp;A line for our contributions to the Washington State I-1183 liquor initiative. Excluding these two one-time items from last year's results, last year's $0.73 reported figure would have been $0.79 making this year's $0.95 figure a 20% year-over-year increase.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the first quarter, our 12-week reported comparable sales figures in Q1 showed a 7% increase, 7% in the U.S. and reported 9% internationally. Excluding gas price inflation and the impact of FX, the 7% U.S. comp reported number would've been 6%, the 9% reported international comp would have been 7%; and the 7% overall would have been a 6%.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest, I'll talk about our opening schedule first. We opened nine locations during the first fiscal quarter of 2013, eight in the U.S. and one in Alberta, Canada. By the end of this week, we will have opened in the second quarter five additional locations, one in Washington, D.C., one additional one in Canada, one in the U.K. and one in Korea, which is later this week, giving us 14 new openings thus far in fiscal 2013. For all of 2013, we have a current plan of 30 new locations, 14 of which are planned for the U.S., three each in Canada and the U.K., one in Australia, which will be our fourth in that country, a new one in Mexico, our 33rd location and the first new opening in Mexico in a little over three years, and eight in Asia, including five in Japan, two in Korea and one in Taiwan.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margins and SG&amp;A in the first quarter, stock repurchase activities, which were relatively small, and of course, the two subsequent events, the announcement of a $7 per share special dividend, which will be payable on December 18 and the sale of $3.5 billion of senior notes.</p>
          <p>Okay. On to the discussion of the quarter, again, very briefly, the sales for the year of the 12 weeks ended November 25 were $23.2 billion, up 9.6% from last year's first quarter of $21.2 billion. On a reported comp basis, our first quarter comps were up 7% for the quarter and excluding gas and FX, up 6%; again, comprised of a 6% U.S. without gas and 7% international in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our 7% reported comp result was a combination of an average transaction increase of about 2.5% and an average frequency increase of just under 5%. In terms of sales comparisons by geography, geographically all the regions have been fairly consistent for the past few fiscal quarters, generally in the mid to high single-digit positive range. One outlier was due to Hurricane Sandy hitting the Northeast, comps for the Northeast region in November were lower than it had been running by a couple of percentage points. California has been in the mid-singles positive range; Southeast and Midwest, in the mid to high singles.</p>
          <p>International -internationally in local currencies during the quarter, Costco Canada continued strong, coming in the low double-digits for Q1 and in the mid to high singles in November. Where international sales results are being hit is in Asia in a word, cannibalization. Since Q1 end a year ago, we've opened one unit in Korea, we now have eight there; one unit in Taiwan, which brings us to nine; and four new locations in Japan, so we now have 13 in Japan, so six new openings in the past year on a &#x2013; base a year ago of 24. Additionally in Korea, a few months ago, we like other big-box retailers in Korea are now required to be closed two Sundays a month.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, September, October and November essentially, within Food and Sundries, overall in the 4% to 6% range with candy, deli and refrigerated being the relative standouts. Our hard-line sales were quite a bit stronger as compared to recent quarters. Majors, electronics, came in, in the high teens and hardware in the mid-teens; overall, in the low double digits for hard-lines. Within the low double-digits soft-lines comps, small electrics and women's apparel were the standouts with media being the area of continued weakness. And within fresh foods, its comps have been in the mid to high single-digit range. All subcategories pretty good results.</p>
          <p>Moving down the income statement, in the first quarter, membership fees, $511 million or 2.20%, that's up 14% or nine basis points from the $447 million a year ago, or $64 million increase. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from several things. Certainly, we're still benefiting from the $5 and $10 membership fee increases that began last November in the U.S. and Canada for new sign-ups and this past January for renewals.</p>
          <p>Of the $64 million increase year-over-year in the membership fee income, about $28 million we estimate was due to these increases based on how deferred accounting works. The income statement benefit to the membership income line, as I mentioned before, will continue to show year-over-year &#x2013; incremental year-over-year increases throughout the four fiscal quarters of 2013 and to a partial extent, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we've got new openings that have helped as well as strong renewal rates, rounding up to 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 86% worldwide, and continued increasing penetration of the $110 a year executive membership in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>Our new membership sign-ups in first quarter company-wide kept pace year-over-year with last year's sign-ups. While we did have more locations open in the quarter, nine versus a year ago four, we figure it's pretty good outcome given that there were very strong international openings last year, which contributed to a very large sign-ups in Q1 a year ago. In terms of new members for Q1 end, at fiscal year-end we had 26.7 million Gold Star members, that's up to 27.3 million at Q1 end. Some of that of course is the conversion of some of our business add-ons as they convert into executive member and become their own separate membership. So it's again, 26.7 million became 27.3 million. Primary business, 6.4 million at yearend 6.5 million at Q1 end. Business add-on 3.8 million and down to 3.6 million, again that's related to that conversion, and so all told, 36.9 million and now 37.4 million, including add-on spouse cards, 67.4 million cardholders at the end of Q4, and 68.2 million cardholders 12 weeks later at Q1 end.</p>
          <p>At Q1 end, paid executive members were 12.9 million, an increase of 280,000 or about a 23,000-a-week increase in the quarter. Executive members account for a little over a third of our membership and a little over two-thirds of our sales. So that trend continues as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewal rates, they continue strong at 89.7% at Q1 end in the U.S. and Canada, and 86.4% worldwide. Business was a 93.6% at Q4 end and picked up to a 93.8% at Q1 end. Gold Star remained constant at 88.7%, and total 89.7%, and again, worldwide 86.4%, so continuing strong in all categories. Overall, it certainly appears that the year ago's membership fee increase had a little or no impact on our renewal rates.</p>
          <p>Going down the gross margin line, margins were up 6 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, from a 10.62% last year to a 10.68%. And as usual, we'll just jot down a few numbers; give you a few less this time. We'll make four columns and the line items are as follows &#x2013; and four columns, by the way, would be reported fiscal year 2012 and then fiscal year 2012 without gasoline inflation, and then for the quarter, the same thing, reported Q1 2013 and then without gas inflation. So those would be the four columns.</p>
          <p>Going across core merchandising, for the year, it was minus 21 basis points. Without gas inflation it was minus 13 bps. For Q1, reported was minus 7 bps, and without gas, minus 1 bp. Ancillary, plus 1 bp and plus 2 bps for fiscal 2012 reported and without gas; and in Q1, plus 14 bps and plus 15 bps. 2% reward, minus 2 bps and minus 2 bps, and in the quarter, minus 2 bps and minus 3 bps. LIFO, plus 8 bps and plus 8 bps for last year, and plus 1 bp and plus 1 bp in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>All told, we reported for all of last year a 14% (sic) [14 bps] year-over-year decline in gross margins. But without gas inflation, it was minus 5 bps. In the first quarter we reported plus 6 bps, and without gas inflation it was plus 12 bps. So with that chart in front of you, you can see that our overall gross margin was higher year-over-year by 6 bps, but again up 12 bps without gas inflation. In the first quarter, our core merchandising gross margin again was a minus 7 bps, but only 1 bp basis point lower year-over-year excluding gas inflation. This 1 basis point negative result compares favorably to the previous four fiscal quarter figures, where the year-over-year core merchandising gross margin variances had ranged from minus 10 basis points to minus 16 basis points. And again, as you can see in the chart we just wrote down, for all of last year ranged &#x2013; averaged minus 13 basis points.</p>
          <p>Ancillary business gross margins contributed 14 bps, higher year-over-year gas sales, both in dollars and gallons, and higher year-over-year gross margins in the gasoline business represented about two-thirds of this positive year-over-year gross margin variance. Margins in our Food and Sundries department, which is a little over half of our core merchandise, were up slightly year-over-year in the quarter, while in non-foods, hard-lines was flat year-over-year and soft-lines margins was down &#x2013; were down slightly, as were fresh foods.</p>
          <p>The 2% reward feature, again, just a little extra sales penetration there for a minus 2 basis point reward. That of course would imply about a percentage point increase in sales penetration to those numbers. In LIFO, LIFO, there was no charge or credit last year and there was a very small credit this year of $2 million or 1 basis point implying some minor amount of deflation during the fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentages in the first quarter were lower or better by 7 basis points, coming in at a 10.05% compared to a 10.12% as a percent of sales last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same little chart with the four columns. Two columns for 2012, fiscal 2012 reported and without gas, and then two columns for Q1, reported and without gas. The first line item is core operations. In fiscal 2012, plus 18 bps and then without gas inflation plus 12 bps, meaning lower &#x2013; better or lower by that much. In Q1, plus 10 bps and plus 5 bps.</p>
          <p>Central was a small improvement last &#x2013; for the whole fiscal year of 2012, plus 2 bps and then without gas plus 1 bp. And in Q1, SG&amp;A was higher at central, minus 7 bps and minus 8 bps without gas inflation.</p>
          <p>Equity compensation was minus 1 bp and minus 2 bps for all of last year and minus 4 bps and minus 4 bps in the first quarter, certainly a reflection of both the higher stock price as well as every &#x2013; there are certain recipients that get them every other year and we're trading off a year versus that, when that doesn't happen. All told, plus 17 bps and plus 9 bps for last year. So reported SG&amp;A &#x2013; I'm sorry, excluding quarterly adjustments. Quarterly adjustments was basically that $17 million charge to SG&amp;A last year in the first quarter for I-1183. For all of the year that was at minus 2 bps in the reported fiscal 2012 column and a minus 2 bps without gas inflation. In Q1, it was plus 8 bps and plus 8 bps, so lower year-over-year of course. So a total of plus 7 bps and plus 1 bp; meaning we reported 7 basis points of improvement and without gas inflation plus 1 bp &#x2013; 1 basis point improvement.</p>
          <p>In terms of a little editorial, operations were lower again as you can see in the chart, by 10 basis points but 5 bps excluding gas. Within core operations our payroll as a percent of sales improved year-over-year by 7 basis points and I think for the first time in the few &#x2013; past few quarters we benefited slightly by a 2 basis point improvement in healthcare costs line item.</p>
          <p>Our central expenses were higher year-over-year in Q1 by 7 basis points as you can see, 8 bps without gas. The big culprit there is something I've mentioned in the past few quarters that just continued to increase is the IT modernization costs. We are now in full swing and that represented year-over-year a 7 basis point hit to SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement line is pre-opening expenses. $10 million last year and of course with the ramp-up in expansion, that's $8 million higher this year, and that was 3 basis points to the company but $18 million this year versus $10 million last year. Last year in the quarter, we had four openings and this year of course we had nine, with 5 more just after Q1 end. All told, reported operating income was $543 million compared to &#x2013; last year compared to $639 million this year or an 18% increase. Excluding the $17 million charge for I-1183, operating income last year would have been $560 million or up about 14%.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line reported interest expense was much lower this year versus last year with Q13 &#x2013; Q1 2013 coming in at $13 million versus $27 million in last year's Q1. Virtually all of this is the pay-down &#x2013; represents the pay-down of a $900 million of debt back in March, which we did on an annual basis beginning this past March, the annual pre-tax interest savings to Costco given that we paid off 5.3% debt and we're then forgoing interest at a much lower rate, that's about $44 million pre-tax a year.</p>
          <p>Now, interest income and other in Q1 was much lower year-over-year as well by $17 million, coming in $20 million this year interest income and other and $37 million last year. Actual interest income within that interest income and other was only lower by $1 million coming in at $10 million versus $11 million. The other component of the interest income and other amounted to $10 million this year versus $26 million last year or lower by $16 million.</p>
          <p>Now, $12 million of that negative variance related to a gain last year in the first quarter on U.S. dollars held in our Mexico joint venture because the Mexico venture held U.S. dollars and the &#x2013; during that quarter the peso declined relative to the value of the dollar, its holdings of the U.S. dollar, which is a foreign currency to them required marking that to market and a gain.</p>
          <p>That $12 million of course, half of that gain was ours ultimately since we owned 50% of Costco Mexico at the time. So half of the gain was &#x2013; so all of the gain was in the interest income and other line a year ago; and half of it was down below non-controlling interest as an offset. Most of the remaining year-over-year decrease of approximately $4 million is just a normal swing plus or minus where buyers managing the cost of foreign denominated inventory purchases in our foreign operations, which require at the quarter ends to mark those to market.</p>
          <p>Overall, pre-tax income was up 17% last year from $553 million to $646 million this year; again excluding I-1183 it would've been &#x2013; last year's $553 million would've been $570 million so the increase would've been 13%. In terms of tax rates, our company tax rate this quarter came in at 34.8%, much lower of course than last year's reported rate of 40.8%, but excluding the two items mentioned in the press release our effective tax rate last year was 35.3%, which I think is a more appropriate comparison; still about half a point higher last year than this year and again that reflects mostly the fact of increasing penetration of oversea &#x2013; of earnings outside the U.S. where federal tax rates generally are lower.</p>
          <p>Overall, net income was up 30% as you know, in the press release, excluding those two items in the press release that would've been up 19.</p>
          <p>Now, for a quick rundown of other usual topics, the balance sheet is included in today's press release; depreciation and amortization $213 million for the quarter. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories, reported of course it showed 108% year-over-year and up 5 percentage points from 103% last year. If you just look at merchandise inventory &#x2013; accounts payable compared to merchandise inventories, last year it was 92% and again improved up to 94%, so most of our inventory is trade payable financed.</p>
          <p>Average inventory per warehouse last year in the first quarter was $12,871,000. This year in the first quarter, it was $13,213,000 so up $432,000 or 3%. About $100,000 of that, just under $100,000 of that is FX, strengthening foreign currencies versus the dollar. Another $130,000 is in majors, principally televisions and cameras. We've done very well, as you know, in the monthly sales reports about how our comps in the majors areas have been, and the rest is pretty much spread among many departments.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter, we spent $488 million. Our fiscal 2013 CapEx is estimated to be approximately $2 billion. This compares to CapEx last year of one &#x2013; just under $1.5 billion. Some of this higher annual year-over-year estimated expenditures are due to both the higher penetration of the number of units planned in Asia as well as anticipated higher ramp of total openings scheduled for Q1 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Also I want to mention our dividends, regular dividend, our quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share quarterly; this $1.10 per share annualized dividend represents total cost to the company of just about $480 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, as you know, last year, we opened 16 units, 17 openings and one &#x2013; including one relocation. So 16 net openings. For this year, we've, as I mentioned, opened nine new units with no relos &#x2013; actually there's no relos all year. So in Q1, we opened nine, and in Q2 with the opening later this week in Korea we will open &#x2013; have opened five more, so 14 total. We planned three &#x2013; seven for Q3 and nine for Q4 and that would give us our 30. Certainly, we're going to get north of 25 and if one or two of those slip, so be it. But that's our current budget is 30.</p>
          <p>So in fiscal 2012 the 16 new units we added on a then base of &#x2013; a beginning base of 592 represented 3% square footage growth and 13 adding 30 on a base of the 608 that we began this fiscal year is about 5% square footage growth. And again, that includes 14 in the U.S., 3 each in Canada and the U.K., 2 in Korea, 1 in Taiwan, 5 planned for Japan, 1 in Australia and 1 in Mexico. As of Q1, our total square footage ended at 88.259 million square feet, which represents an average of just over 145,000 feet per Costco warehouse.</p>
          <p>In terms of stock repurchase during the quarter, for &#x2013; basically for &#x2013; as you recall, for all of fiscal 2012 we had purchased 7.3 million shares for a total of a little over $600 million. This year in the first quarter, we repurchased 357,000 shares at an average price of $96.41 and that represented about $35 million.</p>
          <p>Mind you that during the 12 weeks, there were only about three weeks that we actually purchased stock. For the first five or six weeks between the beginning of the fiscal quarter and through the day after of first quarter earnings announcement and I think the second week in December, we essentially were locked into a previous 10b5-1 filing and the stock had moved above that metrics, so we weren't buying and of course once we decided to do a special dividend we held off on buying during the last few weeks of the quarter as well. So if I looked at the days we actually bought on an annualized basis it was in excess of $500 million on an annualized basis but who knows what that brings for the future.</p>
          <p>And lastly, the two subsequent events, two weeks ago on November 28, we announced the declaration of a $7 a share special cash dividend. This dividend will be paid on December 18 to people who own the stock on the close of business on December 10. In total, the dividend represents return to our shareholders of just over $3 billion. By the way, in connection with the Costco shares held by our employees in the 401(k) Plan, which totals approximately 22.6 million shares, these shares are held through an employee stock ownership plan that had been established several years ago and dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. So we will recognize a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $62 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2013 in connection with the dividend payable on December 18.</p>
          <p>Also on November 28, we announced the completion of a $3.5 billion public debt offering in the form of senior notes. The notes were issued amongst three tranches; three-year, $1.2 billion worth; five-year, $1.1 billion; and seven-year, $1.2 billion. Given the weighted average maturity of five years, our all-in annual rate of interest came in just under 1.25%, so we believe extremely attractive financing.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it back over to Felicia. As you know, later this morning, there will be a supplemental information pack, which includes some useful stats, and that will be posted to the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning. Felicia?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Richard, a couple of things. What are your merchants now saying about reflation in 2013? It seems like it may be less than we originally thought, but there's &#x2013; still would seem there are some price increases coming down the pike. What's their thought and what's your thought in terms of what you put in the budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the buyers are the ones that more put in the budget, but in polling the buyers just yesterday actually, the ones &#x2013; the area that stands out would be components of fresh foods, notably protein, beef, poultry and pork. The view there is there is still additional mid to high single-digit inflation expected over the next six to nine months. Beyond that, it's hit and miss. There's &#x2013; if I look at our LIFO statistics as an indication, apparel is down ever so slightly year-over-year, but that's partly because it was up a lot last year, so it's coming off of its peak, so it's still probably higher than a few years ago. So I would say the overall view aside from electronics being down slightly per like item, but actually our average price points are up a little, I believe, because we've tended to go towards higher-end, like 60-inch and 80-inch TVs and more SLR cameras &#x2013; DSLR cameras and the like.</p>
          <p>But just looking down the list of some unusual items, again, tuna looks like it's come up a little a little bit, canned tuna. As I mentioned, beef is up some. There is always going to be some ups and downs on produce just based on supplies. Grapes are drama &#x2013; and blueberries are dramatic right now higher year-over-year, but I'm sure it's weather-related not anything else related. And on the downside, when I scan the list of the top 20 or 30 items here, most of them are electronics with a few other things. I mean just anecdotally, pecans and walnuts. But I know a year ago again, they were way up. So if you put it all in, my guess is that gas, who the heck knows; fresh foods, inflationary; the rest of it, kind of a wash at this point, nothing up or down a lot.</p>

          <p>Hi, Richard. Congrats on the quarter. I want to ask a little bit about the core merchandising margin only down one basis point ex-gas, is there any change there or can you really point to what was going on there to keep that number muted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I mean as we've always said for many quarters, margins are more us than anybody else. No. It's pretty much as you see it. It's a little better. I don't think we started the quarter saying let's get a little better or let's get that trend back to zero, but that's where it ended up. We're trying to do both, drive business and make money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you seen an uptick in your private label penetration or anything like that that might be contributing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean we continue to add products, everything from some wine and spirits to canned goods and all kinds of nut and candy items. So I'd say nothing dramatic. The big dramatic number came in the first half of calendar 2009 after the financial crisis where we saw an unusually large increase in sales penetration of private label. I think on the Food and Sundry side over six months back then it was like 300 basis points. But generally we see 0.5% to 0.75% a year, and I'm not aware of anything that is different than that right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Greg with ISI. Richard, one question on SG&amp;A and then CapEx, what really drove that central increase, is that some of the modernization impacts or getting the website up and running in the new format? Or what should we call out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I look at IT costs as a percent of sales year-over-year, they were up seven basis points. My guess is a half of a basis point might be re-platforming. Maybe another half a basis point or whole basis point is normal increase in IT. But clearly, five plus of it is modernization and that's probably has trended up a little extra year-over-year over the last few quarters, and will probably peak this year and then it'll be anniversarying against itself each year, over the next three or four years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As it anniversaries, do you expect it to go back to zero or do you actually cycle it and it becomes a year-over-year down or good guy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it's going to go down for two or three years. These things take on a life of their own, but it'll be a lot less than five to seven basis points. I mean I would hope, again, we haven't budgeted that detail that far out, but I would hope it's zero to two not five to seven next year. And by the way, regarding the prior question as it related to Black Friday, I just was looking the &#x2013; that week on a year-over-year basis frequency was still darn close to 4%, just below 4%. So, pretty consistent with what we've seen all over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. If I could follow up on the CapEx front, I know it's going up, because we're having more club opening. Could you help us on the international openings and how many of those you actually build and own the store as opposed to lease it? I imagine it's less when you go overseas than the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that detail in front of me. I can tell you that when we look at the average location cost, which might be on average over the last couple of years company-wide in the mid-30s, it tends to be a shade lower than that in the U.S. and Canada and higher and it might be in the 40s on average over like, let's say, in Asia. But we've done a couple of that are in the low 50s, and I would assume we'll continue to do that. In Korea, we tend to do more ground leases. In Japan, we tend to own. In Taiwan, I think we tend to &#x2013; it's a combination, so ground leases as well. Australia, I think we own. And Mexico, we own. And U.K. we own and in Canada and the U.S., we generally own 80% plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the ownership rate doesn't seem to change dramatically if we look international or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, particularly because we tend to &#x2013; right now, at least we're tending to open, like, in Asia, more in Japan than in Korea and Taiwan, where we tend to own more than lease.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And next just lastly a follow-up on gross margin. I think you mentioned in hard lines gross margins were flat. I'm just surprised on that especially given the strength of electronics, was there anything else going on in there that could have impacted it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's &#x2013; not really. I mean, I think, sales were strong. But in terms of the outright gross margin year-over-year, look, there's a lot of hot deals over there. I didn't really read anything into that. There's not a lot &#x2013; we've certainly improved on our returns over the last years as we changed our returns policy in electronics to 90 days instead of infinity. But I haven't &#x2013; in terms of &#x2013; anecdotally, in the last few budget meetings, there's not been nothing &#x2013; there hasn't been anything coming out of there in terms of any issues in electronics or hard lines.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. It's actually Matt for Chuck. Most of my questions have been answered. I was just wondering if you could kind of flush out your comments about the cannibalization you're seeing in Asia and kind of where that is relative to what you expected, and what you think is going to happen kind of going forward as you continue to open up? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I mean, it's as we expected. I mean, as an example, I think in Taiwan, we opened North Kaohsiung, which of course took a bunch of business from Kaohsiung. In Japan, and earlier this year we opened in &#x2013; reopened Tamasakai, which was the one unit that was &#x2013; that had been closed for about 10 months or 11 months from the tragedy of the earthquake. Essentially, all of that business went to two or three nearby Costcos and when I say nearby, half an hour away and the day it reopened that unit is not comping because it hadn't done any sales over the last year, but it took all that business out of the other two. So on top of regular cannibalization, we had extreme cannibalization in that one. So all that's &#x2013; that was in March. That'll subside in this March, but nonetheless, we're opening a bunch of units over there, so that'll continue as we expect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just a follow up, in terms of the Northeast you said it was obviously weak, given Sandy. Have you seen a recovery kind of take hold and are we back to normal in this area yet?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks, Richard. Just a quick follow-up on Asia cannibalization, looks like the comps in international ex-currency were running kind of at a 10% range for all of fiscal 2011 and the first half of fiscal 2012. And then the last few quarters, in the 7% range. Is that entirely explainable by cannibalization and can you quantify what that cannibalization impact is in total on the international business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a big chunk of it is. I don't have all that detail in front of me. But if I look at Japan in local currency as an example, I mean, it's easily from &#x2013; I don't have the exact &#x2013; I don't have &#x2013; know what it was running &#x2013; I'm sure it's running in the low double digits. And of late, it's in the high single negative digits and if you look at it, and we've opened four units in the last year. And whether that impact &#x2013; those units, those new units aren't in the calculation yet. And so half of the previous units or almost half of the previous units are being cannibalized and two of them extremely cannibalized, because of &#x2013; you've had a high-volume Tamasakai unit, existing location that had been closed for 11 months, and all those customers came back to their home base.</p>
          <p>So we don't &#x2013; and then again, there's the anomaly in Korea of having to be closed for two Sundays a month. If you just do simple math, it's 1/15, that's 6% or 7% of the days. You don't lose it all, but you certainly lose some or half of it, or who knows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then back in the U.S., how many clubs that don't have a gasoline station can still be converted at this point and where are you on that entire path?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the U.S., we have about 440 locations, I could be off one or two, and I think about 70 of them don't have gas. My guess without looking in detail is that half of them ultimately can have gas and half of them will never have gas. We're never going to have a gas station at 11th in Harrison and San Francisco, or in Brooklyn. Just they're landlocked and forget about it. And I'm sure there'll be some that we're working on, I don't have the list in front of me, and there'll be others that we'll relocate. So probably a best guess is over the next five to eight years, half of those 70. And my guess is, is when we open new ones, virtually all of them do, there'll always be one outlier, but virtually all of them have gas stations, as is in Canada. Now in Canada, we have &#x2013; hold on, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:22). In Canada, we have 83 locations; 38 of them have gas, so 45 of them don't, recognizing we've only been in gas in Canada for the last few years. So again, my guess is, is that two-thirds of those that don't have it, will have it over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is. He's asking is the $20 million that we had &#x2013; hold on, I got to look real quick. When I looked at interest income and other, hold on a second, okay, now $10 million was investment income and $10 million, it's mostly equity and earnings of &#x2013; hold on &#x2013; I just need the variance, hold on. Basically, it's about $8 million or $9 million of FX-related stuff, but by comparison, it's within $0.5 million of year ago, so no change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the SG&amp;A leverage, you obviously pointed out payroll and healthcare. Just wondering how sustainable you think that might be throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always &#x2013; certainly, payroll depends &#x2013; I mean, I think we've certainly shown that we've focused a little more on expenses and payroll, and that's &#x2013; we've gotten it down. But certainly, sales are a big part of that as well and increased penetration outside the U.S. where payroll percentages as a percent of sale are lower to start with. Our $20.50 average hourly wage in the U.S. is a third to 60% of that number in other countries and close to it in Canada, of course, and a couple countries as well. But so that helps increasing penetration. On the healthcare, I think if we got a couple basis points, it's probably more related to sales being stronger and getting it down a little back to flat without it. So, it's still hit and miss there. Several components of all the new healthcare legislation, which have kind of hit each year incrementally a little more, I think we're nearing the end of that, so a lot of that stuff, if you will, is in there by the end of this year, at the end of next year, rather. So, I can't predict that it's a trend by any means yet.</p>

          <p>Yeah, other than that, I mean, I think the number in that 35% range. On an overall basis, somewhere in the 35%, maybe a shade higher, but the trend line if international's penetration continues, which we do, would see that again, trending down ever so slightly, certainly all things being equal.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Richard. One thing that really stands out for me with Costco versus other discounters is that the comp growth is very consistent for you across the product categories, so not just food and consumables but also very strong in general merchandise. So can you expand on what you think you're doing differently or better, especially in hard lines and majors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; yeah, I'd give you a different reason for some different categories. From the beginning of time, we've always known we could be strong in foods and fresh foods and the key is how do you &#x2013; and those are fast turning areas. So how do you turn the bigger ticket non-food items because you don't have to add more square footage for it. If you can get something that's turning six and eight times up to nine and ten, that's good in bigger ticket items. So we've always focused on that. I think of late, if I think of electronics, certainly our strength in 60-inch and 80-inch TVs, the bigger, higher-quality TVs, that's helped us, clearly getting people in the door via gas and fresh foods and having them walk by those types of things.</p>
          <p>I think in apparel, certainly we've made a conscious bigger commitment in several of those areas over the last year, year and a half. I think I'd use the example last quarter, something as simple as like the men's wool Kirkland Signature pants, which I think we tested a couple years ago with 100,000 units and last year 200,000 units and this year a million units at $60 or so a pair and they're doing well. And so not only are we making a decent margin on the KS shirt, we've gone from just a standard one to a couple of different styles with a spread collar and a &#x2013; and so we're up to a 4-plus million KS shirts. So overall, making some bigger commitments. Jewelry is strong and not just because some of the prices of components have gone up, but jewelry has been pretty good of late.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. New member sign-ups, I'm assuming benefited during the first quarter due to the rise in gas prices during the summer, especially in California. I mean to what degree did that &#x2013; was that material? And then gas prices have come down, might that slow member sign-ups in the periods ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think a lot of it relates to that. I mean yes, a little bit of it when we get somebody &#x2013; when a newscaster talks about it in a given market, certainly that helps. When I looked at the numbers, on a base of about 1.3 million new sign-ups in each of the fiscal &#x2013; prior two fiscal quarters, again, when I talked about Australia and Japan last year, which opened near the end of &#x2013; very &#x2013; just before Q1 2012 a year ago and into Q2 2012 Japan, a couple of units, just those two markets represented almost 90,000 fewer sign-ups year-over-year because of the huge sign-ups we had in those markets during these six or eight weeks prior to opening and then they're booked as of opening day. So that again dwarfed anything else. And in fact that we were flat year-over-year given 90,000 less in those few locations is pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. My final question is previously you'd indicated 27 to 30 new clubs as your plan for this year. This morning, you said in your prepared remarks 30. Is there anything I should read into that? I mean do you have higher visibility now for this year or is that &#x2013; should I perceive it to be the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think earlier in the year, probably a quarter ago, I talked about 25 to 27. Again if pushed, I'd probably say 27 to 29, but 30 is our budget and they're all doable, there is always the chance that a couple will fall out, but I think we're getting more confident of those numbers. So if my single point estimate was 27 or 26, now it's 28 or 29.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Costco (sic) [Jefferies].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Dan Binder with Jefferies. I had a couple of questions. First, on the membership growth, what do you think we should see given, I guess, the extraordinary sign-ups per club last year? What do you think average sign-ups per club should look like this year for the 30 or so stores that you're opening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have &#x2013; haven't looked at it that way. And our membership's not here but it ranges again, some of these locations overseas can be &#x2013; and again when I say opening day sign-ups, it's anything that was signed, any paid member sign-ups during the six or eight weeks prior to opening when they've got the tabling activities outside of the construction site through opening day. And in the U.S., in very strong Southern California markets that we're plopping the unit in, where we have a bunch of members already, it's just moving around where they shop and more &#x2013; shopping more frequently, because they're closer to a location. We might have 3,000 to 6,000 as of opening day, and another 5,000 to 10,000 or 8,000 to 12,000 over the next 12 months that first year.</p>
          <p>In a new market, a small new market like a Tennessee or a Carolina unit, we might have 4,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 new sign-ups in the first day, as of that first day, which is more than a high-volume LA unit when we open it. But again, it has <mark type="ph" /> no more to do than that (48:55). Again, over in Asia, we see numbers in the 25,000 to 50,000 range as of the opening &#x2013; through opening day, and so well over the company average for all members per warehouse, which is in the high 50,000s &#x2013; I mean for all warehouses that have been opened, whether they've been opened a week or 29 years. So there's no right number there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if we look at existing clubs, how does the new member growth rate look like in existing or comp clubs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the end of the day, I don't &#x2013; again, I don't have that level of detail right in front of me but when I've looked at it in the past, if our renewal rate is just under 90% let's say, in the U.S. and Canada and just call it 90% for a moment for simplicity. We lost 10 and we gained 11. I mean it's always up a little bit more by &#x2013; just a little bit more than it was at the beginning of the year and that of course is cannibalized a little bit when we open in an existing market a little bit. But then those new sign-ups in those new markets help us. So it's a lot of &#x2013; there is no major trend changes if you take out cannibalizing units and take out some of the crazy high numbers in some of the new Asia units or the like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my last question was on SG&amp;A, 7% comp, impressive. You've got sort of flattish SG&amp;A year-over-year rate. As we look forward, do you think that because of the accelerated store openings this year that to get leverage on SG&amp;A going forward this year, we need to be at 6% or 7% or do you think you can achieve it at somewhat lower levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there are a couple of things. Again, I see my guess will continue for these next few quarters. What I did mention there is always four or five miscellaneous line items that generally should add up to zero, some a little higher, some a little less. If I look in the quarter, I think there &#x2013; if I added up those types of things, it hit us by 2 basis points or 3 basis points in the quarter versus being zero or helping us by a basis point. So there is always going to be those things. I would think that's on average zero, not minus 2 or 3, as it was this quarter. Again, I &#x2013; when I look at, I was pleased that payroll which is payroll benefits are 70% of SG&amp;A. The fact that we have increasing penetration overseas that helps us a little bit just because it is on average lower SG&amp;A, but again offset that probably for the next year in Japan, as an example where we're cannibalizing the heck out of it.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much and congratulations on a great quarter. So, Richard, obviously with the 30 clubs that you're targeting at this point in the game, it's very different from what we've seen in the recent past. Can you talk about the difference in real estate process to get those 30 clubs open in one year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we put a lot more people on the ground and in countries. If I go &#x2013; we've been working a long time and I know it was forever before we even got to perform in terms of how many we say we're going to do and we actually do. But if I look back three years ago, two, three years ago as an example between Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia, all of that real estate activity was done with no real estate people on the ground &#x2013; none of our real estate people on the ground in those countries. We now have one to two people in each of those countries. Same thing with Europe, same &#x2013; we've always had it pretty much in the U.S. and Canada. So &#x2013; and the pipeline is more full. So again, as the pipeline &#x2013; as the time get to opening in some of these countries are more difficult and take a little longer anyway, we've got &#x2013; we've built up the pipeline. So I think there'll be more confidence in the next few years of how many we can open based on the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of looking at the 5% increase in frequency in the quarter, most retailers have been talking about traffic as being a major issue. Can you provide some additional color around your strong traffic numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the five &#x2013; my guess is, by the way, this &#x2013; these months are a little strange for a couple of reasons. One, we had a 53-week fiscal year, so it ended like on the September 2 instead of late August. So how did that affect Labor Day a little bit? Same thing at the other end of the quarter of, I think, Thanksgiving was a week off and in terms of dating, so all those things are in that number. My guess is is that getting being just below 5% and I mean just below 5%, is there a half a point in there or a little more of it could have been just how all these things ran? Possibly. So, I'm not banking on a plus 5% but certainly that gives me comfort that our high 3s to low 4s that we've seen, 3.5% to 4.5%, hopefully that'll continue. There's nothing that we see that should change that until it changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other point is, as I've said over the years, the good news is it's a lot of little things; it's everything from the membership base and the demographics, certainly gas and fresh foods, certainly big screen TVs, I mean there's lots of different things that we've been blessed by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you called out hard line sales as being quite a bit stronger as compared to recent quarters. Was that &#x2013; and you called out several specific categories, what &#x2013; was there any kind of key there or was it quite broad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was broad recognizing what we call majors is a big category within hard lines, and cameras, and TVs and the like. Jewelry is not a big percentage category, but had decent numbers. So again, that was across the board. I think also even in some of the little things when we bring in items within the furniture category, we've tended to do well with them and certainly on the soft line side, as I mentioned in apparel, that's been a help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So part of it is our aggressiveness in some of these categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly just can you give some color on how new clubs are performing in markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, what's the last part of that?</p>
