          <p>Welcome to the ASML 2008 Second Quarter Results Conference Call on July 16, 2008. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig DeYoung. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jose. Good morning and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at ASML. I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2008 second quarter results. Hosting the call today is ASML's CEO, Eric Meurice; and CFO, Peter Wennink. For your information, Eric and I are joining the call from San Francisco, California. I mention this in case there are any technical difficulties and we get separated from the call, we will rejoin the call as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement contained within today's press release and presentation. And you can find our Q2 results, press release and the presentation on our website at www.asml.com. The length of the call will be 60 minutes.</p>
          <p>Now at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for attending our Q2 2008 results conference call. Peter and I would like to say a few things about the quarter before we open up the call to questions. Peter will start with a review of our Q2 financial performance, with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with our assessment of the current environment and some details on our longer-term view. Following the introduction, we will open the call to questions.</p>
          <p>Now, Peter, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. First of all, I would like to review the highlights of our second quarter results. The second quarter ended on the high side of the expectations, with revenues of 844 million euros on shipments of 39 systems, 16 of which were immersion systems.</p>
          <p>The second quarter ASP for all systems was 18.6 million euros, making this another record ASP quarter which is due to the success of the ASML immersion systems.  40% gross margin along with operating expenses of 186 million euros resulted in operating margin on the quarter of 17.8% versus 20.5% in the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>We booked 33 systems in Q2, 29 of which were new, and as guided at the time of the Q1 results, this represents a gradual increase over Q1's order intake of 26 units, and as predicted, a significant increase in order value, which brings the Q2 bookings value to 632 million euros versus 312 million in the first quarter. That leaves the total system backlog value for the end of the quarter at 1.1 billion euro.</p>
          <p>The second quarter orders were heavily dominated by orders for 20 immersion systems. These requirements came largely from memory customers with an emphasis on Japan.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we anticipate the immersion bookings in the third quarter to be comparable to Q2, driven by essential technology transitions that are underway at flash and DRAM manufacturing. Even though the demand for immersion systems remains very robust, the current macroeconomic weakness that reflects on our customers may be forcing them to postpone non-leading edge capacity additions.</p>
          <p>This is true in most applications making it difficult for us to guide the orders for non-leading edge systems in Q3. Now, in case of a situation where these systems, these non-leading edge systems would not be ordered, we would likely see an impact on our Q4 shipments. And this means that the previously announced 2008 sales decrease of 10% could potentially end up being as much as 20% decrease.</p>
          <p>On the positive side though, it appears that the effective utilization at all of our customers remains high. Chip inventories are at a moderate level and will to invest in the latest technology remains strong.</p>
          <p>Our customers will resume ordering additional production capacity when they regain a higher level of confidence in the economic situation which includes a healthier pricing environment for the memory devices.</p>
          <p>The timing and size of such a rebound remains unclear and although we do not exclude that this could happen in the course of the second half of this year. I think a striking example of our customers' cautious stance at this moment is the fact that our two leading foundry customers are completely absent in our order book with the effective utilization at high levels. This has never happened before.</p>
          <p>In Q3, we plan to ship 37 systems, slightly less than the 39 systems in Q2, but with an average selling price of 15.6 million euros versus the 18.6 million euro ASP in Q2. The ASP decrease is simply due to the product mix in the quarter, which means a higher mix of used tools versus immersion systems as compared to Q2. This level of sales was anticipated at the time of our Q1 order intake when we estimated the impact on this on our 2008 sales number.</p>
          <p>Now, on the lower Q3 sales number, our gross margin for the quarter will be approximately 38%, as we will experience a lower coverage of our fixed manufacturing cost. As mentioned in Q1, given the current market weakness, we plan to trim manufacturing and SG&amp;A cost for the second half, while keeping R&amp;D stable at the current levels. Therefore, R&amp;D is planned at 130 million euros and SG&amp;A will decrease to 52.</p>
          <p>As was also mentioned, we posted a net tax benefit in the quarter, which resulted from a release of tax provisions after we concluded some long standing discussions with the Dutch tax authorities. And these discussions focused on amongst all things, the treatment of taxable income relating to ASML's patents portfolio. These concluded discussions have led to a benefit booked in the second quarter and will also result in a structurally lower effective income tax rate in the coming years, decreasing to an estimated 20% annual tax charge.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, we remain cautious against the backlog of global economic weakness and a difficult pricing environment in the memory market. However, we are also confident that lithography demand will resume its secular growth plan when overall economic uncertainty decreases because no excess lithography capacity is currently being built and necessary technology transitions are progressing well.</p>
          <p>Now, as a last comment, we almost seem to forget amidst all the doom in the gloom of today that ASML is a very healthy company. We are growing market share. We are robustly profitable and we are generating more than sufficient cash in a very tough environment. That's something that we are very proud of.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn back to Eric for an outline of our technology progress, which is the key behind ASML's robustness.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Peter. So, Peter has highlighted the fact that we again posted those strong sales for the ninth consecutive quarter. We are arguably doing better than our competitors or peers in terms of sales decline this year, even if the market for capacity tool stalls as a result of the fear of recession.</p>
          <p>This is a testament again as Peter said to ASML's strong position in support of technology transitions, resulting in high system average selling prices and a continuous market share growth. So, I'd like to spend a bit of time on talking about the fundamentals of the business in spite of the fact that we may be going into recession because what makes the difference is the technology strength of the company.</p>
          <p>The first issue, the first thing I'd like to underline is our immersion business. The immersion business continues to show significant strength as we shipped 16 systems this quarter. We took an additional 20 immersion orders, leaving 27 systems in our backlog at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We have shipped 30 systems year-to-date and have now more than 100 immersion systems delivered to over 20 individual customers worldwide. We are well on our way as we guided multiple numbers of times; we are on our way to near doubling our immersion revenue in 2008 versus 2007.</p>
          <p>To maintain our competitive lead in immersion, we have unveiled a week ago, I think this week, our new TWINSCAN XT:1950 immersion lithography system which is the latest addition to our proven family of immersion systems that includes the XT:1900 and the XT:1700.</p>
          <p>With the 1950, we are increasing the performance of our current world leading system by 25%, a very large number, thereby making immersion lithography increasingly affordable for 55 nanometer and for 45 nanometer processes.</p>
          <p>This tool is also the only tool capable of supporting the development and the volume production implementation of the next node, particularly the 32 nanometer node with its unique 1.35 NA and sub 4 nanometer overlay specification. There is no matching competitive tools in existence or either announced that can do this.</p>
          <p>Thanks to this product development, in particular again in immersion, our market share in Japan is continuously increasing in the memory and non-memory segments. Since early 2007, we have shipped more immersion tools in Japan than our competition and have won two new customer applications there this quarter alone. The systems for these new, two new logic applications we'll ship in Q4.</p>
          <p>Beyond immersion, we achieved significant breakthroughs in our extreme ultraviolet that is EUV program as the productivity of our EUV Alpha Demo Tool is now reaching targeting focus and as light source suppliers are confirming roadmaps enabling system performance well beyond 100 wafers per hour.</p>
          <p>This is a significant performance which has created additional momentum in the market for deliveries of the first pre-production tools in 2010 with production runs anticipated already for 2011. We expect to be well ahead of competition, when the market, I would say even again when the market transitions to EUV.</p>
          <p>During this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, we plan to keep, as Peter said, our R&amp;D investment at the current level, which is also a testament of what we think about the depth of the potential recession, while we plan to accelerate our operational efficiency program. Indeed the current business environment including the strength of the euro foresees our customers to push for better pricing obviously.</p>
          <p>The price pressures will be dealt with through accelerated manufacturing and SG&amp;A cost reduction, which you have already seen, using our embedded labor flexibility and supplier base efficiency programs as well as value enhancing system performance of grades including the TWINSCAN H version  on one hand, a completely new architecture on the other hand, which will be introduced early in 2009 and the introduction of our lithography enabler library resulting mainly from Brion Technologies.</p>
          <p>So, after brushing inside our technology progress in Q2, I think Peter and I are now ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. Beforehand I'd like to kindly ask you to limit your questions to one with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get in as many callers as possible. Jose, could we have your instructions please and then the first question?</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Menon. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Janardan from Dresdner Kleinwort. Two questions or a short follow-up the second one is I promise you. You talked about accelerated price pressure. Would you have any intention of increasing the level of discounts beyond what you've given in the past in order to secure business? Or would that be &#x2013; I mean ASML has always had a policy of not bending down to price pressure and giving much discount. Would that policy be maintained in the future as well? And my follow-up is if you have &#x2013; you have been taking in quite strong immersion lithography orders even though you don't have much visibility on the dry orders. Can you give us a feel for what kind of increase in immersion shipments you can see next year at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Janardan, thank you. On the price pressure, the reason why we mentioned this is that because in any recession or in any market environment where the volume is not there, there is always a price pressure. This time we have also a, I would say profit pressure from most of our memory customers. So, profit pressure will always result in the customers putting pressure on every supplier. So, it's not a lithography issue. So, the way to react to this is well, as I said in my little introduction is twofold. One, obviously we have to give value to our customers, so when they have genuine reason for the price pressure due to the fact that there is not enough value generated, then we have to give away. I would not say we give away discount; I say we develop products which are more cost-effective. You've heard in my speech that we can be more cost-effective further by improving on our cost structure, but also improving on the product itself.</p>
          <p>And then what we also do which is why you have seen this acceleration of the, I would say, call it cannibalization of our products by bringing new versions. We accelerate the introduction of new products with more value to them.</p>
          <p>The XT:1950 (sic) [XT:1950i] is an enormous improvement. It is about 15-ish% cheaper, very clearly if you've seen the press release, but in addition it is another 10% better in value, you can shrink more. So you got a significant value generation option here, which solves the problem or addresses the problem of the customer price pressure.</p>
          <p>And if that's not sufficient, we have the product, the next generation TWINSCAN which comes early next year which is another leapfrog to this. So, in other terms, we recognize price pressure, we recognize price pressure due to the customers having difficulties and we are addressing this with products which are significantly better. In fact, our R&amp;D investment is showing.</p>
          <p>The second bit is the immersion business for 2009. I think you have got two questions in that. It's not only the immersion business, it's the whole of 2009. Everybody is waiting to see how 2009 is going to develop. And in fact, I think we should be, at this moment, optimistic because of the following two things. One is, we just said that we are not seeing at this moment any capacity orders. We are only seeing immersion and with the immersion we are still developing a sales level, which is, we say, appropriate. But the fact that there is no capacity order at this moment means that if and when the economy starts to pick up, we're going to have an enormous wave of capacity order.</p>
          <p>I mean, you read the statistics from analysts that says there is, however, still in the semiconductor industry some unit growth and this is happening. But when the unit growth will get back to a level of 10% or so after the recession or when after the recession the industry gets more confidence we fear, with pleasure by the way, that there could be a significant pickup and we are in fact preparing ourselves for this possibility in 2009. So, in other terms we are confident that the business pick-up will be will be larger than expected because at this moment there is no capacity being dealt.</p>
          <p>Now to answer your question on immersion, immersion will be a big business in 2009. We do not know if there is a &#x2013; what is the multiplying factor but we know it's going to be a big business for two reasons. One, the new technology, the new nodes in DRAM at 55 nanometers at this moment is just started at two players only. And every other DRAM players will have to be 55 nanometers. This is the rule of the game, recession or not. When the two leaders have 55, the other one have to have 55. So, we are going to have significant amount of business and it's probably more than 60% of the DRAM business. Customers will have to have it and at this moment they haven't. So, we expect that to be a major driver.</p>
          <p>The second driver is the usual Flash. As you know, Flash today is having some difficulty because of the end volume which is not great. But at this moment they are not building a lot of capacity and again they will need to build 45 nanometer capacity, in particular the guys who are not yet in this business. And this is again probably, I would say, at least 30 to 40% of the market share in Flash is not yet in this 45 nanometer node.</p>
          <p>Then the third engine is what's beyond 45 nanometer in Flash, what's beyond 55 nanometer in DRAM and what is the logic 45 nanometer immersion ramp. This is going to be also significant in particular that for some of those nodes we are going to talk about double patterning. And double patterning means double numbers of tools to process the same amount of wafers. So, in other terms, there is a multiplier in immersion business for 2009. A bit too early to talk about, but it's going to be significant.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric and just a clarifying comment, when you said 15% cheaper than 1950 is of course meant not that the tool price is 15% cheaper but that we have 15% more throughput which actually makes the cost for our customers 15% cheaper?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. It's Andrew Gardiner from Lehman Brothers. I was just interested in a bit more detail on the backlog composition at the moment. Firstly, of what, what is there, in terms of the memory names and just how you feel about the tier 2 guys coming through in the third quarter of this year, third and fourth quarters of this year potentially, particularly around some of the delays that you'd cited earlier in the year?</p>
          <p>And then finally on the foundry side which clearly is not in the backlog at the moment. What are the conversations that you are having there with those guys given that, as you pointed out, utilization is high and perhaps, sort of, the frequency with which those conversations are going on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay good. Thank you. Peter, you may want to take this statistics stuff and then I can give some color customer wise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you said the, the backlog composition, it's in the terms, of course it's shown in the presentation that we lumped that together, which is on slide 27 of the presentation. The end-use 65% memory and 8% foundry which I said clearly does not include the two biggest foundry customers that we have, which was by the way for the first time in the history of the company that we don't have those two in the backlog.</p>
          <p>Which actually pretty high utilization there. The IDM 27% and then we split the memory business, it is 50-50 DRAM and flash in the backlog. So we're going to go into the customers details clearly but it's really spot on 50-50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to give some color, the reason why we've said today that we will oscillate between minus 10% and minus 20% in worst case situations, is because there is a wait-and-see attitude about putting bookings for capacity orders.</p>
          <p>And this is happening in most of the segments, even in the segments which have significant volume growth like the Logic segment. Even in the segment the different players, foundry in particular are saying, let's see how the world economy is developing before we put the orders. And this is, I would say, the same on DRAM where those people are waiting for the price of the chips to be firming up. As you know it has been firming up in DRAM so far, but firming up with a, I would say, single-digit type numbers. It would be more comfortable for them if it is double-digit. Flash, they are waiting for the end product to move up a bit, which is most of them is consumer driven, so it is most of them H2 rather than H1. But a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
          <p>So, we have that all over the place, which is not bad. It doesn't mean that the business is disappearing. It means that the business is taking its time to gauge their future. So, that is why I said we are seeing the possibility of a fairly steep ramp-up. At the moment, uncertainty would weaken or disappear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would like to add to that Eric that if you look at the utilization of our tools, in every segment, memory, IDM but also clearly foundry for all our tools we are at utilization levels we have never seen before which actually means that customers are dealing with clearly the end growth demand in terms of units by sweating their assets. And that's very, very visible. So I think that is also gives them a little bit of breathing space to actually say we can afford to wait and see approach now. Since all of them are at record utilization levels and that has a natural limit, like Eric said. There must be a moment in time where that doesn't work anymore. You cannot sweat the assets any further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Nicolas Gaudois. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's Nick Gaudois from UBS. First question is on the behavior of clients you're seeing currently, I mean, obviously you had some economies as you said. Your order guidance for Q3 is reasonably vague. We have a backbone for immersion. We don't really know much more about what would happen for volume production there. Would you say that even some of your largest customers which tended sometimes to spend strategically right now are also in wait and see mode and remain probably more hesitant to confirm orders for Q3 for deliveries in H1 '09 or is that not a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's exactly as you said. It's a wait and see attitude. But with the usual game of telling us that they may want things in Q4. With very, very short lead time.</p>
          <p>So you &#x2013; very clearly, I mean, everyone in the industry is still not seeing in the world economy. It is not seeing negative statistics about demand. I mean you are the specialist, you should know most of the applications are still running, PC is doing fairly good. Consumer electronics is okay. Cars except for General Motors, I guess, is still growing.</p>
          <p>So you have all this happening but because of fear everything that can be pushed out is pushed out at this moment and as Peter used a very scientific term, that at this moment they are sweating the installed base which you can always do until the decision becomes necessary.</p>
          <p>So most of our customers &#x2013; in fact all of our customers are still putting a forecast to us for Q4, which is above our guidance.</p>
          <p>And let's be very blunt that we are judging as we've mentioned between minus 10 to minus 20, just as a statement of, I would not say conservatism, but of the fact the world at this moment has a period of thinking about where the business will go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And in terms of a follow-up, just I'm struggling a little bit to understand the ASP for new orders, orders for new machines in Q2 considering that you had 20 immersion orders, I understand one of them was a refurbished that leaves us with 19 immersion, 10 non-immersion. And when I do the maths, I mean I have to plug in ASPs close to, I guess, 27 million for immersion and maybe around 12 for non-immersion to get to your blended ASP. That looks low, I mean am I missing something or in some cases you have to have pricing a bit lower from what you typically would have on a normal run-rate basis?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the math with me, potentially Craig and Frankie will come back to you on this, but no, there is no trend at all that you could see again because every time at this moment when we would reduce the price of a tool because every year you negotiate and every year you give away a bit and this is the normal business.</p>
          <p>We usually upgrade the machines with a higher speed and therefore we compensate for this. So, this happening at this moment. Sometimes you have by quarter of course a mix &#x2013; a customer mix impact which could explain this. This time, also we have a lot of fuse order, I think. I don't know, but I am &#x2013; at this moment you, you should not be able to see any ASP screened by segment or by customer.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The emerging ASP is on average between 27 and 28, but it includes by the way two used tools. So, that means that the new systems are about the same level as we had before.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Atif Malik. Please state your name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Atif Malik from Morgan Stanley. I have a question on your R&amp;D profile. If I look at your R&amp;D spending over the last, let's say, two to three years, it seems to me it increased to 17% of the sales in 2008, or there was an increase to about 17% levels. So is it fair to see 2008, as your 2005 year where you are coming over the new platform and R&amp;D spending is the kind of going higher and then for 2009, it's going to kind of a come down to a more like 14% kind of level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, it's not a &#x2013; we cannot manage the business as a percentage of sales. These R&amp;D blocks are project driven and the project will get into sales three years later or something. So, the R&amp;D decision sizing is really much more about how many new products we would want to introduce and whether we can afford them. So we can take a decision to reduce or not. But percentage of sales is remotely related to this. What we've said however on a regular basis is that our business could justify, say, up to 140, 150 million per quarter where we would be able to generate value, we know that.</p>
          <p>At this moment we have about 130. We do not expect short-term to move it up because of the current sales level, which will not justify the profit. So we've decided to cool down on some good ideas we may have. But with 130, we are able to maximize our set of new products for efficiency, costs, and also for new generation like EUV. And we feel comfortable that 130 million would allow us to get EUV in business by 2010, as we said for pre-production and 2011 for ramp. So, in other terms, we would probably stabilize at 130, except if two things happen.</p>
          <p>One, big accidents, let's say if 2009 is a terrible year and we are going to show some profitability.  So, we will be able to reduce a bit but that would cost potentially some months of delay of some products. But again at this moment, we don't see this to happen. Or we get so rich in 2009, as I said, the pickup is enormous, et cetera and then we have two or three of our additional dreams, which will generate more value in 2012-13 that we can afford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I have a quick follow up. In your slide 29, you mentioned that you are going to be doing some cost reductions. Historically, ASML's gross margins have been about 500 basis points lower than your U.S. peers and you kind of lever some gross margin in the supply chain. Are you guys thinking of doing something different in the current cycle to maybe offset the weaker pricing environment or is it more of the step that you have been doing in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. So, first of all, as we've said consistently we are trying to manage a company around 40% and then by improving our efficiency, we will move up 40 to 45 or so. But these numbers, I'll remind you are based on the fact that we are a highly leveraged company using a lot of suppliers. We are an integrator of a lot of things and in there you've got a major buy, which is the lens. If you correct it for the margin of the lens you could probably correct this to be a model margin between 45% and 50%, not 40. And so, be cautious when you compare us to peers or competitors.</p>
          <p>But having said that, are we still on our plan to move the margin from 40 to 45? Yes and no. Yes, because we are working all these efficiency programs, which includes cost savings, which includes reduction of the lead time by a major factor. We are in that moment putting together some ways of manufacturing differently, which will allow us to do that. We are working with suppliers to get there. We are putting suppliers into Asia and et cetera, et cetera. So, we are moving nicely towards this.</p>
          <p>In addition, as I said there since the acquisition of Brion, we are going to add more software value on our tool and software is 70%, 80% margin. So, the more we are going to sell of these "Lithography Plus", as we call it, or holistic lithography; we are going to move into higher margins. So, all of this is doing well, in fact, we are adding nicely. We are progressing. There are no issues.</p>
          <p>The bad news, however, at this moment is, yes, there is a recession looming; yes, our customers are losing money, so the pressure is higher and yes, the euro is not helping us. So, a lot of the savings that you should have seen already has been eaten up by the fact that, yeah, we are under pressure because of the euro. So we don't expect this to last much longer and therefore you should start seeing those margin number creep up again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And Eric, I would like to add that if you look at this kind of reference to our Q3 guidance which if you add it all up, you come to lower than &#x20AC;700 million of sales. We guide at around 38% gross margin which is, if you look at the relative sales decrease as compared to two quarters ago, this is a relative modest decrease in gross margin which is mainly attributable to the fact that we have lower coverage of our fixed cost. So that means that we are effective in driving down the cost reductions through the manufacturing supply chain. And that will also be noticeable going forward. Some of the problems that we have started we will see clearly do have an effect already starting in Q4. And that going forward is clearly our focus. We will get these cost reductions through the supply chain as was explained by Eric.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Sch&#xE4;fer. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. That's Simon Sch&#xE4;fer with Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask a question just to get the sensitivity right. Am I right in assuming that maybe the lower end of your guidance are either 20% effectively presumes that there is no capacity shipment in the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then, if that's the case, just trying to understand, how would you describe the risk that some of the orders that are pending for margin actually see some real cancellations just given as you actually remarked some of the capital structures of your customers are not looking as strong as you may like them to be. Maybe that's not the case for the first year customers on the NAND side and the DRAM side, that have put in the orders. But even they are more subject to perhaps budgetary checks that you'd like them to be. So, in simple terms what are the risks that those actually get cancelled in the next six to nine months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the risk is extremely small. In fact, the backlog is okay. It's not excessive. So, what we have in there are customers who really need those units. The question becomes more of the timing. This is where the issue is at this moment. The timing and often when they push out a bit, they would say yes, but now I want to change my mind and I'd like a transition from this machine to this machine. So you've got that type of activities? At this moment we have one or two customers who say, well now that we look at this, why don't we have immersion tools instead of non-immersion?</p>
          <p>So we've got in fact two customers in the situation where we are discussing the possibility of upgrading the orders basically to immersion. So these types of things are happening. But I would be highly surprised if we have any request for any cancellation from what we have. When I say any, more than the standard 2, 3, 4 tools per quarter or something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Maybe just to clarify, so the down 20%; does that assume some type of risk that there is considerable push outs by the first year DRAM &#x2013; memory company &#x2013; customers for immersion or does that &#x2013; is that baked in to your assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's baked into the assumption that there would be mostly immersion as we said in Q3 and Q4. Q3 has increased 80% of our business would be immersion. Q4, I don't have the specific in my mind but it's nearly to the same level.</p>
          <p>And this does not include a lot of immersion. So in other term, in normal circumstances when the business is booming, the leaders of the DRAM business and Flash business would try to outsmart the competitors by pulling in Q1 demand into Q4. That we haven't assumed, because again we don't know when the business will become bullish again to get back into this way of doing business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And just a simple follow-up question. Just given the cash situation now and the negative reaction in your share price. How is the company looking at potential share buy-back. I know you've kind of got authorization but what is the plan in that respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, like we said at previous calls, we have a cash target of between 1 and 1.5 billion. When we generate, keep generating cash at this level, we will be at the point where we could have say, cash in excess of our operational needs and we would use that cash to give back to the shareholders which we think could not be through a regular share buyback program, as you know it, but probably it's a bigger form of what we did before last year on the capital repayment and the reverse stock split now.</p>
          <p>That is something that because of all the logistics to that which you need to call an extraordinary shareholders meeting and you have fractions with the reverse stock split. It's not something you would do for an insignificant amount of money.</p>
          <p>You would really need to save up a decent amount of money and where we would have that, there is no change in our policy by giving that back through this kind of a &#x2013; I would call this kind of instrument.</p>
          <p>So there's no change, and if we keep doing what we are doing today, then that will be almost an inevitable thing to happen.</p>

          <p>Next question Mr. Jim Fontanelli. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim Fontanelli, Arete Research. I was just wondering about the risk to 1900i shipments in the fourth quarter given that you expect to start shipping the 1950 (sic) [1950i] in the beginning of '09 and you talked about cannibalization within the product portfolio and equally you talked about the risk that customers start to switch products within the backlog. What risk does the launch of the 1950i present both in terms of backlog push-outs but also potentially 1900i shipment numbers into the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that we &#x2013; this is our usual business of ensuring flawless transfer from one machine to the other. We do this every year or so. The way to do this is that of course you keep the price where it is on the 1900 (sic) [1900i] and the 1950 (sic) [1950i] has a higher price. And so customers usually accept that. Now, what we have done in addition this year and we are going to be much more aggressive, in fact it's one of your questions regarding margin. We are developing packages very early on to upgrade the older generations. So in other terms, at this moment we are telling the customer, you can buy a 1900 (sic) [1900i] and we will upgrade you with a package in Q1 and that looks like a 1950 (sic) [1950i] or you can buy a 1950 (sic) [1950i]. So, therefore by doing this the customers have no timing issue. They will be upgraded in the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also Jim, you should not forget that if you get push out of 1900s (sic) [1900i] which need to be translated into 1950s (sic) [1950i] later on, we are limited in the ramp up of the 1950 (sic) [1905i]. So that means that you cannot create this big bubble because we won't be able to ship to anybody. So if you start canceling your 1900 (sic) [1900i] which you need in Q4, you might be ending up in Q2 and Q3 of 2009 which is not going to actually service your real needs and that's why you need those particular upgrade packages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. And if I can, just quick follow-up on your capacity flex. Obviously we are seeing results of the flex from a downside now but you talked about the potential for a rapid shipment increase at some point over the next 12 to 18 months. Could you just, maybe quantify that in a little more detail about what you can handle maybe on a quarter-to-quarter basis? How aggressively you can flex upwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, we have done two things this year and last year. We've done the new factory which is capable now of doing these new architectures and EUV. So, that's the fundamental. So, now we've got more space which we didn't have before. And then we have hired about 2 to 300 workers which we are at this moment training, and that capacity will be allowing us towards 1.3 to &#x20AC;1.4 billion per quarter. And these are the type of numbers we think the &#x2013; our simulation tool will tell us we need if the market goes back to its historical trend.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, it's Fran&#xE7;ois from Cazanove. In terms of competition, we have obviously a situation at Intel and probably you can't comment about it but what's your new target for market share for 2008, 2009 in terms of 2007? If you could tell us if you feel there is any of the account with Intel where you think you'll be at risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question. So, yes we are bound by confidentiality as you know. So, we're not able to address the particulars of competitors' contract, et cetera. So, but what we can say first of all regarding Intel is our relationship with Intel does continue because Intel is in fact continuing to give us orders. We've shipped lately a 1900s sale and we are working on multiple nodes. So, clearly here there is whatever you may have heard, it may have to be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
          <p>The value proposition that we have in the immersion is still unique. You can look at the specifications of our customer &#x2013; of our competitors. The 1900 even and of course the 1950, the 1900 has a 1.35 NA. It has 131 wafer per hour spec. It has a 7 nanometer overlay.</p>
          <p>These three points which allow you to do chips with a very tight shrink capability and cost effectively at 131 wafer per hour. This is still fundamentally unique, nothing has changed in the market.</p>
          <p>The nearest competitor has a 1.3 NA which doesn't allow the same CD. The NA, the overlay is maybe 30, 40% worse than we have and the speed is maybe 40% lower. So, you are talking about &#x2013; that has not changed in terms of product.</p>
          <p>If we have the 1950, you can even calculate the improvement to this position. So, we are not, we're really worried in the situation of comparison of a spec to spec for very tight processes. Now, if some customers may want to have I would call less critical lithography, immersion lithography layers to be done in which case our effective better spec may not have the full value. It would have the value of the speed but the overlay and the NA would only be useful in critical areas or critical processes, not so much in less critical. So, on this one, release would be always where we would be more vulnerable, as we are in KrF, as we are in ArF, as we are in i-Line.</p>
          <p>So for these types of segments we have to be cautious and offer the market products which are effective in still addressing those non-critical layers. And this is where you usually would be at risk of losing a bit of market share and et cetera, et cetera. But in total, we will still think, we still think with our speed, we can be highly competitive, and that we may, the business we may lose are probably more strategic type things like when we &#x2013; spec was not the issue, or when our competitor is crazy in terms of price. And so, that could definitely happen. But in view of the situation, we still reiterate our market share target of 70%. At this moment we are 65-ish percent in value. And we believe we can get to 70% within the timeframe we said, which is by 2010 or so, and that hasn't changed.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sandeep Deshpande, JPMorgan. Again talking about your market share, the other customers, the Japanese customers, Elpida is making a decision on choosing its lithography supplier. I mean, you I believe have been qualified at Elpida, I mean, at what timeframe should we expect orders from that customer to come through or is there still doubt whether decisions have been made within that company about placing orders as well as of course associated companies with Elpida?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the Elpida evaluation is going on. I think what I said is that there was an internal plan by Elpida &#x2013; there is an internal plan by Elpida to close the qualification of our tool within weeks or so. At this moment we expect it to happen by September-ish. So far so good, everything is okay and the question at this moment is three fold, one is Elpida has now to decide when they ramp 5x nanometer and I will not tell you what it is because that's internal data.</p>
          <p>So, but you can understand that, that date will tell us when we get the PLs. It's more than now qualification; it's more like when do they really want to ramp, and this is being discussed internally. And by the way, and one of the decision points is, what is DRAM price looking like, et cetera and how to get capital. So, that is clearly on the mind of every DRAM vendor.</p>
          <p>And two, there will be a conclusion of negotiations. And I expect the negotiations to drag on until the point where they have to put the PL which would be normal behavior.</p>
          <p>So in other terms, at this moment looking good, negotiation ongoing until the customer needs to put the PL plus a lead time so that they get in ramp in the 5x ramp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one follow-up Eric, I mean, just to reconcile, I mean, you are talking about worst case situation of 20% revenue decline versus I mean when you came into the market in the second quarter, you were slightly more bullish.</p>
          <p>Have you seen in customers, I mean you've said also that you've not seen real order cancellations, but what is it that you're seeing from the customer, that customers just don't want to order at this point or they're telling you that we may push out orders into 2009? How is &#x2013; what's the customer behavior you saw which made you change your stance slightly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is a good question. You'd remember that most of, every time we speak, Peter and I, we try to relate to not a forecast but to a simulation. And then we put the situation in front of our order activity to give you some feedback.</p>
          <p>So, the simulation means, if the world was running with some statistics and goals, that would be the number of tools necessary. And this hasn't changed. We believe that we were right, we are still right, that there is need for them to buy capacity.</p>
          <p>If they have to make the numbers of chips necessary as per the &#x2013; what the analysts say. So we are still bullish there. There is a growth opportunity. What surprised us, however, during the period of three months is the economy is so uncertain that every customer, even the bullish ones, even the one who are just sitting on machine that are 110% of their capacity, if you know what I mean, that they are running on the max, max, max, are telling us; "wait".</p>
          <p>We just want to know how this economy is evolving. So nothing has changed at all on all the economics of litho of our market share, of the need for them to have capacity and immersion of the transition nodes. But everybody says you are not going to invest not knowing if the consumer is going to do something. If the banking sector and JP Morgan is going to collapse &#x2013; sorry Sandeep &#x2013; and demand the complete wait and see attitude.</p>
          <p>But as I said, be cautious. Still the same people are saying however, I may come back and ask you for these tools. And in fact, we have some of them even with immersion tools for Q4, which are putting us into a situation of wait and see. So what I've changed is to wait and see, nothing else.</p>

          <p>Next question Mr. Ramel. Please state your company name followed by your question</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Ramel from Exane BNP Paribas. Just to come back for the pricing pressure, you said you are facing pricing pressure but on the other hand, you say the pricing for the immersion tools remain the same. So I'd just like to understand what kind of pricing pressure you are seeing, if you could quantify it, and for which tools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, that's a good question. So, the mechanism of this type of business is to have negotiation on a yearly basis. And each of the customers has its own cycles. Most of them would be negotiating in the Q3 timeframe. A lot of them are negotiating in the Q4 timeframe and some will be negotiating &#x2013; the laggard would be negotiating Q1-ish. So, during this period of time you close volume purchase agreement, like when you sell an Airbus or a Boeing and then you fix your price and that would be based on a one year or a two year basis or a technology basis.</p>
          <p>Intel, for instance, is more on the technology basis. Usanta would be more on a one year basis, etcetera. So when we say price pressure, we don't mean like in the memory business where you have the price pressure for next quarter. You're talking about a price pressure for the next negotiation. And this negotiation lasts three to six months. And so, during the period you know that you are going to be hard pushed by customers say "well, I'm losing money, why shouldn't you?" And then you start from there. That's what we are talking about.</p>
          <p>At this moment therefore, it's difficult for me to say that we know what our price position will be in 2009. But because we are well prepared for this pressure, of course we are here to offer value to customers. So, they are going to confront us because they haven't yet fully done this and ask us, well, you know, we need to have a better solution from you. We have to come up with a better solution, all the time, and that's where I am pretty proud with the type of effort, which you have see in my speech I said, we are introducing the TWINSCAN H. It's the first time I say this, by the way, I usually hide to you the different versions of TWINSCAN. But this one is a version which is 15% faster than the older one.</p>
          <p>So guess what? That means I am going to say to the customers that they are getting 15% price reduction from this product and keeping the same price. But that machine, the H 1950, in addition has a different lens and a different overlay capability, so that that's even value.</p>
          <p>So you are now going to hit the customer who is pushing you and say, look first of all cost wise I am really helping, 15% improvement of speed, and secondly I am bringing value to the equation because you can shrink further.</p>
          <p>And that discussion will lead, hopefully, to us keeping margin or improving margin in the normal circumstances. So that's why we are, I think we're well positioned but it would stupid for me not to say that when you are Euro based company and we are in recession, you're not getting significant pressure.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just maybe a follow up. When you say that in the worst case scenario you could have sales down 20%, is it compared to the adjusted sales you published today, or to the previous sales of 3.8 billion you achieved last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a 3.8 billion multiplied by either 0.9 or 0.8, will be somewhere in between.</p>
