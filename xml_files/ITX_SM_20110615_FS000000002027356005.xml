          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the presentation of the Inditex Results for the interim three months of 2011. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim three months of 2011. I am Pablo Isla, I'm here with Mr. Ignacio Fernandez, our CFO, and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for the first quarter 2011 show that Inditex continues its ongoing global, multi-concept growth. Sales in the quarter have increased 11%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period. Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our store opening plan for the year is on track. Zara has recently been launched in Australia, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex business model. We have on also launched our e-commerce operations in selected new markets in the quarter. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Ignacio Fernandez, who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In this first quarter of 2011, all the key lines from the profit and loss account saw significant growth as a result of our operating performance. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;3 billion, EBITDA of &#x20AC;601 million and net income of &#x20AC;332 million. In terms of gross profit, in line has increased 9% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion, resulting in a 58.8% gross margin on sales. Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 10%, reflecting merely the growth in space and include all the startup costs of new openings. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the trends shown at fiscal year-end 2010.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez, who will elaborate on the performance of the Inditex concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the space addition, we are on track, as we have opened 110 <mark type="ph" /> new (3:00) stores in the first quarter of 2011, to reach a total of 5,154. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 29 markets over the period.</p>
          <p>Regarding the performance by format in the first quarter of 2011, Zara and the younger concepts grouped together have performed broadly in line with each other with some minor differences. Regarding the younger concepts, Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear have performed above the average and Zara Home and Bershka below the average. The changes versus last year relate mainly to the comparable base.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to our expansion, let me highlight that our store opening plan is on track. Regarding the outlook for the first half of 2011, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of February to the 12th of June have grown 11%. For the rest of 2011, we will continue to invest profitably, expanding our business in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns through our multi-concept and multi-channel strategy.</p>
          <p>We continue to identify significant opportunities for global expansion. In the coming months, Zara will launch stores in new markets, such as South Africa, Taiwan and Peru. Regarding our e-commerce operations, on the 3rd of March 2011, we launched Zara online sales in five additional markets: Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Monaco. Zara's online offer is now available in 16 European countries. We plan to roll out Zara online sales in other selected markets until we establish a global presence. To this end, we will launch Zara e-commerce operations in the United States on the 7th of September. Following the successful launch of Zara and Zara Home, all Inditex concepts will soon be present in e-commerce. Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Pull &amp; Bear, Stradivarius, Oysho and Uterq&#xFC;e will launch online sales in the most relevant European markets on the 6th of September 2011.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex concepts over the quarter and some selected store openings of recent months. Inditex expansion has reached a new milestone with the launch of the first Zara store in Australia in April. Zara, at Pitt Street in Sydney, has 2,300 square meters of retail surface. The reception has been very strong. A Zara store at Bourke Street in Melbourne has opened this morning. Additional Zara stores in the key Australian cities will follow. Inditex is now present in five continents and in all the key markets, showing our global reach. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Pull &amp; Bear has launched its operations in the Netherlands. It has opened two flagship stores at The Hague and Tilburg that showcase its new image. Further openings in the Netherlands will take place over the coming months. Massimo Dutti has launched a big sport shoe collection in selected stores worldwide.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the launch of Bershka in Japan with the opening of a flagship store of 1,300 square meters in Tokyo's Shibuya district, a global hub for teenage fashion. This commences the expansion of Bershka in the country and additional stores will follow in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Stradivarius has opened a flagship store in Milan's Corso Buenos Aires, showcasing its latest  image. Oysho has launched a new beachwear collection now present in all its stores worldwide. Zara Home has been launched in Germany, a flagship store in Frankfurt's Rathenauplatz is the first in the country and will be followed by additional openings in the coming months. Our accessories store, Uterq&#xFC;e, has opened a very relevant store in Istanbul at Ni&#x15F;anta&#x15F;&#x131;.</p>
          <p>Zara has opened its fifth store in Hamburg, at Ottenser Hauptstra&#xDF;e. This is Inditex's store number 74 in Germany. Zara has opened a flagship store at Ilica in Zagreb's city centre, further increasing our presence in the capital. Zara has opened a very relevant store in Moscow's Mall of Russia. This is Zara's 51st store and Inditex's 228th in the country. We continue to expand our presence in China with a highly prominent store. Zara has opened at Guangzhou's TeeMall, a key retail destination in the city, which brings our store count in China to 150. We have opened our 31st store in Brazil, at the Iguatemi Alphaville in S&#xE3;o Paulo. And finally, we would like to close this presentation with the Zara's store of 3,100 square meters at Bourke Street in Melbourne that we have opened this morning.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. Now, we will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will start now. We remind you that online questions will follow. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We request that you kindly limit yourselves to one question per turn. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Quick question just on online, I wonder if you could give us some sense of what proportion of group sales is now going through the online channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, during this year, we prefer not to be very specific about the level of sales. We are quite focused on the execution, on launching in the different markets, of course, on customer satisfaction, providing a very good service. What we can tell you is that we are quite happy with the evolution of our online operations in the different European markets in which we are present today. As we were saying during the presentation, we are planning to launch our online sales this autumn in the U.S. and Japan.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we are launching on September the 7th and we are planning to begin our online sales with all the other concepts that we are not present in online, also at the beginning of September in selected European markets. So, this is what we can tell you about our online operation, is that we are quite satisfied about the evolution of our online sales, not only about the evolution of our online sales, but also about the number of visits to our webpage, the number of fans in Facebook. Within that, this multi-concept approach is working quite well, but we'd prefer not to be very specific about the level of sales that it represents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just staying with online, are there any incremental costs that we should factor in with these launches this year in terms of operating expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say nothing about what happened last year, not last year. As you remember, we were quantifying &#x20AC;12 million cost because of the Zara Online launch and you could assume a similar figure this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally on the gross margin, could you give us some sense of what the currency impact was on the gross this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, as you know, we prefer not to get into the details of the gross margin because the gross margin over a quarter is composed of many different factors. You have the product mix, you have markups, markdowns, currency, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, at this stage, what we would like to highlight is that very much our business model remains being very flexible and this, our position in providing the latest fashions at the right price also brings, in our opinion, the right approach to the market. And what we would like to reaffirm is what we mentioned last March, in the sense that for the gross margin for the fiscal year our estimate is to lock in 50% of the gross margin gains that we achieved last year without entering into a quarterly breakdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from and Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Anne Critchlow from SG. I'd like to ask a question on the inventories position, up 24% year-on-year by the end of the quarter, sales only up 11%. Could you explain the difference please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we always say the inventory position doesn't particularly reflect the commitment of the company at any given point in time. Our commitment starting <mark type="ph" /> manage (13:07) remains fairly the same as last year. The low rate as of the 30th of April is influenced by the 10% decline in inventory the year earlier. This means the growth is just 6% compounded over two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Richard Chamberlain from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning, gents. Just a question please, on Bershka, just wondered if you can comment on the performance of that brand. Obviously, you had a tougher year last year, very good year the year before. How happy are you with the offer this spring, summer and on the like-for-like trends for Bershka, pleases</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are satisfied, basically, as we mentioned during the presentation. The results &#x2013; what we are showing on our presentation is very much the result of the growth of the previous year. So, it's very much a comparable issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's just over -- see the comparable is much easier this year and yet it doesn't seem to be performing any better on a relative basis compared to the other brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult between the -- they are different between the first half and the second half, so in the first half a little bit demanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm with you. Okay, thanks. And just on Japan, just wondered how easy you're finding it now to get new sites in Japan, obviously, you've got your global flagship there, but going forward, can we expect an accelerated rate of expansion there? Can we also expect some <mark type="ph" /> norms (14:49) or formats to open in Japan at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at some point it always could be the case but currently our brands in Japan remain the same. We will continue opening Zara stores and we are opening between 10 to 12 Zara stores per year and then now we'll have the introduction of Bershka and of course, we are opening, we have opened this flagship in Shibuya and then we are having a different opening as well today, we have already three Bershkas in Japan. And the idea is to combine this flagship store with other openings of Bershka in shopping malls in different areas, in different cities. So, as we think about this year or the next year you could assume and we'll be doing 10 to 12 Zara stores around 4, 6 Bershka stores, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that's &#x2013; it does sound like then you're finding it a little bit easier now to get new stores, new sites than maybe five years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, very similar, similar to our rate of growth. This has been our growth in Japan in terms of openings in the last two or three years, which are very similar. We are not changing at all our approach or our strategy</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. All right, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>The next question comes from Fred Belen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question on the store base. Have you actually closed any stores during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. No, if you see in the presentation, we mentioned the rate of openings. Our store opening program is on track. We have opened stores in 29 geographies, which proves the global reach of our business model. And for the year, we think that the calendar remains very clearly on track as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that the net number is in line, but as I was just wondering if there's a difference between gross openings and net opening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not very significant. There may be just a few but nothing significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, are we talking less than 10 closures during the quarter or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are they confined to Spain or are there other countries where you're closing space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't &#x2013; I mean the &#x2013; we always analyze a store per store there is not a geographic bias towards this kind of exercise. It's always that we examine every store and this is very much the case. In Spain, what we can mention is that, as you know, what we mentioned in March, that we expect a very stable performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, basically, you close stores as leases come up renewal and they don't make sense anymore? Or is it more to do with the macro environment in which you operate? Or is it just a &#x2013; it's a side-by-side basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In terms of side by side, it's sometimes also because we find a better location in some places, and also, when this happens it's always side by side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes, if we have one store in one particular street and we find a location that we like more, then sometimes we could make the decision to close the first one and then to open the new one, no? So, it's on a side-by-side basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess what I was getting at is that, for example, in China, there's a lot mall development and you have a big opening program, but my understanding is that a number of malls that perhaps opened five to ten years ago are not as relevant anymore as they used to be. I was just wondering, given that leases are much shorter in China, if you're able to sort of churn the portfolio in order to capture that trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, this has not been the case for us, so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then. Well if it's not been the case for you, then that's exactly what I wanted to hear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just two questions. First of all, could you comment on the performance of Spain in the quarter? And then, secondly, I think you said at the beginning of the season, you plan to hold prices this year. How do you find the customer's reacted to that? Are customers trading up? Are you seeing sort of ASPs kind of flat on the year so far in the season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can begin answering your second question. Say that this has &#x2013; we'll anticipate that in the full-year results presentation, our pricing policy is to maintain our prices stable in the different markets this year and we are not seeing any relevant change in the trends of customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>And regarding your second question about Spain, we prefer not to enter into the discussion of geographies over a short period of time because we <mark type="inaudible" /> (19:29) bad macro-proxy.

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you. Firstly, within the quarter, was there any notable change in mix, particularly given the weather, but also, I think, kind of fashion appears to kind of pushing towards some lighter and lower ASP? Was there anything within that that would have impacted your margins or the way you traded through the quarter? And the second, just this is in Germany, as to whether, now that you've bought out your former partners, you'll be accelerating store growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the first question, as you know, we're operating our global business in 80 countries, 5 continents. The weather, I would say, is not very relevant. So, because it's very difficult that the weather impacts all the geographies. So, I wouldn't read anything specific in terms of mix due to the weather. And regarding Germany, I would say that, well, clearly is a market that we like very much.</p>
          <p>We have to make very profitable decisions to expand in the country. And &#x2013; but as you see, we're clearly launching other formats and we believe that, again, we are going to follow our regular expansion. We have opened Zara Home. We will open more stores for Zara Home. We've opened some significant stores for Zara as well. You've seen in the presentation, we've mentioned the fifth store in Hamburg and what we can say in Germany is that we see a very strong long-term opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's an acceleration. And just in terms of e-com launches, you've given us a date for the U.S. You'd also previously talked about some e-commerce in Canada, South Korea, or in Japan. Will those all come in this financial year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will announce the launch dates one by one because, as you know, the plan we have is to roll out e-commerce for all the countries in which we are present. So, we believe that the right way to do it right now is providing an exact date for the launch of every opening. And this is why we have announced that on the 7th of September, we will launch Zara in the U.S., on the 6th of September, we will launch e-commerce operations in the most relevant European countries for all those formats which are not yet present in e-commerce. And we will provide the dates for the following openings on a one-by-one basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the U.S. launch, will that coincide with the launch of the Fifth Avenue flagship?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it will be the &#x2013; the Fifth Avenue flagship probably will be opened or will open next year, at the beginning of next year, not this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I understand that you won't give geographic breakdowns on a quarterly basis, but I was wondering if you look over the trends in the past year, if you think you're outperforming or underperforming the market overall in Spain or if you're taking significant market share there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Karen, what I would like to highlight is very much what we mentioned in March and we are reaffirming today. In the sense that in Spain, we are seeing very stable performance, as we expected, and this is very much what we expect for the year and, again, we have very bad macro proxies, so we would like -- we would prefer not to enter into the this kind of analysis over a quarter in any specific geography. But, regarding Spain, what we can mention is that we're seeing a very stable performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it sounds like you're probably taking a little bit of share there as the environment's been &#x2013; has been pretty good so far this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer to look at our operations than to look at the market as a whole. This is why we would prefer not to analyze specific geographies on &#x2013; with that kind of focus over a quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I know you don't look at the inventory as a single point in time but it's actually, if you look at it for the past two quarters, it's been up 20% for both quarters which seems to be, perhaps, more of a trend than a one-off timing issue. I was wondering if I'm looking at that the right way or if there's something else that's impacting the way that's reporting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no changes in the way we have our business model is very much the comparable, I think is quite relevant if you look at that compounded rate over two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I was wondering, with the Online business, is there going to be a point in time where you expect that you will give us a breakdown of the Online business, or should we just stop asking?  Do you think 5% of sales <mark type="inaudible" /> (24:38) information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that as you see 2011 is a year for the launch of Online in very relevant markets and very relevant concepts. In that sense, in the first quarter, we extended Zara online sales to 5 more countries who are now present in the 16 more relevant countries in Europe. Then, obviously, on September the 7th, we have the launch of Zara in the U.S. Then the day before, we're going to launch all the formats in the most relevant European markets. Then we will launch Japan, which is also a very relevant market.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, with this timeframe what we are more focused on is in terms of execution of customer service, of the online platform, et cetera and logistics. So, I believe as this is an ongoing process, we would rather focus on the launch and on the execution over the first years, and depending on that, we will move on into our next phase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Your OpEx-to-sales ratio was pretty good, with OpEx lagging sales  by about 120 bips. Is there any particular explanation and should we expect that trend to continue through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, as we always say, it's very difficult to read the OpEx evolution in one particular country, quarter, we prefer to wait until the whole season. Having said that, as the main driver of our OpEx growth is, of course, space growth and then it also has something to do always with the like-for like sales growth evolution. And what we can say that we are managing very carefully and very tightly our costs in all the different areas, so there is not any specific reason, just the permanent management of our cost base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, there's no one particular influence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the permanent focus in managing very tightly our cost base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, one other question, please. In terms of your inventory, given the sort of inflationary environment that is in &#x2013; of <mark type="ph" /> our power (27:15) sourcing, can you quantify what unit growth is in inventories rather than overall inventory, just to sort of see what the underlying unit trend is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Rebecca, I don't think this analysis is relevant because as we always provide is the latest fashion. This is a &#x2013; you're not selling exactly the same garment year-on-year. What we can mention is that sales growth has been mainly due to unit growth of comparable product because our pricing policy has been very stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Nicklas Fharm from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions on your relative market position at this stage. You mentioned twice now that you have maintained your prices stable, but I think it's a fair description to say that we're seeing a lot of other retailers increasing their prices lately. Do you actually think that you have gained relative attractiveness in the end customer demand at this stage? Or do you think that the customer shopping in the value segment doesn't necessarily shop at you anyway? Where do you think you have been impacted from the current market trends in terms of pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I can tell you is that in the last few years, we have always been maintaining our prices stable in the different markets and if you think about our sales, what is our commercial proposition to our customers, it's a combination of first of all, fashion, so our customers know that when they come to one of our shops of any of our concepts, they will find very &#x2013; latest fashions, very fashionable garments, quality and then affordable prices. And this is our policy and this remains our policy.</p>
          <p>And we are permanently focused in having the latest fashion, high fashion with our business model, and of course, very, very high quality. And this policy of maintaining our prices stable in the different markets is what has been the case in the last three or four years and what continues being the case this year. So, we are not changing our policy and we'll continue completely focused in this idea, in fashion, quality and of course, always maintaining affordable prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, would you agree that at the end of the day, a lot of the competitors in the market has been actually changing their pricing policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I prefer to talk about ourselves. I am transmitting to you our policies and what is our commercial proposition to our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My second question relates to your gross margin development. It would be great if you could give us some insight into what extent there's been any markdowns impacting the gross margin in this fiscal quarter, given that I also believe there's been a lot of discounting going on in various European markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, Nicholas on that, I would like to remember what I mentioned at the beginning of the conference call in the sense that you're referring to one of the components of the gross margin, but the gross margin is also the mix of fashion. It's the markups, it's the markdowns, it's the execution of the supply chain and, as Pablo mentioned, the key feature of our gross margin is our business model.</p>
          <p>It's the flexibility to react with the right fashions at the right time. So, at this point in time, all I would like to mention is that we try to view to the market in March what we reiterate right now that we expect to lock in 50% of the gross margin gains of last year. And then to add to that, I believe, the business model of Inditex is the key factor behind this statement.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, guys. I just had a question on your payables terms. I know you commented that the working capital profile was stable in the quarter, but it strikes me that your payables terms seem to be coming more and more favorable and that's something we've seen over the last year to 18 months. So, could you just kind of try to explain that to us? I mean, is that a function of moving more openings and more sales into emerging markets such as China or is there something else behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Not really. In terms of payables, what you have to really bear in mind is that the dividend to be paid is there and this is one of the factors and then there is another factor which is the payables. Nothing very different in terms of the way we've managed the working capital over the season. It's very much we sustain the same fundamentals as of the end of last year and based on proximity sourcing and our business model. So, what you should expect is that the working capital accounts would perform in a very similar way over the year</p>
          <p>as -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you and can I &#x2013; I don't know if this question has been asked already but just in terms of your view on store openings in China this year now and kind of where you think you can get the opening rate to in the future, i.e., do you still see the rate of new openings as something that could potentially accelerate from your current run rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have not understood so well your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's &#x2013; and I guess it had two parts. How many stores are you anticipating opening in China this year? And do you think &#x2013; and then the second part is do you think that that number of stores can increase in future years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say that in China the growth opportunity in China for us represents a very, very relevant growth opportunity, not only for this year and for the next five years but I would say for the next 20 or 25 years or who knows how many years. And we see very, very strong potential there and people like very much fashion. Our Zara and all our other brands are very, very well received by our customers. And we are, as I said, we were trying to combine high street openings with shopping mall openings.</p>
          <p>There are a lot of shopping mall developments right now and many more that will take place in the next years. So, for us, it represents a very, very relevant opportunity. So, we anticipated that during the full-year results presentation, that we were expecting to open 120 stores in China within this year 2011. If we think about the next years, you should assume a figure at this level or higher, but we are not expecting any figure below this number of store openings in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay, that's great. Thank you. And then, just a final question was on the kind of cash balance that's continuing to build. You've commented before that you see the potential for further avenues of growth. At this stage, have you got any sort of better visibility on how that cash might be used going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the financial policy is focused mainly on growing the business with profitable store openings and in that sense, that's the key priority for the group. Secondly, we believe it is good to have a sound financial condition in this environment. And then, the third pillar of our financial policy is clearly to have a shareholder remuneration policy which is predictable and is clear. In that sense, we have a 50% ordinary payout commitment. And then, based on the different opportunities we see in the market plus the cash position, the board decides on bonus dividends in the last board meeting of the year. And as you remember, since the year 2003 we've been paying bonus dividends. So, this will be the way ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay that's great, that's very clear. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning to you all. We are now going to go through the questions that have come in through the webcast platform. Some of them relate to topics that have been answered already such as sales growth, gross margin, costs, e-commerce and also on China. We have some questions regarding Australia. Can you give us some feedback regarding your launch in Australia? How many stores do you plan to open? And also, how has your Summer Hemisphere collection being received?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say is that the opening in Australia has been very &#x2013; something very relevant for us because after opening Australia we can say from every point of view that we are quite a global company, being present in five continents. And we have been extremely well received there with the opening in Sydney and today one of the stores has not yet closed because today is the first day of &#x2013; on this day is the opening day of our store in Melbourne, but also the reception of the customers have been very strong.</p>
          <p>In the near future, we are planning to open new stores of course, in these two cities, in Sydney and Melbourne, and then in other cities in Australia. So, our idea will be to continue opening stores in the coming years. And within that, we are having a more and more and stronger and stronger South Hemisphere collection, now selling in many different markets in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Australia and also this year entering into South Africa, Peru, so we feel quite comfortable with our South Hemisphere collection.</p>
