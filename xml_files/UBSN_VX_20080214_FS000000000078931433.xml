          <p>Good morning, and welcome to UBS's presentation of our Fourth Quarter Results. Today's presentation may last longer than usual and the reason for this is that we think it's important to explain our results in considerable detail. We also want to give you enough time to ask questions. So after the presentation, we'll take questions from analysts and then, after a short break, we'll answer questions from the media.</p>
          <p>I'd like to note that German-speaking journalists will have the opportunity to ask questions in German at the end of the session, and Mr. Rohner and Mr. Suter will then answer the questions in German. Here's an important disclaimer. Please take a few moments to read it.</p>
          <p>I now hand over to Marcel Rohner, Chief Executive of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. Today, I have to present an unacceptable result for UBS, an overall loss of CHF 4.4 billion. With today's presentation of the results, we want to achieve three objectives. First, we want to explain what happened and go in detail through our problematic U.S. real estate related exposures. Second, we want to explain the good parts of our businesses, the vast majority of our activities we did very well. Third, we want to show what actions we have taken to address the most important issues and why we are confident about the future.</p>
          <p>The very poor outcome of 2007 conceals two different trends. In most of our businesses, Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, Asset Management and the businesses other than parts of FICC within the Investment Bank, profits were strong, in some cases at record levels. This reflects our very strong positions in all client and product segments. As just one measure of this, total fee and commission income was at almost exactly the same high level in the fourth quarter as in the third quarter, and was up 10% from the fourth quarter last year. But the extremely large losses in U.S. real estate securities do overshadow this strong performance. We have taken action to improve the structural weaknesses exposed by this development. The repositioning of the FICC unit, including establishing a separate workout portfolio, the introduction of a new funding framework and adjustment of our market risk limits and measurement approach.</p>
          <p>Let me first give you the results against our normal key performance indicators. Obviously, all of net profit, return on equity, cost/income ratio and diluted EPS growth were well outside our target range. We are not going to laboriously adjust every number throughout this presentation to exclude FICC losses, because FICC is part of our business. But I should draw your attention to the fact that the cost/income ratio for businesses other than the Investment Bank improved again in the fourth quarter, and Marco will give you the details in a minute.</p>
          <p>Net new money, at 15.5 billion for the group, has within it, two quite different trends. Net new money for Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, at CHF 32 billion, was strong. Net new money for Global Asset Management was weak, with an outflow of 16 billion. This is a consequence of previous underperformance, in particular, traditional equity capabilities, and has been dealt with by having changed management within that part of Global Asset Management.</p>
          <p>The vast part of our businesses has performed well. We do have had a serious problem within our FICC business, through our U.S. real estate related exposure. Why did we amass such large U.S. real estate exposures? I found three root causes to this problem, a me-too strategy in fixed income, predicated on closing gaps with our competitors, the significant availability of cheap, short-term liquidity and the creation of DRCM.</p>
          <p>Before I go through the management action we took to address these issues, I'll briefly take you through an overview of writedowns and exposures to the U.S. real estate market, which will later be explained in much more detail by Marco.</p>
          <p>This table summarizes the writedowns on our sub-prime related exposures and other U.S. real estate related losses. With respect to the sub-prime losses on exposures, in addition to those positions, which we have already disclosed on 10th of December, we include losses on the sub-prime related portion of our monoline wrappers, and mark-to-market losses on sub-prime related elements in our reference-linked note programs.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at our exposures in sub-prime. First, the super senior RMBS exposure as of 31st of December 2007 is slightly higher than it was presented on 10th of December. The reason for this is that we include the remaining sub-prime exposure to an impaired monoline insurer, because we no longer considered the hedge effective. The amount of this is US$1.81 billion. Secondly, despite this loss of hedge, the total exposure has been reduced by approximately 30% due to writedowns, sales throughout the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our exposures to the Alt-A U.S. residential mortgage market are shown on this slide. We show the net exposure as at the 28th of September, 2007, and the year-end picture. We segregate clearly our exposure between AAA rated first lien residential mortgage-backed securities and others, i.e. lower rated and/or second lien exposures. As you can see, we significantly reduced our Alt-A positions in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In relation to the AAA first lien residential mortgage-backed securities, we have marked down the positions by $780 million throughout the quarter, with about half materializing in the second half of December. A further 1.2 billion writedown applies to the other RMBS exposures, which are non-AAA and/or second lien.</p>
          <p>The two next U.S. real estate related exposures are of a different nature than the other exposures, and this will be explained later by Marco. They are the following. First, the U.S. reference linked note program. It has an element of sub-prime related assets, which are more than 90% high-grade securities and amount to 3.8 billion net. Second, our residential mortgage-backed securities related credit exposure to monoline insurers, which amounts to US$2.9 billion. Again, we will provide a more detailed breakdown in a minute and this will include the split into sub-prime related contracts, as well as the notional amounts of all the exposures.</p>
          <p>Let's come to the U.S. commercial real estate market. Our year-end U.S. commercial real estate net exposure is in two categories. First, the U.S. trading book assets, commercial mortgage-backed securities and secondary trading amounting to 3.6 billion net exposure. It includes cash loans held for securitization and, as I said, commercial mortgage-backed securities. Second, the lending and investments of US$4.1 billion. Here, I should note that only 400 million is classified as an equity investment within this 4.1 billion. Looking at this exposure from a risk standpoint, just over 90% of the CMBS held in our U.S. trading book is AAA, AA. Our commercial lending assets are diversified by sector and by geography. We actively manage the spread risk inherent in the CMBS and in the loans held for securitization portfolios.</p>
          <p>Q4 losses associated with these positions were approximately US$500 million. That includes writedowns on CMBS and loans of 300 million, that's one part, as well as losses on the super senior CMBS CDO of approximately 200 million, with a notional exposure of 1.2 billion. This notional exposure of 1.2 billion is included in the 3.6 billion trading book assets shown on this slide.</p>
          <p>How are we going to address these exposures? We have taken significant steps to improve our risk management and funding framework, as well as reorganizing the Investment Bank and taking steps to strengthen the capital base. In the Investment Bank, we have repositioned FICC, fixed income, currencies and commodities, with the objective of improving efficiency and returning to area of profitability.</p>
          <p>Our priorities this year are to risk manage our existing positions by leveraging areas of excellence, as we calibrate to our new balance sheet targets and revised funding model. We are also aiming to bring a number of products and coverage teams closer together. This will improve overall client service.</p>
          <p>In repositioning our FICC unit, we have established a separate workout group, focused on continuously reducing risk through hedging, selling and restructuring our exposure to the U.S. real estate market. That will free our management to focus on the development of our FICC business as a client-centric and profitable operation. We will continue to keep you fully informed about all our progress in this specific area going forward.</p>
          <p>In risk management, we have made a number of important changes. Market risk in our core businesses has been substantially reduced to a level appropriate to support our strong and growing client franchise businesses. Some aspects of the market risk control framework were not adequate to identify the risks being carried and to prevent losses in the extreme conditions of the second half of 2007. We have taken a number of actions to strengthen the framework in response to these events, such as more granular approach to stress testing, the recalibration of notional limits, revised market shock volatility assumptions for stress loss and VaR measurement.</p>
          <p>We have implemented a new funding framework. Until recently, the Investment Bank funded many of its assets on a short-term basis. Now, to make sure we have a more disciplined use of UBS balance sheet, the Investment Bank funds its positions on market condition terms and by reference to the liquidity of the respective positions held.</p>
          <p>Headcount &#x2013; in November we indicated that planned changes would result in head count reductions of 1,500. Approximately 1,330 already left or have been terminated in Q4, with the remainder expected in Q1.</p>
          <p>In December, we also announced a number of actions which will significantly increase our capital base, including the issue of a 13 billion Swiss francs mandatory convertible note, the rededication of 36.4 million treasury shares and the conversion of a cash dividend to stock.</p>
          <p>Our strong capital base is critical for our credit rating, our funding cost and for the pursuit of our client-centric strategy. On December 10th, we announced a comprehensive capital improvement program. We have now submitted for approval by our shareholders two important elements of this program &#x2013; the mandatory convertible and the stock dividend.</p>
          <p>As you can see in this diagram, which depicts the value of shares delivered against the prevailing share price, the terms, which we secured for our mandatory convertible, have a guaranteed floor price in favor of existing shareholders. The mandatory convertible note holder only benefits from an increase in the shares of UBS, once the share price exceeds 117% of the reference price.</p>
          <p>With this summary of what the positions are and what we do about &#x2013; to address them, I will now hand over to Marco to go in detail through the result and the exposures.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcel. Good morning. The losses from our sub-prime positions have overshadowed everything else. That's totally understandable. I would, nevertheless, like to divert your attention for just a few minutes away from the sub-prime crisis and spend some time on our core businesses, before later coming back to our exposures in those areas most affected by the U.S. credit crisis.</p>
          <p>As Marcel has already said, all of our core businesses outside of FICC had a very strong quarter and an even more impressive year. I'd like to start with Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking. Here, all business segments had record results, both for the quarter and for the full year.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland posted record results. Revenues for the fourth quarter were slightly down, mainly due to foreign exchange effects. This, however, was more than offset by lower personnel expense. Pre-tax profit for the quarter advanced by almost 2% to well over 1.6 billion Swiss francs. For the full year the top line grew by over 2 billion to 12.9 billion and the pre-tax profit contribution was up by over 1.1 billion to 6.3 billion. That's a strong 21% improvement over last year.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management U.S., pre-tax profits for the quarter were up over 13%. For the full year, revenues were up almost 800 million or 14%. That's a great achievement, particularly in view of the weak dollar. Pre-tax profit for the year was up 136 million, a strong 23% year-on-year growth rate.</p>
          <p>In Business Banking Switzerland, pre-tax profit for the quarter was up almost 70 million to 666 million. This is a record result and is 12% ahead of the third quarter. For the full year, pre-tax profit was up by over 4% to 2.46 billion Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>So, combined, our Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking division has improved fourth quarter pre-tax profit contribution by over 5% compared to the third quarter and by almost 15% compared to the fourth quarter '06.</p>
          <p>On a full year basis, revenues were up over 3 billion or 14%. Profit for the full year was up over 1.3 billion to almost 9.5 billion and the cost to income ratio has improved by 0.8 percentage points to 62.5%.</p>
          <p>On top of this very strong profitability, Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking has again delivered strong net new money inflows, both for the quarter and equally for the full year. I will come back to this shortly.</p>
          <p>Global Asset Management advanced its top line in the fourth quarter by 14% to over 1 billion. Its pre-tax profit was up 29% to 476 million for the quarter. Thanks to strong revenues in A&amp;Q and from our Brazilian operations. For the full year, operating income advanced by over 27%, to 4.1 billion Swiss francs. Pre-tax profit for the full year, however, was down 77 million.</p>
          <p>If we exclude the DRCM closure cost of 384 million, that's the charge we took in the second quarter of this year, full year profits for Global Asset Management would have increased by 22 <mark type="inaudible" /> against full year '06.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, our equities and IBD businesses have also performed very strongly. Equities revenues were up 5% compared with the fourth quarter '06. For the full year, revenues rose 50% compared to '05, and by almost 13% between '06 and '07.</p>
          <p>IBD's growth was even more impressive. Compared to the fourth quarter '06, revenues were up by over 24%. On a full year comparison, IBD was up over 80% compared to '05 and by almost 39%, compared to '06. Keep in mind that we have achieved that 39% year-on-year increase despite the global fee pool according to Dealogic, only being up 10%.</p>
          <p>As I said a couple of minutes ago, Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking had a record quarter in terms of profitability, and their net new money contribution was again very strong, with an inflow of 31.7 billion for the quarter. The Q4 inflow was somewhat down compared to the first three quarters. As in the past, we have again experienced the seasonal pattern, whereby inflows in the last quarter of the year are not as strong as in earlier quarters of the year. But this year, the Q4 number was up almost 60% compared on a same quarter basis of last year, and it was the strongest fourth quarter ever. This quarter's net new money brings the total net new money intake for the year to 156.3 billion.  That's over 40 billion above the net new money number of 114 billion we have achieved in '06.</p>
          <p>The net new money picture in Global Asset Management did not match the strong performance of our Wealth Management business. Global Asset Management had outflows of 16.2 billion in the quarter. These outflows were concentrated in some of our core and value equity mandates and to a lesser extent in fixed income mandates.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we continue to attract strong net new money inflows in higher margin businesses particularly in A&amp;Q and in emerging market equities. As you could see, the outflows have not affected our profitability, as the shift to higher margin businesses has allowed us to improve our gross margin on invested assets. We expect to continue shifting our mix towards higher margin business.</p>
          <p>A&amp;Q has both capacity and momentum for further growth. Here you will remember that for example, we have recently launched our infrastructure business. We are also encouraged in Global Asset Management by our prospects in growth equities, and we expect to continue our strong position in emerging markets. I'm talking about markets like Brazil, China, Korea. These are markets with also higher margins and that's where our growth rates are strong.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this chart, our invested asset base has experienced a slight reduction in the quarter compared to the end of September, despite the net new money inflows. This reduction was mainly due to the weakening of a number of key currencies against the Swiss Franc, and to a lesser extent, to market performance.</p>
          <p>As you have been able to observe, these external factors have continued into January. So, absent the reversal of this trend, we will have a lower asset base on which to earn fees. We are addressing this issue right now by tightening our belt on the cost side.</p>
          <p>As I've already said, our core client businesses and therefore our fee, commission, and interest margin businesses have performed very strongly throughout the year. In fact, they were significantly ahead of the fourth quarter '06. With our trading businesses, as already explained by Marcel, has experienced negative revenues. I will not further dwell on this issue now.</p>
          <p>This table shows our credit loss experience for the last six years. You have got to bear in mind that only credit provisions or losses coming from assets, which are accounted for under the accrual method, are kept to that credit loss expense. Credit losses from positions accounted for under the fair value method, are shown in trading income. So our large U.S. mortgage related writedowns are not reflected in this graph. But as you can see from this chart, our accrual books have not entirely escaped the credit turmoil of the fourth quarter, and this has resulted in the historical trend of net recoveries being broken.</p>
          <p>Of the total credit loss of 238 million shown here, a 131 million actually did not come from a true credit impairment; instead, they reflect the credit spread widening on a portfolio of approximately 1.6 billion in U.S. floating rate commercial mortgages, which were securitized in Q4 and therefore are no longer on our books. Another significant contributor to the credit loss line were losses taken as a result of a small number of repo counterparties defaulting and the underlying collateral being structured credit paper.</p>
          <p>Our operating expense line in Q4 has seen a significant increase in personnel, and to a lesser extent, in non-personnel expense. The Q4 increase in personnel expense was limited to the Investment Bank. Personnel expense in all other business groups including the corporate center has come down. Part of these reductions, however, had to do with the fact that the bonus pools are only finalized in December. So, in the case of an over-accrual in earlier quarters, it can have a positive impact in Q4 and vice versa.</p>
          <p>As for the increase in the IB, there is a simple explanation. You will remember that in Q3 we had reported a large reduction in personnel expense because we had decided at that time to accrue bonuses at a significantly lower level than during the first two quarters of the year. This led to a claw-back of earlier accruals in Q3.</p>
          <p>In addition, you will remember that we had also decided to change the mix of how we pay bonuses between cash and shares. The impact of the increased share component which according to the old accounting treatment is expensed in future years was mainly accounted for in Q3.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the personnel expense line in IB also includes a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of approximately CHF250 million related to the head count reductions we had announced earlier. This head count chart demonstrates that we continue to invest in our Wealth Management businesses. Over one-third of the increase in personnel in this business was in new client advisors. In the Investment Bank the head count fell by 901 during Q4. That's short of the 1,500 head count reduction program announced earlier, but you can add a further 430 people who had already been given notice to leave UBS, but because of their notice periods they're technically still shown on the payroll at the end of December.</p>
          <p>Measured against the fourth quarter '06, our G&amp;A expense was up 1%. However, against third quarter '07, our G&amp;A expense was up 13% with almost all expense categories contributing to this increase. Some of this increase is seasonal and represents a reversal to a more normalized level. You need to bear in mind that many of these expense lines typically reach a low point in Q3, as the business slows down during the summer holidays. But some of the increase also reflects higher staffing levels and higher professional fees, mainly in legal and project related costs.</p>
          <p>The large loss we recorded in the fourth quarter makes the IB cost-to-income ratio and the overall cost-to-income ratio meaningless. But as Marcel has already highlighted, the cost-to-income ratio in all other business groups has improved in the fourth quarter. Specifically, Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland improved by 1.2 percentage points, Wealth Management U.S. improved by 1.5 percentage points, Business Banking improved by 3.8 percentage points and Global Asset Management improved by 5 percentage points. We are very focused on improving this important efficiency ratio even further. I've just got to alert you, in order to achieve this we will also need accommodating external factors, particularly in our Wealth Management businesses. If, for example, the strengthening of the Swiss franc against some key currencies continues, or if equity markets fail to recover from current levels, our Global Wealth Management business will find it very challenging to show a similar level of cost-to-income improvement as they have done last year.</p>
          <p>We told you at the occasion of our Q3 disclosure and again in early December that we are committed to managing our resources more efficiently. I'm pleased to announce that during the fourth quarter we have delivered on that commitment. We have reduced our balance sheet by over 200 billion during the quarter. That 200 billion represents a 9% decrease compared to the third quarter. You can see that on the blue line on this chart.</p>
          <p>The entire reduction of our balance sheet was achieved in the Investment Bank. Here the reduction in our repo book and reductions in trading positions in FICC were the key contributors. But we have not just reduced our balance sheet, our risk-weighted assets also have come down. They stood at 372 billion, down from 390 billion at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Here you see the asset classes that have contributed to the 18 billion reduction in our risk-weighted assets. The entire reduction, as for the balance sheet, was achieved in the IB, where we reduced risk-weighted assets in our lending business, in collateral trading, in off-balance sheet commitments and, last but not least, had a lower contribution from our OTC derivatives exposures. This overall reduction was achieved despite an offsetting effect on risk-weighted assets from our trading positions. Here we had reduced our balance sheet position but have nevertheless experienced a higher risk-weighted asset contribution. You need to understand that the risk-weighted assets from trading positions are primarily driven by their value at risk contribution. The increased volatility experienced in Q3 has led to a higher average VaR consumption for the fourth quarter and translated into higher risk-weighted assets from these transactions.</p>
          <p>The VaR backtesting exceptions we experienced in '07 have further led to a higher VaR multiplier which compounded the risk-weighted asset increase from our trading positions. This trend is likely to continue into 2008 as we continue to update our time series.</p>
          <p>Our total capital ratio at the end of December stood at 12%. Our Tier 1 ratio was 8.8%, or 1.8 percentage points lower than the 10.6% Tier 1 ratio we had at the end of September. Our fourth quarter loss of 12.5 billion was the main driver and contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points to the reduction in our Tier 1 ratio. This was partially offset by the reductions in risk-weighted assets, by the reversal of the cash dividend we had accrued earlier in the year and the 36.4 million in treasury shares, which were rededicated in the quarter and therefore no longer had to be deducted from our regulatory capital base. In addition to this, we raised 600 million of hybrid Tier 1 capital in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As we had already communicated, the 13 billion mandatory convertible notes will receive Tier 1 treatment. This, however, is not yet reflected in the capital ratios shown here. Also, this capital ratio shown here reflects the treatment under Basel I and they will come down under Basel II.</p>
          <p>Marcel has given you an overview of our U.S. subprime, RLN, monoline, Alt-A, and commercial mortgage exposures. I will now run you through these in somewhat more detail.</p>
          <p>As we had done on December the 11th in London, here we are providing you with the average marks at which we held these positions on our books at the end of December. When comparing this slide with the slide I had shown you in London on December the 11th, you will note that our high-grade positions have reduced from 3.8 billion to $2.8 billion and that our marks have come down from $0.81 to $0.72. That's because we have taken additional markdowns in December.</p>
          <p>You will remember that in December, I had explained to you our fundamental valuation model and, at that time, I had also indicated that the lifetime loss estimates produced by our fundamental model are ultimately calibrated to the loss estimate observable in the relevant ABX indices. I had also indicated that over one-third of our mortgages were from older vintages, for which no ABX index exists. For these positions, for which no ABX index exists, or for positions where our model had produced high marks, we had decided to add an extra risk premium to our valuation model. This has led to a further markdown of these positions in December.</p>
          <p>In the case of the mezzanine exposure, when you compare it to the London presentation, you will note that the exposure has increased from 7.8 billion at the end of November to 8.3 billion at the end of December. This exposure would actually have reduced to 7.1 billion, had it not been adjusted for approximately 1.2 billion in exposure, where for risk management and reporting purposes we no longer recognize a monoline hedge due to the downgrading of this hedge provider in December. Marcel has already touched on this issue. The average marks for the mezzanine positions have come down from 55 to $0.53 compared end of November to end of December marks. I need to stress that these are average marks and that the individual marks vary significantly within these portfolios.</p>
          <p>Marcel has also shown you our Alt-A positions and the resulting P&amp;L loss we have experienced in Q4 on these positions. Here you see the average marks of these positions. This confirms what Marcel has already said. Our positions of AAA first lien Alt-A mortgages are far from being credit impaired. They nevertheless towards the end of December had experienced spread widening, which resulted in some fair value adjustments. From a pure credit perspective, however, these look fine.</p>
          <p>Where we have taken a bigger hit and what represents somewhat higher risk exposure are those Alt-A exposures which represent either second lien paper or first lien paper of lower credit quality. Our total exposure in those positions amounts to 5.4 billion and it is here that we have taken a P&amp;L hit of approximately U.S. 1.2 billion. This is also reflected in the lower marks of these positions.</p>
          <p>Marcel has already said that in Q4 we had taken a P&amp;L hit of 1.2 billion from mortgage-related exposures in our U.S. reference linked note program. So let me explain how the program works by walking you through this illustration. We start on the left-hand side of this illustration, with a reference portfolio of various debt instruments. Next, we purchase a first-loss credit protection from an SPV by means of a credit default swap. Ideally, credit losses of the assets in the reference portfolio would be offset by gains on the credit default swap.</p>
          <p>The SPV, in turn, issued tranche securities, as illustrated here. The proceeds from the issuance of those securities ultimately serve as collateral for claims we may have against the SPV under the credit default swap. In the case of our U.S. RLN, we have a total of 10 of these programs. The aggregate notional size of the reference pool amounted to 16.9 billion and the aggregate amount of first-loss credit protection purchased amounted to $3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The good news is that, to date, almost none of this protection has been consumed, because so far we have only experienced minimal defaults in the reference pool. Ideally, up to the amount of the first-loss credit protection, a deterioration in the value in the underlying reference pool would have been compensated by a corresponding markup of the value of our credit default swap, as both legs of the transaction are fair value accounted. These transactions, however, entail other risk factors, not just credit risk, such as duration and correlation. And it is for this reason that the desk has also had some assets in a global hedge book associated with these programs.</p>
          <p>Now, let me explain to you what happened. As spreads in the reference pool in Q4 have widened, the value of the assets we hold has declined. The value of the credit protection has increased, but not in the same amount. This has led to some valuation losses in Q4. The bulk of the 1.2 billion P&amp;L hit, however, was due to positions in our global hedge book, which are not perfectly covered by the credit protection.</p>
          <p>This table now shows you the composition of the assets in the various reference pools, including the assets in our global hedge book. We have a total of 10 programs and these programs are not cross-collateralized. The aggregate market value of the assets in the reference pool and the hedge book amount to 13.2 billion, the credit default swaps have been marked up in aggregate by 1.8 billion. The net component of subprime exposure at year-end amounted to 3.8 billion. Here, I need to stress that these are predominantly high-grade RMBS assets, with a relatively low probability of impairment and, as you can see from the pie chart, the majority of these RMBS are of older vintages. The quality of the underlying CMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities, is very high. 72% is AAA, 17% is AA, 1% is A, and 10% is BBB.</p>
          <p>Marcel has given you the aggregate size of our monoline exposures, resulting from so-called negative basis trades. Negative basis trades are positions where we have bought credit protection from monoline against the portfolio of underlying assets. This slide should help you guide through the terminology and numbers that I will cover on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Our first level of recourse is obviously the underlying asset pool. If these assets do not default, we have no claim against the monoline. If the assets default, the monoline would have to make us whole, at which time we will have a credit exposure to the monoline for the amount of the shortfall. To date, none of the underlying assets have defaulted and we currently do not have a credit claim against the monolines. In one case, however, we had the right to call for the collateral &#x2013; for collateral from the monoline and that call has not been honored.</p>
          <p>From an accounting and risk perspective, we are required to value both the assets as well as the CDS protections we have bought from the monoline. If the underlying asset pool loses its value, the CDS gains in value and this results in a perfect hedge, also for accounting purposes. In the fourth quarter, we saw the market value of the underlying assets, particularly subprime assets, deteriorate and correspondingly the value of the credit default swap and hence our contingent credit exposure to the monolines increasing.</p>
          <p>In the case of one of the repo monolines, we have booked a 90% credit value adjustment against our potential credit exposure. In the case of the better rated monolines, we have calculated the credit value adjustment on the basis of the credit spread implied default risk of the monolines and we have made an LGD assumption, loss given default assumption, of 65%. This resulted in credit value adjustment for the better rated monolines of between 5 and 15%. On average, the adjustment was 9%.</p>
          <p>This slide now provides you with the detailed numbers to what I've just explained. If you aggregate the two boxes at the lower right-hand corner, you will arrive at the net aggregate credit exposure to the monolines in the amount of $3.6 billion, representing $2.9 billion of exposures relating to U.S. mortgage-backed securities and 0.7 billion related to other underlying asset classes. As I've indicated, these exposures are calculated on the basis of the replacement value of the credit default swap, minus the roughly $950 million in credit value adjustments we have taken in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On this table you will also see that the underlying exposure for our U.S. mortgage-backed related monoline exposure is predominantly of high-grade subprime quality and that most of our exposures are insured by A or higher-rated monolines. There is one notable exception, which is the 1.6 billion in notional mezzanine subprime CDO exposure for which we had bought protection from a monoline, which has since lost its investment grade rating and for which we have taken, as I've said before, a 90% or U.S. $588 million credit provision.</p>
          <p>Those transactions not related to U.S. residential mortgages mainly relate to corporate loan obligations. Compared to our subprime exposures, they are clearly of higher quality. This can best be seen by the fact that the monoline credit exposure in these cases is very small compared to the underlying notional amount. Leveraged finance was an area where relative to our competitors we have fared better, mainly because here we entered the credit crisis with a relatively small exposure.</p>
          <p>We show the exposures as old deals versus new deals. Old deals refer to those transactions which we entered prior to July '07. You will note that those exposures have come down in Q4 and are at a very low level. New deals typically have richer pricing and better covenant and flex or other forms of credit protection. In Q4 we have added new deals to our portfolio as we have continued to work with our key clients also in this area. Overall, our exposure is modest and it is adequately marked in our books.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we have clearly over &#x2013; we were clearly overexposed in U.S. subprime positions and hence ill-prepared for the credit crisis, and this has left its marks on our P&amp;L and on our capital base. Our exposures in other asset classes affected by this crisis are manageable and of quite different nature compared to our subprime exposure. We do not expect major negative surprises here, and we have further reduced these positions again in January and in February.</p>
          <p>Apart from these issues, all our businesses performed very strongly. Many of them had a record year. We are particularly confident that the long-term growth prospect for our Wealth Management businesses are as bright as ever. And in all of our businesses, we are extremely well positioned in the fast growing emerging markets. Once this credit storm has blown itself out, the attention will certainly shift back to our very successful core businesses.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And with that, I'll hand you back to Tom Hill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marco. I'll now take you rapidly through the main features of the performance of each business group. I'll start with Wealth Management, then Asset Management and then IB.</p>
          <p>So, Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland produced another very solid net new money performance. As is normal, the fourth quarter was well below the third quarter at 23.4 billion francs, compared to 35.1. But that was a record for a fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Over the whole of 2007, net new money was 125 billion francs, up from 98 billion in 2006. The strong net new money performance offset the drag on invested assets we had from the strength of the franc against other currencies, in particular, the U.S. dollar, and from soft markets. So invested assets rose very slightly over the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland, profits before tax reached another new record. Revenues were approximately flat over the quarter and the gross margin on invested assets fell by 1 basis point to 102 basis points. But expenses, partly because of currency movements, fell by 3%. So profits before tax rose by 2%, and that brings the full-year increase to more than 20% at 6.3 billion francs.</p>
          <p>For some time now, we have separately disclosed the results of the European domestic business within Wealth Management International. But after eight successive profitable quarters, we now consider that this business is mature enough to be considered an integral part of WMI, so we will no longer break its results out separately.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, the inflow of net new money was 3.1 billion francs. Again that follows the seasonal pattern and was up very substantially from the fourth quarter 2006. This business continues to grow. For the whole of 2007, net new money inflows represented 13% of the invested asset base at the end of 2006 and the greatest inflows are from the U.K., Germany and Italy. The trend of profitability in EWMI continues to be upwards. For the full year, profits rose by about 56% from 2006 levels. The relatively high cost income ratio of this part of our business magnifies the seasonal fluctuations in revenue growth.</p>
          <p>So profits for the quarter fell from the third quarter, with revenues up by 6% on the quarter, but expenses rose faster at 16%. However, expansion continues and the number of client advisors rose 2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management U.S. had another quarter of solid progress in terms of both net new money and profits. Measured in francs and excluding interest and dividend, net new money was 8 billion Swiss. With the weakening of the U.S. dollar in particular, that led to a 3.4% decline in invested assets. Of course, this makes it difficult to track what in fact is very solid progress over time in what is a U.S. dollar denominated business.</p>
          <p>So, measured in U.S. currency terms and including interest and dividends, net new money was $13.3 billion, which was up from 8.8 billion in the third quarter 2007. Wealth Management U.S. have the highest level of profits for any quarter in recent history, up 13% in Swiss franc terms to 205 million. In U.S. dollar terms, the increase was even bigger, up 19% to a record $180 million.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring revenue rose on increased client activity and there was a slight rise in dollar terms in recurring income. These were partly offset by increases in non-personnel costs. WM US is now a significant contributor to overall Group results. For the full year profits were 718 million francs, up a full 23% on 2006.</p>
          <p>Business Banking Switzerland had another good quarter. Its profits were up 12% on the quarter to another new record, bringing the total for the year to 2.5 billion francs. That's 4% above 2006. This was slightly helped by disposal of equity participations. But, of course, the value of this business also lies in the shift of clients and assets to Wealth Management, which totaled 9.2 billion francs during 2007.</p>
          <p>Global Asset Management had a good quarter for profits, but a less good quarter for fund flows. Quarterly profits rose 29% on the third quarter and the annual total, at 1.3 billion francs, was only slightly below 2006, even though the costs of the DRCM restructuring were taken in the second quarter. Excluding those charges, 2007 profits would have been 1.7 billion francs, up 22% compared with 2006.</p>
          <p>For some time, we have been flagging the fact that investment performance has been lagging in some of the product areas within Global Asset Management. You can now see the effect of that in client flows, which were substantially negative in both the institutional and wholesale channels. If we exclude money market flows, outflows were 26.2 billion francs. The particular areas that have underperformed are core and value equities and fixed income.</p>
          <p>We have recently overhauled the structure and the management of this part of asset managements. In time, that should lead to an improvement in investment performance and, in due course, client flows. But outflows, weak markets and currency fluctuations mean these invested assets fell over the quarter. However, revenues rose by 14% and that was due to an increase in performance fees, especially in A&amp;Q and in Brazilian Asset Management.</p>
          <p>So Marcel and Marco have already covered trends in FICC within the Investment Bank. So I'd like to highlight just a couple of trends in the other two business areas. Equities saw a strong recovery in revenues in the fourth quarter. In fact, the Equities division records the highest level of fourth quarter revenues ever. That performance was supported by some disposal gains and in particular, by the inclusion of a gain from owned credit in the quarter for the first time.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, this is a good result. It is consistent with other non-financial measures of success, including market share of client commissions in the cash business and our rankings in prime brokerage, which continue to improve.</p>
          <p>IBD had another excellent quarter. Revenues net of transfers to other parts of UBS set another new record for a fourth quarter, up 24% on the 2006 level. UBS' gross capital market and corporate finance fees for the full year were 7.7 billion francs, up 29% on 2006.</p>
          <p>According to Dealogic, for the whole of 2007, UBS' market share of the fee pool was 5.9%, so we ranked fifth compared with an eighth ranked position in 2006. We thought it would be useful to prepare a slide showing what the results would have been if it hadn't been for the subprime write-downs and losses in IB during the year.</p>
          <p>Looking first at revenues, total revenues were in fact a negative 538 million francs. But total subprime write-downs and losses in the second half, plus the negative revenues in DRCM in the first half were 18.5 billion francs. And most of this came from one single book, the super seniors. Excluding these, IB revenues would have been about 18 billion francs, down only somewhat from 2006. And on the same basis, profits in 2007 would have been respectable.</p>
          <p>In the full year 2007, Corporate Center recorded a pre-tax profit from continuing operations of 1.255 billion, I'm sorry. That improvement up from the loss of 1.087 billion a year earlier was mainly related to the 1.95 billion Swiss francs gained from the sale of the 20.8% stake in Julius Baer. In addition, there were positive cash flow hedges and higher income from the investment of equities, which also assisted the 2007 result.</p>
          <p>While all these developments helped operating income to rise by 2.248 million between 2007 and 2006, the higher levels of credit loss expense in 2007 moderated the increase.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand back to Marcel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I'm delighted that we were able to announce the appointment of Jerker Johansson as the new CEO of the Investment Bank. With his long experience and track record in many areas of investment banking both in the U.S. and Europe, Jerker ideally complements our leadership team.</p>
          <p>Jerker joins UBS from Morgan Stanley, where he was Vice Chairman Europe. In his 22 year career at Morgan Stanley, he was previously Head of the Institutional Equity Division and Co-Head of the Combined Equity and Fixed Income Trading and Sales businesses. He brings experience, a strong track record in building businesses and managing through challenging times with him. Jerker shares the same values about the culture we want to create and he shares our vision to continue building client driven growth businesses in investment banking. Last but not least, it is important to get an outside in perspective in the transformation we are currently going through.</p>
          <p>In addition to Jerker's appointment, we felt it is equally important to broaden the business group representation in the Group Executive Board and to strengthen the regional governance of the Group. This brings the Group Executive Board and the businesses much closer together.</p>
          <p>To reflect the growth and the importance of the regions, we appointed Robert Wolf to the Group Executive Board and Alexander Wilmot-Sitwell to be Chairman and CEO of the European, Middle East and African area. Alex will also join the Group Executive Board. Both Alex and Robert will keep their current responsibilities within the Investment Bank. Together with Rory Tapner, our Chairman and CEO of UBS APAC, they will represent the market perspective from their regions in our decision-making process. Marten Hoekstra's appointment will further reinforce the wealth management expertise at the GAAP level, as well as strengthening the insights into the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to be the Investment Bank with the fastest client driven growth. We don't want to be all things to all people. We will build and grow our Investment Bank as an integral part of the UBS Group, capitalizing on its unique strengths, our brand, our global presence, with particular emphasis on our strength in Europe and Asia and emerging markets, our number one position in investment banking in Asia, our leading equities business.</p>
          <p>Our emergence as leading M&amp;A advisors, our leadership in equity capital markets, our traditional strength in relationships with financial institutions, our leading position in foreign exchange, our leading position in risk management solutions for clients. And we aim to capture the specific opportunities arising from being the world's leading wealth manager and from our strong alternative and quantitative asset management platform.</p>
          <p>We will measure our success based on our ability to create shareholder value. Specific qualitative ambitions are our aim to achieve the leading position in terms of profitability in investment banking in Europe and Asia and continue to grow market share in the U.S. We maintain our number one position in equity capital markets and further our position as a leading M&amp;A advisory firm.</p>
          <p>We intend to be the world's leader in structured solutions for Wealth and Asset Management clients. We want to be the number one provider for asset managers and hedge funds, and we want to be the preferred global partner for financial institutions. We want to prioritize client service, breaking down silos between the product functions within the Investment Bank, through a combination of primary capital markets, the creation of dedicated structured product teams for Wealth Management, the consolidation of our electronic distribution, the integration of all the research and the global alignment of our financial institution group teams.</p>
          <p>How do we want to measure success? Defining and measuring success are critical to create clear responsibilities and send a clear message of what we hold ourselves accountable for in running the Investment Bank within UBS. As we reposition the investment banking line with the UBS Group strategy, we aim at simplifying our organizational structure and aligning closely to our client franchise.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we focused on a few tactical targets where we will strive to improve continuously. Headcount reductions; we have already reduced head count approximately by 1,330 and we expect to reach the 1,500 target in the first quarter. The repositioning of FICC and operational synergies from breaking down the silos will yield some additional head count reductions. Headcount development beyond these reductions will depend on market conditions, where we will adjust accordingly.</p>
          <p>Costs. For 2008, we aim to achieve a market reduction of our cost run rate before bonuses. Size of balance sheet. Our balance sheet target for the Investment Bank is 1.75 trillion by the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>In conjunction with these 2008 targets, we will be developing our long-term performance objectives around the following critical dimensions: Franchise growth measured in market share, growth in share of wallet; productivity, specifically in revenue per head; efficiency measures such as front-to-back ratio; non-personnel costs per head and others; and ultimately value creation, measured as free cash flow over the allocated equity.</p>
          <p>We know where we want to go. We have the leadership team in place and we are addressing the subprime problem. The market environment at the start of the year was challenging and the uncertainty remains high.</p>
          <p>I would like to make two final points. We continuously reduced and hedged and managed our exposures even in challenging markets and we had positive net new money in January.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and we now go over to questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Claudia Meier from Bank Vontobel.  So my first question would be on the positions. You have now disclosed further positions to the loan you have already disclosed.  Can we now be certain that you have an overview of all your positions and we will not be seeing new positions still coming to these positions?  That's basically my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question would be on Basel II.  You said that Basel II would negatively impact your BIS Tier 1 ratio.  I would like to know what kind of impact you anticipate.</p>
          <p>And the last question is on fixed income.  At the third quarter conference call you said that fixed income would be somewhere in the 205 to 206 area.  Can you now, with restructuring to the business, give here a guidance?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  With respect to the disclosure of positions, the basis we have applied is to disclose wherever we see material risk.  We have a 2 trillion balance sheet and this section is the comprehensive section on our U.S. real estate related exposures where we see material risk, and we consider it as comprehensive.</p>
          <p>Then the second question, with respect to the Tier 1 ratio, I'll ask Marco to respond.  And the third one, on the run-rate of FICC, I think it's critically important to differentiate between the workout portfolio and the remaining business.  I believe that we have, outside of the workout portfolio, obviously always depending on the market environment which can substantially change that, a fixed income business run-rate which is around 5 to U.S. $5.5 billion, which we think is solid.  But obviously the revenue depends always on the market circumstances as they develop.  And on BIS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the impact of Basel II, we had mentioned earlier last year that the impact might be 50 basis points.  We have continuously run parallel runs.  The latest parallel run was parallel run number six.  And we are still cleaning up some of the data.  But I think the 50 basis points that we had indicated earlier is not the best benchmark.  But I won't be able to give you a precise number right now, but it's not in the order of magnitude I have seen from some other banks.</p>
          <p>Basel II obviously will affect risk-weighted assets and equity.  Equity will reduce under Basel II because intangibles are treated differently.  Risk-weighted assets should not have a big impact and then the operational risk element is added.  But, for all intents and purposes, we'll publish that number the first time at the end of Q1 and I think there are bigger impacts than Basel II in Q1, such as the MCN issues, or, for example, the risk-weighted asset development as a result of the VaR backtesting exceptions or data series updating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kilian Maier, NZB, Neue Z&#xFC;rcher Bank.  The first question would be on net new assets.  When you announced your capital measures on December 10, you said net new assets growth in Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking were 30 billion for October and November, and for the full year that was 31.7, so that implies only 1.7 net new assets in December.  Is that a correct statement and is that the normal pattern for December?  That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one would be, you lived up to your promises and reduced the balance sheet and also worked on risk-weighted assets.  Could you say a little bit more on the pre-tax impact on that, from that reducing of the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  So let me address the pre-tax impact.  I think what you now see is that we had a record result for the equity business, we had a record result for the investment banking business and they are not affected by this.  So, the run-rates of that are intact and the growth of the business depends on the market environment and on the flows, client flows, as for the other business, and we've just addressed the remaining part, which is the fixed income business.  And that gives you the core profitability of the business.  And then there is the workout portfolio but I'm not going to predict, obviously, the further development of the real estate market.</p>

          <p>You asked about the net new money number where you deducted the 31.7 from the 30, we had communicated earlier.  What you need to understand with most of the numbers that we communicated on December 10, these were approximate numbers, so it would be wrong to deduct the December number from that number.  The final definitive number at the end of November was different from the 30 billion, but we are not going to disclose monthly net new money figures, neither for the past nor going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I actually had three questions.  Firstly, I wonder if you wanted to make any comment about Pactual and how integral and crucial a part of your fixed income business that was? I think that's one of your better-performing businesses, so presumably it's pretty important to your guidance, although I know that there's been some talk that that might be an asset that you could sell.  So any comments there could be interesting.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just a technical question.  You've obviously issued a lot of shares to your staff.  In the past you've bought back and neutralized share issuance to staff.  I just wondered if you could formally confirm that that will be the case for this share issuance, or will that be potential dilution?  So, just a firm statement there would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, just on cost control.  Looking back at, say, Q1 2005, clearly your fixed income guidance is, if anything, quite bearish at a 5, 5.5 billion run-rate compared to Q1 2005.  If I go back then, your Investment Bank had 16,764 employees according to your Q1 '05 report.  You currently have 21,932.  When you talk about market conditions guiding your cost control, is it reasonable to assume that if you were to go back to that kind of revenue environment, we should see head count going back to that kind of environment, or has there been an underlying deterioration in your investment banking productivity?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good.  Let me just tackle these three issues, starting with Pactual.  Pactual had indeed a stellar performance which was further boosted by these extraordinary profits through the demutualization of the Brazilian exchanges.  The business performance was actually strong across the board.  It's not particularly that the fixed income geared, as it was actually earlier.  It was very, very strong in equities.  It has a very strong equity capital market and IBD year, but also in fixed income.  So it was a balanced result.  And it's an asset which we like to own because I think it fits very well into our strategy.</p>
          <p>The issued shares, shares issued to staff, we will treat them as always and they will be bought back and they are not dilutive, so you can assume.</p>
          <p>Then on cost control, the comparison to 2005, in our case that was a particularly strong fixed income year, but your analysis, I think is directionally right.  I do believe that on your head count numbers we will be relatively rapidly at around the 21,000 number, and then it depends on the market development how we will react to that.  The 21,900 you mentioned are obviously excluding those people which are already on notice and will leave and then the additional, I said, due to the restructurings which I have initiated which will follow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning.  I also had three questions.  The first one is you told us your net new money in Wealth Management is positive in January, but I just wondered how that compares to previous Januarys.  We've heard from some of your competitors that they believe they're taking market share from you in Switzerland and I just wondered how worried you are that the Investment Bank problems were leading to some contagion in terms of net new money flows in the private bank.</p>
          <p>The second question and I think you may have just touched on this briefly in your introduction.  If you were to have taken the marks to the end of January rather than December, what additional losses might you anticipate on structured credit?</p>
          <p>And the final question is with regard to the mandatory convertible.  Is this an irrevocable commitment to money that you've got from your investors or are there any circumstances under which they could renegotiate?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do the number one and two and then I will ask Marco to do the three.  On net new money positive, we are defiantly not going to start to report monthly net new money number.  We can't do that because it's lumpy.  What I can say, it is positive, and what that new money means, there is always money coming in and money going out.  That's also true for us.  And clearly, we'll always find somebody who picks up a UBS client and we'll pick up clients from others, the question is how big it is in the end. And I'd say it is positive, and that's for us the most important part of it.</p>
          <p>And then same thing with marks, we are not going to mark our months.  We obviously do mark the books, but we're not going to report monthly marks and results and particularly not in these difficult, illiquid markets.  That would not be appropriate from our perspective.  Now, on the MCN, Marco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the MCN, for all intents and purposes, it is an irrevocable commitment.  It has standard conditions, but obviously does require, it requires approval by the EGM and we are confident that we will get the support from our shareholders for this important issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  Three questions.  I might ask them one by one just to make it simpler.  First, Marcel, you mentioned you wanted to shrink the balance sheet by &#x2013; in the order of that magnitude about 30%.  So taking you from 2.5 trillion to 1.7 trillion.  But I'm struck, given what you are announcing and what you've signaled your &#x2013; to dramatically downsize fixed income.  You probably don't need a balance sheet much more than a trillion or so.  How have your thoughts evolved over the last couple of months and could you maybe update us on what the new target would be?  And B, how do you think about what the earnings power of the Investment Bank is, as you have a dramatic multi-year shrinkage of the book?  Thanks.  And then I'll ask the other two questions later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I've actually already tried to answer that and I will just try to make myself a bit clearer here.  I think we should differentiate the three businesses as they are shown and presented in the results: equities, IBD and the fixed income.  I'm obviously not making any forecasts with respect to the market environment which drives these revenue lines, but we do have a very, very strong top-performing equity business, which is not affected by these balance sheet targets.  We have a top-performing IBD business which is not affected by these balance sheet targets.  And then we have the fixed income business, as I've said before, in dollars by the way.  What I think is its run-rate outside of the workout portfolio and a lot of balance sheet reductions come actually from the workout portfolio itself, as we said, in repo books there is more to come.  Then we are also reducing some balance sheet consuming relative value, proprietary trading books, where long and shorts are there, which takes some time to do that. And in that sense that gives you essentially the earnings power we see in the Investment Bank.  As of now, we have substantial growth potential in all businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  Second one's just on disclosure.  On the Q3 call, I think &#x2013; you remember I asked about the commercial mortgage backed securities. And you, at that stage, just thought there would be no losses and yet obviously we got our half billion today.  I think it would be very helpful if you could share any other mortgage exposures you've got, above and beyond the ones you've shared today, in particular I have to assume that you have a very large European mortgage portfolio, and I think it would certainly help us all if you could perhaps disclose that and any other mortgage portfolios you've got around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously we do have a variety of mortgage businesses. Our disclosure is a risk-based disclosure, which is why we have taken this comprehensive disclosure for the U.S. market, where we see the largest risk. We do have our Swiss mortgage book. That's where we are a direct lender. Then we have additional mortgage activities in Wealth Management, in direct mortgage lending and indeed Investment Bank. We do have mortgage-related derivatives and structured product trading throughout Europe, where we do buy and sell protection with underlying mortgage pools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly from my point of view &#x2013; and certainly and I think from investor's point of view, it'd be very helpful if at a later stage you might be able to share more color, particularly on the deterioration in the credit spreads of non-performing loans in the U.K. and certainly in Spain. And then just lastly, just on your accounts, I'm struck that you have been more aggressive than some of your peers. For instance, Merrill chose not to book the 2 billion CDS hedge on their ACA exposure, Deutsche chose not to fair value their own credit spreads, they're widening the impact on their notes. And if I just reverse those two features alone, you'd have lost 3.6 billion more than you've announced today and that's notwithstanding differences in models on the mortgages. So, two thoughts; one, how are your accountants feeling about the fact you have been more aggressive than some of your peers when signing off on the account? And number two, when you come to publish your final accounts on March 25, will there be a substantive section in there on post balance sheet events and marks? And if so, could I at least just in the spirit of openness perhaps encourage you to do a conference call then, if there are going to be significant further disclosures on what I assume is multiple-billion marks in Q1 as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Huw, I didn't quite get the first question. But on credit, this is &#x2013; I'm not aware that anybody's not booking it, because we are clearly under the direction by the accounting rules that we have to fair value adjust the liabilities for which we have opted fair value accounting rules and that's what we have taken, very much in line with that. In our case, the amount was smaller than in other cases, simply because our credit spread was still relatively strong compared to our banking competitors. Can you just repeat your first? You said something about the ABX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On your exposure to ACA, your monoline exposure, I think the ACA exposure which you've sort of mark-to-market today, Merrill's also had a 2 billion potential positive from marking their CDS to market, but they chose not to take it in their accounts because it hasn't actually come good and they haven't got the cash yet. You obviously chose to mark it. So I'm just struck with the difference there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a misunderstanding. Our exposure to ACA has been provisioned for 90%, so we have assumed a recovery rate of 10% and God knows what the final recovery rate will be. So but the unsecured exposure there, our unprovisioned exposure is de minimis. What we have done, we have the entire notional amount of the protection we have bought from them has now been included in subprime as if the protection were not to exist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But for the exposure, we have taken a 90% provision. I think somebody has taken out 100% provision, but that does not explain the 2 billion delta at all. I mean we are talking about tens of millions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the notional is 1.8 of the exposure and the provision we have shown on the subprime is largely that provision, which is 90% of the markdown of the 1.8 notional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Notional is 1.8, the value 1.2. We now have the full value in there and the difference between the notional and the value is in essence what we have taken as credit exposure to the monoline, and which we have reserved 90%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Offline, I'll send you a couple of things which one or two of the competitors have given, because I do think certainly one or two of your competitors have chosen not to take the fair value on the credit spreads. But in terms of the post balance sheet events and whether you would &#x2013; whether there will be a substantive statement on March 25, which we should expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, I think we just follow the normal disclosure rules. If we have to disclose, we disclose. And other than that, you said if our accountants are happy to sign off, we have basically just disclosed these results according to all these rules of disclosure, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have at the present time no indications that we will have post-closure events.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have got a few questions, first of all your convertible. There's concern that, as you have given new material disclosure today, and as a result one of the investors could potentially pull out of the convertible. Could you please give me an indication of max losses, give me an indication of, are you having discussions with your investor base that will provide the convertible? The second question is on your fixed income business. When I strip out your write-downs as well as your hedge gains and your capital gain from the disposal of the Brazilian Stock Exchange business, I basically get to a negative revenue run rate in fixed income. Can you explain why I get to a negative number in the fourth quarter? And the third question is on the break-up of your Group, considering that you're destructing material value through your holdings, which really come out of the investment banking business. I'm trying to understand why you're not considering a break-up scenario at this point and leave it to shareholders to decide at the upcoming AGM. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last question first. I think it is important to see how the Investment Bank result is composed and where the losses are coming from. And as we have demonstrated, actually, in one of the slides Tom has presented, it really is a very, very small part. In fact, almost one set of positions in subprime super senior CDOs, which has created that situation and led to these unacceptable results. So we think it is the best interest of our shareholders that we fix that problem. And that's what we are doing, by creating a workout group, by addressing these exposures and maintaining the value in the business and continue to grow the value of the business.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter FICC, I think that you are absolutely right, you can take the losses to 13.7 billion, translated in Swiss francs 15.6. That's roughly exactly the negative of FICC, then that's zero. And what you then have is a few more zeros, such as the commercial mortgage backed part, and you have extraordinary income. And that shows you that there were some businesses which did well, that's the FX money market business, which did well, but clearly the credit business &#x2013; and some parts of rates, but the credit business suffered from the difficult environment and the credit spread environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I can just interrupt there, I get to a loss of about 900 million in fixed income revenues on a clean basis. Considering you're such a big rates and FX player, where you must have made a lot of money, I don't understand how you can lose 900 million in one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would suggest that we take it offline with IR, where you can actually reconcile all the numbers to your point. I think with the numbers we have presented I think you will be clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question was regarding the convertible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Marco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not aware of any such max clause. Our attempt was always to raise final capital and not conditional capital, and that's why we went this route. I'm not aware of any such clause.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you had discussions with the two main parties already, following the new disclosure you gave today? And their commitment, can you say that they're fully committed to this convertible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the last discussions we had with them, which was not after today's disclosure because we are still in today's disclosure, I can say they are still strongly, firmly standing behind their commitment in view of the long-term investment horizon they have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I can add one more question, if I may, the new CEO and Chairman of the Investment Bank. Generally, when you have management changes of this kind, you we will see material changes in the Investment Bank. Is this what you expect to happen, material changes in terms of the way you manage the Group and the way in terms of potential changes in the structure and strategy of the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we signed, we had extensive discussions about the way forward and I think we are totally aligned. And I think the most important element is that we get our short-term tactical goals in place and prepare the ground that we can run it in a way that is consistent with our goal to create shareholder value. And Jerker and I have had intensive discussions about it and I think we are totally aligned. Of course, he will also bring his experience to the table and it will be his contributions, which might lead to some further developments but fundamentally, we are aligned already now where we want to go, consistent with the statements I have made at the end of my presentation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I ask a number of questions? Basically, firstly, you mentioned you've been selling some assets within your problem exposures in January or February. Have you actually been able to sell, though, anything of the subprime residential mortgage, so the $27 billion? And the second area is when you're talking about some of the private bank, you seem to say that if equity markets don't recover or the Swiss franc stays where it is, obviously the cost incremation could go up. Could you talk a bit more about what you could do on costs or is there a scenario where we could see the private bank actually falling in pre-tax terms in '08 on '07? And then could you also talk about how the customers are reacting to the market? So, are they deleveraging their portfolios and is that having a marked impact on your margins in the private bank? And then, finally, also when you talked about the net new money positive, was that in Wealth Management, because obviously you've got a lot of different divisions, there's lots of different net new moneys, or is it Wealth Management International in Switzerland? Could you just be a bit more specific? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start from the back and I'll hand over to Marco. Net new money, it concerns Wealth Management, not Asset Management, Wealth Management. That's what I've said and it's all Wealth Management. Then we don't see a deleveraging but obviously we see a slowdown in leveraging of the portfolios. And for private banking, the statement simply says if the asset base we have is impacted by market developments, such as downturn in equity markets or the change in currency, and it goes down as a result of that, the fee-based income also goes down. That's a very fundamental mechanism, I think. We don't want to forecast here what the equity market is at the end of the year, or the U.S. dollar. You can make that forecast by yourself. And that was basically the principle which was stated, if the asset base goes down then obviously the revenue number goes down. That's the exogenous factor driving the revenue line of the Wealth Management business. On the exposures, Marco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the exposures, they have come down in January and further in February across all of the mortgage-related asset classes, including the super senior exposures. We had a number of events of defaults in January, which is a good development or can be a good development. What happens in an event of default is the super senior structure collapses and the underlying assets, to which we had no direct recourse in the beginning, are auctioned off in the process and during that auctioning off process, we have further reduced our super senior exposure. We have taken some of the exposure into our RMBS exposure, but the net effect of these auctions was a reduction in our exposure.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Thank you. Three quick questions please. Firstly, could you give us an indication of your prime U.S. mortgage exposure, CDOs and RMBS? Secondly, could you give us an indication of the vintage mix of your subprime CDOs, subprime RMBS and Alt-A? And thirdly, you've shown very strong equities revenues here. I just wonder to what extent you view those as recurrent and continuing into '08. Have we seen a continuation of that strength in January '08, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the equity revenues. The fourth quarter had two effects. It had a positive effect due to extraordinary gains, due to the disposal of the exchange seats, but it had some challenges in the proprietary trading area. The net effect of which says, I believe, that the equity run rate of 2007 is sound, obviously depending on the market development, but it's sound. The vintage and rest of the exposure question, Marco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had disclosed vintage information before on our super senior positions in subprime, and there the guidance we have given is that more than a third of our exposure were vintages 2005 and earlier. That, to my knowledge, is still true because we have not changed the composition of that portfolio that much and I would expect that these events of default probably were more affecting newer vintages, so the net effect will be that we probably have a higher proportion of older vintages. On the portfolio of subprime relative to our RLN, we have shown you the vintage information on the PowerPoint and there it's even older vintages. On Alt-A, I don't have the vintage information.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning. I've got three questions. Firstly, given your very strong position in the U.S. municipal market, if you could provide us with some comments about what you've seen in that market generally and what that means for UBS? Secondly, a question on the ABS CDO business, given that you were leading underwriters my question is, we've identified a lot of the super senior tranches across various banks, including yourselves. Who do you believe holds the junior tranches and do you believe that they have actually marked down, as they should have such exposures? And finally, outside of monolines, could you generally talk about where you see counterparty and credit risk going over the next, let's say, six to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start with the junior tranches and then Munis, and for monolines and credit I would hand over to Marco. Well the junior tranches, I'd say everybody's under this. Most of the people are under the same accounting rules and I guess they follow the rules and value these tranches accordingly and I can't really speak for the books and records of others and who is holding them at the moment. Most of them will be substantially written down and impaired.</p>
          <p>The municipal market in the U.S. has several aspects. I mean there is on the one hand is the whole question on monoline wraps and how they're impacted, and then on the other hand it's the structure of some of the bonds and how they are issued and then remarketed. Fundamentally, I think the municipal bond market is a sound market. These are usually tax-receiving entities which are issuing bonds and we believe the market per se and these entities are from a credit standpoint largely good and sound.</p>
          <p>Then, of course some of the paper was in hand, credit in hand, by way of monoline wrappers. We believe that the substantial part of potential downgrades is already priced in. The market, when these securities trade, it is always hard to say what happens then, if it's getting worse, how much is that already anticipated, but general expectation is that this is largely priced in. And then, on credit monoline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On credit and monoline, how our credit exposure to the monolines will develop depends very much on the value of the underlying assets. So, if we see a further deterioration in the value that will lead to an ultimate increase in our monoline exposure. So that is clearly linked. As to the credit quality of the monoline, I cannot speculate as to how exactly that will affect the monolines.</p>
          <p>What we have not shown you or told you in our presentation is that we do have some credit hedges against our monoline exposures. We have not shown them because the hedge effectiveness of these hedges can happen in quite a different accounting period, so we do not want to overemphasize the hedges. But obviously, we manage our credit risk to the monolines actively throughout this period.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Derek De Vries, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually I have a few questions and maybe we can just pick up on that last statement you just made. You said you had some hedges against the monolines. Presumably, those hedges are through CDS on the monolines, so presumably the gains on those hedges have been coming through the income statement as the CDS has been marked to market. If you could just confirm that or if you're talking about some other kind of hedge.</p>
          <p>The second question I had relates to the treasury shares. Now, in your statements it looks like you're still holding those treasury shares. I'm just wondering, is there some technical reason you're still holding those treasury shares or are you waiting for the share price to rebound? Or maybe you could just tell us if there's some requirement to hold them or if you could sell them whenever?</p>
          <p>And then I wonder if you could comment on your correlation trading book and how big that book is? That's an area that investors are concerned about. And then a last question. You've done a very good job explaining these reference-linked notes and I think we all understand them now. What you haven't said is why you hold them. Was this just a plain old yield pick-up where you were funding yourself cheaply? Or was it somehow related to a client business, or maybe you could just tell why you hold these reference-linked notes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the last question. Basically, this goes back off what I said at the very beginning. This is essentially a trade where you create carry. And if you have cheap funding to acquire these assets and structure it that way, you can create a income. And that's all it is and that's precisely the type of transactions we think we don't need to do, to be a client-driven growth company. It's the best example. So the why to that is simple. It's a carry trade. And if it's fair value, you actually make the money up front.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Monoline hedge, yes, your assumption is correct. It's mainly through CDS, credit default swaps.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a third one. Treasury shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we always hold treasury shares. Most of the treasury shares we do require to hedge our employee stock programs and employee stock option programs. As you will remember, we went to the AGM in I think it was 2006, to ask for conditional capital. That conditional capital was only approved for employee stock options issued after that date, and we still hedge all the other programs using treasury shares.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You had another question on the correlation book, could you specify which kind of correlation trades you mean? Okay, sorry. So can IR follow-up on that question please.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just two questions. One is on compensation expense in the Investment Bank. In your financial report, you state that you're going to restate the compensation expense for '07. And can you give us a guidance, a feel for by what kind of number you're likely to restate that, and whether that's an overall up or down? It sounds like it's an up. And the second question is, you mentioned in passing that you have repo exposures to counterparties who have posted structured paper. Can you give us a feel on how much structured paper we're talking about and what kind of counterparties these are, and whether that would feed into your overall U.S. residential mortgage portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the comp expense, we will publish that when we publish our annual results. Up or down, the loss would be slightly bigger under the restatement, so going forward I think the expense line should therefore come down. On this structured repo, we actually have a fairly small amount of structured repo, which we finance as part of our prime brokerage operation. These were one or two funds. One, I think, highly published fund of one of our competitor institutions who had failed in Q4, and where we had some of this exposure. In the overall order of magnitude, this amounts to maybe 50 or 60 million of these defaults on the repo book combined. And they were included in that credit loss number simply because the repo book follows accrual accounting treatment.</p>

      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Derek Chambers, Standard &amp; Poor's. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Derek Chambers from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Could we just come back to the fixed income trading? I know you've gone through it a lot. But first of all, you've identified two special items affecting both sides of trading, that's about 634 million gains on the different Brazilian exchanges and then 659 million on owned liabilities. And I think you're indicating that this is in both fixed income and equity trading. Could you give some broad indication as to the split, is it 50/50 or is it some other split?</p>
          <p>And then on your fixed income underlying ex write-downs result, one element of it seems to be that you had losses on negative revenues on trading with clients in credit business. Could you just say how this occurs and is it market making or some other type of activity?</p>
          <p>And elsewhere on the Wealth Management business, the international business, could you say something about current trends and your expectations for client business in areas such as Latin America, where clearly you're doing well in investment banking? Is that also being reflected in your Wealth Management business? And also, what are your expectations in Asia? You've had some regulatory difficulties in India, but presumably your contact in other areas like Singapore have improved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, it's roughly 50/50, that's correct. And in fixed income, it was just a very difficult environment. Apart from all the issues we've identified, which actually largely explain it, there was also a weak credit trend, which we have outlined also in our report. And that basically means it's with respect to assets and positions we hold, partially in proprietary trading books, which are in the process of diminishing, and partially in the market-making books.</p>
          <p>And the last one on Wealth Management, could you just repeat that question? I wasn't exactly sure. Our focus in emerging markets, there we are doing exceptionally well. Actually, the fastest-growing part is APAC. Some of these markets you could probably no longer call emerging markets, but that's basically developing very, very well and the Brazilian business has done very well too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's no more questions on the line, so let's have one more from the room before we go to the media.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am Dirk Becker from Landsbanki Kepler. I would like to ask a question about the dividend. I haven't seen the statement in your report anywhere. I think the last guidance was that you still wanted to pay an unchanged dividend. And when you announced that you had an assumption on the dilution effect that this would have &#x2013; but since then the share price has fallen, and it might fall further under your AGM. So the question is, are you still firm on your announcement that you would pay an unchanged divided no matter where the share price goes from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have announced it. I think we have actually announced the maximum amount of number of shares of dividend. So if you take today's share price, it could well be that it's not exactly going to be at the 2.40 &#x2013; 2.20 francs level. That 2.20 level, I think, was at the share price of about 44. We have never said that we are going to pay 2.20 francs. We said approximately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then we have a quick break and then we do the session.</p>
