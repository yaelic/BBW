        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for attending our first quarter web cast. Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations; and Matt White, Vice President and Controller are with me this morning. Liz will review our first quarter results. Afterwards, I'll discuss the current business environment, our outlook for the balance of 2010 and our earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Liz?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 3 in our presentation for a summary of our first quarter results. Please note that these results and the year-over-year earnings comparisons have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation which was announced in January. This resulted in a one-time pre-tax charge to our earnings this quarter of 27 million, 26 million after-tax and $0.08 of earnings per share.</p>
          <p>As you will recall, the earnings guidance we gave you in January for the first quarter and for the full year of 2010 excluded this charge. A reconciliation of these results to our GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Praxair's results in the first quarter reflect improving global business fundamentals, though the strength of the improvement we have seen varies considerably by geography. Volumes have picked up sequentially in all our regions, led by Asia and South America. The modest overall sequential volume growth we reported was muted because March was kind of an inflation point following demand levels in January and February that were pretty much on a par with December. So this should position us well for incremental growth in the second quarter given that the March trends are holding or slightly improving in April.</p>
          <p>Sales in the quarter were 2.4 billion, 14% above the prior year. Higher volumes contributed 6% growth and foreign currency appreciation contributed 7%. Volume growth came primarily from higher sales to chemicals, metals and electronics customers, whose production levels were very low a year ago as these three industries were working through significant inventory destocking.</p>
          <p>New plant start-ups in Asia also contributed to volume growth. Operating profit was 506 million in the quarter, up 14% from the prior year, in line with our sales growth and the operating margin was 20.8%, also in line with the prior year quarter. Higher volumes of base business atmospheric gases contributed a high incremental margin in the 30% to 40% range. However, this is masked primarily because last year we were collecting take-or-pay revenue from a number of large on-site customers.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of 2009 was our volume trough and therefore, the quarter when take-or-pay revenue was the highest. Secondly, to date electronics has shown the fastest and strongest volume recovery and electronics process gases have lower margins than atmospherics.</p>
          <p>Higher cost pass-through also had a modest negative effect on the margin percentage. So we do expect that the incremental margin contribution from the recovery of our base business volumes will be more evident as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Net income was 340 million and 14% of sales. Net income grew 17% from 2009, a higher increase than the increase in operating profit due to lower interest expense. Interest expense this quarter was lower than we had forecasted due to strong cash flow generation in several of our countries with higher interest rate debt.</p>
          <p>We expect it to trend upwards over the next few quarters and be in a range of 140 million to $150 million for the year. Earnings per share were $1.09, 17% above prior year. We generated 483 million of operating cash flow this quarter, primarily from net income and depreciation. This cash flow is 20% of sales due to the fixed cost reductions we implemented last year and our ongoing tight control of working capital.</p>
          <p>This cash flow funded 288 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, related primarily to construction spending on the large on-site projects in our backlog. Our free cash flow after CapEx of 195 million funded 138 million of dividends and 68 million of stock repurchases, net of issuances.</p>
          <p>The reason our total debt increased from year-end was because in January, we took advantage of very attractive rates in the bond market and issued 500 million of 3 year notes at a coupon of 2.125%. These proceeds will be used to pay off a note issue that matures in May. At the end of the quarter, this cash was sitting on our balance sheet because we had paid down essentially all our commercial paper and U.S. short-term bank borrowings with the proceeds of the over $2 billion of note issues we executed over the past 12 months, locking in very attractive low-cost financing.</p>
          <p>Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 13.6%. This number was impacted by the cash, which is temporarily on our balance sheet held for debt repayment, and also the significant amount of capital tied up on our balance sheet in construction in progress.</p>
          <p>This capital doesn't generate revenue until projects are completed and start supplying product. The impact of construction in progress on our reported return on capital is over 2 percentage points. However, these projects are high-return projects, which will generate meaningful future sales and earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were 1.24 billion, 6% above prior year. Higher volumes contributed 4% growth and currency appreciation in Canada and Mexico, 3%, offset slightly by 1% lower price mix. The strongest volume growth came from chemicals, steel and electronics customers.</p>
          <p>Sales to the energy market, ex natural gas, were lower due to continued weak oil well service activity. Last year's first quarter was the peak for our fracing volumes in Canada. So the year-over-year comparison is difficult. Oil wells services revenues in Mexico are below 2009 levels due to lower spending by PEMEX, but we expect these volumes to increase over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>On-site volumes were 13% above the 2009 first quarter and grew 2% from the fourth quarter sequentially, driven primarily by higher pipeline oxygen and nitrogen volumes. Our oxygen pipeline volumes have rebounded significantly from the low point, but are still about 15% below 2008 levels. Demand for hydrogen from refiners has been steady and volumes are above last year.</p>
          <p>Merchant liquid volumes were 2% above prior-year. Excluding our fracing business, volume growth was 6%. Liquid oxygen and argon volumes increased year-over-year and sequentially due to higher demand from steel producers. We began to see a modest pick up in demand in March in the U.S. and Canada. Liquid hydrogen and helium volumes were higher to electronics and solar customers. Liquid volumes in Mexico showed strong sequential growth of 5% from the fourth quarter. Total liquid volumes in North America were 5% higher sequentially.</p>
          <p>Packaged gases in the U.S. and Canada continue to be slow to recover. This is attributable to the fact that within the manufacturing sector, non-residential construction, infrastructure spending, equipment and welding activity are still weak. Higher auto production and appliance manufacturing should provide lift going forward. Total North American packaged gases sales were 1% below prior-year. In Mexico, packaged volumes were higher due to improving domestic manufacturing demand.</p>
          <p>In PDI, our business in the U.S. and Canada, sales, ex-currency, were down 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Sequentially, we have started to see some volume pick up, but it is stronger in hardgoods than gases, which is typical in the very early stages of an economic recovery.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in North America increased 8% to 277 million and the operating margin increased to 22.4%. The margin improvement is due to higher volumes and the substantial cost reduction actions in 2009, but is mitigated by the large customer take-or-pays we were receiving a year ago.</p>
          <p>New business activity is picking up and is increasingly broad-based in food, chemicals, metals, manufacturing, refining and environmental applications. So we expect a stronger second quarter in North America.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were 338 million, up 12% from prior year. Higher volumes contributed 7% growth and currency 5%. Volume growth came primarily from higher on-site oxygen and nitrogen sales in Spain and Germany to steel and chemical customers. Liquid volumes are also up about 10% year-over-year. Liquid volumes are recovering across the region and volumes are higher than last year in Germany, Spain and Italy versus a very weak quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Auto production is increasing and exports are stronger in Germany. New business activity and contract signings are positive and above 2009 levels. Both on-site and merchant volumes grew sequentially from the fourth quarter. Packaged gases sales recovery is lagging on-site in merchant. Construction activity remains weak especially in Spain.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $67 million, up 6% from the prior year. We expect to see continued recovery in Europe, but expect it to be slow. The strong volume increases this quarter reflect increased production by large customers who are making global commodities and exporting to the world market. After some restocking, sequential demand growth could slow in the second half. Merchant, liquid and packaged gas volumes are more reliant on local consumption and an increase in manufacturing and construction activity and our expectation is that these will be slower to pull out of the downturn.</p>
          <p>Please look at slide 6 for our South America results. Sales in South America were 458 million compared to 353 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 30%. Currency appreciation, primarily the Brazilian real, increased sales by 21%. Underlying sales grew 12% and 3% sequentially from higher volumes and higher price.</p>
          <p>Industrial production in Brazil has rebounded strongly from negative 15% in last year's first quarter to positive 12% in this year's first quarter. Steel production in February was almost 50% above February 2009, but still 25% below peak production in 2008. Our on-site volumes are up strongly on a year-over-year basis and have continued to improve sequentially driven by oxygen demand.</p>
          <p>Low interest rates in Brazil, by historical standards, and credit availability have provided economic stimulus and supported domestic consumer demand. Merchant volumes are higher versus prior year and last quarter. As in our other regions, packaged gases are recovering more slowly along with general manufacturing, but volumes are up 5% sequentially. Overall sales to manufacturing are up 10% from the fourth quarter. We expect strong growth in South America to continue in the base business from new applications and new project startups. We have 7 projects scheduled to start up over the balance of this year and we are looking at numerous new project opportunities. Our healthcare business in Brazil also continues to grow steadily.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased to 109 million from 75 million in the prior year and operating margin was 23.8%. The operating leverage came from strong incremental margins on higher volumes, higher pricing, productivity gains and cost reduction in 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 7 shows our results in Asia. Asia had a very strong quarter with sales of 258 million, up 43% from 2009 due primarily to 31% volume growth. This growth came from significant growth in on-site and liquid volumes in China, India and Korea due to broad-based demand across most end markets.</p>
          <p>Oxygen volumes are growing in China due to strong steel demand fuelled by auto production and infrastructure spending on roads, tunnels and rail. In March, China produced 1.7 million automobiles, more than U.S. production. Higher cost pass-through and currency appreciation added 14% to sales growth and price mix was down 2%.</p>
          <p>Electronics sales have completely recovered from last year's low point, up 88%, excluding FX. The mix effect of such strong electronic sales is the primary reason that overall price is negative 2% and that our operating margin percentage declined.</p>
          <p>Merchant pricing in atmospheric gases is stable and beginning to firm due to strong demand and tighter capacity.</p>
          <p>Merchant sales in China were at record levels in March from strong demand from glass, chemicals, electronics and MetFab customers. In India, strong growth in merchant sales was driven by steel, pharma and auto. Carbon dioxide sales in Thailand for food freezing were also strong. In Korea, on-site and merchant volumes are sharply higher due to demand from electronics as well as general industry.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we started up 2 plants in China. New business activity is robust in both China and India. There are many new large project opportunities. We are sticking to our strategy of selectively pursuing sale of gas, not sale of plant, opportunities where we can get good returns and can grow the merchant liquid business locally.</p>
          <p>We have a strong project pipeline in Asia. Several projects in China will start up this year, but the larger projects we are working on, such as our second 3,000 ton oxygen plant to supply coal gasification and our large hydrogen plant for Indian Oil Company, start up in 2011 and 2012. So we are confident that our strong growth in Asia will continue.</p>
          <p>Page 8 shows Surface Technologies results. PST sales this quarter were 136 million compared to 123 million in 2009's first quarter. Sales increased 7%, ex-currency effects, due to the $20 million in sales from Sermatech, which we acquired last July. Overall coating volumes at Sermatech were lower than the prior year.</p>
          <p>Industrial gas turbine coatings are down due to weak IGT builds by the major manufacturers resulting from the economic downturn and the credit crisis. But we are forecasting a pick up in these volumes in the second half of 2010, in line with the manufacturers increasing forecasts for new builds.</p>
          <p>EBPVD jet engine coatings, which are used in the new GE GEnx engines and will power the 787 and 747-8 planes, were strong and above prior year, but more conventional aerospace coatings declined. We are expecting EBPVD volumes to pick up in the second half as more planes are delivered and as spares for rebuilt engines pick up along with growth in passenger miles flown.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of 19 million compares to 22 million in the prior year. The margin decline is due to lower volumes and Sermatech acquisition integration expenses, which has offset the profit contribution from Sermatech in the last 2 quarters.</p>
          <p>Our integration plan will be completed on schedule next quarter. We will have closed 5 of 11 manufacturing sites, reduced head count by 150 people and consolidated admin and back office processes. So PST's operating margin should improve to the high-teens range by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going turn this over to Jim who will give you more detail on our end market trends and discuss our earnings guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Liz. Please look at page 9. We showed you this slide last quarter to show the sales trends we've seen from peak to trough in 4 of our key end markets. We've indexed our sales for the third quarter of 2008, which was pretty close to the peak in these markets.</p>
          <p>We updated this quarter to illustrate the sequential improvement we've seen from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the end of March. This also gives you a visual of where we are now relative to the third quarter of 2008. What you can see is that electronics was the most cyclical end market in the downturn. We fell the furthest, recovered the fastest and sales volumes are now above previous peak levels.</p>
          <p>Chemicals and metals continue to recover and showed positive sequential growth this quarter. Our global sales to both markets are still modestly below the 2008 third quarter. We expect continued growth in these markets and we are forecasting a slower sequential growth rate in the second half of the year as we believe that inventory restocking has been a part of the increased demand we've seen to date.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing has been slower to recover. As Liz mentioned in the regional discussions, we began to see sub sequential pick up in March and you can see that on this graph. However, we're still about 13% below the peak and so this end market represents a great source of upside to earnings as volumes continue to recover.</p>
          <p>Page 10 gives you some more detail on our end market sales trends both year-over-year and sequentially. Let me make a few comments here on the energy market. This quarter, our sales to the energy market are a little lower, but this is not a long-term trend. We see this market as a solid source of revenue growth for us in the future.</p>
          <p>The largest piece of our energy sales is hydrogen sold to refiners. Hydrogen demand remained very steady through the downturn and our volumes in the quarter were above prior-year. We expect continued growth from new project opportunities to supply refiners outside of North America who are expanding refining capacity and outsourcing some hydrogen supply.</p>
          <p>As an example, in November, we announced a large contract where hydrogen and nitrogen supply to Indian Oil's new refinery being built on the East Coast of India. New projects will be the principle driver of future hydrogen revenues.</p>
          <p>These two large projects in our backlog in North America, the first of which is expected the start up in the back half of 2010 and the Indian Oil project is scheduled for 2012. We'll be selective about the projects we bid on and disciplined about returns and we're interested only in built, own and operate, not large plant sales.</p>
          <p>There are significant opportunities around the world in geographies where we have a very strong presence. Our liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide volumes for oil and gas well fracing in North America are well below prior year, as Liz mentioned, and any significant recovery will depend on the outlook for higher natural gas prices and drilling activity. Volumes declined over the course of 2009 and so after this quarter will not be as much of a negative comparison in our merchant volumes.</p>
          <p>In addition, these lower volumes have had a negative mix effect on our North American merchant pricing. In February, we announced a contract with ExxonMobil to build a new plant to supply nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery in Hawkins, Texas.</p>
          <p>We're optimistic that over the long-term we will see more EOR project opportunities around the world as energy demand increases and producers look to increase production from existing reserves. This month we announced that we will be supplying CO2 under contract for an enhanced oil recovery pilot project in Abu Dhabi, with Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company or Masdar.</p>
          <p>The Middle East has an abundance of energy-related projects going on, but to date has not been a region where Praxair has participated as many of the opportunities have just been equipment sales. We've had business development people on the ground in Abu Dhabi for a while looking to see if there is an opportunity to develop an integrated industrial gas business in the region.</p>
          <p>Another energy opportunity is nitrogen dilution for LNG, and we recently announced a project with Chevron and Total to supply nitrogen at the Sabine Pass receiving terminal in Louisiana. This is not a large investment, but these projects are all examples of opportunities for industrial gases in the energy sector and why we feel bullish about this market over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page 11 for earnings guidance. In the second quarter of 2010, our earnings guidance is for earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.15. This represents sequential improvement from the first quarter based on the trends we're seeing. We're raising our EPS guidance for the full year of 2010 to a range of 4.50 to 4.65, excluding the $0.08 negative impact in the first quarter resulting from the Venezuela currency's devaluation.</p>
          <p>This represents year-over-year earnings growth of 13% to 17% and is well above Praxair's peak earnings in 2008 of $4.20. Our earnings guidance including the Venezuela charge is 4.42 to 4.57.</p>
          <p>We expect full-year sales to be in the area of 10 billion. The effective tax rate is expected to remain at 28% and we still expect CapEx for this quarter to be about -- for the year, to be about 1.4 billion. Large project activity around the world is picking up from what we were seeing in 2009. The bulk of these projects are in South America and Mexico, India and China, where we have a very strong presence, a history of successful project execution and integrated businesses, which allow us to get good returns on the capital we invest.</p>
          <p>Our large project backlog at the end of the first quarter included 38 projects. This quarter, we started up 6 plants with a capital value of about $140 million. We added 4 new projects with a capital value of about $170 million. The size of our backlog is holding up and start up dates are now extending out into early 2013.</p>
          <p>If you look at the chart on page 12, you could see how fast we're growing in Asia. Of 13% growth over 6 quarters, 8% was for project start-ups, and 5% was organic growth from peak to trough. Emerging markets represent about 34% of our global sales, which is a higher percentage than our competitors. I also believe we're winning more new business in China, India, South America and Mexico. This is a result of our reputation and demonstrated ability to execute in emerging economies. Additionally, our standard plant designs are a key factor in our ability to win business at high returns due to lower capital investment, better energy efficiency and greater reliability.</p>
          <p>In addition, our base business in North and South America and Europe has a significant way to go to get back to pre-crisis operating levels. As you see them down 7 to 10% realize that we also had 3 to 5% contribution from new project start-ups so the dip in the base business is actually lower than it appears, implying more upside as the economy recovers.</p>
          <p>In closing, I believe the outlook is clearly improving. Emerging markets are experiencing significant expansion, which is being led by internal demand and consumption while the mature markets are recovering from the depths of 2009.</p>
          <p>And now I'll be happy to take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions if I can. First of all, excited about refinery hydrogen projects, but Jim, would you be able to give us any kind of an update with respect to Chevron at Richmond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The Chevron Richmond story continues to unfold and drag on. They recently had a court decision, which requires them to rewrite and resubmit the environmental impact in court and so that's just going to be a delay as we see it in the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Secondly, a housekeeping question, can you give us the positive impact on PDI from currency? Both the loonie, I assume, but also the peso?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's about 3%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally, on a more of a secular long-term basis, I guess I'm a little surprised that there hasn't been more gaseous nitrogen plants built for EOR, either here in the U.S. or Mexico or Middle East. Any reasons why the industry hasn't taken advantage of that in terms of high oil prices and maybe what the outlook is for that particular application?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a good question. And I'm surprised it hasn't picked up faster than that as well. But I do believe that over time, there will continue to be more EOR projects.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Yeah, good morning. Just two quick questions. One, tied actually a little bit to the last one. But with such a big push into the shale, gas plays and things like that, why was your oil well services business weak in the quarter, because I would think it would be actually seeing pretty decent sequential growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, what's actually happening is that the big push in the deeper shales, which is what everybody's activities around are so deep that you really can't use gases for enhanced oil recovery. So they're using water for fracing and consequently, we're really not going to participate in that market because the wells are so deep that you would have to inject so much nitrogen or CO2 down there, that just wouldn't be practical. And I think one of the reasons that they are down a little bit is because there is more activity going over to those shale reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then just with regard to Brazil, it sounds like you've got a lot of start-ups coming up over the next couple of quarters. Any impact on the margins there or is it just a big enough business right now where even bringing up 6 or 7 new plants isn't going to really move the needle in terms of start-up costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically the start-ups are going to be on-site plants, okay. And on-site plants have a lower asset turnover, but a higher margin than the average of the business when you include merchant and package. So the start-ups, once they get ramped up to expected capacity, will increase the operating margin there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In China there seems to be mad rush of coal-related projects, coal to methanol, coal to olefins, basically coal to anything. How significant is this opportunity for the on-site project business that you would like to participate in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're looking at quite a few of those projects and they basically all require large volumes of oxygen. And we're negotiating a couple. As you know, we're building 2 right now. We're in the process of negotiating a handful more and I think ultimately that'll probably be the biggest end-market for industrial gases in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on slide 4 you commented that your packaged gas sales have been down 4% in the U.S., Canada. What has been your historical expectation, by how much this business will lag the pace of the general economic recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think basically the packaged gas business is really about 50% no fabrication and weldings. And so some part of that business is just steady day in and day out maintenance and repair work, things that have to be done. Other parts of the business are tied to the physical capital investment cycle, such as non-residential construction, equipment and machinery, things like rail cars and so forth. And I think that part will recover when the rest of the manufacturing and the process economies gets back to full capacity utilization. So I think there's going to be a longer ramp up in packaged gases.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think based on what Liz said, you're seeing good incremental margins, but it's not apparent in the numbers yet. So is it fair to say that your margins will improve with the lag of couple of quarters? And would you say that maybe your second half margins would be better than first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They should be. And basically when you look at our underlying business where volume's coming back, we're getting 30 to 40% margin on that. But there are a couple of mitigating factors, particularly in this quarter, which should basically not be important going more. But part of those is that a year ago, we had a number of on-site contracts where we were operating take-or-pay. And so we were receiving the payment, but we weren't producing the volume. And so as that volume went up, we're not making any more money for that. So that's a damper on the margin expansion. But at this point in time, we've moved through the threshold level of almost every take-or-pay contract. So we should get more leverage going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On top of that, we've got some higher expense from pension expense and incentive comp and so forth, which are just some inflation is up year-over-year. And then lastly, the areas where we had the greatest sales growth, like in electronics, are the areas we have lowest margin. So we have some kind of negative mix effect on the whole thing.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, the areas where we're going to get the biggest operating margin leverage are going to be in liquid volume and packaged gas volume. And those are the areas that still haven't recovered as much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Jim, I have a second question about margins and returns. Several times in the past you've talked about hydrogen business having lower margins than Lox and Lin. So can you compare capital investment for a hydrogen plant versus an ASU and compare return on capital on similarly sized projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The common denominator is the internal rate of return, the cash flow internal rate of return...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the capital investment, okay. Atmospheric plants, you don't have to pay for anything except the electricity. You don't have to pay for your raw material. So atmospheric plants tend to have low asset turnover, not a lot of sales for the capital investment, but very high margins. In hydrogen, you have to buy natural gas and pass that on to the customer. So depending on the way the contract is structured, if we're buying a gas and selling it to the customer then a lot of &#x2013; we're going to have a lot more sales growth for the capital investment, but it's going to be at a cosmetically lower margin, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now going back to the common denominator of internal rate of return, they should be about the same, except for the fact that atmospheric gases has more opportunity for co-product economics and more opportunity for vertical integration between the on-site to bulk and package business. And so as a whole, I think what we see is that atmospheric gases is a higher return on capital business than hydrogen. Not to say that hydrogen's bad, it just doesn't have as much co-product economics.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Jim, could you comment on pricing on large projects in Asia? Is it becoming more competitive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. There still are -- there is a plethora, an abundance of projects, which are on the drawing boards in China and India and so forth. And I think we're winning more than our fair share of those projects, based on our reputation in those countries, based on our ability to execute, build the plant on budget on schedule. And based on the fact that we have probably more liquid products than our competitors do there. Now there's another contributing factor, which I think is helping us win this business at high returns, is our standard plant designs. We are making most of our plants according to cookie cutter standard plant designs.</p>
          <p>And when we do that, each time we make another one, we bring the capital cost down. We bring the reliability up and we reduce the amount of spare parts and maintenance that's required. But just to give you an example, we've built over 15 of our PL4 size plants. The project that we are -- just announced in India is a T13 and we're building 5 of those. So the standard plant design really is working out very well for us and enabling us on the one hand to win the business and on the other hand, to get it at a good return.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. As far as the price increases that went through last year, I think you put your bulk price increases in late October and PDI in November. This quarter, did you actually realize some positive pricing that was offset by the mix or was there some slippage to those price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically the way our business works is everybody has a different contract, and everybody's contract has a different price and you have an on-site 15-year contracts and in merchant, usually 5-year contracts and when the contracts come up for renewal is where you just to talk about pricing you get. And so when we announce a price increase, generally what we mean by that is we're just giving our salespeople some backbone when they go back to a customer whose contract is being renewed after 5 years.</p>
          <p>And so there are a number of customers that are below market that we are increasing price on. The place that we lost the slippage was that our highest price products in the merchant business were the CO2 and nitrogen for fracing and the reason the price was higher is because of the long transportation cost to get there. So as that business has gone down and other business is going up, it's been a neutral overall pricing environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping, I could just piggyback on the last question, you didn't really address the PDI pricing environment and my question related to PDI pricing is maybe was your December price increase in hindsight maybe a little bit premature and are you seeing the pricing environment improving now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're getting traction on the December price increases. It was focused on some specific areas and some specific product lines and so forth and specifically gases, okay. And so we're getting traction on the gas price increase. Hardgoods, on the other hand, which is about 40% of sales, prices are naturally competitive and potentially coming down because you have wire and stuff as your raw material and so the cost of making hardgoods is coming down and the realized pricing is coming down also, but the margin --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just so I understand correctly, the PDI same-store sales number was that negative 4% or negative 7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question I wanted to ask you is on the Asia margin. Can you just give us some more detail on the mix issues there? What are some of the differences between margin level in atmospherics' process gases and sputtering targets? And what is the mix looking like right now as compared to historical norms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there are two factors. One of them is that, we're really in a growth mode in Asia, and we've got a lot of engineers on the ground, and lot of business development people on the ground. And therefore, an overhead structure, which is supporting a business that will be well over $1 billion in a couple of years. And so, that's a little bit of downward pressure on the margin there.</p>
          <p>But more specifically, the electronic sales represent roughly a third of our total sales in Asia, okay. And the atmospheric gases sales and hydrogen sales have about a 20% operating margin. In other words, if I carved out the electronics business from our business in Asia, it'd be running at a 20% operating margin. But the electronics business is running closer to a 10% operating margin, and it's up 88% year-on-year. So that's why the mix caused the margin to go down relative to the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Also in there we've got the sputtering targets, which have a lot of precious metals in them. And we had cost pass-through in the targets of about 9%, or representing 99% of our total sales there probably about 27% cost pass through from targets of sales. So it always looks like a disappointing thing with the low margins in Asia, but the fact is that, electronics is just a bigger part of Asia. We're not investing very much in electronics in Asia. So as we start up more oxygen plants and hydrogen plants, you'll see that operating margin go up.</p>

          <p>I'm a little surprised you guys haven't seen a little bit more active volume pick up based on what we're hearing out at some of your customers. So I'm just curious in slide 12, you gave us your volumes geographically. What do you think that curve looks like as we go through the next few quarters, does it stay at that same rate of change, is there potential for acceleration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. And I think when you look at our customers, they've got improvements going on both in volume and in price, okay. And I can't -- you understand that better than I do. Our price is constant. So we're only looking at improvements in volume. And in the chemical sector and the steel sector, we've got very significant volume pick up just quarter-over-quarter from the fourth quarter. The other sectors, more general manufacturing, we just don't have that much volume effect. So what we need to see is overall manufacturing get better and we need to see the production levels of chemicals and steel stay up at the levels that they're at right now.</p>

          <p>It does. Yeah, I mean, I guess I didn't consider the part that a lot of the revenue growth we're seeing of your customers had the price component, but it would still seem like their volume component was maybe stronger. And I don't sense there is any inventory build through many of those end markets. So I guess I'm expecting maybe a bit of a hockey stick for your volume developments.</p>

          <p>I think we have to see more &#x2013; there's no inventory of gases, okay. So we've got to see more pick up in the manufacturing and so forth. If you look at slide 10, you'll see our metals volumes up 19% year-on-year, and chemicals up 12% year-on-year. Now they may not be as much as the commodity chemical producer and the commodity metal producers. But remember, we're selling to a whole broad array of customers there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Spain and Portugal got their credit downgraded yesterday and have some pretty significant macroeconomic issues. And we don't do any business in Greece. So we'll start out with that. And then about 40% of our business in Europe is in maybe 35, 40% in Spain and 35, 40% in Germany with the rest in Italy and France. But the only real impact that we could have on the negative side from this credit crisis in Europe, will be seen as a dollar euro exchange rate. In other words, we don't have credit issues with customers. So if there is a bigger crisis that emerges in Spain and what not, maybe that'll slow the economy down some, maybe it'll weaken the euro some, but that's going to be the extent of any impact on us.</p>

          <p>You've got some downward pressure, as I mentioned before, from the mix from selling less fraced gases and those are the highest priced gases because of the long transportation cost. But if you exclude that to the average customer, pricing is holding very nicely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, just wanted to get your sentiment a little bit, given your sales guidance same to same, are you feeling a little better about the industrial now versus January, about the same, little bit worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm feeling much better about it, because January, the third quarter, we saw a fair amount of pick up from the depths of the second quarter. Fourth quarter was flattish. You came through the Christmas season okay, but really I think across the board you're seeing the economy ramp up in March and April. And so I'm a lot more optimistic about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Then in terms of Asia, the 30% plus growth in volumes, is that run rate sustainable? Is that primarily new projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's 2 things there. One is that electronics is a big -- is about a third of Asia and electronics was up the fastest, okay. Now if you look at chart -- well, I'm looking at chart 12, you see the 13% pick up in Asia, about 8% of that is from new start-ups and about 5% of that is organic growth.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's over the 6 quarter period. If you look year-on-year, it's a mix between electronics and start-ups.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, if you had to guess, when you look at PDI same-store sales, when would you think it would stabilize and maybe see a positive inflection point this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they've definitely stabilized. That year-over-year comparison of about 4 is -- it doesn't look that great, but they've definitely stabilized. They really bottomed out in the third quarter, which is a summer quarter and typically a weaker quarter for packaged gases. But we're seeing a solid, but gradual, increase in same-store sales growth.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is just on M&amp;A. On packaged gases, are you still looking at independent distributors or anything larger? And also geographic expansion opportunities, you mentioned the Middle East, I think when you have expanded geographies would you be looking at larger size acquisitions to get a large footprint right away? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In packaged gases, we continue to look at acquisitions where we can bolt on the small acquisitions and cut the cost in half and get a very high operating margin contribution from them. Other places around the world where there are privately-owned industrial gas companies, they're a number of family-owned companies. At some point in time, the family will decide to sell and we stay in conversation with those folks and every once in a while you'll see one of those come up for sale.</p>
          <p>Now the other two geographies that we're looking at and have been looking at for a while, but been slow to move, is the Middle East and Russia. And both of those geographies come with a bit more risk than some other places. And both of them require, you really need to know how to operate locally. But our strategy for building shareholder value is to build integrated industrial gas networks, if you will where we've got on-site merchant and packaged gases.</p>
          <p>So that's what we're looking to see if there's a way we can enter those markets with a fairly low level of risk and build an integrated business there, because both in the Middle East and Russia what they're trying to do is take the oil dollars they've got and diversify the economies into other industries. And that's where we're going to be looking to build an integrated business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. In packaged gases, what are the leading indicators telling you such as larger ticket equipment items as you look at the recent trends, let's say, through March and April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The leading indicators impacted gases are really is hardgoods. Hardgoods moves faster up and down than the gases do. And particularly the equipment sales, okay. So for example, if you have a job shop and he doesn't -- it's not full. He doesn't need to buy any equipment. But when your volume goes to the point where he needs to buy equipment, you'll see him come and then buy welding machines and laser cutting machines and that type of stuff. So what we are tracking is inquiries and orders for that type of equipment. And we're starting to see a few of them, but I don't think it's broad based.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second question, Jim, if I look at slide 5, in Europe you had an operating margin decline of 190 basis points sequentially. Often when you see that kind of volatility I guess it relates to energy pass-through, but in this case it looks like that was flat sequentially and volumes actually picked up slightly. So can you help me understand what is creating the margin pressure there in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically it is some on-site contracts where the plant was operating below minimum take-or-pay, but we're receiving a take-or-pay payment, okay. And so that translates into heavy dollars that drop right to the bottom line without much revenue, okay. When you increase the volume in the plant, you move through the take-or-pay threshold and your revenues go up, but your operating profit doesn't go up quite as much. So that's really the explanation of the lower margin in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And at this point, Jim, are all of those customers above the threshold?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim. Two question on North American merchant. The first one was what operating rates did sequentially, you had a 5% volume increase from Q4 to Q1? What did that do to operating rates and it's another way of getting back to that, why didn't we see more margin on a 5% volume improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably to use the round numbers on that, it's moving from mid-70s to about 75% operating rates, well below the 85%, 90% operating rate we'd like to be at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you say mid-70s and 75%, it sounds about the same. So you're only up a point or 2 then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean mid-70s. I meant about 70 to 75.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on a 5 percentage point operating rate change in merchant, you should see some pretty good incremental volumes there, right? You're talking about incremental volumes in the 40% range, wouldn't that translate into a better operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are definitely seeing that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, margins are up in the merchant business. It's still way below where it was at the top of the cycle, okay. And really the -- when we look at our total North American business, we've got a mix in there of package gases, home healthcare, merchant, on-site and electronics. And so we're a little bit getting masked here where we are getting that leverage in the industrial gases business, but electronic sales were up significantly and there are lower margins. So you're just not seeing it all come through the financials right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. In your Asian business, is there a seasonal margin progression where the first quarter for various reasons is a lower margin than the other quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. In any business, when you have a shorter operating period, you're going to have the same fixed costs but you're going to have lower sales, okay? And what I mean by that is that even in months when you go from 30 days to 31 days or whatever, you see that happen. But in Asia, you have Lunar holiday where things just shut down for a week, sometimes 2 weeks and that translates into lower sales and even lower operating profit, because your lower sales are still distributed over the same amount of fixed costs. So you're going to see fourth quarter generally in Asia being below, first quarter being below the fourth quarter, both in dollars and in operating margin percentage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>And basically what we've said about Airgas is that we're monitoring the situation, watching it closely. We're keeping our options open as to whether we'll do anything. We can't say definitively right now what we might do. But I think what I've said before is that we would have more synergies than anyone else in buying Airgas, because we run the second largest U.S. packaged gas business already and you should not assume that that would preclude us from an FTC standpoint. And I will also say that if Air Products is successful in buying Airgas and we don't participate, it'll still, I think, be a net positive for us in several ways.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow-up on your earlier comment on metals and chemicals, because you sound upbeat about it, but I thought you hedged your comments by saying you thought it would slow later this year because of inventory issues at your customers. So do you have any data to maybe support how much restocking may have occurred or whether you think inventories are normal or not normal downstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do watch inventories. I don't have those numbers on the top of my head, okay. But the way I see it is this.  Inventories went to practically zero level, okay, and so inventories have definitely been moving up. I think they're still well below what they would have been historically, okay. And could move higher, but if inventory's been moving up fast then that means that production is faster than assumption. And so if inventories hold in this area, you'll probably see a tempering off of the growth rate. But that's just my guess, but I really don't have any data to support that.</p>
