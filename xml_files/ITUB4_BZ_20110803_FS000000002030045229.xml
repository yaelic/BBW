        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Good morning for those who are in Brazil and the U.S., and good afternoon for those who are in Europe. For those who are also following through the presentation, we start in Slide number two, highlights.</p>
          <p>The first one is the net income at R$3.6 billion in the second quarter, with a 22.2% ROE. The recurring net income was R$3.3 billion, a decrease of 8.8% when we compare to the first quarter and below the consensus <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:36) of the market for this quarter. The total recurring net income achieved in this first semester was R$7 billion, that means ROE of 22% and an increase of 7.6% when we compare to the first semester of 2010.</p>
          <p>The second highlight is the loan portfolio, the growth &#x2013; the total portfolio was R$360 billion with an increase, a total increase of 4.4%. Individuals, the growth was 5.6%, companies 3.6%. Just to remember that we have a very big dollar-linked credit portfolio with devaluation of the real, this portfolio reduced. If the real had remained stable, the portfolio of companies, the increase should be 4.2% and the total instead of 4.4%, it should be 5%, so the growth of the portfolio, the origination of new credit in this quarter was very strong when we see the total number and we compensate the dollar devaluation.</p>
          <p>The third highlight is the financial margin with clients. Our managerial financial margin grew 4.3% in this quarter. This number is in line with the 4.4% credit portfolio growth. The NIM with clients declined slightly, 10 basis points, but grew in performing credits 30 basis points. We are going to give more details about the margin in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>Other effects, we showed stability in the mix during this semester and we are going also to show the decrease in the importance in credit that we provided one year, two years ago, and now the origination of this credit are larger in spread.</p>
          <p>Financial margin with the markets R$700 million, 26.2% lower. This is mainly our proprietary trading debts and of course due to this more &#x2013; much more difficult environment not only Brazil, but also the markets offshore.</p>
          <p>The fourth highlight, the NPL and loan losses, the balance of provision increased for loan and lease losses by 6.9%. Our expenses to our loan and lease losses increased 16.6%, much more than the growth of the portfolio and achieved R$5.1 billion. This growth in provision and expenses is mainly because of regulatory provisions, when we changed the classification of the clients and this is according to the resolution 2682, especially when we analyze our small and very small segment of companies that we provide credit.</p>
          <p>The 90 days delinquency increased 30 basis points, achieved 4.5% by the end of the semester. This is in line what we said that our delinquency ratio would increase during the year. We said that in the first semester conference call, our expectation was an increase of 30 basis points would be around that for the year. We achieved that in this quarter, but we don't see much deterioration in the coming quarters as I will show you in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>This 4.6% is below &#x2013; this 4.5% is below the 4.6% level that we were in the first semester of 2010. Short-term delinquency rate, measured by the 31 to 90 days ratio, declined 20 basis points, so that is good and in the quarter reached 2.7% of the total loan portfolio. And our complementary provision for losses remains in R$5.1 billion and the growth of the portfolio was 4.4%. So we didn't touch these complementary provision level.</p>
          <p>Banking fees is fifth highlight. They grew 4.6% and the 12 months is 11.1%, it's in line with the expectation.</p>
          <p>The sixth highlight is the non-interest expenses. The non-interest expenses, the growth was 3.7% in this quarter, achieving R$8 billion and confirming the trend of deceleration. Remember that when we compare the first quarter of this year with the first quarter of last year, this rate was 19%. Now we finish with 14.7%, so we continue to decelerate the pace of the growth of non-interest expense. The efficiency ratio achieved 48.3% in this quarter, mainly because of the decrease in net interest income with the market.</p>
          <p>On slide number seven, we are going to see the expectations that we provided in the beginning of the year for 2011. So, at the beginning of the year, we said that our expectation of credit growth was 16% to 20%; we reiterate this growth for the whole year of 2011. We're not changing these. We see the Brazilian economy growing.</p>
          <p>We are not seeing any problem in terms of so-called the credit bubble in Brazil. We don't see this happening. We are very confident that this is sustainable growth due to the environment and due to the formal jobs and the expansion of companies and so on that is happening in Brazil. So &#x2013; and especially the creation of formal jobs when we analyze the growth of portfolio for credit for individuals. So we reiterate our growth of 16% to 20%.</p>
          <p>The second expectation that we said was a slight increase in NPL levels. We were expecting some growth of around 30 basis points for the year. Now, we achieved this level already and we still see some increase in the NPL levels for the rest of this year due to the problems that we do have related to very small and small companies. Our expectations here is slight increase, so we're seeing something between 20 and 30 basis points more for the year, in line with the growth of our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>The third expectation that we said was banking fees growth, 14% to 16%. We reiterate this level for 14% to 16% growth for the year. Non-interest expense, our expectation at the beginning was 10% to 13%. We are now in a phase that is lower than that. So we're changing our expectations of non-interest expenses growth from this level 10% to 14% to 8% to 10% considering how these expenses and also the union negotiations.</p>
          <p>And fifth, was 250 basis points improvement in efficiency ratios. We reiterate that we are going to achieve and it is our goal and we're going to be in this level of efficiency ratio by the end of the year, because of the growth of the credit portfolio and because of the more controls in the deceleration of expansion of our non-interest expense.</p>
          <p>We can go to slide number five for those who are following through the presentation. Managerial financial margin, the growth was 2.5% in the quarter, 11% 12 months. The lower losses here, as I said we made much more provisions than we were expecting in this quarter in the small and very small companies, especially. So the growth when we compare the two quarters of 2008 to 2011, 17.1%. Non-interest expenses, as I said, we're in the trend of deceleration, 14.7% in the second quarter compared to 19% in the first quarter and our new expectation is something between 8% and 10% by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>On slide number six, net interest margin with clients almost stable at 10 bps reduction to 11.6% in the second quarter. Banking fees, a growth from 4.6% achieving R$4.6 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; change to slide number seven, we see the trend of the net interest margin that is stable. We are going to the next three slides to talk more about these.</p>
          <p>We can change to slide number eight, we have more to say on analysis of our financial margin. The first thing is that is our performing credits, the NIM of performing credit achieved 11.3%, that means our 30 bps increase when we compare this to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The second is the portfolio credit mix. We have these two tables here to talk. The portfolio credit mix, the contribution was positive for the financial margin in the quarter, but it was neutral when we analyze the year, the first semester. So the difference between one quarter and one &#x2013; the second quarter was neutralized as we can see on the right side of the slide. The simulation of constant mix in the loan portfolio, what was good in the first quarter was compensating the second, so it was neutral when we analyze the first semester.</p>
          <p>On slide number nine, it's very interesting to see what was our position in terms of credit origination in June 2010 and June 2011? We can see that one year ago, 25% of our credit portfolio was originated in 2009, as an example. We can see in June that this origination of 2009 was less than 10%, so a reduction in this participation of this 2009 vintage. It is interesting to see that we already renovate 47.8% of our credit portfolio in the first semester of this year, because of maturities, short maturity of many of the &#x2013; of our credit products and we have 31.7% originate in 2010.</p>
          <p>This is important to analyze because 2010 as the spreads were lower than the spreads that we are using today in the new originations and renovations of credit, because of the environment deteriorated worse than it was in 2010 and the spreads also in 2009 because of the crisis of 2008, was higher. So we are generating new spreads and that's why the NIM in the performing credit achieved to 11.3%, an increase of 30 basis points when we can compare to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 10, we can see that the total assets achieved R$792 billion, an increase of 1.8% in the quarter; stockholders' equity R$66 billion, an increase of 3.7%; loan portfolio, total here includes endorsements and sureties, 4.4%, R4360 billion; and funding with clients including here the money market funds and assets under management of R$822 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we can see a more detail of our results. I think we talked about this in the previous explanations. So, I think we can change through to page 12, talking about loans and NPLs for &#x2013; I think it's more important at this moment. We continue to grow personal loans, individuals, as I said also mortgage is continuing to be important, 18.4%. We don't see any problem; we don't see any risk or deterioration in this individuals credit portfolio. I think we have been more conservative in our vehicles financing.</p>
          <p>We have been more &#x2013; also in terms of credit card and companies, the growth was 3.6%. It should be 5% when we &#x2013; if we take off the dollar devaluation impact against the reis in our dollar-linked portfolio. And as I said, a growth of 4.3% in very small, small and middle market continues to be strong and we reduced the base especially in very small and small because of the problems that we have in the portfolio originated in 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we can see the trend of the NPL ratios for 90 days, 4.5% in this quarter &#x2013; by the end of the quarter from 4.2% that we were in the first quarter. You can see the NPL ratios for individuals vary slightly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:00) 10 bps from 6.7% &#x2013; 5.7% to 5.8%. But as I said, we don't see problems here. And companies, they increased from 2.9% by the year end of 2010 to 3.5% here in the end of the first semester, especially related to the problem that we had with very small and small companies portfolio.</p>
          <p>The NPL ratio of 31 to 90 days is, it's okay, we don't &#x2013; the trends are very positive. The balance of provisions of R$23.7 billion, increased R$1.5 billion in this period and with all together the coverage ratio reduced from 173% to 166%.</p>
          <p>And on page 14, we can see the evolution of expenses for loan losses and the increase when we compare this quarter, when we made R$5.1 billion against R$4.4 billion almost in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, the breakdown of our deposits and assets under management <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:45) the total funds that we manage is R$1.067 trillion.</p>
          <p>On page 16, banking fees revenues, I think we don't much to say here, 4.6% in the quarter, 11% in the year. We reiterate our expectations to achieve something between 14% and 6% due to the problems that we managed and also because we increased some prices of sales and services in the first semester.</p>
          <p>And on page 17, non-interest expenses, I think it is a good number, we &#x2013; especially when we analyze 12 months, we see much better number that we are achieving and we continue to reiterate our expectations of growth of 8% to 10% in the expenses for the whole year of 2011.</p>
          <p>We also reduced the number of employees, especially related to credit card operations and some of the retail branches. And also in the JV that we have, people that we had here that we're transferring part of them to the JVs that we have with the retail companies. So we expect to have 1,000 back in the JVs from people that we reduced directly from the Bank. So part of this cost will come back through the JVs numbers.</p>
          <p>On page 18, efficiency ratio, as we said, we expect it to reduce to 250 basis points by the end of the year with this numbers and expectations of credit tariff growth and our numbers for &#x2013; new guidance for expenses growth of between 8% and 10%.</p>
          <p>The BIS ratio continues to be very comfortable to face the growth of the Bank, 16.1%, and we still consider pending approvals in the Central Bank for Tier II, with a number we achieved 16.6%.</p>
          <p>That's our presentation. And now we are all here open to questions that you probably have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Actually I have a couple of questions. The first one is related I think obviously to the provision expenses you reported in the quarter. We saw a slight deterioration in NPL ratio and we saw very large increase in provision expenses. If you could give us some more color about your expected loss model and mostly how should be look at provision expenses going forward? What exactly should we expect given that for such a small deterioration we had such a big jump in provision expenses?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to margins. Thank you for the very good graph on the seasoning of your portfolio. I think it's impressive that from the 100 billion you originated in the first quarter only 30 billion are left in the second. What does that say to us about margin? Should we continue to expect margins to go up on the loan side and then barring another weak quarter in trading that we should see overall margins for the Bank going up through the end of the year, if you can give us some color on that would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Macedo, Rogerio Calderon. Looking forward in terms of the bad debt expenses, we believe that the movement should be very much in line with the margin movement. So we don't expect to have a similar circumstance that we faced this quarter on which we had expenses &#x2013; bad debt expenses growing much faster than the margins.</p>
          <p>And thank you for your comment on the margins chart and the margin <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:09). I draw your attention to page nine. I think on this chart, it's &#x2013; this chart is particularly very important because it shows our flexibility to re-price the portfolio. So after six months, almost 50% of the portfolio now was created, originated after &#x2013; during this year or by the time we have anticipated this potential deterioration in the credit scenario.</p>
          <p>So what means that, the favorable conditions that margin could rebound up to now, so I'm not saying that is going to happen, but the conditions are very favorable. It's also very, very &#x2013; I think it's very important to highlight this. The more we have in this portion of new origination created this year, the trend is still having overall better quality in our portfolio, since as was mentioned, since the beginning of the year, we became more selective. So in overall terms, the quality of the portfolio tends to be better, but also benefits the movement, the future movement in the linkage in NPL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just going back to the first question then, what you are saying is that we should expect the provision expenses to go up in line with loan growth, is that it, so start from the level which they &#x2013; which are in the second quarter and go up with loan growth through the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's it. That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to &#x2013; this is Alfredo. I just want to compliment what Rogerio said. I think it's important that we &#x2013; as we were expecting this increase in the NPL, as I said, especially in the first quarter conference call, we took measures since the end of that year especially in the small and very small segment to be more conservative and to have more collaterals from the companies and so on. So what we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:36) of the vintage that we had problems of deceleration that we made during the year of 2010. So as I said before, we are not seeing any issues related to large companies or to middle market companies. We are very confident in the portfolio and so on, and the same for individuals.</p>
          <p>So the problem is very concentrated in the small companies more than the very small, because the portfolio of the small companies are around R$25 billion &#x2013; R$22 billion, R$25 billion, I don't have to read the number exactly and much higher than the very small, there is around R$7 billion, R$8 billion. So there is a concentration in these segment and in all the rest in our view is showing no problem and no deterioration.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody. Thanks for taking the call. I want to follow-up on the questions that were made previously. First, you mentioned a lot of the problems were concentrated amongst &#x2013; or seem to have been concentrated amongst small and very small companies. Can you give us a bit more color on what drove this deterioration? Cause, it's still unclear to me whether this is an issue, Ita&#xFA; growing too rapidly in this segment, where you did grow very rapidly last year, and hence essentially writing that business or is this a broader issue that's more industry-driven because we really haven't seen obviously these issues with some of your competitors, obviously there is a mix issue, you had been more focused on smaller than some of your competitors, but is this an issue that is more Ita&#xFA;-specific or more &#x2013; or is it a broader industry type of problem?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just to follow-up on that question, I wasn't clear by your response to Carlos' question about the vintages with small companies and the problems being done there. Are you saying that you don't expect additional deterioration amongst small companies that these vintages in this deterioration is mostly run its course in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Saul, its Alfredo. I think in our case, we don't have the breakdown of course for our competitors and for the industry, because the Central Bank release corporate numbers as they don't segment the figures.</p>
          <p>In our case, just to give you more information, what we consider to be a very small company is companies that have revenues up to R$500,000 a year is a very, very small company. And what we consider to be a small company is a company that has revenues between this R$500,000 level to something around R$6 million. So that's our segmentation, okay.</p>
          <p>We had a very strong position compared to other banks in the middle market. So probably we were the first bank to go more down in this segmentation last year, so we accelerate more. This small company credit portfolio before the others. I don't know exactly how are the others to-date? Our figure is that we had this R$22 billion, R$25 billion portfolio. This portfolio should grow for us, the way we operate and the main reasons for the provisions that we make in these quarter.</p>
          <p>The guidance that we provided in the first quarter of the increase in our NPL was related to what we were seeing in this segment mainly, because as I said, we don't see problems in the other portfolio. So that's the picture so &#x2013; for our case. I don't know the others, how are they operating or if they are operating in this segment or not, but in our case we didn't. Certainly we were not very well-succeeded. And we took measures since at the end of the year; we have been much more restricted in providing credit to these segments &#x2013; for these companies or these small companies. And that's why our NPL increased and in relative terms also increased because we reduced the pace of growth of this portfolio, so the old vintage has a weight higher than it was when we started to increase. So I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. If I could just ask a quick follow-up as well, I don't want to take all the other analysts' time either. The guidance that you gave for loan loss provisions, that is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:50) loan loss provisions should remain stable as a percentage of loans or should it continue to increase as NPLs increase in the coming quarters as a percentage of your loan book?</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity. I have a couple of questions. The first one still on asset quality and actually the impact on your loan growth expectations, I mean given that you're pulling back from the SME segment or at least part of the SME segment, are you still comfortable with your 16% to 20% guidance, I know you reiterated the guidance, but do you see any downside or risk regarding that guidance and how do you expect to compensate for the lower growth in SME, which sort of segment do you think you can grow more to be able to fall within that guidance?</p>
          <p>And my second question is also regarding the &#x2013; your restructured portfolio. If you &#x2013; if I look at your restructured portfolio as a percentage of your loan portfolio, it was actually up 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and compared about 20 basis points increase if you look at the same period last year. So there was a big jump there compared to last year levels. I know there is some seasonality there, but here it seems it's a little bit higher. Can you please explain I mean which segments explain that increase in your restructured portfolio? Was it like individuals or SMEs, if could you could clarify that, I would appreciate. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Marcelo, this is S&#xE9;rgio Werlang. Just answering our guidance of growth of the loan portfolio still will be between 16% and 20%. We think that the range is much more than enough to accommodate for the loss of our speed of growth of the small and very small enterprises segment. As for the restructured debt, I will pass on to Calderon.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, I suppose you referred to the renegotiation footnote we had in the financial statements, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's decelerated to 22% this quarter. That's from &#x2013; I want to just reemphasize that we didn't change anything on renegotiations, anything, any rule was changed, it didn't &#x2013; it does not impact anything in terms of the provision. It does impact and change the NPL whenever we have cash we received; of course when we receive back money, the credit is not non-performing anymore, it's a performing credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, but I understand all your points, I am just asking I mean that &#x2013; so the increase in restructuring portfolio does not concern you whatsoever in terms of future delinquencies, that's the point you are making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This is business as usual, and this &#x2013; the portfolios that grow more or less in the total negotiation is totally related to the vintage, we grow more or less in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One follow-up question, when I look in terms of the performance of your delinquency rate by segment, it was interesting to just see that on the retail side, you actually did better than your competitors. You had an increase of 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter compared to some of the other peers, they are like between 20 basis points to 50 basis points. Why do think you performed better on the retail side?</p>
          <p>And in that regard, I mean talking about your expectation for an additional 20 basis points to 30 basis points increase in overall NPL ratio in the second half of the year, what are the segments that you think would drive that deterioration in NPL ratio for the second part of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is S&#xE9;rgio again. I think that several factors contribute to the small increase of our NPL. And basically, I would say that the main thing is that we have a mix of individuals that &#x2013; of credit with guarantees. For example, we have a lot of real estate credit, we have a lot of &#x2013; we have been growing quite a bit in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:52) and furthermore we have been growing personal credit in only the very best classifications, so it is natural. And as Alfredo pointed out, what we see the increase is in the small and very small enterprise and that's what we see for the second semester as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Sorry to bother you guys again, but just one final question on your restructured portfolio, is it possible to &#x2013; can you share with us what percentage of your restructured portfolio is related to loss individuals in this quarter and versus first quarter 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; normally, we don't share this information. So we take your suggestion, we're going to consider it, and include in our financial statements or make it overall publicly known to everyone.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Let me ask two questions as well. First, I'll stay on the topic of asset quality. About three months ago, the Bank guided for 30 basis points increase in NPLs for the full year. Now, you are guiding for another 20 to 30 basis points increase. So I just wanted to understand exactly what has changed in three months for you to double your expectations for pick-up in delinquency?</p>
          <p>And also on asset quality, if you can give us just a breakdown what percentage of these small and medium sized companies, what percentage of them &#x2013; of these loans have a collateral attached to them?</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be on expenses. You showed that your expenses are growing 15% year-on-year in the first half of this year and you will reduce the guidance, your growth guidance to 8% to 10%, can you be more specific why are you reducing your guidance, what measures are you implementing in order to see a slowdown in the growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:35), but first &#x2013; yeah, so your question on our expectation on NPL, actually what we put out in the other calls that we had an expectation of 30 bps up by the end of the year and behind that we had an expectation of growing on NPL and then slowing down or reduce actually in the fourth quarter. So this reduction to 4.5% again in the fourth quarter, now we don't think is going to happen this year. So our estimate for the year is the current level to go up around 20 bps and then keeping stable during the first quarter. Regarding the collaterals on these, I'll hand it to S&#xE9;rgio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just give you the main number, I mean the most important number is the working capital. We increased the working capital with collateral, substantially we're close now to 50% of our collateral in the working capital of small and medium enterprise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just let me do a follow-up, what are you seeing then, Rogerio, that is different now for you to increase your expectation, or what has changed in the operating environment for you to now not to think that delinquency should be improving by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. There are a couple of changes in the international scenario, some macroeconomics changed, some movements in &#x2013; regarding the interest rate, so some changes &#x2013; not a &#x2013; it's not a big movement actually, we're talking on 10, 20 bps, it's also related to the &#x2013; to how fast we grow our portfolio. You know that NPL is also a results of how fast we grow the portfolio. You must consider that we have decelerated a little bit in this area, SME, so this is altogether is considering the model. This is not a matter of estimation by anything other than making a modeling and out of this model we have this new scenario, if you want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Alfredo, talking about the expenses that you asked. We changed the guidance because the level of expansion that we are running and what we see for the second semester is better than we imagined. In these numbers we also already included the &#x2013; even a negotiation under our expectations and also the personal that we will be &#x2013; that we reduced, but they will be hired by our JV partners in the retail side.</p>
          <p>If you remember, we last year had very high level of expenses in terms of restructuring the branches of Unibanco into the Ita&#xFA; model and also the operational side of the branch changes. So this was this almost to R$1 billion during the year 2010, the labor expenses that we have today renovating the other branches are much lower than that level.</p>
          <p>Also we have some synergies to gain in the semester as long as we can this former systems and the data bases of Unibanco that are still in place, because we &#x2013; the first moment, we changed the flow of new business into the systems of Ita&#xFA;, but we remain with the former systems of Unibanco controlling the inventory of credit and products. So these, we are turning off during this year, especially during this semester.</p>
          <p>And also we made some reductions, some restructures in the credit card area because at the beginning of the merge, we had seven different systems, we changed that for five and by the end of last year we changed for one platform. So because of this new efficiency of the new platform of technology, we were able to make a huge restructure in the area during the second quarter and part of the expenses of these restructures &#x2013; little bit more in reality than R$100 million was expenses to lay off people and to make some provisions for labor litigations that may appear.</p>
          <p>So we have also some gains that we are making during this second semester in retail area also under the new management of Marco Bonomi. He is also making some changes in his branch level. So many areas are changing and we have also the synergies and one-shot expenses last year. So we are very confident that we are able to achieve this level and we continue to reiterate the 41% level by 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great. And just to follow-up, Alfredo, just quickly on the head count reduction, you said you reduced about 2,000 people this quarter &#x2013; last quarter, but you said you expect them to be re-hired by the Bank. Can you just clarify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not by the Bank, Mario. We reduced people in the Bank employees, but they &#x2013; around 1,000 of that reduction, these people will be hired by the JVs or even by their retail, if people move towards that that go behind the clients to sell credit cards, and personal loans inside the retail stores. So part of these, around 1,000 of these people will be hired by &#x2013; even the &#x2013; all by the JV that we have. So that's why not all these expenses &#x2013; that will return through the JV's cost during this second semester. But when we announced these 8% to 10% expected level, we already included these numbers, these figures.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Yes, my questions have been answered, but I have one follow-up, if we could continue with the renegotiated credits. Just looking at the allowance for loan losses related to those in the notes that you have in the financial statements and that level, the allowance there for loan losses to provision is now on the 40% on of the total renegotiated credit. Is this a number that you're comfortable with, looking at the past quarters, it looks like it's consistently been above 40% historically. Is this a number you're comfortable with or do you expect that you may need to make some more provisioning here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Rogerio. Yes, it's also treated by the model, so we're comfortable with this and just remember that whenever we talk about renegotiation, it does not change anything in terms of the provision we make on -- just change there for treatment of NPL whenever we receive cash, it's back to the performing loans, but we don't remove the provision if that provision was a specific provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And just one quick further follow-up on credit charge going forward, so the new level that we have in terms of credit charge as a percentage of average loans, which is much higher obviously in the second quarter, do you expect that to come down a little bit looking into Q3 and Q4 as a percentage of average learns? In other words, when you say that it should grow in line with the portfolio, should we look at year-on-year growth, should we look at quarter-on-quarter growth in terms of level of provisioning credit charge and loan growth?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I should think a little bit more on this, but I think it's more related to <mark type="indiscernible" />  (55:43) because of &#x2013; we're talking on charge-offs, so I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:49) makes more sense than shorter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is <mark type="ph" /> Karim Delco (56:15). Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the strategy generally, given that there are the first signs at least of some problems with credit in your portfolio, in general in the country coupled with macroeconomic backdrop, which has worsened quite a bit. I'm a little bit surprised that you're still driving the same deal in the portfolio, i.e., the way I interpret this is that from your perspective everything is fine, we have a couple of pockets of problems which you think will go away, I do feel like &#x2013; I don't know, I mean, it's your business, I am the shareholder, but I am a bit concerned about the risk of a hard landing here if you now basically pulling &#x2013; pushing the pedal the same speed, even though things are clearly deteriorating, maybe you can just give me your perspective on that, sort of &#x2013; this is more of a global macro view now, it's not just a situation in Brazil, but also in the rest of the world, which is not looking good maybe a few months ago. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Karim (57:28), this is S&#xE9;rgio Werlang. Okay, so let me first answer you, however, just looking generally from the macroeconomic viewpoint. You know the Central Bank issues monthly data with some lag of course on NPLs of 90 days in the Brazilian system. And using these data and the aggregate credit data of the Central Bank, it is possible to join with our microeconomic scenario, which actually every month we have a meeting to discuss in detail and about the new scenario.</p>
          <p>Now, this scenario has been shown for quite a while that the Brazilian Central Bank in order to fight inflation would have to decelerate the economy, essentially through an increase in interest rates. Now, given this &#x2013; given this scenario, what we see is that the economy is already decelerating, but we expect the growth rates of this year to be below 4%, in between 2.5% and 4%, and the same thing for next year, so a deceleration of the pace of growth of the Brazilian economy.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, there is an increase in the interest rate. When &#x2013; so this is our basic scenario, which has been more or less like this for a while, obviously it will vary according to the Central Bank actions in each of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings.</p>
          <p>So using this data and the macroeconomic data on credit provided by the Central Bank, it is possible to foresee that there is going to be some slight deterioration on the delinquency rates on the NPL ratio above 90 days and in our forecast we show that the average, I can tell you the forecast for until the end of the year, but our forecast for this average shows that the number from the Central Bank will go from 5.2% to 5.5% and decrease to about 5.4% by the end of the year. This is how our macro scenario &#x2013; what our micro scenario is pointing out. And I'll now pass to Rogerio for more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just adding that, as in our case, we have &#x2013; we had a movement that was possible to identify specifically the segment and the type of clients &#x2013; so it was actually the decision taking was changing the criteria, the approval criteria reducing, making more selective, and then focusing on the other segment. That's what give us that confidence that you mentioned in your question.  So, we keep confidence on the guidance, we keep confidence on the ability to keep growing in a very safe scenario by changing the mix of the portfolio, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I may follow-up, I don't know if I am stepping too far out here, but since we are global investors, okay, we look at countries and we have a lot of concern about two or three countries, one is Australia and one is South Africa, they have very similar macro kind of &#x2013; at least global drivers such as Brazil. Now I understand Brazil is much bigger, but Brazil also has clearly driven much more to consumer credit than let's say these two countries, that's what I mentioned.</p>
          <p>And I'm just curious, I guess &#x2013; your yield curve is flat, I mean, the signal is just &#x2013; I guess my point, are you confident with the consumer credit growth that has been going on in the last couple of years that even if there is a macroeconomic slowdown and Brazil to some extent in a decent rate, there is not going to be an issue like a big problem or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is S&#xE9;rgio again. Look, we don't see any special &#x2013; especially hard deterioration of the market in the models whatever we do. The behavior of the Brazilian consumer credit has always been &#x2013; the consumer has always had credit at a very high interest rate and this is historical. Sometimes the interest rate went down a bit, now it's quite down in relation to what was sometime ago, but has been even lower some &#x2013; has been lower, the interest rate for the consumer sometime in the past, but if you go more to the past, it's much lower now than it was before.</p>
          <p>What I am trying to say that there is no particularly different sort of the behavior or there is no particular fast increase of indebtedness. I think that's in the Brazilian &#x2013; of the Brazilian consumer in terms of how much income the person has to pay in terms of interest, that's always been high. And this is no news, it has always been high for delinquency rate of the Brazilian consumer have been high historically. You can look at it and compare to international markets, you are comparing to Australia, but I don't know the numbers on the top of my head. But I'm pretty sure that Australia, the delinquency rates for consumers is much lower than in Brazil. So this is already factored in and that's why spreads are higher anyway in the country. So that's what it is.</p>
          <p>You can look at the behavior what happened in the crisis in 2008. In 2008, 2009 the delinquency rate of the Brazilian individual went up to 8.5%, this number I gave you that was going to &#x2013; this number, yeah, went to 8.5% which is even less than the number that what we picked in the U.S. to give you an idea. So we don't really see any particular bubble. Our real state credit is small in relation to the GDP of 4%. And with such high interest rates, you don't see any change in particular that would trigger an event that has not been happening in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my call. I've two questions and I hope this will be last one on credit, but I've seen you are always very well reserved, always a good 30% above the minimum allowance requirement, but your coverage has come down quite a bit and down to about 166% of NPLs. So I'm wondering if there is a particular level that you target.</p>
          <p>And then as a follow-up, not on that, but it's &#x2013; for a while your deposit growth has lagged behind your loan growth and this is not always a case with your peers. So I'm wondering if you have any strategy to bring back some deposit growth and perhaps gain some market share, you are especially seeing that your loan-to-deposit ratio is going crimping up back to about 150% by my estimate. So I don't know if you have any thoughts on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the coverage ratio, it's actually very comparable to the level of over coverage we have and it's quite similar to the historical level we ever kept except for the fact that we &#x2013; up to December, we had a counter cyclical portion, we know that's provision. So we made a reversal of this counter cyclical portion by the end the year, what made this step down from the 195% or something that we had to the 170%, around 170% that we keep now. So that's the only movement, strong movement, if you want, that we posted recently, other than this is very flattish with minor movements, ups or downs.</p>
          <p>When you refer to the loan to fund, I think as you mentioned 150%, I think you are not considering debentures as a source of funding, debentures is a sort of an instrument in Brazil that works exactly the same way as time deposit does. So you should consider this in your ratio for loan-to-funds, and I'll be glad to explain in detail even legal terms et cetera if you want then particularly.</p>

          <p>Hi, how are you? I just have a follow-up question on margins. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:08:22) in the net interest margin for clients of; if I'm correct 10 bps during the quarter, we just want to understand better what are the drivers behind this reduction and how should we think about this margin going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Jorge, this is Rogerio speaking. This is a minor movement. I think it's much more related to the movement we had in securities, the securities portion increased a little bit in this quarter when you compare to the quarter before. If you remove this movement, I think it will be flat. So if you look at that margin, actually the margin is growing exactly in line with the volume. So it is really flat the movement in net interest margin.</p>
          <p>Looking forward and we try to give you guys some color on this; we have a chapter in the MD&amp;A that we expanded a little bit by talking on the net interest margin, dividing or segmented by performing loans and non-performing loans, it's clearly the performing loans shows a 30 bps up in the net interest margin.</p>
          <p>Also, we pointed out that the portfolio of credit mix removed a little bit of our net margin in the first quarter, was actually replaced in the second quarter. So by looking at the semester, the mix, the credit portfolio mix is not impacting anymore the net interest margin. And there is a final segment in this chapter that I think is really very important and it's on page nine. I'm going to repeat, because I think there are some new guys in line.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the slide number &#x2013; on page nine, you're going to notice that the very recent portion of the portfolio is now occupying a much bigger size of our average portfolio. So almost 50% of the credit portfolio was recently originated, so originated things at the beginning of this year and of last. So this is in a better quality, because we got to be more selective as mentioned before and it's also &#x2013; it was also originated in an average higher spreads if you compare to 2010 is not higher than 2009, because we had the peak of the crisis, so spreads were much higher, but a portion of this oldest <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:11:17)  are reducing the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So by looking forward, it seems that we have a favorable condition to net interest margin to be bounded to increase as for now a little bit. It's hard to make an estimate, back to the first point, because we don't know the movement of increases and you know that we calculate that based on the earnings asset model. So &#x2013; but considering &#x2013; directionally saying, the conditions are favorable to rebound.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen. I had a follow-up question on the case growth. You said that you have 16% to 20% year-on-year increase till &#x2013; for year-end 2011. And I would like to &#x2013; if you can provide more color about what should be the split in terms of different business segment? So, somebody mentioned that you took some corrected measures in the very small and small companies, I would like to know if this considered growing less, or this considered increasing collateral for example. And I would like to understand also the acceleration that we see in the quarter in the growth for example in the personal loans business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've raised that rate to 16% to 20% that the growth we expect to see in the rest of the year. It's pretty in line with the movement we saw in the first semester. So more or less the same from &#x2013; when segmenting between divisions and companies. But if you are look inside companies, the proportion of corporate and very small, small and middle markets should show a reduction in very small and small portion of portfolio because of the decisions we made. It's also important to highlight that not only we've reduced the speed on this segment, but we also increased the collateral level of this portfolio as I think S&#xE9;rgio mentioned before.</p>
