        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 conference call. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our press release and the presentation slides are available on our website. As always, I must advise you that our presentation today contains forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in our annual report on Form 20-F and in the document of reference.</p>
          <p>Our presentation today will be divided in four parts. First, Chris Viehbacher, our CEO, will share with you the main achievements of the quarter and then update on strategy. Then Marc Cluzel, Senior Vice President of R&amp;D, will provide the results of a recent R&amp;D portfolio review. In the third part, Hanspeter Spek, Executive Vice President, Pharmaceutical Operations, will provide some color on the Q1 market performance. In conclusion, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, our CFO, will comment on the Q1 financial performance. We will then host a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>And I will now hand the call over to CEO, Chris Viehbacher.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;bastien, good afternoon. Good morning to all of you. Before we start, I'd like to give a warm welcome to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, who joined us in Q1 as one of our Q1 achievements. I like to put it that way as J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me's first earnings call for Sanofi-Aventis, so welcome him. And of course, obviously to Hanspeter Spek and to Marc Cluzel, who will talk to you a little later on. And as S&#xE9;bastien already said, I'll start with an overview of the business, and then I think Marc will update us on the review of the portfolio, and Hanspeter will give us some of the detail on some very strong performance, both on topline and I think in terms of cost control.</p>
          <p>So I'm on slide five, which is really giving an introduction to what is a very good start to the year. We have growth of 3% for pharmaceuticals. Obviously at constant exchange rates sales were flat, as you've seen in the press release, and it's 3% when you correct for the fact that we had Copaxone in the numbers last year and we don't have Copaxone this year.</p>
          <p>The Copaxone comparator does affect various lines. It affects sales. It effects cost of sales and some selling expenses, and J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me will talk about that a little bit, and Hanspeter will go into a little bit more detail on pharmaceuticals and vaccines, 9% growth, very good growth there.</p>
          <p>At constant exchange rates, and that's a basis on which we are giving now guidance and reporting on earnings principally, been a very robust 9.8% constant exchange rate growth of earnings per share.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, clearly we had a positive benefit of exchange rates such that it &#x2013; the actual rate was 16.8%. I'll give you an update. We're about half way along in our transformation initiatives. We've clearly made some acquisitions this quarter, which I think are very consistent with the strategy that I had the opportunity to outline to you at our last meeting and, of course, we've had in the mean time an FDA advisory committee, which has given very strong support to the approval of Multaq, and I'll come and talk to that in a little bit.</p>
          <p>So if I move to slide six, the center part really is one of the classical sources of growth and you can see that our major products Plavix, Lovenox, Lantus, Taxotere and Aprovel all had good growth. The Lovenox number looks a little low but I think as Hanspeter will show you that's really related to the heparin supply issues that we had in the last year, which kind of distorted quarterly growth and we're looking at a strange comparator, but actually all underlying script growth is very much consistent with previous quarters and we're very happy with that performance.</p>
          <p>On the vaccine side, to the left, you clearly see sales of Sanofi Pasteur at &#x20AC;627 million, up 9%. We include the sales of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture. Remember that we don't consolidate those sales, down 8.7%, largely as a result of Gardasil sales. If you strip out Gardasil sales, we're up 15% and I think you've heard from Merck what the story is on Gardasil.</p>
          <p>Our animal health franchise actually resisting pretty well against the economic crisis, up 2%. Actually management has done a very good job of cost management there and the joint venture profit sales were actually up 10%, so clearly a good source of growth on animal health.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we are thinking about future of Merial, given that Merck and Schering have announced a proposed merger. Schering, as you know, has the Intervet business, and Merck is currently going through an exercise to decide what it wants to do in animal health. We're partners in that, and we will obviously discuss the future of the joint venture, what we might do with Merck when they've completed their strategic exercises.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the slide you see OTC business, 378 million, a robust 10% growth there, 9.9% and of course our generics business, and Hanspeter will talk about that a little bit more, that does not includes Zentiva, Kendrick or Medley. So this is the business that we start with, but also very good growth.</p>
          <p>I would say that this is a very good performance, particularly when you think about the fact that this is now the second time that Sanofi Winthrop has won a very competitive tender process. You've seen &#x2013; I think it's Ranbaxy has decided to exit from certain European markets because of price pressures, so I think the fact that Sanofi Winthrop is able to &#x2013; is to compete shows that even a company like Sanofi-Aventis can do well.</p>
          <p>So page seven, we're confirming the guidance for the year. I've seen some of the notes some of you have put out. I would draw to your attention, perhaps, that the guidance is up at least 7%. So it's not 7%. It's at least 7% and we'll likely, with the second quarter, try to narrow that range a little bit for you but we are clearly off to a very good start to the year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide eight, I'll give you an update just briefly on the Transforming Program. There's an awful lot of activity in the company and lot of thought going into it since we announced, really the vision of the company as a global healthcare leader.</p>
          <p>That all sounds great but there are real management decisions and challenges that are a consequence of this. When you think about the fact that we are now one of the top ten generics manufacturers, that immediately raises questions about how does this get organized, where do the plants report? If you would have talked to our head of manufacturing, for instance, for the Mexican sites, manufacturing plants in pharma would typically have what they would call 10 launches per year. This is -- these are new packages, new formulations.</p>
          <p>When you move into the generics field, that goes from 10 to about 100, and so there are clearly adjustments that have to be made and we have to think about the people we have in those businesses. We are still very much interested in the remaining three questions on R&amp;D. We've answered really the first two and, again, Marc will go through that in some detail.</p>
          <p>So obviously in addition to the portfolio review, we're still very much interested in thinking about how we can really rejuvenate innovation, create an organization that's looking outwards, define new innovation externally in the company, and of course, defining our R&amp;D strategy longer-term.</p>
          <p>So the portfolio review doesn't completely say, we're going to be in or out of some therapeutic areas. That has to be overlaid with our 20-15 R&amp;D strategy. So the three pillars are really increasing innovation in R&amp;D, and Marc will take you through the portfolio review, adapting our company to future challenges is as much around some of the acquisitions we're doing and the fact that we're doing a lot more partnerships and, of course, you've seen external growth.</p>
          <p>So I move to slide nine, and I can give you a little bit of a feel for each of these things. I think R&amp;D is a critical milestone, the review of the portfolio. It's not really just so much where we've ended up as how we got there, and Marc will take you through the four key criteria that we use for our own version of the bank stress test on our own portfolio.</p>
          <p>Personally, I think we end up now with a portfolio that we all feel very confident in. This is a portfolio that we can put our resources behind, and really drive behind the most promising projects that we have. And so I think we have a greater confidence, a greater sense of mobilization around the pipeline that we have. That doesn't mean that we can sit back and be complacent. We clearly need to add to that pipeline, both in terms of our own discovery and in terms of seeking new drugs.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the middle group there, I think the BiPar acquisition is an excellent example of that. It underlines and underscores really our commitment to innovation. Obviously, this gives us a first-in-class oncology, a compound, in an indication of triple negative breast cancer initially for which there is no treatment today. Phase II data will be presented at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] later in the month of May.</p>
          <p>Behind the scenes I can tell you I'm particularly happy with this, because it was really Hanspeter's team in marketing that did a first screening of opportunities that might be there, and it was really working together with Marc Cluzel's team in research and development to really assess the scientific potential of some of these, that really lead us to BiPar. And so I think we're seeing already new evidence of the important collaboration that has to exist between our commercial and R&amp;D organizations.</p>
          <p>I think the deal structure itself was also very good. Clearly, if you're buying a company with a product that's not yet on the market there is an enhanced risk, so I think we were able to structure the purchase price really around a similar structure to milestones that we would have done, if we'd have done a partnership instead of an outright acquisition.</p>
          <p>Clearly, I think another important aspect to this is that, we don't want to integrate BiPar. They clearly know that product. They know their business, and we want to leave them independent.</p>
          <p>Multaq, very strong support at the Advisory Committee. We've had very good progress with the FDA on labeling, and really see no particular issues with moving to an approval. Whether or not we actually get an approval on the action date is very difficult to say. As you've seen, there are always last minute technical glitches that come up and so I can't really say whether it's actually going to be approved on Thursday.</p>
          <p>But everything thus far has worked extremely well with the FDA, and we look forward to having certainly an approval in Q2, and moving forward with I think, with what will be an exciting new medicine.</p>
          <p>Page 10, three bolt-on acquisitions. They're bolt-on acquisitions, but when you're looking at acquisitions, you don't necessarily say, well, what does this mean to your worldwide company? If you do that, you're going to limit yourself. What I like about these acquisitions is we identify growth opportunities out there in the marketplace and we sought out to find resources, talent and products that could allow us to access those.</p>
          <p>So Zentiva now gives us a very strong branded generics platform in Central and Eastern Europe, and Turkey. And that's very important because we really were a sub-critical mass on generics. This now adds a substantial amount of sales, gives us a good base on which we can grow. We can leverage the global footprint that Sanofi-Aventis has and be able to move some of the products that Zentiva has beyond words, enable to market.</p>
          <p>Medley and Kendrick in Mexico and Brazil also not transformational from a company point of view, but very transformational for our operating companies in those markets. And really between Mexico and Brazil, we have close to &#x20AC;1.5 billion of sales, so these are important companies of ours and important markets. By buying these two companies, that gives us really a leading position as a generic manufacturer in Latin America.</p>
          <p>And I think it also says that, you want to be careful a little bit about even defining generics as our -- if our General Manager from Brazil were here with us today, he would say, well, you could argue we're already in the generics business because 95% of what he's selling is not covered by patents. And he's certainly -- and he and his team have certainly figured out how to compete in that kind of environment very successfully.</p>
          <p>So I think, people ask what's our acquisition strategy? I think these acquisitions are very emblematic of that. I wouldn't necessarily say that you can say that they're all going to be of that size, they just happen to have come down the pipeline like that, but they are very consistent with the strategy of diversifying, both geographically and in terms of line of business, and I think very much add to the platforms of growth that I laid out at our last meeting.</p>
          <p>So I'll close on slide 11, and say all right, I've got a to-do list. We all have a to-do list here, and we're working our way down that. I think we've started the year very well with very good Q1 results, led by some extremely strong performance of some of our core brands, and we're on track to deliver the year.</p>
          <p>We've added to the team. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine doesn't come from the pharmaceutical industry. I personally look at that as an extremely important aspect at a time when we're all looking to transform our business. Having a different experience I think is very important. The key Strategy Officer, Laurence Debroux, is up and running. That's very important. We looked at probably 75 projects in Q1 alone. You need a dedicated team with some commercial, scientific and financial expertise to really go through the product systematically and look for where we can find value. We've got some new external R&amp;D deals, and Marc will show you the percentage of our pipeline that really is related to partnerships. We've got disciplined investments. We've completed our R&amp;D review.</p>
          <p>Now looking forward, we expect approval for Multaq. We will be doing on July 2 an emerging markets investor seminar. I think that's very important, because in discussions with some of you, I mean, clearly, we as a company and I think we as an industry are moving away from the product-focused discussion we've always had. And I think it's going to be important to not only understand products, but also markets. In fact, we even struggle a little bit to think about how we're going to show you sales going forward to make this a little bit more transparent.</p>
          <p>But if we're going to be limited to showing key products, well, we have 400 products that are actually delivering quite a lot of our growth in emerging markets, and we would like to be able to share a little bit more about some of the key success factors that compel developments, what it takes to succeed in Brazil or in Africa or in China.</p>
          <p>And obviously then the Q2 results, I think we'll be able to give you a much clearer roadmap following our transformation programs. We're actually achieving recommendation phase coming up into the month of May. We'll be able to summarize those and present the impact for you on July 29 when we present Q2 results.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it to my colleague Marc Cluzel, Head of Global Research and Development, who's had an extremely busy Q1. So Marc, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you very much, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, for everybody in the U.S. So I will start with the slide 13. So as Chris said, the company is an ongoing transformation process quite extensively. And of course, R&amp;D is strongly involved. Our first priority was in fact to make a kind of portfolio prioritization, which will allow us very quickly, in fact, to define which product we should invest on. But at the same time to give some more flexibilities in order to re-look at some of our internal resources to external resources.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are now at the end of the process to evaluate, or to try to decipher, what will be the pharma in 2015, and by the way to define as R&amp;D for the expected pharma in 2015. And based on what we think should be the pharma in 2015, we will adapt the organization and increase with a strong, how to say that, with a strong involvement on innovation because we think that innovation will be key in the future.</p>
          <p>A little bit of word about how the portfolio review was done. So it was done on all the projects, in fact, covering all the products into development, but also products within one year of entering to development. So I think we must have covered more than 60 products. It was a multi dimensional approach, and as it is said in the slide 14, the four key dimension was degree of innovation, the extent of patient need addressed, the technical and commercial risk, and the overall value and return on investment.</p>
          <p>I think the thing that is not too important, what is much more important is how the process was done. The process was done with involvement of the whole company, so everybody, whatever the function, was involved in the process. And also, what is quite important, that we try to evaluate the risk on each key feature and, even what is much more important, we get an agreement on the level of risk for each of these key parameters, which is giving to the company, I think, a quite clear view for all the product.</p>
          <p>What must be said also that it was not only an internal process. Perhaps you are not fully aware, but now we are in place since 2008 meeting with peers. In fact, we have a separate meeting for European peers and with U.S. peers, and we are in fact thinking to address one for the Asian peers in the near future. So some of our decision we are backed, in fact, by the peers.</p>
          <p>So next point that before we were looking to the portfolio project by project, another feature of our evaluation will be that now there will be a symetrial review of the portfolio but with the global analysis of the portfolio mainly based on the risk exposure.</p>
          <p>So now moving to the slide 15, I will not spend too much time on the projects stopped. As said Chris, there is in development, in clinical development, 14 projects stopped and also there is four projects with very close go/no-go decision. I am fully ready to take your question during the question-and-answer-session.</p>
          <p>I think it is much more important to move to slide 16 and, in fact, to look in our portfolio what is new. And, in fact, again, I will emphasize as Chris, the importance of the partner venture for many reasons. The first reason is because we are making an acquisition of products, moving from mostly internal discovery to external discovery. We are reinforcing our oncological franchise at the time when it is absolutely critical. We have a brand new compound, which is first-in-class.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, as you will see in the next slide, we are reinforcing our portfolio at one stage where we are a little bit weak and where we need definitely to reinforce it, which is at the Phase II level. After &#x2013; on top of that, so we have one product entering Phase I in Alzheimer in cognitive and tactical input, as for improvement of cognition, and we have an anti-NGF in pain management, which has different characteristic from the Phase I, and it's not targeting exactly &#x2013; it's targeting the NGF, but it is not exactly the same biochemical profile. And I will bet on the other regulatory approval or submissions.</p>
          <p>So now moving to the portfolio, which is slide 17. So you have the number of products. I will make two comment. Despite the loss of four product in Phase III, we still have 11 products, we'll call in Pharma R&amp;D in Phase III, which is a relatively good level when compared to our peers. So I will say that in Phase III the portfolio is not too much at risk. If you are looking to the portfolio you may expect, in fact, to have much more product in Phase I and in Phase II than in Phase III, so just, I think it's to reemphasize what was said before, that we will need to make some acquisition in Phase I and in Phase II in order to reinforce our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving now for slide 18 and so going first to the right pie or Camembert and going in the same way as Chris. Now our part of internal versus external is roughly 25% external and 75% internal. We are still a little bit far from our peers, which most of time are roughly 50-50, but definitely when you are looking in terms of improvement of this ratio I think we are doing a good progress.</p>
          <p>Another interesting point also, which is on the left pie, we have the tradition of the reputation to be really a small chemical company in terms of R&amp;D. In fact, looking at the portfolio now, we are 50-50 between chemical entities and biologic. So I will say that if the transformation is not complete, we already started to change the landscape of the R&amp;D and, by definition, if we change the landscape of the R&amp;D we'll change a little bit the landscape of the company.</p>
          <p>So now moving to the slide 19, so it is a very difficult slide, so I will try to explain it of my best. What is presented in fact &#x2013; what is always presented is not the specific spending of some R&amp;D, but is a global spending of R&amp;D and in the global spending of R&amp;D you have some pharma R&amp;D budget, but on top of that you have the vaccine budget, on top of that you have some marketing studies and also you know there is more and more epidemiological studies pharmacology around spot marketing commitment and so on and so .</p>
          <p>So what is considered as the R&amp;D budget is, in fact, a mix of different factors and, based on that you can understand that, if for example, pharma R&amp;D is decreasing, but vaccine R&amp;D is increasing, the end result might be zero. On top of that you have two other points The first point is that when you stop a product, in fact at the time when you stop the product, it is costing you a little bit, and Mr. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine will show you that, in fact, we have some provision in the first quarter as a result. So the benefit is not translated immediately in the budget, due to pattern so that if we stop selling internal product it is also, as was said before in the slide on transforming R&amp;D but also in the comment from Chris, it is to acquire new &#x2013; to acquire new compounds.</p>
          <p>So to make it simple, at the end of this year, we're expecting low single-digit decline of the R&amp;D spend as a constant exchange rate in 2009. Of course, we are expecting more substantial decline in 2010, with the two caveats that I said. It depends of the expansion of the other part of the project and of course of the acquisition that we will do. So I hope I have been clear.</p>
          <p>Now moving to our potential blockbuster. The first one is for Aflibercept. So Aflibercept is in competition with Avastin, which is an anti-angiogenic agent. As it was already mentioned, the side effect is not only a VEGF inhibitor, it's also acting on the plasma growth factor. We are in fact in an extensive programming phase III, and to characterize it, there is three directions. The first direction is we are in a domain where Avastin sells, which is pancreatic cancer. We are in fact in domain after Avastin, which is lung, and which is colorectal, and this is and there is one domain where Avastin is still not there, which is prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>It's difficult at this time to give any kind of information about the product, except that the recruitment is going extremely well, in fact we are ahead of recruitment in three of the programs out of four. The program, which is slightly behind is a lung program, but by definition and by tradition, it is difficult to make studies with anti-androgenic agent in this population. And also, one point which might interest you, that you know that with Avastin you have thrombotic event, and thrombotic event in fact are linked to the creation of the complex between the antibody and the platelets, so it was considered for the development of AGS and a precedent of specific interest, also we have some information from pre-clinical that Aflibercept is not creating this complex and so far, in terms of monitoring, we do not expect a thrombotic event, but of course it has to be a concern at the end of the trial.</p>
          <p>Going now for the slide 21, which is the PARP inhibitor, so in fact, we are very excited about the result of a study, with the PARP inhibitor was under the response to chemotherapy in triple negative cancer. So we'll go fast on triple negative, but it is in woman who, in fact, whose tumor is not expressing estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or epithelial growth factor.</p>
          <p>What it is bad to not express these receptor, it is that if your tumor is expressing this receptor, it means that just tumor is somewhere stimulated by these factors and, in fact, if you limited this factor you can have in fact a better prognosis, if you are lacking this stimulating agent, it means that you have less tool to treat the patient, the breast cancer, and so it's not too surprising to discover that the prognosis of this cancer is very bad. And here we might have in fact one of the first effective treatment for this specific population, which is really a dramatic medical need, and I think the best is to have a meeting at ASCO when the result will be published.</p>
          <p>At the same time of course, we are looking for other indication, what might be also interesting is that it will might be for this product link a little bit of targeted therapy because as the pop is not the only way to repair the DNA, and it might be interesting in fact to administer the drug in population while acting all the ways to repair the DNA because we will increase the potency of the compound.</p>
          <p>So now moving to slide, sorry for the faux pas, we are in discussion with the FDA now to define the Phase III program, and based upon the efficacy of the drug, we hope to have a kind of accelerated development.</p>
          <p>Now moving to vaccine and to the Dengue, so you know you that the Dengue is touching a very large part of the population, and it's relatively clear on this chart, which is on the right part of the slide page 22. So 230 million people, 2 million children, and also it is not put in the slide, but there's roughly 30,000 deaths by year. There is at the present time no treatment available and each year's result might be worse than the previous one.</p>
          <p>So definitely again, there is a huge unmet medical needs. I think for this concern, it's surely at the level of global health, and so we are pushing as much as we can, both clinically and in fact also in terms of industry reparation, and with announcement of in fact the factory in Brazil, just dedicated to this vaccine. And of course because here we are touching global health, we are working very closely with the WHO <mark type="inaudible" /> and so and so, and the first filing is planned in 2014.</p>
          <p>So now moving to slide 23, I should say that in our road map for the first quarter, we are relatively correct in fact, because I think we have achieved what we were supposed to achieve. As Chris said, we are waiting for this quarter the approval of Multaq, and so, at least in the U.S., and so the consequent launch of Multaq with a level which is reflecting the value of the product and in our study.</p>
          <p>So what are the next steps for choosing R&amp;D resource on project with best chance of success and acceptable return? I think it's already done with, but as you know, it is an over-going process so we need to continue and we need to continue to share the portfolio, and also to look outside. We are now discussing structure in place. So after that now it's evaluation and the deal process which is machine shop.</p>
          <p>So, accelerating R&amp;D partnership, I think we have done already quite a lot in the past, but we will accelerate in the future. And more details on R&amp;D transformation will be given on the Q2 results. So now it's my pleasure to turn over my friend, Hanspeter.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, good afternoon to everybody. To report on the first quarter performance is a good thing to do because overall, we believe that the performance is solid. We have put at the top of page number 25 also as planned indicating that when we did this plan, which was done in the second half of 2008, we of course could not anticipate the full dimension of the financial and economic crisis.</p>
          <p>So indicating now is that we perform resisting very well against those crises, despite the fact that we see some impact in countries like Mexico and Brazil but overall we do well. We have a growth rate say now 3.5% in terms of sales composed from 9% for vaccines and 3% for pharmaceuticals. Performance in Europe has been improved a little bit. You may remember that our performance has been slightly negative during all of 2008. Now sales are stable. In U.S. we do better that the market, with about 5% growth and in the rest of the world, 7.3%, which is more or less in line with the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>On Page 27, we turn to one of the special strengths of our company, our performance in the emerging markets. Now on the chart you see that in the so called BRIC-M, we are growing by 13.5%, <mark type="inaudible" /> and once again, despite some negative impact, as a consequence of the crisis by wholesaler de-stocking. So, BRIC-M performance before forecast to continue to be very positive for 2009 and we remain convinced that the close will be very close to 10% or even slightly above.</p>
          <p>In line receipts, we have reinforced our market leading positions in some parts of the world by the recent acquisition, to which Chris has already alluded. This will translate in the fact that, first of all we will have a market share of about 6% in these parts of the world and, second, that the part of sales coming from those countries will increase by about 50%. From the chart you also see that we have very good split, I feel, of risk sharing between the major parts of world, the United States, Western Europe and the rest of world because we have exactly one-third of our sales coming out of those three parts.</p>
          <p>On page 28, then you see a translation of the recent acquisition what we will become as of the second quarter of 2009 when we will be consolidating sales of Zentiva, Kendrick and Medley. You see that, yes, we advance pretty significantly from 0.4 billion of sales to 1.2 billion of sales on an annual basis, of course, we will become the number eight generic player globally and evidently, we will become the number one in Central and Eastern Europe and in Latin America sales markets, where we have this great confidence of conviction that those markets will continue to grow over proportionally.</p>
          <p>Now turning the page, to the next page 29, some comments on our key products, I start with Lovenox. Also in this respect, Chris has already indicated that the overall growth rate is 1.3% for the first quarter. Evidently looks modest, but if you look at chart you see that there is kind of bubble in the first quarter 2008, which was a consequence to the so called Heparin crisis when, especially in the United States, there was overstocking and in the first quarter we are now competing against this artificial first quarter of 2008. The underlying growth drivers like prescription rate and so on continues to be absolutely normal and you will then see in the second quarter 2009 that we are back to the normal, linear growth for this product.</p>
          <p>Good news from the European authorities. They have guidelines issued for low molecular weight Heparins as biosimilars they have become published quite recently. The major key take away is that those companies competing for those products will have to submit in Europe, clinical data for each individual indication, which evidently don't make our market excess, more complex and also costly and we will have to see which impact the European decision will have on the FDA decision, which is still pending. I may anticipate the eventual questions. We have absolutely no news in respect of Lovenox coming from the FDA and for evident reasons at least for the time being we take no news for good news.</p>
          <p>Last words in context of Lovenox, so far the impact of the oral anticoagulants remains very insignificant with market shares of approximately 1% in Germany, UK and France, where those respective products have been launched.</p>
          <p>On page 30 you see then the very nice performance of Lantus. Lantus has taken leadership in the latest launch market, which has been Japan. You see that we have here the usual picture. Lantus has taken over the NPH products. It's also performing superior to Detemir. The reasons in Japan are the same as in the rest of the world. We have a very strong support from our pens from SoloSTAR. We have obtained the new registration for SoloSTAR in the context of Apidra from the ASPA. And those pens contribute to the overall growth, but this of course is not the only growth driver. There is a continued stream of positive clinical data coming out for Lantus and this is continuously driving the really superior growth of this product.</p>
          <p>On page 31, you'll see that the success story of Plavix continues. The product has obtained nearly 1.7 billion sales in terms of our own consolidation you have received yesterday, the figure of the United States being issued by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The product continues to perform very well with a growth rate of nearly 9%. We have received very positively against the alternative source competition in Germany. We maintain a market share of very close to 80% and we feel also this is very encouraging for the months to come.</p>
          <p>Strong performance in Japan, the product has obtained in the first quarter 70 million, growing by more than 90%. For the remaining years in the life cycle of the product we remain extremely confident. We have new positive data coming out of the trial which was recently published, called ACTIVE-A. The data gives us additional opportunities to promote the product in atrial fibrillation; therefore, we will submit the request for additional indication to the FDA within very short. Evidently, we see some synergies through the upcoming promotion of Multaq there and we have also from the same trial new evidence in the field of stroke reduction, which has been a field which was not so well developing in the current quarters. But with the new data, we will regain momentum also in stroke prevention. This is not all. There are still two more trials going on. The current trial in the Clarinet are, results are to be expected for later 2009 and 2010 early.</p>
          <p>Page 32, Taxotere sales of 534 million, growing by 8.3%, as the composition of this growth has not really changed. There has been a little bit of a negative effect in terms of growth rate, which had been in the fourth quarter 2009 at two digits and this comes from wholesalers destocking in the first quarter of 2009 in the United States, but this is a technical effect of course, which will be equalized as of the next and the following quarter. Also in the context of Taxotere, which of course, remains the product with the largest field of indications, we are promoting the product in eight indications in the United States. Also there is continued flow of new positive data in the early stages of breast cancer and, yes, you also continue second management by new dosage points and therefore good to report that we intend to launch during in 2009 more or less worldwide a 1-vial form of Taxotere.</p>
          <p>I close then on page 33, concerning the pharmaceutical products with Multaq. Of course you are aware that we have a planned March 18 a positive recommendation from the FDA advisory Board. Our conversations progress very well with the FDA concerning the labeling and, if you look to the right side, you see the anticipation and perception of American physicians concerning the product attributes of Multaq.</p>
          <p>And I think so the attributes are very much in line with what we expect in terms of labeling, and you see that the leading attribute is reduction of risk for cardiovascular hospitalization. So we believe that we will make a product available which matches those expectations in a very positive and interesting way. And therefore we are looking forward to commercialize the product during the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now the last chart can dedicated to the Vaccines or to say our good performance that you have seen before plus 9.1%, &#x20AC;627 million of absolute sales. You see the Pentacel growing by nearly 34% and VAXIGRiP growing by 44%, have been growth drivers. You see there is a little bit of a <mark type="inaudible" /> around Menactra, which has negative sales growth of 13%, since this is an effect which is mainly caused by a certain saturation of our patient population in the United States. So please keep in mind that the product, for the time being, for capacity reasons is only commercialized in the U.S. and there we have obtained a large penetration in those patient groups which have been approved. We expect, and we have good reason to expect, new acceleration of growth when we have obtained additional patient groups, infants and toddlers, and for this we will be filing a request for extension by 2009.</p>
          <p>Important to note that we start to obtain our vaccine business very strong sales growth in these emerging markets, where we have started to combine the pharmaceutical business with the vaccine business, and consequently you see that in Latin America our sales are up by 51% and in Asia Pacific by nearly 17%.</p>
          <p>So let me close. We have a very good performance during the first quarter and this close is perfectly in line with our expectations. We have consequently to the recently announced strategy reinforced our positions through acquisitions but also additional investment into major products, regions, generics and evidently in the emerging markets and, yes, we are ready to launch Multaq as soon as we have obtained final approval from the FDA, which is due for the second quarter in 2009.</p>
          <p>So this gives me the opportunity to pass on to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, who will give you more figures on this performance.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter. Good afternoon, and good morning to those being on the other side of ocean. It's my pleasure to be in the position to present this strong set of results for the first time for Sanofi-Aventis, so we go through the coming slides and comment what have been the main drivers for this improved profitability which we have posted this morning. So after all when it come to sales, here on page 37. To understand properly our sales, it's important to remember that since the 1st of April, 2008, we do not commercialize COPAXONE anymore in North America, which is the main impact of the Group structure, but when it is impacting our sales it is not impacting our reserves. For the contribution for the royalty which is served by Teva of COPAXONE is booked at the level of all the current operating income. So you could say basically that it has no impact on our results event slightly positive, firstly because our performance has been good, and second because we have a positive impact of the exchange rate of the <mark type="inaudible" /> as against the euro <mark type="inaudible" /> for this royalties.</p>
          <p>Apart from this impact, when it comes to the rest, we have both positive impact of organic growth, so actually what we need to read as an underlying performance is 3.5% of sales growth, along with what Hanspeter has just commented a few minutes ago. And a positive impact of the exchange rate for a total amount of &#x20AC;183 million, that is 2.7. So all in all, 2.5 increase of sales on a reported basis, and with a 2.7% contribution of exchange rate and a negative contribution of <mark type="inaudible" /> the level of sales.</p>
          <p>The coming two slides are mainly commenting about the exchange rate impact, you know that we have saving in various currencies, so just as a reminder on page 38 to have a gross picture. Our sales have been making euro for around 36% and in USD for around 32%, in Japanese yen for 7%, and quite a number of currencies for the rest, along with the variety of our geographic positions, the next coming currency being the sterling but only for 4% of the rest being slower contributors.</p>
          <p>Of course, despite not very much changing from one year to another, apart from the change of currencies and of course, when the U.S. dollar is increasing, the relative contribution of U.S. dollar in sales is slightly increasing as well.</p>
          <p>You have on page 39 some more details to understand how the various variations of guarantees have impacted our sales. In fact, we have had a positive impact mainly from two currencies, U.S. dollar and yen. U.S. dollar for 240 million is the largest, of course and 121 for the yen. The other ones having a negative impact, which all in all is in the range of 180 leading to the net 183 million, which is a net impact of the currency variations.</p>
          <p>Now if I move from this phase to the P&amp;L, and here I am on page 40. You can see that when sales of, on the reported basis been increasing by 2.5, and our core center being stable, all other elements in terms of costs decreasing and their focus would include improvement of the operating income, which is growing by 14.9, close to 15%, on the current exchange rate on 8.6 on constant exchange rate.</p>
          <p>The few comments on this slide. First of all, the fact that beyond the contribution of the increase of sales on like-for-like basis, you have also the contribution of other revenues that remains of other revenue are mainly royalties resulting from our partnerships, in particular in connection with Plavix.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we have those, the contribution of the increase of sales of Plavix, in particular in the U.S., but also the contribution of a stronger dollar. And therefore, bringing to a significant increase of the gross profit, which is increasing by 2.4%, when the sales are stable and therefore improving the gross profit margin.</p>
          <p>On the slight increase in <mark type="inaudible" /> sales, some explanation, as Marc has described, we have decided to terminate a certain number of projects. On some point some of these projects studies have been launched including external studies on the clinical trials; therefore, we have to complete them and we take the provisions on these remaining costs during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In fact, we have the impact of the termination of our project, which is an impact of 54 million of the R&amp;D costs, which excluding this cost as you can see, we would have had stable costs of R&amp;D on the current exchange rate basis on the decrease of the R&amp;D spending on constant currency basis, which is consistent with what Marc has mentioned when it comes to the trend for the overall year in terms of R&amp;D expenses, which will should be single-digit decrease.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A as usual, I could say are under control, are continuing to decrease by 5.6% on the constant exchange rate basis. Therefore leading to the improvement of operating income, which I already commented. The main <mark type="inaudible" /> when it comes to all the operating income is precisely the contribution of the CapEx on the royalty in our first quarter 2009 where it was going into various lines in 2008.</p>
          <p>Shortly on page 41, if I go down to the net, as you can see, your net income is increasing by 15.7% on the constant exchange rate basis 8.7 and, as long as a number of shares has decreased and, as you remember, that we had concerns on shares last year. The EPS had gone by close to 10% on the constant exchange rate, 16.8 is a very good result on the current exchange rate basis.</p>
          <p>Maybe for you to weather the storm where it comes from, I could make it simple. If I take the adjusted net income, the overall increase can be divided into two parts, one contribution, in the contribution of exchange rate, it is 132 million. The rest, contribution of operating performance is 163. Out of this 163, around 110 comes from increased sales and increased gross profit, and around 50 coming from the decrease in absolute terms of costs R&amp;D <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So this leads on page 42, to improvement of all ratios, say like that. First of all, the cost of sales to sales ratio, which is decreasing very significantly from 27.2 to 24.8. We can say here that it's coming from three elements, one is the CapEx element, which is impacting positive yields as a level of margins by pound 0.9. Second is coming from the exchange rate, the benefit from the stronger dollar, so it is contributing for around 0.9, and the rest is improvement of cost of sales, as well as evolution of the mix of products being sold.</p>
          <p>As units of sales ratio is below 25. You may remember that we gave the guidance when, on the 11th of February that we should be able to decrease our SG&amp;A ratio by around 1%, from 26 to 25. So I can today confirm guidance for the full year and therefore we have, as a combination of these two elements, significant improvement of both operating margins and net income margin.</p>
          <p>Page 43, some topical comments on the sensitivity of our EPS to the valuation of currencies. Here again, there is really one currency which is impacting significantly, which can impact significantly our EPS, and you know that already. The average sensitivity is one set movement of the U.S. dollar against euro as a contribution of plus or minus 0.5% of the EPS variation. For the other currencies, I would say the impact is for all currencies really marginal.</p>
          <p>Also I think what is noticeable, this is page 44, is the strong cash flow generation. We have generated before acquisitions, a master valuation of working capital &#x20AC;2.3 billion of cash flow. So it has allowed us to finance all acquisitions, including the debt from the company, which we have acquired, namely Zentiva. So the overall investments has been in acquisitions have been 1.8, a bit more than 1.8. And even that has been financed with cash flow so that the net debt has decreased, again, from 1.8 to 1.2. The two rating agencies have confirmed their rating with a stable outlook. We can say quite simply that we have a strong flexibility to cope with a near potential external development we might consider.</p>
          <p>So just to summarize, with solid underlying sales performance in line with expectations, the continued cost management and cost control, a strong EPS growth on cash flow generation with lower, very lower I would say debt &#x2013; net debt level. So we can, as Chris has mentioned, reconfirm our EPS guidance for the year, which is at least a 7% increase at constant exchange rate, assuming there is no material adverse effect which may take place before year-end. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Starting off with a question for Chris, when you talked about an update on transforming -- all the transforming program with the second quarter results I was just wondering, are we talking about target &#x2013; for cost savings over the long-term or even more than it's on a structural basis? Question on the Copaxone royalty through the other operating income line, could you just quantify that, and also highlight, how much of the other operating income was Allegra royalties?</p>
          <p>And then a question on the pipeline, the Aflibercept combo, the FOLFOX trial, just wondering on Phase III design there, does the control lot involve an Avastin or Erbitux competitor, and also is that a combination of either or both of those agents? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Graham. Let me start off on Q2, so in Q2, we will be able to, I think, give some guidance as to what we think the financial impact of transforming will be. I would stress that, I have been very clear internally and externally, that transforming, though, is much more than what this might have to do with cost. We are busy trying to have the most creative and innovative research and development.</p>
          <p>We need to reorient the business on a more globally diversified model, and we'll put some meat on the bone certainly on that. That having been said, clearly as you've heard from the R&amp;D presentation, given that we've stopped a number of projects, and we're looking at things like shared services, that we would expect that there's some financial enhancements coming out of that, and we'll be able to give you some greater precision around that at the Q2. As far as the other income goes, I'll turn it over to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so you may remember that last year we told you the contribution of Copaxone for the first quarter, which was &#x20AC;51 million at operating income levels, when said were 220 million. This year we &#x2013; they have a positive impact of the exchange rate. And on top of that, we have some improvement in the contribution of Copaxone, because Copaxone has done very well during the first quarter. So, all in all, it is more subjective Q1, let's say in the range of 60 plus.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the end of the question was a little bit lost on the phone. For the first part of the question in the first round of trial, we have decided not to go head to head versus Avastin. <mark type="inaudible" /> a little bit to carry both the compound and generic monthly. The value of our compounds, so as I said, we decided to go in an area where Avastin failed at pancreatic cancer.</p>
          <p>Second line, versus Avastin, colorectal and lung, and the new area which is posted At the same time, now we have initiated a trial in first line colorectal in order based on the result to go head to head versus Avastin.</p>
          <p>I think, versus Erbitux, since we do not have exactly the same mechanism of action. I think it's difficult to do it in &#x2013; at the first glance. I think we're still not at the stage, I think initially we have to position Aflibercept versus Avastin and once we have positioned Aflibercept versus Avastin, it will be time to go for a new regimen or new definition of regimen in terms of treatment of concept.</p>
          <p>And I'm sorry but the last part of the question was lost in the, there was some kind of, I don't know if I answered correctly your question.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To be absolutely clear on the, what you said on the head-to-head there, that you would actually initiate with the head-to-head or that you would run a study that was against best, just against FOLFOX initially and then look to initiate the head-to-head later, just to be clear on that?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, afternoon. Three questions, if I may. Firstly on Multaq, perhaps if you could share with us, your planned pricing strategy? And also confirm the contribution margin should be pretty positive pretty quickly given the lack of incremental sales? Second, on emerging markets, sales force, I should say, second on emerging market. When I look at the IMS breakdown from some of your key territories, it's only by 11%, on revenues is 24%. Could you just explain the delta in term of additional revenues that make up the remainder of the sales?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is, just thinking about the diversification and the reallocation of capital into low cost health solutions or just call it generics, particularly in the emerging markets, what are you doing to try to minimize execution risk in terms of maintaining the existing managements of the businesses that your acquired and actually I'm going to speak in a final one?</p>
          <p>I didn't really understand the significance the dengue fever slide for the product which only gets introduced in 2015, perhaps if you could explain that, that'd be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Andrew. Let me ask Hanspeter to deal with Multaq and the emerging markets, I'll come back on diversification and dengue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Andrew, I understand your interest, but evidently it's too early to give you a precise price for Multaq, because mainly we will adjust the prices when we have the final label. But I think there are some criteria evidence that is &#x2013; it's chronic treatment. It is a totally unique product which has outstanding and unique outcome data, and it is an important patient population, 7 million. But on the other side it is not such an important patient population, as let's say we have for Plavix.</p>
          <p>So you as a professional I think, you will conclude from this that the price will be in the upper range of chronicle treatment in cardiovascular and let's say diabetes. But to give more precision it is today too early.</p>
          <p>Sales for that's very easy one, we will do it this in the U.S. for the time being, because we are the most advanced, with a separate sales force in hospital and in the private market. We will target, of course, cardiologists, but we will accompany to launch with contacts to GPs, which we found are important to maintain this product. But we will not increase our sales force. We will totally cover the launch out of the existing head count and also say head count planned for 2009.</p>
          <p>Then second part, the Zentiva, Kendrick and Medley question, so to say, so two or three governing principles for this. First of all, we will keep those businesses relatively apart as far as the operational side is concerned. In country we will integrate all general services like accounting, purchasing, et cetera, and we will make shelf services in all our markets concerned. But once again, from an operational point of view, from a development point of view, from a regulatory point of view, we will keep those businesses separate because we believe it will be a mistake not to handle it as a different business, as in fact it is.</p>
          <p>Now as also said already before by Chris, generic is not necessarily as generic in Brazil or in Europe, so there will be, of course, adaptation through the regional structure but the other governing principle will be, said we will be using Medley as our, let's call it generic platform, for the Latin American markets and we will be using Zentiva for the European market, which means we will concentrate all our assets for further developing our presence in generics around. So it's two companies where we have the necessary management and the necessary know-how, and in doing so we also believe that we will motivate this management to stay and to contribute as in the past and we have firm science that this is absolutely the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me come back to dengue. Actually the slide said 2014 not 2015, but that's actually a misprint as well. The actual early fillings for dengue will be in 2012. We are in Phase really IIb with that study and would move pretty quickly into Phase III. That might even be earlier, depending on what the results look like. So the other thing I would just say is I think, although you may look at this as a developing world vaccine, when you actually look at the number of people and the tiered pricing, personally I think this could be a bigger vaccine than anything we sell today. So that's why we highlighted it. It's big sales potential, and it is actually in the 2012 timeframe at least in terms of filing.</p>
          <p>In terms of diversification, you know, execution risk and maintaining management. Certainly on execution risk, I think if you say well, what we do well, I'm up kind of to five kind of critical successes factors. I mean, I think we understand healthcare professionals. We understand distribution to pharmacy. We understand getting reimbursement from either insurance companies or government providers. We understand the need to develop scientific or clinical evidence to support a marketing proposal and we understand, you know, technical things liked patents and technology.</p>
          <p>So to me as we look at diversification, if I see businesses that have three or four of those things then I think we minimize execution risk. Somebody asked me about whether we'd get back into beauty products. Well, to me beauty products don't share too many of those five things. So I probably wouldn't want to get in to that. Equally, we can imagine some products, certain devices for example, that share quite a number those things. They're reimbursed. They're prescribed and they're, you know, the physician is the key customer, those sorts of things. So we would see less execution risk.</p>
          <p>Buying things, clearly making sure we retain management, is really up at the top of the to-do list when we do things and whether it's Zentiva or Medley or even BiPar, you know in the BiPar we clearly structured that to insure that those people who have led this business so successfully are the ones who actually continue to lead that business. And thus far we've actually been pretty successful at it. You've always got to watch out, you know you make management millionaires and they all want to head to the beach. So you do have to be careful that you don't lose that talent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think just remember the more you move outside of U.S. and Europe, the less reliable the numbers become. You know, vaccines are in some markets, not others. We have OTC businesses, which aren't included in IMS. Like I say, once you move outside of the Classical Western European markets, I think the data become much more difficult to interpret and as become more diversified.</p>
          <p>In fact, I was in China last week and I told management, I don't want to ever see anybody show me the ranking of our company, not necessarily products, products is fair enough, but I don't to see ranking in IMS terms, because I don't want the IMS definition of market to be our definition of the market. China is a developing frontier that, you know, that is not practiced like in Europe and the U.S. And if you start off with IMS numbers, you are going to define the market in the way we do it in the U.S. and Europe. So I personally really don't even want to see IMS being used, at least for &#x2013; as an overall company point of view, because it's going to distort our strategic thinking.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen. Congratulations on an excellent quarter and also thank you for the increased disclosure on your business and geographical segments. I have three questions on R&amp;D. One is on your R&amp;D spending. You've cut your late stage pipeline by one third over the past two years. And yet your R&amp;D spending remains stable. Could you just share with us what is the main reason behind that? I understand you've got a number of fixed costs, but they are not only fixed costs?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Idrabiotaparinux, what is the kind of profile you would want to see to decide to continue with this product when you have additional data in six months? And lastly on the GLP-1 and the AVE0010, have you made any amendment to your Phase III program following the Advisory Committee of Liraglutide last months? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to start about the cost. I tried to explain that what you are seeing is a mix of different factors from R&amp;D representing 70%, which is lot, but only 70%. So if you are thinking as R&amp;D pharma there is already a substantial reduction this year in terms of the budget. And since there is provision this year for some of the product which are stopped, there will be even more substantial reduction next year. This is for the variable cost. Of course, if we have less activities based, not external but internal, based on the reduction of the portfolio, we will have, and in fact we are in the process of looking at it as part of R&amp;D 2015.</p>
          <p>We have to adapt our organization. In fact, not too much to the present situation, but what we expect it to be is a situation in one and two years because it will be clearly to withdraw, to adapt all that to expand again. So I think what you are doing at the present time is really trying to get a nice view of what will be the current volume of activities. For activities, because some activities are impacted by the discovery, by example, is not impacted by the fact that we are stopping product.</p>
          <p>And also, you need to put into account that including product within the portfolio as a cost to borrow is a cost by example for R&amp;D in 2009. So again, in variable cost decrease this year, most substantial cost next year, and we are in the process of adapting the internal resources to the volume of the activities within the company. But not on a day-to-day basis but on a projection of what will be the activity in the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of profit on new product, but that bottleneck if fact we are not waiting for clinical data, because the clinical data will be 2010. But we want to be really sure with the FDA that we are addressing all the concern of the FDA, especially about potential bleeding with a long-term compound. So you have a compound which is on board for one week, which is accumulating a little bit with the duration of treatment. And so, it's a kind of total reassurance.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean that we have a specific signal from the FDA about that, but before to continue last program, we want relatively clear insurance about what the FDA is expecting from us in terms of clinical data to address any kind of bleeding signal. I must say that at the present time we do not have a bleeding signal. In the initial study, we did of <mark type="inaudible" /> was relatively low. And Boghalis, which is a study of short duration, is so far going ready for our treatment and we do not have a bleeding signal. But still it is &#x2013; it has been identifying during the review of the company as a high-risk regulatory order and in fact the company wants to ask R&amp;D to address this specific point and we will come back to you on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of GLP-1, I think we are a little bit different from competition in the way that competition has this trial done, unfortunately, before the issue of the guidance, so they were already acting in a retroactive way.</p>
          <p>We have the chance to, there's a possibility to act a little bit more in a proactive way. I think you are thinking mainly about <mark type="inaudible" /> we do not have too much effect. I think you are thinking in terms of cardiovascular effect. So far we have not reached a conclusion <mark type="inaudible" /> I think sometime you have some advantage of being late. I think that this time we have an advantage of being late because we can act proactively and not retroactively under definition of cardiovascular event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just maybe I'll follow up a little bit. To put a little bit more things concrete I mean clearly there is no -- Marc showed you that the graph out of the 4.6 billion he's got 3.3 billion of which about two thirds is fixed cost, one-third is variable.</p>
          <p>Out of the projects that we have stopped, if you were to annualize the variable costs, which we think will be saved, and this is a net, because as Marc said, as BiPar comes into the portfolio we will have some clinical cost for that.</p>
          <p>So by adding BiPar and cutting the other products, we estimate that's around &#x20AC;200 million on an annualized basis, and we'll have to look at the overall structure and be able to come back to you and that will probably &#x2013; will give you more of a feel for that later in the year.</p>
          <p>On the Idrabiotaparinux, I think it's just useful to give you a little bit of a sense of, again, what goes on behind the curtains. I would say probably I would be skeptical about the product. Marc is highly passionate about the product. I think that's a healthy thing.</p>
          <p>I can tell you there's plenty of people will tell you that Plavix would never have seen the light of day if R&amp;D hadn't been passionate. I can tell you Advair would never have seen the light of day if there hadn't been a few people who believed in it.</p>
          <p>So I think you have to &#x2013; as we look at the review we have to get behind it and, at some point, somebody's got to believe in something. I think what is important is that you don't kill that passion on the scientific side but you do put in place a number of milestones.</p>
          <p>So I respect Marc's passion for the product, but I also want to know okay, there is a bleeding issue potentially and we have a meeting with the FDA. If the FDA can get comfortable with it, then I think I support Marc's view on it. If the FDA is not, then we clearly have a safety signal that &#x2013; potentially a safety signal that we would have to address, but I think we have to say it's not all quite so black and white here, and I personally have a huge respect for our R&amp;D colleagues who really do believe in a product because, at the end of the day, when we look at the history of this industry, sometimes that belief has really triumphed over commercial logic.</p>
          <p>So that's why we put in on the table, said hey we know these are some projects where not everybody would see the immediate benefit, but we have identified milestones. We've got a process, and I think we've got an objective way of looking at this.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A few questions. Going back to R&amp;D, obviously things are in flux in the near term in terms of portfolio assessment, but I am wondering if you can give us some directional guidance for long-term R&amp;D spending as you see it over the next three or four or five years? Do you think for Sanofi, that's going to be an upward trajectory, or a flat trajectory, or a downward trajectory?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on Multaq and on life cycle management plans. I guess I'm kind of surprised that I don't yet see any additional trials being run with the product post the ATHENA results, and I'm wondering at some point if we might see more programs initiated?</p>
          <p>Last question on Plavix. Your partner Bristol seems to expect that there very well might be additional country launches of generic Plavix in Europe in the current year. I'm wondering if you share that view, and if so, what countries that might include?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, I'll start with the Plavix. I think it is a fair statement from Bristol-Myers that there may be additional launches in Europe. First of all, in some European countries there is no more patent protection for Plavix, which is a natural, so to say, event, because the patent in those markets, which are by far not the most important markets inside Europe, but nevertheless it's off.</p>
          <p>Second, there is so far no common position from the European authorities being issued how they will handle the question of alternatives sought. We understand that European authorities have stopped the clock in this respect, but beyond, we have no other information. And yes, I think it's a careful statement to say that we cannot exclude that there may be other launches, but all the rest is speculation.</p>
          <p>I think it's nevertheless worth, once again, to mention that in a highly price-sensitive and highly accessible market for any kind of generic competition like Germany, we succeed and resist very well with the market share of approximately 80%. So I think this has to be put into perspective with what Dehecq said. So, yes, Bristol-Myers is right. But I think it's also right to say that so far there is no other market accessible. The European authorities sit and think what to say. And last, but not least, we have reason to believe that any penetration of generics would not necessarily show a typical pattern as usually is the case in the U.S. or in Germany, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Multaq, I think and you're looking at atrial fibrillation, in fact in all cases, the products were registered initially on surrogate endpoint which was EKG. And after, in fact, all the goal of life cycle management was to demonstrate some gain of morbidity-mortality advantage. So when you're looking at Multaq, in fact, we started from morbidity-mortality study. So I'd say the emergency need for life cycle management is perhaps less than in the previous situation.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we thought that when you're doing life cycle management is to expand the population, so it was quite important to wait for the final label of the FDA in order to know what will be exactly the initial population which can be exposed to Multaq. And to answer totally your question, there will be, of course, life cycle management with Multaq once &#x2013; I think now we're close to the level, so I think we can start to work really on life cycle management in the last phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So coming back to R&amp;D costs, I think, you're looking at an -- a few components in here. The vaccines part on R&amp;D, I mean, we've got a pretty robust pipeline. Part of the costs are going up because we acquired Acambis last year, which is largely an R&amp;D organization, so that adds to R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Although, that having been said, to the extent that we've acquired R&amp;D, vaccines business Sanofi Pasteur is actually been looking to make some budget cuts as well, so that it's not all additive, but the net is still an additive.</p>
          <p>Then you've got post-marketing commitments and the pharmacovigilance and that's not all necessarily going to go away because, clearly in an environment of things being safety conscious, this isn't the time you'd want to go and cut back on expense on that.</p>
          <p>So if you look -- but however, if you look at the pharma piece, which is the 70%, then I would say well, this kind of depends a little bit about what happens. If we found no new products, then actually you would expect to see R&amp;D expenses decline from, I would call it a high-water mark, in 2008.</p>
          <p>To the degree that we're able to find new products and they come into development, clearly that comes in. Now, that might happen in two different ways. Some of that might go on the balance sheet, depending on the accounting treatment for that, because under IFRS where you've acquired somebody else's product and you have milestones, that could well go on the balance sheet, especially if they continue to do the work.</p>
          <p>To the extent that we take it on and they come into our portfolio, and we start spending money on development, then clearly you will see some increased expense. So I would say, if I were in your shoes as an analyst, I would say, well my baseline is probably more on a somewhat declining path, and every time we come up with an announcement about what we might be adding to the pipeline, you probably want to ask us about how we're treating that from an accounting point of view. Is this going on the balance sheet or is this adding to expenses? So I hope that kind of helps, Tim.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have just three quick questions if I may, and maybe a fourth if I'm not pushing my luck. Well, I just wanted to understand your aspirations for the generics business within Sanofi, given the number eight status today, you've obviously made steps to increase your exposure in terms of emerging markets. But I'm just trying to understand long-term what the aspiration might be for that and whether therefore further acquisitions are on the agenda?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with respect to emerging markets, I'm just wondering if you could give a comment in terms of how we should think about the operating margin on the emerging market sales? And obviously a lot of upfront investment today, but where might they get to in future?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on the product mix that we saw -- improvement in the first quarter, can you just identify what products were the key levers of that, that driving that change in product mix? I'll leave it there, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, starting on the generics, that's not such an easy question because and I have said so many times before, it depends on how you define generics, and I have said -- earlier said because generic is a non-patent protected product which is sensitive to the promotion through price. We are already a pretty big generic company. But if you're really talking in the closest senses of Zentiva or Medley, I would say as a watermark to have a significant impact here, we probably have to continue to double our immediate size, which is approximately as you see in the presentation, 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>So I believe that to be something really and to shield our sales should get close to 3 billion and of course, it's also in the light, that at least I believe that the market of generics will continue to consolidate. So perhaps, this may help you as an orientation or an aspiration.</p>
          <p>On the emerging markets, we have said earlier that, at least as of today, our operating margin in the emerging markets is at least on the same level as in other markets. And when I say other markets, it's primarily Europe, because, as you know, our profit and loss in the U.S. is pretty atypical because we have relatively lower sales but relatively higher profit coming from the special configuration. We are selling and promoting Plavix and avapoem, so I believe that because the European margins probably will go down over the coming years, I believe that in fact the situation in terms of operating margins in the emerging markets will not change.</p>
          <p>I believe they are very solid. It has to do that the prices are relatively high. It has to do that patients are evidently relatively low as well, and it has to do that the promotional schemes are different to others, and you can obtain with relatively little in terms of promotional investment a lot of positive impact on your sales. So in summary, I don't believe that proportionally the operating margin in the emerging markets will go down, as compared to Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I would just add on to what Hanspeter said, remember, I think one of the major things we are doing is disconnecting our R&amp;D investment from overall sales. So if we expand our sales by buying Medley, or they grow in China, it doesn't necessarily follow that we're going to spend 15 or 16% of those sales on R&amp;D, because we don't necessarily need the R&amp;D to replace those sales.</p>
          <p>We are basically building up our R&amp;D expense on the basis of projects and what we want to invest in. And I am not committing to spend any percentage number on R&amp;D. If we come up with the projects, we'll spend more. If we don't have the projects, we will spend less.  But I have seen too long in my career this whole idea of well, you know, we've got to stick to a certain number, otherwise everybody gets worried about the pipeline. I think you can't just give someone an envelope. You've got to come back to basics, and Marc very much shares that view. I think the third question was around product mix as it applies to the gross margin. Was that the question?</p>

          <p>I think the answer, of course, I mean the way you compute it is by difference, so this a &#x2013; so just I repeat and that the figure was that the overwhelming increase in the cost of sales to &#x2013; if I take this figure to cost of sales to sales, which is indicated by 2.4 percentage, is 0.9 for the exchange rate. It is 0.9 for CapEx, and it is 0.6 for the mix.</p>
          <p>And when you say the mix, in fact is a combination of two amounts, which is &#x2013; but which products and which geography. So as long as the sales in the U.S. are growing 5% and, as you know, we have a higher margin, by construction it increases the mix. And then of course one of the products are growing fast that will help us and increase the overall &#x2013; its overall contribution. So basically, you have -- you can easily see this impact was of course change is coming from U.S. Aventis I think this is where it comes from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on Dani's question on the cost of goods and the net benefit. Could you give a bit more guidance on how you see that evolving? Obviously Lantus certainly looks like it continued to have a positive impact, but you've then got Zentiva and the emerging markets coming in, so should we expect to see some of that benefit erode, or could that continue?</p>
          <p>And then on the R&amp;D, I just wanted to be clear. Is your guidance, your single-digit decline including the provisions, and on those provisions, have we had everything in the first quarter, or could there be more later in the year related to the determinations you speak about today? And could you maybe give us an idea of what proportion of the R&amp;D spend is in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And then, maybe just one final question on the swine flu, and just how you're positioned with your vaccines? How we should think about it in terms of capacity? Is there an option to combine the seasonal flu vaccine with something against swine flu? Just give an idea of how it could work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, just, I think on the margins, without getting into a lot of nitty-gritty here, I think we'll see &#x2013; but I would say margins will -- I think it's as Hanspeter said, will largely stay roughly stable. We've seen certainly an element of exchange rate here that has helped. I mean clearly the Copaxone benefits will flow forward. That's really an effective mix. The exchange rate well, that will depend on where dollar goes principally. And I think we've got growth in the U.S. and we have Zentiva coming in. Clearly Zentiva has lower margins than the U.S. business, but it's not such a big business compared to what the U.S. market is growing. So I don't think we particularly see any major variations in margin. As far as the costs of the R&amp;D stop...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is included. I mean, when we give &#x2013; gave this guidance of the low-digit or single, low single-digit decrease, it is everything included &#x2013; including the fact of the &#x2013; including the cost of termination of the projects which have been terminated, yes. Part of these costs will be <mark type="inaudible" />, but has been taken as a charge in the first quarter, just as the result of the decision to terminate them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of cost of research in U.S., I take the question as what is our sensitivity to the dollar, in terms of the change between dollars and euro. In fact, we are paying a lot of stuff in dollars and in fact, most of our clinical trials are paid in dollar. And so in fact the difference of the company when the dollar is increasing and saying in fact we're also increasing the cost of R&amp;D. So we have positive sensitivity to the dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On swine flu, we're obviously not only a leading vaccine manufacturer, but a leader in seasonal flu. What we see here is a virus that we haven't seen circulate before, so we have clearly a swine flu strain in there. You've got an avian flu strain and then you've got a human strain in there. And so, if an H1N1 vaccine has an H1N1 virus, but it's not the same as the H1N1 component, which is included in the seasonal flu.</p>
          <p>If we are called upon to make a swine flu vaccine, first of all, you have to understand that the manufacturing facilities are the same ones that are making the seasonal flu vaccine. We have two facilities. One is in Bourg-la-Reine in France, and the other one in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania. We are in the middle of campaigns for the northern hemisphere. We basically start in February and go through early summer.</p>
          <p>So then you have a couple of scenarios. It may be that someone says, can you add -- can you exchange the H1N1 component that's already in there for this swine flu variant that's around. There are a number of technical challenges around that, and it would particularly have an impact on both the capacity and the timing for such a flu vaccine. If you wanted a swine flu vaccine as quickly as you could and in the maximum quantities, then at the moment our technical folks believe that creating a monovalent H1N1 vaccine would be the best.</p>
          <p>However, if you go to the monovalent H1N1 vaccine, then you are going to be forced to making a choice between seasonal flu vaccine and the swine flu. That is obviously a very sensitive public health question that would be taken by WHO, the European, U.S., and Mexican healthcare authorities, and that I don't think anybody believes needs to be taken just yet. I can say we are working in very close collaboration with the WHO, with CDC, and the Mexican healthcare authorities.</p>
          <p>We have taken all of our stock that we had left over from last year's seasonal flu campaign and put it at the disposal of the Mexican government. It's not believed that being inoculated against seasonal flu provides you much cross protection for the swine flu, but we're in early days of this and nobody is absolutely certainly here. So to the extent that it's needed, that vaccine is available.</p>
          <p>But let's say, I think for this year, the big question is can you combine it with the existing flu. But, remember if you do that, you've got to produce three strains, which has a capacity implication and a timing implication, or do you do a monovalent, in which case you're going to have to choose, because you could end up having a situation where you've produced a swine flu vaccine, the epidemic has resolved itself, and then you have a lot of swine flu vaccine and no seasonal flu vaccine. You put a lot of people at risk there.</p>
          <p>However, there are also some people saying, well, you've got to watch out for the fall flu season. It may be that the current epidemic resolves itself, but then you get a rebound there. So all of the experts are really trying to sort that out. We've got daily conversations on this and we will certainly be prepared to respond at the direction of global healthcare authorities.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Eric Le Berrigaud from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions, three on R&amp;D, please. With the positive outcome on <mark type="inaudible" />, could you comment perhaps on what your thoughts are on this compound and also where you are on Phase III start and is it fair to say that you will go ahead to address this only to the U.S.?  And second on <mark type="inaudible" /> this one seems not to be under review. Could you confirm that, and do you think there is a need for a 10A injectable?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, in R&amp;D with the Lovenox spend, any thought about when we could expect some data? I knows it's probably very sensitive and any kind of a filing date for us? And then one on strategic animal health. Is it fair to say that Sanofi will either get 100% or sell its stake in Merial, or is there any other option, as particle or whatsoever?</p>
          <p>And the last few, financial, first on BiPar. In the press release, you mentioned that maximum spending would be $500 million, but what could be the minimum you're going to pay in any case? What is the thought with the spend in Q2 and will that go through the P&amp;L? And then on the guidance with Q1 being affected for the last time with Copaxone, how could you not beat the guidance now, significantly with a 10% Q1 performance? Are you waiting for anything specific before updating that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow, you're really getting a lot for your money. I said two more questions; I think there were six in there, but all right. Let me, let's, I'll take the Merial, the BiPar, and the guidance questions. Marc, do you want to take the <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think you speak about <mark type="inaudible" />. It is expected to be, I think, beginning of next year. In fact, the beginning of Q3. Decision to go ahead towards <mark type="inaudible" /> it's a little bit difficult because, in fact, we were aiming to compete with 50 we ended with the decision has not be fully taken. It will be a kind of <mark type="inaudible" />. Now will it be head-to-head comparison at this stage, I cannot say.</p>
          <p>In terms of photonics-savon, it is a good question, but will, may I excuse the question? What is the level do you think of improvement is necessary to replace GP2B3 plus eplivanserin?. So your question is fully valid, but we estimate, and we can discuss that, but we estimate that if we are decrease of the events of more than 40% with mix alone, which has the advantage to be a fully strategic compound with a half-life of 10 minutes, we will have a competitive profile and we should have the results of the study rather soon. The last to point on, I think it was the result of AVE5026 through the beginning of the next year; I think the first wave of results. I don't know if I have answered quite your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was the level of spend, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the level spend. Level of spend. I am sorry I have to check. I think S&#xE9;bastien will come back to you, because I cannot answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So. Then you asked about Merial. Clearly we have a partnership with Merck on the Merial joint venture. Merck has proposed to merge with Schering-Plough, which is Intervet. You know, clearly we are then involved, because whatever Merck wants to do with Merial  has an implication with us. Right now, Merck is still working through how it is looking at this. And we we'll be working with Merck. I mean, we could acquire their half. I mean there are various options here.</p>
          <p>We'll probably be able to give you an update, certainly at the latest by the next Q2. I would say if there is an opportunity to acquire it, we view the end will help sector as an attractive one and we would look at that. But well, we have to wait and see what our partner is doing first.</p>
          <p>BiPar, I think it was an interesting deal because what we will really wanted to do is, we took a set of milestones very much as we would do with a collaborative type agreement. But rather than having to share profit afterwards, we actually have acquired the company. So this structure is pretty much classic. There an upfront payments, which we'll have made now and, as the product achieves other certain milestones, then we would pay more. So if everything comes through and it's approved and there's other indications, then that what add up to $500 million. At the moment the amount of money is on the balance sheet, I think, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, if the product were to be failure then &#x2013; and we would have to deal with that. But it's substantially less than $500 million, and I think we could deal with that without any difficulty. On the guidance, look, hey, it's first quarter. The British have this saying, "Two swallows don't make a summer". We're off to a strong start. There is nothing in particular we said at least 7%, so it's put a floor under the guidance. It's not a ceiling. You guys are extremely talented in your forecasting ability. So I'm sure you have your own numbers.</p>
          <p>We'll probably give you our own view towards the middle of the year. We'll look and see how markets are shaping up and how currencies are looking. But I think saying we're off to a very strong start and don't particularly see anything on the horizon to offset that. But I don't think it's in anybody's interest after the first quarter to start messing around with guidance, quite honestly. I think that's something that we would do at the earliest with Q2 results.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you very much. Just two very quick questions.  Chris will be relieved. Who is on the portfolio management group in R&amp;D? And have you managed to bring forward any drugs in development if you feed up some resource?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah R&amp;D. Yes, is present also. So I think, everyone and I think, again, what is important is &#x2013; I think the most critical from my point view, but my colleagues and Chris can give some details, is that we have an agreement about the level of freight and specific item because it is the most, how to say that the most material aspect that you can have. And expect once you start to agree the level of risk in different area. I think you have a better view of the portfolio business. Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think it's also a view of &#x2013; the holistic view of a project that, do we really believe that this is going to make a difference to a patient? Do we think that there is a reasonable risk here of being able to achieve it? Do we have a balance of risk in the portfolio? To answer to your question, I mean the final review, you had Hanspeter Spek, you had J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, you had Marc Cluzel and you had myself. I mean, so we have actually reviewed all 65 projects personally. And so I think we've got the endorsement here of senior leadership of the company behind those.</p>
          <p>In terms of being able to accelerate, I mean, I think what this does do is that as Marc has done with the acquisition of BiPar. You know, this immediately frees up resource to think about doing more external development. So we would likely be looking to see what kind external opportunities there are. And we now have the budget and the resources to get a good start on that.</p>
