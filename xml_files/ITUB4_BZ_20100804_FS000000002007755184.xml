      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First, sorry for the delay. We had some technical problems in the previous teleconference in Portuguese we will have interrupt for almost 10 minutes. So that's the main factor that we started later this English conference call.</p>
          <p>For those who are following through the slides, start on slide number two. The highlights, net income is the first one. The recurrent net income for the quarter R$3.3 billion, means an increase of 4.1 from the first quarter and that means our ROE annualized about 24.4. In the first semester, if you would consider the first semester, the recurrent net income achieved at 6.5 billion and with a growth of 29.6 when we compare to the first semester of 2009.</p>
          <p>The second highlight is financial margin with clients and the credit expansion that we showed. The growth of the margin was 6.7. In total of R$10 billion in the second quarter especially, because of the credit expansion 4.4% in the period in this quarter and 11.4% when we compare to the first semester of 2009.</p>
          <p>If we consider only the retail credit growth, this number growth is 18.8. So, we showed a very good margin with the client in a very solid operation of the bank with declines that I think is the most important thing that what &#x2013; that is what gives us the sustainability for our results.</p>
          <p>The third highlight is banking fees and banking charges, a 4.4% growth when we compare to the first quarter, R$4.3 billion in the period. Mainly because of the credit card operation increase in terms of volumes, current account services, also shows growth. And investment banking also was a very active significant good quarter for our Ita&#xFA; BBA Investment Banking operations.</p>
          <p>The first highlight, the delinquency rate and the results from loan losses. 90 days delinquency rate reduced 30 basis points in this period and we finished with 4.6 in the quarter and we showed a reduction of 100 basis points during this year.</p>
          <p>We expect this number to remain relatively stable. We don't see much gains anymore in this delinquency ratio and showed some gains but the most part of the gains already are reflected in these numbers. This is because &#x2013; mainly because we have a different mix. we increased our portfolio mainly in &#x2013; with individuals and SMEs then it's a more risky business and we expected this delinquency ratio to remain around the same level that we have today.</p>
          <p>Also in the first semester, our provision for loan losses net of recovery of credit that is more active this year were 15.8% less than the &#x2013; when we compare to the same period of first to net of last year.</p>
          <p>We remain with the same level of additional provision of R$6.1 billion in this quarter when we compare to the other quarters run rate. Non-interest expense is the fifth highlight. We showed growth or grew &#x2013; we grew 4.4% in the quarter when we compare to the same in this semester sorry, when we compare to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>And if we exclude the expenses within Unibanco's branch migration, new points of sales</p>
          <p>that we are opening 35 branches and platforms with them as of need. Redecard and Porto Seguro expenses that we don't have direct control.</p>
          <p>We can see that when we compare to the first semester of 2009, a nominal reduction of 0.6%. So in the quarter, the numbers are not so good, especially because we hired 2,000 people in the period. We increased our marketing expenses especially because of the World Cup Soccer and that's the main reason of the growth of our expenses in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Going to slide number three. We had recurrent net income of R$3.298 billion in this period and we made provisions for contingencies related to economic plans that happened in the past year in Brazil of 133 million; that the reason that our non-recurrent was &#x2013; our net income was R$3.165 billion that's the number that we believe.</p>
          <p>On page four highlights from our numbers, 6.4 billion in the semester for net income, 3.2 almost 3.3 billion in the quarter. Managerial financial margin and banking fees 33 billion in the first semester of this year. We had growth of 5% in the year-on-year and a growth of almost 5% when we compare the quarters of fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Results from loan losses, due to the better environment that we have here in Brazil in terms of economic growth we showed important decrease in provisions. We have to reduce net of the recovery of the write-offs credit of a reduction in this year of 15.8% and there is more increase in the quarter of 1.5.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses, like I said, a growth of 12.6 in the quarter and when it compared to first semester of last year 4.4 that includes all the expenses of the Bank.</p>
          <p>On slide five. Net interest margin with client as I mentioned 10.1%. It was a very good quarter for the relationship with our clients especially related to credit and fees. Efficiency ratio was 46.7. It was accumulated in pro forma 47.3 in the quarter. We feel confident that we are going to reduce this number to a lower levels in the coming quarters as the synergies appears more and, of course, also with the growth of our business.</p>
          <p>Recurrent ROE, 24.4 in the first semester and at the same level for the second quarter of this year. On page six, assets, we finished with 651 billion, growth of 2.7 in the quarter; stockholders' equity, R$55 billion, a growth of 4%; loan portfolio, a growth of 4%; and funding, total funding with clients including AUM, R$716 billion, a growth of 2.1.</p>
          <p>On slide number seven, we can see better the P&amp;L. We'd like to highlight the financial margin with customers declined, as I mentioned, a growth of 6.7, showing a solid operation with our clients is very important. And a reduction in the margin with the market, the treasury gains proprietary and structural totaled R$891 million, with a decrease of 12.6. What is good shows that the growth in the margin came from the business, the recurrent business of the bank with the clients, especially related to the credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>Also we can see the results from our operation in insurance, stable when we compare it to the second quarter -- to the first quarter. Another point I would like to point here is the provision for loan losses, R$4,019 million in the quarter, a little bit above of the first quarter of 2010. And also recovery of credits written-off, we showed some increase in the period of R$967 million. So it was good numbers when we compare to the last year 2009. It helped us to increase our portfolio and increase the result.</p>
          <p>Retained claims also are better in this quarter, showing a better operation also for our insurance business. In terms of expenses, we are going to explain a little bit more in the coming slides. But I said in this quarter we had some extra expenses in the period, little bit above the expectations from most of the analysts and investors. So, the net income of R$3,165 million was number that we used. On slide eight, we see loan by type of clients. We continue to focus more on individuals and SMEs. We can see that individuals -- the total portfolio was, in terms of credit, R$296 billion, individuals R$107 billion.</p>
          <p>The growth in the quarter came more from credit cards and personal loans. Vehicles was a little bit lower than in the past because we are focusing more in new vehicles in this quarter after the fiscal incentives from the government was finished, as the sales of new vehicles was a little bit lower. But we already saw some recovery in the month of July. So, vehicles portfolio didn't increase much. In terms of companies, we saw a bit increase in our SME business, 6.7 in the quarter. We finished off at R$68 billion in the portfolio with a growth of 26.3% in 12 months.</p>
          <p>In line our strategy to grow and to invest in this segment, we continue to increase the number of managers and people related to this business. And most of the 2,000 employees that we hired in the quarter was to serve in this segment of business and we will continuing this trend in the coming quarters. When we saw the numbers for corporate company we see that the growth was much lower 3.3% in the quarter, and negative when we analyze the 12 months. We finished with R$92 billion. We have some -- still have some impact when we analyzed 12 months related to the evaluation of the real against the dollar.</p>
          <p>Companies &#x2013; corporate companies still are using more capital markets for that than for equity so it's more difficult to grow the portfolio here. If we see the last line of this table, we can see corporate total risks in this line we included the securities that we carried in terms of the ventures, commercial papers and other papers issued by companies that we have in our secured portfolio. We can see that considering these the number goes to R$104 billion. In total, credit in these securities and the growth in the period will be 4.6. In terms of mortgage, continues to very active. We finished the quarter with R$10.5 billion with a growth of 12% in the quarter and 47.7 in the 12 months. This continues to be very active it's growing but it's only 33% of our credit portfolio, but it's the one that is growing faster.</p>
          <p>On page nine, non-performing loans, we reached 4.6 reduction of 3.3% in the quarter, as I mentioned we don't expect much gains in this ratio in the coming quarters. But both individuals and companies showed better ratios 6.4 for individuals and 3.2 for companies for 90 days. Additional provisions, we remain for the fourth quarter in the same level that we had R$6.1 billion of additional provision. We don't intend even with this better environment, in terms of economic growth to reduce this level, this ratio will be reduced by the growth of the credit portfolio. It is not our intention to reverse this level of provisions in the coming quarters. So with all these the provisions and the additional provisions our coverage ratio for 90 days remained almost flat on an 87%.</p>
          <p>Going to page 10, we can see that we have 8.7% for provisions what is very comfortable especially considering the environment that is good in terms of growth of the economy. On page 11, total funding considering deposits and also the AUMs at R$716 billion with a growth of 2.1% in the quarter and 12% when we compare to the first semester of 2009, which give us very comfortable position in terms of funding to serve the growth of our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, we can see that our relation dollar ratio in terms of loan portfolio and funding achieved 98.9% that because of the new regulations related to a compulsory deposit issued by the Central Bank in the first semester of this year and we had to make a huge amount of deposit at the Central Bank to face the new regulation. But we don't see any kind of problems if we could fund our credit operations to serve the growth of our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, banking fees, we can see well I said the growth in terms of the asset management, current account services, and also in terms of credit cards and also in the line others. We can confirm the investment banking revenues that was more active this quarter, also helping our growth of 4.4% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of expenses on page 14, we can see that the total growth increased 12.6. This number were above the estimates of most of the analysts and investors. As I said we had some extra people and also extra marketing expenses in this period, that explains most of the growth which we reduced the expenses.</p>
          <p>We don't have direct controls like Redecard expenses, and Porto Seguro expenses as we consolidate in our balance sheet and also reducing the investment in new points of sales and also the branch migration expenses that we are doing from the Unibanco network with our network. The number of the growth would be 9.8 and but we &#x2013; when we compare to the first semester of 2009, we see a nominal reduction in terms of expense.</p>
          <p>We continue with our guidance growth of total growth of around 5% for the year, between 3 and 5% for the year and also when we don't consider the expenses and the expansion of the bank and the migration expenses as the growth should be in something between zero and 3%. The BIS ratio of 15.7 would keep us continue to grow our credit portfolio investments without problems.</p>
          <p>On page 16, the segmentation we have a quarter with recurrent net income of R$3.3 billion with the fourth traditional segment that we present to the pro forma numbers, marginal numbers, Commercial Bank, Ita&#xFA; BBA Consumer Credit and Corporation and Treasury.</p>
          <p>We have of this R$3.3 billion in net recurrent income 1.5 coming from the Commercial Bank. We allocated &#x2013; of the R$55 billion of our shareholders equity, we allocated 17.3 to this commercial operation. And this quarter the RAROC for this commercial banking was 36.5.</p>
          <p>Ita&#xFA; BBA in line at R$592 million in terms of recurrent net income, 12 billion in terms of allocation of capital and RAROC of almost 20%. Consumer Credit R$679 million in net recurrent income, capital allocated 7.7, and RAROC 35.3. And Corporation and Treasury 532, capital allocation 18.2 with RAROC of 11.8, especially because of lower gains from Treasury in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our market capitalization on slide 17, R$150 billion at the end of the quarter and we expected &#x2013; and our liquidity R$1.1 billion daily trading, especially in the New York Stock Exchange, and this number increased and probably will continue to increase a little because of the state of the Bank of America position, that means 8% of our preferred share that are now quoted in the market. So liquidity is increasing with our shares here in Bovespa and ADRs in New York.</p>
          <p>We will have a meeting here in Brazil with investors and analysts. It will be on the 17th of August, at 3 o'clock. For those who want to join us, you'd be very welcomed. For those who are here in Brazil, we'll be here in Brazil.</p>
          <p>With this we finish the presentation and we are open for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now being the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Alfredo, couple of questions related to expenses. You mentioned that about R$294 million in the first half relate to the migration of the Unibanco branches to Ita&#xFA; platform. I do recall that at the time the merger was first announced and implemented, you did create a provision to cover merger related expenses.</p>
          <p>So the question is why wasn't this captured by that provision even as these are expenses that could have been foreseen at the time of merger initial implementation? And second, related to that, is there any additional merger-related charges that are not covered by that one-time provision that are coming in the next few quarters that we should be aware of?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to this provision for contingencies economic plans with &#x2013; I'm glad that this is not just Ita&#xFA;, every single bank in Brazil does the same thing. They all call this non-recurring, but we've been seeing this every single quarter for the past, you know, god knows how many years, so it's time that we would consider this more recurring than non-recurring. But the question is when it's going to end? How much more do you think in terms of quarters of additional provision for economic plans in the neighborhood of R$100 million either pay per quarter, are we likely to see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, related to the branch migration, we are not able to include these expenses in the provision that we did made at a time of the merge is non-allowance -- so our auditors didn't allowed us to include this in the provision that we made at that time. I think the rules are not -- don't permit to include this expense.</p>
          <p>What I can say is that we are accelerating this migration since March. So when we compare the first quarter, second quarter, the numbers are much higher in this quarter because we are in a phase of 100 -- 150 branches third quarter must in terms of migration.</p>
          <p>It's not only a migration of systems. It's not only that. We are refreshing -- reforming all the branch. We're changing the equipment. We're changing the chairs and desks and layout is totally new, is the new standard for Ita&#xFA; Unibanco.</p>
          <p>Then also we are after finishing these 1,000 branches will -- of migration of Ita&#xFA; Unibanco we use cards and also the reforms in the former Ita&#xFA;'s branches also. And then of course we will be in a different pace, not so fast. That way we are going to do the same layout and the same things that we are doing now.</p>
          <p>So, for our numbers or so you are respected, you should consider in this second quarter and third quarter -- in third and fourth quarter almost the same level that we did that we have in the same in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I think it's very realistic to consider this level of expenses in the third and fourth quarter because our intention and that is going well in this direction is to finish the integration of the branches by the end of November. So we too have almost 500 branches to do in these four months ahead. So, the level of expenses will remain almost in this level.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The economic plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of economic plans, these provisions are more related to the color plan of 1990. We used to have one plan more of the color two, but it is very small. We don't expect much provision for debt. But the view is that the people can complaint if finished in 20 years.</p>
          <p>So, we are mostly in the end of this level of high provisions against these economic plans. So, probably in the coming quarters these numbers will be lower. We don't know how much lower, but we'll be -- we will see some reduction because of the time for this claims finish.</p>

          <p>Thank you Alfredo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody. Let me ask you two questions or so. On asset quality, if I understood you, you said, you did not expect any further improvements in non-performing loans in the second half of the year. If you can just give us more color as to why you don't seem to expect any more improvements. Talking to your peers it seems like they feel confident asset quality should continue to improve given the -- how strong the economy is in Brazil.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is related to your trading gains, I know it's a very difficult number to forecast, but you have been close to R$1.5 billion a quarter last year. This year, we are running closer to 1 billion. Do you still think 1 billion is a sustainable level or should we eventually see trading gains normalizing back to R$500 million at first quarter level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mario. Rog&#xE9;rio speaking. In terms of assets quality what Alfredo just said is that, most of the improvement in the credit quality is already taking in our ratio. This is because of the maturity of the interest. So we do think that we can have a further benefit of or not -- but it should be very small. So any slightly movement it's possible, but most of the benefits is already taking. So we're now running the bank at 4.6%, which is a 100 BPS lower than -- by the end of the year. And we should also highlight that the mix is changing a little bit, so we are increasing much more towards SMEs. So there is a -- actually a change in the risk mix in our portfolio. So we believe that it should be flat through the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding trading gains, you're right and we always said that it wouldn't be feasible to repeat the same results as last year, because the circumstances are quite different this year. But, we are posting 800, 900 it's -- we never give any forecast on the direction of this. But it should be -- not far from this maybe still little bit high than the sustainable level, but it should not be too far this -- from our.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, this is Alfredo, just to complement what Rogerio said about the delinquency, in our models we -- as long as the Central Bank is increasing the interest rates we should expect some reaction in terms of economic growth and delinquencies. So when we analyze our models and we put the forecast of the interest rate that probably will go a little bit more higher, We again, expect at least the delinquencies remain stable, increase a little bit. But it is not realistic to suppose that the Central Bank increased the interest rate and nothing happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some normal impact &#x2013; it balance. And our view always was right unemployment continuous to improve by disposable income rising. I do understand ranges of the higher interest rates should slow down the economy, but still talking on an economy that's growing 4.5% annual pace growth in the second half of the year. So that's why I was a bit surprised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mario we agree. So I mean as far unemployment is really one of the most important indicator for us. This is absolutely under control. So we don't expect any trouble in terms of delinquency. What we are just saying is that looking not at the macroeconomics, but looking at our portfolio, a movement up or down should be eventually noticed, but not big &#x2013; we included if you consider from 5.6 to 4.6, it represents more than 15%. So it should not be at the same level anymore. Most of the benefit is Redecard Porto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you have to remember also Mario that we have a mix with more components of credit related to SMEs and individuals when we compare with the numbers of 2008. The mix was different, the rate of car price was much bigger than today. So also is another factor that gives us the models that we are almost there in terms of reduction, and in terms of the delinquency ratio. We hope we are wrong, but we have second services.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the end of the day if you are right Mario, we will be very glad actually.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. John Prigoff from Equinox.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi just a follow-up question on the expense side. You mentioned that you added, I think 2,000 employees roughly in the quarter and I was wondering if you could talk about where &#x2013; what areas you are adding people in? And what your thoughts are in terms of head count going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you for the question. So, it's really attracting lots of attention. Our extension expenses this quarter. So let me spend a little bit more time on this. What we should observe is that from the &#x2013; when we compare the second quarter to the first quarter, first of all we should consider that first quarter is normally benefited by the seasonality. So it's normal than second quarter is bigger than the first quarter. It just happened differently last year, but it was abnormal. Normally second quarter is higher than first quarter.</p>
          <p>If you consider on page 14, if you consider that our total non-interest expenses by deflected by this Redecard Porto Seguro and new points of sales and branch is 600 million more than first quarter. I just want to draw your attention that around 200 million is due to the seasonality. We had another 8,200 million more in advertising, because of the words kept single event that is not going to repeat and the defense is indeed, what increased in our total expenses and this was mainly due to personnel expenses we added 2,000 people this quarter. So, this was included in our budget. The guidance on expenses I would consider this and efficiency of everything is aligns with the budgets. This and just to finalize you asked about the 2,000 people they are mainly driven to SMEs platforms that is increasing, you saw the figures is increasing 27% this year, is going to remain being one of the boosts of our growth. So we need people to serve those new clients.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. That's helpful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Boris Molina from Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just one follow-up question regarding the cost. In you first -- in the first quarter presentation, you showed expansion cost of a network R$247 million, but in your slide in this quarter, you're showing R$54 million. So I'd like to know what is the nature of the change and how could we think about these costs?</p>
          <p>And secondly, what is the number of points of sale that you have like work in progress that you're trying to add, and what is the rate of points of sale that are driving these costs and how much we would expect the points of sale to grow towards the end of the year in terms of your points of sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boris, your first question -- actually you are right, we changed a little bit criteria to show these figures. The current figure is 54 regarding the first quarter. I can explain further, but I need some details that I don't have on my hands right now. But the current figure is 54. Could you repeat the second part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you say 54 in the first quarter and 68 in the second quarter. So my question is, how many points of sale are you in plans of opening driving these costs and how many points of sale do you plan to add to in another year, so that we can have an idea of more or less how these line is going to -- performance is going to remain at this level on a foreseeable basis given your expansion plan on new branches for this year and next year, how could we think about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it should be more or less at the same set and we're planning to open up 150 new branch this year. We reaffirm the targets most of new branches are ongoing right now are going to be opened within the next month, if not all of them till the end of the year should be by the beginning of next year, but you should use around a 150 branch this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, wonderful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. A couple of questions I'm going to continue on the cost unfortunately for your guys, but can you talk about the viability of your guidance on expenses three to 5% on total in terms zero to 3%. I think excluding expansion cost and Porto Seguro and Redecard because if I look at these numbers, unless &#x2013; and forgive me if I'm missing something obvious, last year expenses actually declined in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter relative to what they were in the second quarter, I don't see how you get to those guidance metrics could &#x2013; so can you talk a little bit about why you are sticking to that guidance range on expenses?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you talk about why your effective tax rate was less than 24% in the quarter? I think in the past you guys have had a tax rate of 26 to 28 pretty consistently. What drove that lower tax rate? And what should we be expecting going forward? Should we expect that tax rate to trend back upwards in the coming quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, I think we reaffirm the guidance on expenses. This peak in terms of, spike in terms of expenses in the second quarter was already included in our budgets when we gave the guidance from three to 5% total cost increasing, it was already considering including this peak on work things and all the migration et cetera. So, that's what make us very strong to reaffirm that it should be by the end of the year within the three to five range, yes.</p>
          <p>And I don't know exactly the calculations you made but it's more or less we should keep stable during the second semester levels of expenses with some compensations of this taking the second quarter and this is already what we believe is actually what we believe is going to happen. We are quite confidential in this. Okay, so quite confident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but how viable is that, I mean, you are still growing, head count's increasing, you have a wage hike happening in September and commercial activity is very high in the fourth quarter. Your &#x2013; that in spite of all that the expense levels will remain roughly flat versus what they were in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's viable, because we have &#x2013; you are right, we have these expenses going up. But we have synergies being captured month-by-month. So when you add and that is going to be stable during the rest of the year more or less, but I hope that is viable is actually the synergy that we have captured. Can I go to the second portion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So effective tax rate. Yes, we had some movements from the first quarter to the second quarter, some small adjustments, but if you consider the first semester, you are going to find this level you were mentioning 26, 27% and looking forward this is the level that you should consider in your models is &#x2013; and you know in summary, we are talking here on the total 34% income tax depicted by the benefits of interest on net equity. What this drives today 26, 27, that is our normal level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why was it so low in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, second, when we consider first and second quarter, we &#x2013; it appears in which we filed the income tax, all the papers. So, we have some small adjustments ups and downs, but is &#x2013; 26 is the correct figure for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Telles from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Most of my questions have been answered, but &#x2013; just two others. The first one, can you &#x2013; you mentioned that you do not expect much improvement in your income ratio going forward, and one of the explanations is the &#x2013; base of the SME portfolio.</p>
          <p>I was wondering if you could quantify what your delinquency rate on the SME portfolio is right now and just to have an idea compared to the whole commercial portfolio that you have today. And also on the branch expansion side and we saw that, I mean, in the first half of the year, actually your number of branches have actually declined by five branches if I'm not mistaken. So that means that all the branch expansions would be concentrated in the second half.</p>
          <p>We see some of your competitors kind of like reducing their growth expectations in terms of branches. There seems to be some difficulties in the process. I know you reiterated that, but in your case, you are not facing all the same issues that some of your competitors are and what is the reason for that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't give any specific information on delinquency in the credit portfolio. But what I can anticipate to you Marcelo is that, we &#x2013; the NPL ratio for SMEs is higher than the average. So, every time we have an increase higher than the average of the portfolio we have marginally an increase in this ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A number of branch, if I am not making a mistake, we have one branch less than in the previous quarter, however, it does not mean anything in terms of the total branch we are going to reach by the end of the year. We reaffirm that we should be opening around 150 branch during this year. Most of them, if not all of them rents ongoing and it should be open at till the end of the year, if not by December, or January, or February. So it's 150 branch within the next months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One last question if I may. I mean, we saw an improvement in credit recoveries in the quarter, given that, you have probably a bigger level of charge-offs, given the increased delinquency you had in the past year or so. Would you expect that line to continue to increase in the coming quarters, or you think there will be no more or loss, it will be a stable level going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this higher level recovery is due to &#x2013; of course due to the higher level of charge-offs and interest from last year. But we also made some additional efforts on this direction. Since we have more assets to recover, of course, we had more attention on this. We are very close to, if not have reached yet, we are very close to what we believe is going to be flat for the next month. So you should not consider any further increase on this figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. My question is on loan growth. Ita&#xFA; Unibanco's quarter-on-quarter reported loan growth has trailed the bank's two largest private sector peers. However, these peers have each purchased between 3 and R$5 billion in loans in the second quarter alone. Excluding the purchases by your peers does those loan growths looks better ahead of one and in line with the other. Do you at Ita&#xFA;, view loan purchases in the current environment as an attractive use of capital? And should we expect to see loan purchases by Ita&#xFA; in the future?</p>
          <p>And just as a follow-up, our Ita&#xFA; loan growth expectations, I believe it's 18 to 23% ex-large corporates for only organic growth or do they include purchases or acquisitions, loan acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, we are more concentrated in terms of organic growth. We are not considering any acquisition of portfolios. And by -- although we will see some reduction in the portfolio that we already bought in the past. So our growth will come from organic, our own efforts in terms of growing with our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given excess capital, is this &#x2013; could this be an interesting use of funds for Ita&#xFA;? Or it's not attractive in the current environment, is what you're saying if you are indirectly implicitly, I guess you are saying that because you're letting the portfolio run off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our BIS ratio is comfortable, and we think this level is good. Of course, if you rebuy a portfolio it should be better than carrying on our securities in treasury. You are right to this point. But it's not our intention to use this capital to buy a portfolio. And we are not seeing much opportunities in terms of buying these portfolios, maybe we should have some in terms of the low business and things like that. But anyway we are not considering, we are not returning anything. We will continuing our trend of growing organically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And my second question is related to Ita&#xFA;'s insurance operations. Can you give us an update on the outlook for the life and pension businesses for the second half of this year? Maybe some comments on the competitive environment, are we seeing any -- is there pressure on pricing or actually with higher rates there's less, prices are actually improving for the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason so, if you look at insurance and pension plans are in capitalization. We've reached 356 million during the second quarter, what is around 7% higher than the first quarter. And return &#x2013; the way we calculate the return on allocated capital actually also raised from 38 to 35, also Porto Seguro is going very well.</p>
          <p>The association and increasing so where I could &#x2013; I don't have more specific data with me regarding the future of this insurance business. But what we see is a very firm trends, positive trends so we have now very solid position in terms of technical provisions and the return are quite adequate to the level of capital we are &#x2013; we have there. If you want we can go further and discuss specifically insurance we can organize a sort of a column based issuance. I don't have specific data with me here right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your time to being with us. I think we showed good results. I think the quality of the results of this quarter is better in our view from the quarter before because we had more gains and more revenues from client business and not from treasury. We continue in a good trend in terms of growth of our credit portfolio. So we are very confident that we're going to achieve the guidance that we provide in terms of credit, in terms of expenses for the year.</p>
          <p>And of course, this will depend in the pace of the Brazilian economy that we also are confident the growth will continue for many quarters ahead. So the environment for the bank business will continue to be good.</p>
          <p>Thank you again, sorry for the delay at the beginning and hope to be with you in the next teleconference &#x2013; in the next conference call for the third quarter. Thank you.</p>
