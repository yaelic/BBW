      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody. And a particular welcome to those that have trekked all the way up to rural Norwest. And welcome our home. And for those that are joining us online, thank you for joining us.</p>
          <p>I might say that we had a little trouble with a couple of calls with &#x2013; during question time for those that are online. And it really was those that were using headsets or using mobile phones, we really had a little trouble breaking up. Those that used landlines, we had no trouble at all. So in thinking about how you might make your question for those online, just consider if you've got a landline that you can use it would make the experience and our ability to understand your question a lot easier.</p>
          <p>Okay. The financial year 2011, so again, particularly in the second half, we had macroeconomic conditions, particularly around consumer sentiment that were very challenging, and Mother Nature also put a few challenges in their way in both Australia and New Zealand. But despite that, we managed to have a very positive overall result of plus 5.1% in net profit after tax, or 6.5% when you exclude those direct noninsured costs that we've identified in relation to the natural disasters in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>With a year in which we were able to identify that we increased market share in just about all of our businesses, and where we couldn't measure the entire business, particularly in segments where we did have measurement, and we continued in of all our businesses to invest significantly in reducing prices for customers. And of course, that was assisted somewhat, particularly with imported products, with the strong Australian dollar that generally brought retail prices down. We also continued to focus on making sure that we were listening to our customers, so range, formats, the all-important prices and, of course, multi-channel has been a very important part of our growth in the past year and will be an exceedingly important part of our growth going forward.</p>
          <p>We, once again, finished the year with a very strong balance sheet, higher cash flows. And during the year, we're able to give our shareholders back $700 million through a buyback. And Tom will take us through some of the more finer details of that a little bit later. And we were able to continue to finance growth. So we certainly put a greater level of effort into our existing businesses with 180 gross new stores and 233 refurbs across our group. But more importantly, we also prepared for the opening of our new business in Home Improvement.</p>
          <p>And I think when you look over the last 10 years, what has been very obvious has been our ability in both the high and the low times to continue to deliver both the superior value to our customers, but also positive profit and returns to our shareholders through all the economic cycles.</p>
          <p>To the actual numbers. Most of you have had the chance to read through these, having an earlier looks. The sales, of course, up 4.7, EBITDA, up 6.6, EBIT up 6.3 and NPAT, as I mentioned before, up 5.1 and EPS up 6.5 and the dividends with the &#x2013; pardon me, the dividend being confirmed this morning by the board, up 6.1 per share. Our ROFE was slightly down, however. Tom will point out that we've invested significantly in property, particularly in the Home Improvement area over the last year. And, of course, Cellarmasters we bought in May, and didn't have the benefit of the full 12 months of trade in that business.</p>
          <p>So over to the highlights. Price leadership has been the hallmark of Woolworths and it continues to be, whether it's that petrol pricing promise that says we're going to match the lowest in the market area and we're going to give you $0.04. Or whether that Dan Murphy promise that says you're not going to find it cheaper anywhere else, or Dick Smith doing deals or the Dare to Compare wall or the trolley as you come through the front door of BIG W pointing out our price advantage over others.</p>
          <p>Once again in our supermarkets, we continue the tradition of price leadership. We've had the biggest selling value brand in the market, and it's been with us since 1983, and Homebrand continues to grow. In January 2010, we led the market. We led the market by dropping 5,000 prices. It was followed some months later by others, and in February, we went back with our further confirmation to our customers that we're going to be committing to our promise to make sure that they have the value basket of the &#x2013; with price knockdown.</p>
          <p>In fresh food we outgrew, by the market data we've just received in the last week, all other competitors for the year and for the quarter. And there is no doubt that our focus on the fresh food has been unyielding. So whether it's the fixed price guarantee on those key commodity items that we've held are first in the marketplace, our fresh food guarantee that if you're not comfortable with what you bought bring it back, we'll give your money back or the great Macro Wholefood Market range.</p>
          <p>More importantly, I think with the 2015 new format in supermarkets, what we've seen is the marked fresh food participation in those stores over and above our &#x2013; the rest of our fleet. So we're very, very happy with fresh food.</p>
          <p>Talking about new formats, we'll have over half either in the 2015 or the 2010, and we've got another 21 stores coming up in the 2015 format during the year. And both our sales results, particularly in Fresh but also the focus groups that we've held around 2015, have been overwhelmingly positive from our customers.</p>
          <p>Multi-channel has been a tremendous area of growth for us; sales up 63%. We launched Dan Murphy online during the year and it's worked particularly well. New BIG W opened just before the start of the financial year and it's continued to grow. Dick Smith is growing week-on-week, particularly with 'click and collect', and some of the   &#x2013; their Daily Deals, et cetera. And we believe that this now has been one of the, if not the most, visited site for electronics in the Australasian marketplace. And last week we had a record sales for Dick Smith online. I think more importantly, in terms of food, we now cover 85% of the Australian population with plans to take that number higher. And New Zealand online business also is growing in line with the Australian business. Pardon me.</p>
          <p>This is not to do with last year, but this is a very exciting thing that if you haven't seen in the media or haven't participated in, I &#x2013; if you've got an iPhone or an iPad, I suggest you do. This has become the number one app with a bullet, and we've had 400,000 people download this app already in the first couple of days. And we're seeing people walking around the store doing their shopping using this app. So if you haven't had a look at it, I suggest you do. It's pretty exciting.</p>
          <p>Excuse me. I'm just battling a man cold at the moment. I call it flu, but the ladies on the team call it man cold.</p>
          <p>Our Liquor business approached nearly $6 billion. And what's been really important in our Liquor business was an outstanding market share growth well ahead of any other competitor and well ahead of the marketplace in the last year. The photograph that you have there is our newest format store in Victoria and it's doing really well. Private label, big part of our Dan Murphy and Liquor business overall, and there were an additional 70 new lines for the year introduced.</p>
          <p>One of the exciting things, of course, has been our vertical and horizontal integration into new channels and new production capabilities with the acquisition of Cellarmasters. And to date, Greg and his team have delivered over and above our expectations in both revenue and EBIT. So we're thinking that there are many, many opportunities going forward, and perhaps a little later in the year Greg, through Grant, will be able to share some of our plans going forward.</p>
          <p>Countdown, largest and most trusted super brand &#x2013; supermarket brand in New Zealand, that's largest brand by sales now in New Zealand. And last night, it actually was also given the gong for the best marketing by a company in New Zealand the past year, which was fantastic; market share growth on all the metrics. We've got 88% of the fleet now trading as Countdown, but we've still got lots of upside because 62% of the fleet are actually new, either 2010 or 2015 format. So they get to be refurbished across.</p>
          <p>Could I say here, both in regard to New Zealand and also to our Australian teams in the case of both of the &#x2013; or the number of natural disasters, what a wonderful and self-sacrificing efforts that we saw across our business where people put their own personal needs aside to come in to make sure that we looked after our customers in both countries. And it was a very humbling event to watch the efforts that they put in over that time.</p>
          <p>BIG W, still the real leader in price. So whether it's our dare to compare, or you prove to yourself by having a look at the prices that we have &#x2013; this is our competition. We continue to have price leadership. We're continuing to invest in new stores and refurbs and quality branded products such as the Mambo and the new innovative brands like Morrissey. And our business with the optical is also growing quite strongly. So we're very excited about the future here. We just need the Aussie dollar and deflation to move in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Dick Smith, a tale of two cities. We're very comfortable that, particularly the new format stores are doing well in sales. We've done a really good job in the past year in a highly deflationary area in reducing our cost of doing business, so well done to Deborah and the team. We still have got quite a way to go to get the right gross margin, which has been challenging globally in that. So we will continue to focus on making sure that we have a profitable business there.</p>
          <p>In laptops and table top computers and also tablet computers, we've had tremendous growth over last year and particularly with the additional tables that were put into Dick Smith. That particular category has had very, very strong growth.</p>
          <p>Our customer engagement program continues to go from strength-to-strength. We've got 8.4 million members across Australia and New Zealand. A really great innovation in the last quarter was the ability for people to convert their points, their Qantas Frequent Flyer points, to gift cards on a regional basis. So for those that are either not interested in flights or have other means of getting flights, this is a wonderful alternative for them, and we already have some significant shift across for people that wish to do exactly that.</p>
          <p>Our credit cards and debit cards continue to perform well. So the Qantas card that was launched last November took the lion's share of new credit cards that were adopted by Australians in the time since it was launched. The debit cards have been way above our expectations, and we just see more and more growth in this particular area in financial services.</p>
          <p>Home improvement. Our first store is scheduled to open in Melbourne in the next little while. And those that have had the opportunity internally to visit the store have seen what we said in saying that this is going to be a different offer to perhaps what they might have seen elsewhere. And we see this as a wonderful opportunity.</p>
          <p>What we have taken the opportunity to do today is to &#x2013; just to look at the market. This is a new business that we're starting up, and it has costs of starting up. So it's got new distribution centers. It's got a new central team. It's got pre-opening costs. It's got training costs. It's got stock that we've got to put in. It's got launch marketing. And most stores take two to three years to mature in profitability. So we will be taking to the bottom line up to $100 million next year, or this year that we're in, for startup costs.</p>
          <p>The alternative, of course, is buying a business where you put a good goal in the balance sheet and you don't have the opportunity to actually put that against your profit. And, of course, the $100 million, up to a $100 million, will be available to put against profits in a future date. So it's not all doom and gloom.</p>
          <p>I think the important thing to note is that we've been through this before. We opened one BIG W store back in, I think, 1976 when there were a hundred and something Kmarts and Targets or whatever, and people said we were crazy. We bought a little business to be the first of our non-supermarket Liquor businesses in Dan Murphy, and now we've got market leadership. We opened our first petrol station, and people said you're crazy taking on the big guys, but we now have market leadership in petrol.</p>
          <p>So we've been through it, we're comfortable that we know what we have to do. We know what it's going to cost because we've had experience in the past in building businesses. But it's really important &#x2013; when we looked at the financial community and looked at their forward estimates, there were only a couple that actually had any dollars against it.</p>
          <p>So it's really important for us to that we keep transparency with the marketplace to let people know that starting new businesses cost money, and we're willing to invest this. The alternative, if it was available, was to buy one. And you'd spend a lot more on goodwill than that to actually buy a new business. This is a fantastic opportunity for us and, of course, that hundred will very much depend on the speed at which we roll these out. Now we estimate that we'll be at breakeven around about three &#x2013; three to four years, but once again that will depend on how fast we go.</p>
          <p>We will most likely have up to 19 stores opened in the first 18 months, 12 months to 18 months, so we're going to go pretty hard. So we're going open in Victoria. We've got a number in Queensland, and we'll be back to Victoria, et cetera. But we're very confident this is a great growth opportunity for the future for us.</p>
          <p>In supply chain innovation, we continue to invest in our supply chain, whether it's the Hoppers Crossing DC for Home Improvement or the Hawkstone Park campus for BIG W, Dick Smith and Home Improvement or the new National Distribution Centre that we opened in New Zealand. The refurb and refit of our two national DCs and automated DCs in Melbourne and Sydney that have been completed that give us improved efficiency in cost, the Next Generation of replenishment, which is the replacement in the longer term for AutostockR and Stocksmart, or the meat plant. We will continue to invest in delivering greater efficiencies for our business going forward.</p>
          <p>We made a promise to ourselves and the market sometime back that we would put ourselves at the front of all global retailers by having a 40% reduction in our carbon footprint on a like-for-like basis by 2015, and we will achieve that. Our present trend rate says that we will achieve it. So initiatives last year, some 37; one of them was a New Green store in Inverell that just completed the first year of trade for BIG W and it had, for a similar store in the same climate, a 30% plus reduction in energy consumption. We predict $120 million worth of savings that will come from these initiatives and nearly a billion tons worth of carbon equivalents will be taken out of the atmosphere as a result of our activities.</p>
          <p>In corporate responsibility, we continue to show leadership there through our Ethical and Palm Oil Sourcing Policies and our Sustainable Seafood Policy. We continue to invest in the community, where it's appropriate. We launched our Reconciliation Action Plan in the past year. For instance, we've doubled the number of our indigenous teammates in real sustainable jobs. And once again we had another great outcome in terms of our safety, and I think we now, in terms of our metrics, are at the leading edge of similar businesses globally.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to agriculture, so we are proud partners of Australian and New Zealand farmers. In Australia, we have 100% of our fresh of meat sourced from Australia and 97% of our fresh produce. And since 2007 we had a lot of the young farmers that have joined us here for a program that we've initiated. And in addition to that, on their farms, not their particular farms, but on many farms across the country, we've invested in Landcare initiatives to the tune of nearly $7 million. And we continue to sponsor things like the Royal Agricultural Show that are very important to the agricultural sector.</p>
          <p>So to some of the numbers and the longer term trends. Our profit after tax 5.1, or 6.4 after excluding the natural disaster costs. EBIT up 6.3, you can see it was slightly higher than that excluding the natural disaster costs. Once again a strong performance by the Australian Food and Liquor group. CODB, no deflate other than petrol where we had deflation across our businesses to maintain an under 20% CODB. I think it was a terrific effort by our people considering that we had things like the electricity going up double-digit in terms of cost per megawatt, and we had obviously a 3% plus underlying inflationary labor cost each week. This was a great outcome.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit, due to all the things that we've talked about in the past around direct store reduction, global sourcing, shrinkage, et cetera, private label, has seen a slight tick up in our gross margin and we've been able to do that across our business as well as still investing substantially in reduced prices. Our dividends per share, after the affirmation of the $0.65 dividend this morning for 2011, means that we've got $1.22 for our shareholders for the full year, up 6%.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to hand it over to Grant who will take us through some of the individual businesses and make some comments about those. Thanks, Grant.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>As Michael said, I'm going to just make some comments on each of the businesses individually with supermarkets being the first Australian supermarkets. It was a solid year with sales growth in the order of 4% with an improving comp sales position in the second half. And this was despite deflationary pressures in the order of about 3.6 for the second half. So we had good comp sales, improving comp sales, but also the deflation that we'd seen earlier in the year was still present in the second half and despite that, good top line growth.</p>
          <p>The deflation means that you've got to get more customers into your store and sell more units in order to make positive territory in relation to sales. And I'm pleased to say in relation to the supermarkets, that's what happened. Significant growth in customers and units that we moved through the business, resulting in EBIT growth for the food, liquor and petrol business just a little shy of 8% growth, which is a strong result.</p>
          <p>The hero in relation to this top line was fresh foods. Double digit growth in deli, in produce and in in-store bakery, and very strong numbers also in our meat division, as well. So really all the members of the fresh food club within our stores had a very good year, very positive year in terms of top-line sales growth. That resulted, as Mike has touched on already, in pleasing market share improvements in the Fresh areas, but also Liquor and also our Packaged Goods.</p>
          <p>Price was a battleground during the course of the year, and Mike pointed to the knockdown glove. And the knockdown glove is the signal to our customers that we've got a contract with them, and that contract says that you'll get the best value in the marketplace when you shop with Woolworths, and we've maintained that during the year with the investment that we've made in pricing.</p>
          <p>Multi-channel and online is an increasingly important part of our business, and our online Food business grew by 78% last year. So a strong result, and we see strong growth in that area going forward.</p>
          <p>Space growth also remained in place for us. 21 new stores for the year was a good result by the property team in a depressed development market, with 21 stores and another good bunch of stores lined up for the year ahead. So space growth remained important for our ambitions, both this year and going forward for the Australian supermarket division.</p>
          <p>The return on funds employed is something that we watch carefully in all of our divisions, but we're pretty proud of the one in supermarkets. And whilst it dipped slightly to be around 75%, if you back out the Cellarmasters acquisition at the end of the year, as Mike said, and also you back out the additional stock through goods that we're bringing in from our global sourcing office in China, we're in excess of 80% for our ROFE.</p>
          <p>So a very strong business, historically strong business that continues to deliver with 80% return on the funds employed towards that business. So momentum is in the supermarket business that remains and we're confident about how we'll move forward.</p>
          <p>Private Label was the other one I wanted to mention. In Private Label we added another 600 products this year to the Private Label stable. The one that's growing fastest is our Macro brand, which is our good for you brand. Great customer acceptance for that brand, and that's encouraging us to invest further in that item or that range within our stores.</p>
          <p>Liquor. My description of Liquor is an outstanding year. And it's outstanding on all the measures we find important. It grew market share. And Dan Murphy's, as Mike alluded to early, was the hero of the Liquor area. But all major categories performed well in our Liquor business. So major categories for us are beer, wine and spirits. All of them were in positive territory despite consumption coming off over the course of the year. So consumption was a headwind, but we delivered positive sales results in the Liquor business.</p>
          <p>Spirits was the standout. Our Spirits business grew by circa 12% over the course of the year. All in positive territory, courtesy of that was the market share growth that both Mike and I have alluded to.</p>
          <p>Key drivers. Again, I'd point to space first of all. We rolled out 19 Dan Murphy's stores and 26 BWS stores to add to the fleet of Liquor businesses that we have around the country. But also important for us was our private label investment. We have a share, as you know, in the Gage Roads Brewery in WA, and that was courtesy of that investment that we launched four &#x2013; three of our new brands this year, three new beer brands and also a cider brand.</p>
          <p>The Cider category is on fire. It's the most significant growth in the liquor area at the moment. And we bought out our private label, I think importantly, at the beginning of the cycle. And we're getting good growth from that moving forward.</p>
          <p>But it's the investment that we've made in both Cellarmasters, and it's the investment that we've made in Dan Murphy's online, which came online this year, that provides a pointer to some of the growth for next year.</p>
          <p>The integration of the Cellarmasters business is ahead of schedule. The synergies that we're driving into that business are also ahead of target. So good news indeed from the investment that we were pretty confident about, but good to be on this side of it and see the real value that we predicted in that business.</p>
          <p>Petrol, very pleasing result, despite the fact that volumes were flat. I'd like to point to the customer count increase of almost 4% for this business. We make a price promise to our customers in respect to Petrol, and they support that promise with their custom. 4% more customers this year. Flat market, but good growth from a dollar sales and a profitability point of view.</p>
          <p>James and his team had particular focus this year on the shop on the <mark type="ph" /> four court (26:48), what we call the merchandise area of this business. And 10.7% growth was the reward for James and his team for the efforts that they put in to a pretty aggressive expansion of the offer in our four court stores for our Petrol business.</p>
          <p>New Zealand supermarkets survived everything that Mother Nature threw at them and more. A really good year for the New Zealand team. Dave's here with us today, and we're in awe of what he and his team have done in battling those particular challenges and delivering a great result.</p>
          <p>Michael said something in his speech and I want to repeat it because it's something we're pretty proud of. And that is that Countdown is the largest brand by turnover in New Zealand now. That's a long way from where it was when we acquired this business some years ago and is testament to the quality of the team that Dave leads in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>We've got strong growth in key categories of perishables, it was up 6.5%. Produce up 6%, liquor up almost 8% in the New Zealand market, were really good figures courtesy of the aggressive approach that Dave and his team took into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Online has been established in the New Zealand market for some time, but it continued to grow and grew by some 24%. Online in New Zealand is, I think, about 1.7% in that order of our sales and growing. And indeed we're picking up in the final stages of taking the New Zealand platform and putting it into our business here in Australia, only month or two away from launching our new platform for our Food business here in Australia, courtesy of the New Zealand team.</p>
          <p>Profit was, as shown, 5.1%, but if you back out the natural disaster costs, the EBIT growth was in the order of 9.5%, so a fantastic result from &#x2013; in terms of profit. We're also trading here at the moment with one hand behind our back, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but we've still got three stores closed in the Christchurch area; two of them are expected to be long-term, one of them hopefully back online in September though. Yep.</p>
          <p>So three stores have been closed since the second of the earthquakes that we had in New Zealand, but as you can see on the chart a strengthening position in the second half and that's continued into this trading year.</p>
          <p>BIG W is a business that we're pretty proud of, very solid business that has got a fantastic position in terms of price and value and a business that we are confident about building going forward.</p>
          <p>It's had its challenges this year in relation to a number of its categories, particularly Home Entertainment and Apparel, suffering deflation &#x2013; deflationary pressures. But really pleasing to see that in the second half, sales grew by a positive 2% and our profit in the second half grew over 5.5%, so good momentum in the second half. And when you look at the deflation, which across categories ranged from 6% to 9%, to get a positive sales result is a testament again to the team. More customers, a lot more units have to be put through our registers in order to get the sort of sales increase that we're talking about here.</p>
          <p>Margin also was healthy, and a lot of that is being driven by increasing our reliance on global sourcing. We're getting more product out of China and Bangladesh and other sorts of areas supporting our apparel range improvements and the like. So that's been important, and that's important for mix.</p>
          <p>But still with a large focus on brands. I think brands constitute about 70%, still, of our sales in BIG W, but we're doing that cleverly with the private label that we're investing in.</p>
          <p>Costs were well controlled despite the fact we were put through a lot more customers and that we put through a lot more units. We didn't get the top line reward for it because of deflation. So I think Julie and her team have contained costs there pretty well given the volume that's moved through the stores.</p>
          <p>Inventory is something we look at, obviously, very carefully in the BIG W business. The inventory at the end of this financial year was less than the inventory at the end of the previous financial year despite the fact that we added enough for our new stores. So with less inventory we're trading for more stores. So a good position to be in both in terms of sell through of the seasonal stock and management of closing stock by Julie and her team.</p>
          <p>Consumer Electronics, positive story in as much as the new format stores are trading really well. And if we look at those in isolation, as you can see on the chart, some 7% increase in sales on the previous year courtesy of the new format stores. We're not where we want that &#x2013; it's not where we want it to be yet because it's not driving the profitability yet that we want out of this business. So there's still much work to do here. But a couple of other things are appointed to the future for this business, and one is the increasing penetration of online. This is probably one of our most true multi-channel businesses that we have at this point in time. Our growth on online for Dick Smith grew about 76% last year, and interestingly, 25% of those purchases were 'click and collect'. In other words, they were purchased online and collected in the store.</p>
          <p>So it's a highly featured Web site. It's a much visited Web site, to Mike's earlier comment, and it's trading pretty well at the moment. Particular categories that are trading strongly are around the notebooks, computer area and also around the connectivity &#x2013; what we call the connectivity area in the Dick Smith business.</p>
          <p>In respect to the New Zealand version of Dick Smith, it's a small business. It's suffered from the natural disasters. It's also suffering from deflation in many of its categories. The deflationary figure that we are quoting in relation to Dick Smith generally is 14% across its category, so there's significant deflation in that business.</p>
          <p>We've got three stores still closed, just to update you on the Consumer Electronic business in New Zealand. Three stores still closed around the Christchurch area for Dick Smith. So hoping to get those back online in the near future, but I think a couple of them are in the same boat as the Countdown stores that I alluded to earlier.</p>
          <p>Our little business in Croma is &#x2013; in India rather, the Croma business, has been ticking away quietly in the background. Its profitability this year is pleasing around $4.3 million &#x2013; $4.8 million; I beg your pardon, as opposed to $1.3 million the previous year. So it's got 62 stores, more stores being added on a regular basis, and through both the Hong Kong buying office and the skills of the buying team that we've got in India delivering more margins to that business and creating a greater wholesale margin for us, which is the area of the business that we operate in and that's where the increased bottom line is coming from.</p>
          <p>Hotels is the last one I want to comment on. And the heading says resilient performance by the Hotel group. That's the best description I can come up with. It's a very solid result for Hotels, gaining 3.1% in a pretty challenging consumer environment, and profit up 4% to $184 million, so strong results.</p>
          <p>The standout category was Food. Food is really important to this business, as we've said before, because the sorts of hotels that we promote are family hotels where there's affordable entertainment, affordable meals. And to see the Meals category or the Food category jump to the extent that it has and the growth momentum that it has is particularly pleasing for us because it endorses the strategy we have for Hotels and the sorts of clients that we want to attract to those.</p>
          <p>Two more hotels carefully selected and added to the portfolio this year. The Dog &amp; Parrot being one of them and the Robina in Queensland, just near the Robina Shopping Center, great hotel for us. Opportunity for a Danks to go on site, so good growth there, 282 hotels now in total.</p>
          <p>So that's just a little bit of information on each of the trading divisions that I wanted to share with you. Tom's now going to go through the financials for you. Thanks, Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Grant, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll just take you through some of the elements of the cash flow and the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In relation to cash flow, we had a pretty good cash flow for the year. We had generated $2.9 billion in cash, which was up 8.7%. So that gave us a pretty good platform to do a fair amount of investment in our business.</p>
          <p>So I'll just flip over to the next slide. I've just analyze the cash flow slightly differently. So you can see the cash of our after normal CapEx and dividends is about $600 million, which was up nicely from last year at 31%. So then we bought some businesses about $400-odd million. The largest in there of course is Cellarmasters at $340-odd million and the rest was sort of miscellaneous, hotels, home improvement businesses, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We spent about $600 million net on continuing to develop our property pipeline. In a market where the development sector is still particularly weak, it's really important Woolworths continue to underpin its new store growth pipelines. So this isn't not &#x2013; necessarily next year's stores, it's years in &#x2013; stores in years three, four and five, but we were very encouraged by a pretty successful sales program during the year.</p>
          <p>We also undertook a share buyback of just under $740 million. We funded that with primarily increasing borrowings, which I'll touch on in a moment. And after all that activity, our fixed charge cover remained at three and our interest service cover was 12.5. So it was a &#x2013; we really maintained a strong balance sheet. We had some excess capacity there and we've returned money to shareholders, but we've continued to invest in the growth of Woolworths' business.</p>
          <p>On average inventory days, we're up slightly at 33.8. A lot of that's been impacted &#x2013; that little kick-up in average inventory days by increased indent, Cellarmasters and the investment in the Home Improvement inventory. If you take those one-offs out, or those impacts out, we were down about half a day from the normal retail businesses.</p>
          <p>In terms of our balance sheet, inventory gearing kicked up a bit to some of those reasons we just talked about in terms of indent and home improvement, et cetera and in particular, Cellarmasters, which came in at the end of the year. Receivables also ticked up a bit because of Cellarmasters and some of the businesses we've bought under the Danks business, which had receivables as part of their business structure.</p>
          <p>Fixed assets were up, primarily property, plant and equipment, purchases, development, net of disposals. Intangibles were up primarily due to Cellarmasters and borrowings are up because of the CapEx and property program that we're undertaking.</p>
          <p>In terms of shareholder payouts, a great history there, 10 years and $10.3 billion returned to shareholders. So it's a very strong effort over those 10 years.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management, we had quite a bit of activity in relation to capital management. We've owed &#x2013; in the 2010 year, returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders, excluding dividends of course. We raised just over $2 billion in the U.S. 144A market, and we raised $500 million in the Australian debt market. All those debt raisings were heavily over-subscribed and they all had to be scaled back, which meant that we got very good pricing on all those debt deals. So that was a very, very good effort for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of upcoming refinancing, we have notified the market we're going to repay our $600 million hybrid notes &#x2013; the notice went out a little while ago. And we've got about $1.7 billion of bank facilities coming up and they &#x2013; plans are in place to refinance those, and there won't be any issues with refinancing those maturities.</p>
          <p>Return on funds employed, it's about 29%, slightly down on last year. If you look at the impact adjusting for the property development investment that we're making, you can see that, that return on funds employed has been relatively consistent over the last few years. Earnings per share, last slide, up 6.5%, a very good outcome. Thank you all. Back to Michael.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom.</p>
          <p>The next slide is one that &#x2013; when it comes up. There it is. It has been one that we've shared with this group and the media over a number of years. And it remains the framework for how we think about our business going forward, very much having the customer at the center of the focus and then what are the things that will assist the customer in making the choice that Woolworths' brands are the ones that they wish to do business with. And, of course, underneath are the enablers for that and we make the point that we have been very measured and disciplined in our approach to growth over the longer term. And I think Tom provided some incremental capital and incremental return data in the actual press release that went out earlier.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to expand on this because Grant is going to invite the financial community to an Investor Briefing Day in late October. And there will be no doubt some things of great interest to those that are either shareholders or represent shareholders in the future of Woolworths going forward.</p>
          <p>To the outlook, and this is probably one of the more challenging outlook statements that we've made, and we hold the principle of making sure that we keep the market informed with exactly how we see it at any particular point in time. And if we believe that the market is not getting it correctly, then it is our duty to make sure that is the case.</p>
          <p>So there are two things that we see that are very important for this year. So this is not a long-term guidance, this is about this year. And this year, there is no doubt, on all the metrics and all the commentary around why the metrics are so, consumer confidence has fallen. They are saving, not speeding. So it's not to do with falling household income, it's to do with their confidence in the future. And we see nothing at this moment to suggest that, that may change particularly around discretionary spend. Our trading in July and August pretty much mirrored the trend that we saw in late May and June.</p>
          <p>So it was also important to make sure that everybody understood that we're starting a new business, and when we looked at the various reports, there are only one or two that actually had made an attempt to factor in the cost of setting up a new business. So it was very important that we kept the market informed about the likely cost and it could be up to $100 million.</p>
          <p>And so with those two things in mind, we came out with an earnings guidance of plus two to plus six. So, yes, we're going to be profitable. This is about a very, very challenging year, we believe, for retail in general in this country and in New Zealand. And if things change, if there's some significant good news that changes consumer habits and we see a change in consumer expenditure and a change in consumer savings and that has implications for Woolworths', Greg no doubt at the half or some other time, will keep the market informed as of our thoughts to the future at that point in time. But it was really important that we &#x2013; when we looked across the consensus going forward, that people had not factored in the fact that we're actually opening a brand new business, and you don't open it without costs.</p>
          <p>Our view, once again, is that this will be breakeven in the next three, three and a half or four years. I know that the individual briefings will mostly likely share that with you. And I'd just remind everybody that the $100 million, of course, is a carry forward against our future earnings in this division, anyway.</p>
          <p>All right. With that, I think we'll open for questions. And just a quick reminder to those online that mobile phones and headphones will cause some difficulty in us understanding the question, but if you use a landline, it's coming through crystal clear.</p>
          <p>So we have the first question here, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Ben Gilbert from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just first question, just around the $100 million of hardware costs. I'm wondering how much of those are one-off? And how much are actually carried forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Launch costs for marketing, obviously, are one-off. The setup of the distribution centers, but not the ongoing running of them, is a one-off. But you need to keep in mind that stores &#x2013; it doesn't matter whether it's a supermarket or a BIG W or Dan Murphy, they grow in maturity of profitability over two to three years, some are a little bit earlier. But on average, it's sort of like somewhere between two and three years, they reach their optimum profitability rate. So we're going to have a whole bunch that open in the first 12 months that won't be matured. In the second year, they'll start maturing, but we'll have another bunch of new stores that are opening. Third year, those first lot will be firing, the second lot will be maturing, the third one, third lot will be in their &#x2013; at any one stage, of course, we're going to have maybe 19 or 20 stores that are being built. We'll be recruiting, we'll be training, we'll be filling them up from the DC with their new sales, we'll be putting working capital into them.</p>
          <p>So when you build a business, I mean, you've just got to face those, but it's really important that the market understands that these are real costs that have to go against the P&amp;L. The long term future is a fantastic one for us. It really is a great opportunity. I've spent two days in the store in recent weeks, including last week, and I think the guys and girls are going to surprise a few people when we open the door to the public. It certainly surprised everybody that works Woolies when they walked in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a second one. Just maybe around the second half you mentioned, in the new Australian supermarkets business, because if we look at your gross margins in the first half, they're up about 40 bps and in second half, they're down sort of flattish and the cost of doing business was down, first half around 8 bps and second half up around 5 bps.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you maybe just talk to those trends and whether that's &#x2013; those sorts of trends have been built into the guidance that you're giving today?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our guidance obviously is for the entire business. The whole mishmash of things that we wouldn't be going into giving individual guidance for any business other that Masters, which we've done today because it appeared to be absent in most analysis.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You have Christmas and the holidays. There was no doubt that when you got to that mid-May through June, that retailing in general just felt it really tough. It didn't matter whether it was a colleague at Dow Jones or anybody else that cared to make comment in the paper; they just said that consumer stopped dead around about there. And it was tough. All right. Grant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Grant Saligari, Credit Suisse. Well, first of all, I acknowledge another solid results, so well done on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Grant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question, I guess, is really looking forward in perceptively what might be quite a deflationary environment in supermarkets for a couple of years yet, or it's hard to tell. But how comfortable are you with the ability to continue to see a deleverage in that type of scenario where we might have some fairly strong deflation for a while?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In regard to the products that are Aussie dollar connected, obviously, we're going to cycle out of that reasonably soon. So that should be almost like-for-like. So then we're back to where we were. In Fresh Food, it's interesting. We've just been looking at &#x2013; bananas came back to $10. We're starting to see a flow of product from the South Queensland basin of the leafy products. So those prices are coming down. Those &#x2013; last year we had terrible grapes, late mangoes, et cetera, they're all coming in.</p>
          <p>So whilst bananas that's been driving inflation, is coming down, we're also seeing that generally, that we're going to see some good prices on a lot of other categories that we didn't have last year. So I think in terms of deflation and in, obviously, implicit in our guidance is that we think that for the next 12 months that it's not going to be one way, there's going to be a great deal of inflation in food.</p>
          <p>Now, does that mean you got to work a lot harder? Absolutely. And the things that Grant will share in October around the whole Quantum project and the various offspins to those are very much dedicated at doing that.</p>
          <p>So just to give you a flavor of that, we've had 30-something callcenters that are now down to two or three. Over the past year, we've taken an opportunity through our shared services to reprocess a lot of things and as a result of that, a lot of guys that were in the administrative positions are now moved out to be in operational areas. So we're now at the point where if you look above the store manager line, we're actually below on our person per store where we were back in 2006. So we've done a lot of work. But there's a lot more work to be done to make it. But when I look at New Generation replenishment, I look at the transportation model; I look at the new distribution centers coming on line, I look at the growth of global sourcing, I look at the growth of the private label, et cetera. All of those are going to be a big part of what we're doing along with some other smart stuff that the guys working on. But it'll be up to Grant where how much he shares of it, but I'm pretty excited about some of the things that I'm aware of going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one other if I could, the gross margin line obviously, again, a very good performance out of Australian supermarkets. Could you elaborate at all on some of the drivers of that and how sustainable some of those changes are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well they're all sustainable because they all have upsides. So we &#x2013; probably the one that's &#x2013; we're getting closer to the end is the Direct Store delivery, so we're converting most of the alcohol now. But there's still quite a bit of fresh bread, et cetera, that is potentially convertible over the long run. Global sourcing, we're a long way from finished there. We've got great growth, but we can do a lot better there both in terms of the volume that we get for gross margin, but in terms of our cost of that supply chain, we can do much better there. Waste, we had shrinkage. We had another great year, but we still believe that on global best practice we could still improve that dramatically, particularly in Fresh. Private label, we're &#x2013; to be quite frank, we're about half the penetration that I think is possible in this country, so all of that's upside. The list continues to go. And, of course, with all of our vendors, we are very careful to make sure that we're buying at the best price and we're always in negotiation because typically, we're by far and away their largest customer. So we want to make sure that we're buying at, at least, the best prices. So we are in constant dialogue with them about making sure that that's the case. Greg?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So people representing Woolworths in various discussions with councils have been saying your average Masters store might trade at A$30 million a year. On my rough numbers, to produce $100 million loss, the trading range would be close to $23 million or $25 million a year. Do you think those sorts of estimates are reasonable for a store in its first year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think when they're talking about to councils, they're actually about the maturity number, they're not talking about the start-up number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well at the end of the second year, I'd be comfortable in saying that &#x2013; and when they going into the second year that that would be a fair estimate for most stores, yes. Some will be higher; some might be a little bit lower.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Michael Simotas from Deutsche Bank. Thanks for taking my question. Just hoping we could talk a little bit more on the guidance.</p>
          <p>If we look at the guidance range that's been given, obviously, we had some one-off impacts around natural disasters in the base year, and then we've got a one-off or a drag from hardware in FY'12. They seem to roughly offset each other, which implies that the underlying growth suggested by the guidance is fairly low, certainly less than what we've seen in the past.</p>
          <p>Now given we've got a very difficult environment, what sort of growth should we be thinking about longer term for this business? Is the growth that we've seen over the past five years out of the question? Or is it still achievable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this guidance is about this year. I'm not quite sure they quite offset each other. One was 38 and the other one was 100.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just assuming that it's the consolidated about in pre-tax. Correct me if I'm wrong on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, anyways, let's presume that they are. But your question about the longer term, our longer term view about the strength of this business remains unchanged. So we haven't actually changed our long-term goals there. What we need to do is to move through this deflationary environment and get to a place where we have some normality around consumer confidence. So our long-term confidence remains as it always has been.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind quite a number of those really bumpy years were aided by acquisitions. So &#x2013; and that opportunity remains, of course.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Persistence paid off. This is Craig Woolford from Citigroup. Just a question on, will they run the point around the Home Improvement business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Danks was profitable, but the Home Improvement division, if you had one that you reported, would I assume be loss-making because of other overheads. Can you just give some color as to what costs are in your Home Improvement in the FY'11 year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yes. Certainly. We started up the new distribution center, which we had to in Hoppers Crossing. We've had a bunch of people sitting over at Pennant Hills. There's a whole host of things that have already gone into to preparing for the launch, just normal business costs that you'd have.</p>
          <p>The only thing that's missing from the Masters was, in fact, a sales line. But all other things that you need to support a business have to be in place well before you open the door. You can't sort of open the door and say well, we better go and get a buying team, and a marketing team, and et cetera. You actually need to do it.</p>
          <p>We've had all the guys and girls for the first number of stores that have been hired and trained. And we've got a lot of them we have to train because we think that's going to be &#x2013; one of our big differences will be our ability overall to deliver a better service outcome. It just goes on and on, on, on.</p>
          <p>It's just normal business costs. It's what you would expect when you start up a business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And just on the property side of the business. So the company sold off nearly $390 million worth of property. Is there a development property? I appreciate it mightn't go through the P&amp;L, but if you looked at the real performance of property, the difference between what you paid and spent on development compared with what you're able to sell them for? Is that at a profit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We try and do it so it's pretty much breakeven because it's much better to have a long term &#x2013; a lower long term lease rate than a one-off. You have huge development profit. So you'll see that in the numbers, it's &#x2013; the profit and loss on disposal's not really significant for the whole group, and that's probably where we want to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that must include some sort of reevaluations or other...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. No reevaluations. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, there's a question on a statement you made earlier about the Aussie dollar and perhaps the BIG W business and deflation. Is a high Aussie dollar good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everyone seems to think it is, but no, it's not. I mean a stable dollar is okay. I don't care whether it's high or low, but when you go through the change from a low to a high and you reflect that in your retail prices, it really is a challenge for any retailer because your electricity is going up 30%, your labor's going up at 3.5% every day that you're open at all. But you're pulling through more units typically because it's cheaper, but you're getting less dollars for it.</p>
          <p>So if it stays at a $1.04, that's fine. If it stays at $0.90 that's fine. Stays at $0.70, that's fine. But when it actually is on the rise, it's a real challenge.</p>
          <p>On the opposite way, if it falls dramatically, you start getting inflation in the business, and that's a bit of a two-edged sword, say. Yes, your prices go up, but then people are less likely to buy things as they suddenly become dearer than they were last week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it couldn't be as simple as you haven't been able to catch the full benefits of the higher Aussie dollar because of supplies or others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's any benefit there for retailers. If you're out there, and you're going to complete for what is a reticent consumer in discretionary, to try and sit on that and hold some of that gain back, it just means that you're not going to sell anything, quite frankly.</p>
          <p>All right. We might try online.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">

          <p>Thank you. The first question comes from Shaun Cousins for JPMorgan. Go ahead please, Shaun.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, Mike. Just a quick question on cash flow and the dividend. How long is Woolworths' going to pay dividends that exceed their free cash flow? I'm just sort of conscious of the broader pipeline of free cash flow that you've got pending your two month CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thomas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I had announced that, Shaun. We're going to manage our balance sheet so that we can maintain our A3 rating.</p>
          <p>So we basically make an assessment every year going forward as to what we can spend in terms of CapEx, property development, normal ongoing CapEx. We look at where the growth of the businesses is going to be, and then we make a decision as to how much we're going spend. So that's how we manage it and we manage it within those credit metrics.</p>
          <p>So I guess to your point, if those credit metrics came under pressure, then we'd have to look at it again. But for good growth opportunities, Shaun, we don't have any shortage of access to capital, and we'd always take advantage of good growth opportunities going forward. Because we're here for a long term, it's not just a year-by-year proposition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of long-term earnings growth guidance, you guys <mark type="ph" /> didn't (1:06:05) provide that. But I know there's a strategy day coming up late October.</p>
          <p>But is it fair to say, given the law of big numbers and the fact that you've missed these targets or elements of these targets for the last two years, the ability to sustain that sales in the upper single digits and even faster sales, EPS growth and EBIT? It's <mark type="ph" /> yearly (1:01:29) been down by 20 bips per annum. I mean, does that just get impossible for a business that is the size and has the markets that you do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about the components, which is population growth, space growth and inflation. We've got population growth and we got space growth. What we had was deflation rather than inflation, other than in petrol, in our businesses. We would easily have got passed the five mark, which gets us into upper single-digits.</p>
          <p>Then if you take into account the other part of course is whether you can get some like-for-like market share growth. And we think that in most things, we actually did exactly that last year.</p>
          <p>So the component that actually didn't work for us getting into over 5% was in fact the deflation factor, Shaun.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm thinking in terms of more of the outlook. You're saying looking forward you might be able to have those factors of populations, space, inflation is hard to predict. Just curious then why you've decided to take it out. And then is the inference there that those long term earnings growth targets are not able to be achieved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The long &#x2013; what we've given today is our guidance for this year. The long-term guidance has remained unchanged.</p>
          <p>But what we've given today is we're standing on the deck and we're looking at the Australian consumer, and we're getting everybody to recognize that we're opening a new business that will have some costs, and we've given the best guidance that we can.</p>
          <p>We believe in being transparent. I know we're one of the few companies that actually bothered to give anybody any guidance. And that there's always a strong pull to perhaps not give any.</p>
          <p>But I think Woolworths has had a long history of being open and honest with the marketplace. And where we look at the moment, to stand here and be optimistic about the Australian consumer in the absence of any evidence would be, I think, misleading the market. So we've just got to be here and we've got to say look, this is what we see at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now when it comes to the half, if we see some good news happening in Europe or U.S. or wherever else that is causing concern for consumers, and Grant <mark type="ph" /> is able to say (1:03:48) well, we think the second half might be a little bit better, then he'll take the opportunity to keep you involved in that. And clearly as we &#x2013; perhaps if we get closer to the end and the Masters' number is materially different, he'll take the opportunity to tell you that, as well.</p>
          <p>But right here, right now, we've got to be &#x2013; make sure that the people that report on Woolworths understand that we think this is going to be a really tough year for all retailers in Australia and New Zealand. And we are opening a new business that will have some costs. And for us to do other than that would not be in the way that we've talked to the market for the last 10 years or more, and that is to be open and honest and not promise that we're not going to deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The inference, Shaun, that removing those strategies &#x2013; all that strategy terms from our presentation is some indication that we're not focused on long-term growth is totally incorrect. Every single action Woolworths is taking is about long-term growth. Our investment in Cellarmasters, our investment in Masters, our investment in the property development pipeline, of which we had to change tact to achieve it.</p>
          <p>The fact that our new CEO, Grant, is going to front up to the investment community at the end of October and actually present the strategy going forward.</p>
          <p>So there is absolutely no credibility to the view that we are not focused on operating a really good business now, and growing this business into the future. What we have done is set up this meeting in October so that Grant can take the investment community through it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, there. I've noted with interest the new head of Supermarkets has been found running a business in Malaysia, and as I understand the <mark type="ph" /> bullish history (01:06:25) has been very significant and experienced workforce and leadership renewal in the last 10 years have very much been internally generated. I'm interested in why you need to hire someone from outside of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's a really good question.</p>
          <p>I think the strength of Woolworths has actually been our ability to very carefully merge the new with the &#x2013; those that have been with us, and if you look at the senior management group, I think you'll find that it's about &#x2013; at the top 30, there's about a third, soon to be one less, with me going, but long-term Woolworths people. The other two thirds have been with us for less than 10 years.</p>
          <p>So Greg Foran, for instance, has only just ticked over 10 years. Tom's just been with us for 10 years. Julie, Debra, Dave, Don, Graham, Peter. Mark, he's been with us for a while. When I look around, there's a few of us here that have been around for quite a long time, but the myth that everyone that comes to a senior position in Woolworths had to be with Woolworths for 30 years actually is not the case.</p>
          <p>So it's actually been about two thirds and one third. And Tjeerd &#x2013; and that's his name, Tjeerd &#x2013; and I'm  hoping he's going to be cheering for the right football team. That's the one thing I leave you, Grant. He's going to have black and white when he adopts his football team. He's a fantastic retailer. I know he was one of the rising stars within in Tesco and very much someone both Terry and Phil Clarke had a high regard for, and I know that they didn't let him go too easily. But I think he's going to be a fantastic retailer.</p>
          <p>He's a fantastic young guy, and he's coming here to make Australia his home. He's not coming here on any contract, he's coming here to make Australia his home. That's the only way that we take people in from &#x2013; particularly from overseas. If they make a commitment to make this country and this company their new life. It's not you're here for a couple of years and then you're out of here. Tjeerd's coming here to stay.</p>

But the &#x2013; where it actually sits this year, next year, and the year after will depend very much on, number one, how quickly we run them out, and how quickly the stores mature.

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in regards to hotels, it seems the six months result was driven largely by some <mark type="ph" /> union costs of production (1:10:00). Could you just comment -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Just with hotels, it appears the back half result's being driven quite significantly by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:10). Can you just talk about where that's come from? Are there any one-offs there? And will those benefits <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:21).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're asking, the hotels had a good year, particularly second half, and will those &#x2013; where those benefits come from, and will they continue?</p>
          <p>So clearly there are a couple of final changes in the environment that kicked over in January, particularly in Victoria. But we have been very &#x2013; well, the team under <mark type="ph" /> Bruce (1:10:44)  have been very focused on making sure that we refurbish the hotels and make them great family entertainment centers. And in particular, our dining rooms have worked particularly well. But there have been a whole host of other things in terms of efficiency that the guys put in so.</p>
          <p>What we've taken is 280 &#x2013; what were individual pubs. And he's actually molded them into a business. So whether it's around price management or labor rostering, a whole host of things that weren't part of the pub scene for many, many years, and now controlled essentially, and have done very eloquently, and they're generating some good benefits for us.</p>
          <p>On the positive focus on the customer, I think the food has been just an outstanding success for us in the past year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry the one thing that I would add is obviously next year we've got the change in the legislation in the license arrangements in Victoria, basically from August, I think it is? August next year. And that will be a material number.</p>
          <p>And once again, I don't think &#x2013; we may have to give some guidance next year, but I don't think anyone expected in &#x2013; the appropriate amount there. I think one's had a reasonable go, but when I've looked through various papers that others have done, I think they haven't recognized that at all.</p>
          <p>So yes, we've got the cost of the Masters this year, but we're going to have a bit of a positive next year with the change in the pubs in Victoria.</p>

          <p>I'll just &#x2013; I'll take it off.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Okay, any more on line?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from David Errington of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike. Mike, I'm just a bit confused with regards to what this $100 million actually is. Is that your share of the losses of the joint venture? Or is that the total joint venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the total. And then obviously, there'll be a minority dividend come out of that afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the actual impact to Woolworths will only be about $65 million pre-tax? So the after tax will only be about $40 million, is that about right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let &#x2013; you ask a very, very complicated question. I'm looking at a very intelligent man here, Mr. Pockett.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was a minority interest calculation, yeah. Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the actual amount that you're drawing out is going to be only less than 1% change to profits, net profit after tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How about you take the time and have a sit down with Tom and go through your mathematics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's pretty simple, Mike, it's $100 million pre-tax...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your share is $66 million, so $66 million pre-tax, and so after tax, it's around $40 million. It's just 70% of $66 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. That math sounds about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the actual impact to your net tax gross is not going to be that significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be one-point-something-something-percent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What David said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My next question is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>After minority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. My next question was, is that, there was a very strong view from yourself, that the gain from the gaming license would offset any startup losses in hardware. Has something changed that makes you more negative toward the outlook on hardware?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, no. There's a timing difference. One happens this year and obviously the next couple of years until we get to breakeven point. The gaming licenses change starts next year. So that comment, and obviously we'll give the color on that next year, but would generally be true next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the gain in profit that you make in 2013 will offset any losses that you expect to make on startup on hardware?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've reserved the right for Grant to make that comment about this time next year rather than me making a prognosis. But just standing here at the moment, it'll go a fair way to doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a question on Note 16 in your financial statements, your 4E, in the Business segment area, I note that other operating revenue in Australian Food and Liquor has gone up by in excess of $50 million. Not by $50 million, in excess of $40 million, and in unallocated there's been unallocated revenue that has also increased by an excess of $50 million. So there's been an increase of over $100 million in unallocated revenue and other operating revenue. Has that gone straight to the bottom line in terms of an EBIT increase? And if so, does that represent that your underlying EBIT from ordinary operations is only up by that $75 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:17:03) Huge chunk of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So from $179 to $66, the unallocated is the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that'd be part of it, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much would that be? And the other question is, what is the increasing other operating revenue in Australian Food and Liquor that's increased by over $40 million? And I'm assuming that that wouldn't have any costs associated, so is that a $40 million increase in the Food and Liquor EBIT? Why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; I think the line you're looking at, David, is the other operating revenue, which is the sale of skins and hides, and that goes up and down with the price. So I think if this is the line you're looking at. That goes up and down with the price the &#x2013; of all the off-cuts from beef that we sell, and that goes up and down every year, and there's a &#x2013; obviously a revenue and a cost associated with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would the cost be associated with that, Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't really stated that publicly. Yeah. That's the one here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's a fairly large increase in revenue and if that doesn't have an associated cost line as great, then that's a fairly big increase in the underlying &#x2013; a fairly big increase that contributes to the EBIT line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it does have a cost. You got to do something with the animal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got to cut it off. So there is a cost.</p>

          <p>Price of hides does do up and down quite dramatically. Sheep skins in and pig skins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you track it back, David, it's gone up and down over the last five years, it changes. It's really the worldwide price of skins and hides.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
