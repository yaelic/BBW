      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report an excellent quarter, which is a testament to our high-quality portfolio, as well as our early recognition last year of the severe economic downturn. I'd like just take a few minutes to review the financial and operational highlights and then we'll open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>We reported FFO per share growth of 10.3% to $1.61 in the first quarter, compared to $1.46 in 2008. First quarter 2009 FFO per share reflects $0.02 of dilution as a result of the issuance of the common stock dividend that we paid in March of 2009. Diluted net income available to common stockholders per share increased 15.4% to $0.45 in 2009, from $0.39 in 2008.</p>
          <p>Comp NOI growth for the regional malls was up 2.7% for the quarter, and our comp property NOI statistics do not include lease settlements. Occupancy in the mall portfolio was 90.8 at quarter end, compared to 91.7% in the year earlier period. Occupancy across all platforms was decreased, due to the retail environment, as well as the store closings in early 2009 by major retailers who filed bankruptcy in 2008, and subsequently liquidated in the first quarter of 2009, including for the mall portfolio, 595,000 square feet, which was primarily the big box retailers Circuit City and Linens 'n Things.</p>
          <p>Comparable sales in the mall portfolio was $455 per square foot at March 31, 2009, as compared to 491 in the year earlier period. Sales in the mall platform continue to decline, due to the general weakening in the U.S. economy and the reduced performance of some of the higher-end tenants. We did see a deceleration in the rate of sales decline in the quarter, which is encouraging and, remember that Easter fell late this year, actually in April as opposed to March of last year. And there was weakness in Florida, California and the Las Vegas markets, which also impacted that statistic. Regional mall releasing spread was very solid at 24.8%, with a quarter in line with our historical levels and our expectations and what we've signaled the market again about the value of our lease rollovers.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the Premium Outlet portfolio. Comp NOI grew 7.9% in the quarter. Occupancy was 96.9% at the end of the quarter, as compared to 97.9 last year. The decline, again, was primarily the result of certain store closings and bankruptcies, as well as we opened Jersey Shore last year, which is 90% occupied at the end of the quarter, which had some small impact on that number. The Outlet business sales were 507 per foot at the end of the quarter as compared to 511 the year-earlier period. Our premium Outlet releasing spread was a robust 33.5% and the pricing power remained strong due to the low occupancy cost, stability of sales and steady demand for space from tenants.</p>
          <p>Our Premium Outlet portfolio contributes over 19% of our NOI, and is without a doubt the best collection of outlets in the country, and without peer, with the highest occupancy rate, generating the highest sales per square foot, strongest comp property NOI growth and highest development returns.</p>
          <p>Our third primary platform is the Mills. That was 89.7% leased at the end of the quarter, compared to 94.2% the year-earlier period. This decline, again, was attributable to the bankruptcies of 840,000 square feet, primarily Circuit City, Linens and Steve &amp; Barry's. Sales within the Mills platform was $373 per foot at quarter end, compared to 379 which, again, I think helped demonstrate the importance of the consumers looking for value, given the economic situation that they currently reside in. Releasing spread for Mills was a positive 14.1%.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the capital markets. As you all know, we sold 17.25 million common shares and issued 650 million of 10-year unsecured notes near the end of the quarter, and that was a total capital raise of approximately 1.2 billion, which reduced our borrowings on our corporate credit facility. Our corporate credit facility has zero outstanding, other than the foreign currency exposure that we keep outstanding. As a hedge against our foreign income we generate approximately $440 million of outstandings.</p>
          <p>In March we also refinanced two regional malls at 197.5 million with an average interest rate of 7.77%. These loans were new originations by major life companies and, in fact, they had existing indebtedness of approximately $130 million prior to our refinance. We retired $700 million of senior notes. At the quarter end we have approximately 1.1 billion of cash on hand, including our share of joint venture cash. And our availability on our corporate credit facility is somewhat over $3 billion. Our unencumbered portfolio continues to include 150 wholly owned assets that generate EBITDA in excess of 1.7 billion, and our annual cash flow is still projected this year before dividends to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p>Dividend -- let me talk about development, redevelopment, talk about the dividend, as well. We opened The Promenade at Camarillo in Camarillo, California, a 220,000 square foot expansion expected to generate a return of -- first year return of 13%. In addition, on April 17, we opened a new Nordstrom at the recently redeveloped and expanded Northshore Mall in Peabody, Massachusetts. In addition, we are finalizing the construction in the U.S. on Cincinnati Premium Outlets, the second phase of Domain in Austin, Texas, and the redevelopment expansion of South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>We currently anticipate that our domestic development capital expenditures, net of construction loans already in place, will approximate $180 million for the remainder of 2009, and currently we're projecting less than $50 million in CapEx development spend in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the dividend. As you know, we've paid particular attention to this. We've treated it with the most seriousness that we can treat any corporate decision that we can make. We've worked hard and long with our Board of Directors, and we have determined that the company's annual common stock dividend will be reduced to the minimum amount required to distribute 100% of our taxable income and maintain our REIT status. This amount is currently estimated to be $2.70 per share for 2009. In the first quarter of 2009 we paid a dividend of $0.90 per share, and that's -- we expect to pay three quarterly dividends of $0.60 per share for the balance of the year to equate to the $2.70 of estimated taxable income.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, we originally forecasted our taxable income to be approximately 3.30 per share, $3.30 per share, and based on our decision in the Q1 to pay the $0.90 per dividend -- per share dividend on that estimate. Since that time, we've been able to lower our estimated taxable income by taking into consideration the increased share account from our equity issuances, as well as additional taxable depreciation available to us, both of which were not included in our regional estimate.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, the dividend announced today and payable on June 19, is $0.60 per share consistent with the dividend announced in the first quarter. The dividend will be paid in a combination of stock and cash. The cash component of the dividend will not exceed 20% in the aggregate, or $0.12 per share. The cash component of the dividend was increased by 3%, or $0.03 per share, or 33% from the first quarter dividend.</p>
          <p>Guidance today, we revised and adjusted our 2009 FFO guidance to $6.05 to $6.20 per share. This revision was primarily driven by the 2009 common stock in unsecured debt offerings that occurred at the end of the quarter, as our outlook on operation currently remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me just say that I'm proud of the first quarter. It was very -- continues to be a difficult operating environment, but we delivered excellent growth and profits, 10% above last year's numbers. We strengthened our industry leading balance sheet with our common stock and notes offering, and we continue to be pleased with how the company is positioned. And we're grateful to continue to maintain our leadership position in the REIT industry.</p>
          <p>With that said, Operator, we're ready for questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And the first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Was there any magic behind the cash component of the dividend going up a few cents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think we are -- it's our desire to get to as much cash dividend as we feel comfortable to pay. I think we'll continue this strategy for '09, but we're really looking to, as soon as we get more and more clarity in the capital markets, and that's becoming a little bit clearer that, that we're optimistic that we will reinstate the full cash dividend. And I just think it's hopefully a signal for the market that we're getting more and more confidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean not knowing anything else, should we look at, I'm assuming the $0.60 probably wouldn't be a run-rate into 2010, or should we think of 2.70 as being an annual and just think of the dividend on an annual basis at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think that it's obviously, 2010 is a while away, but our early projections on our taxable income for 2010 are anywhere between 2.70 and $3 per share. Again, there's a lot of variability to that, but it would be our intention to obviously pay our taxable income and to pay the appropriate amount in cash, given the current market conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The Mills occupancy decline, I know you mentioned the boxes who were the culprits there. Was all that expected? Did anything else come out of that that wasn't expected? And then can you comment on just, I guess, the demand, the activity that you're seeing in terms of leasing some of those boxes plus in the community center portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll turn it over to Rick. I mean, the Mills decrease was all entirely for the boxes. The demand there continues to be decent. There are more and more tenants like we just opened, the Last Call, I happened to be there last week in Potomac Mills, the Last Call at Neiman Marcus. We're just about to open an Orange Neiman Marcus, as well. So the demand is good, but they have -- as you know we've had lots of boxes in those properties. It will take some time, but the in-line shopping demand, or the in-line shopping, or the in-line tenancy really didn't have much variability. It's all associated with the boxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only other thing, we have another Neiman Marcus Last Call opening at Gurnee and we also have a number of H&amp;Ms opening in these boxes. The other thing that's going on is that, as David pointed out, because of the stable sales performance there, we're seeing an increasing migration to the Mills platform of not only Outlet tenants that we are cross fertilizing from Chelsea, but also our full price mall tenants that we've started to open in the Mills. So our demand for small shop space in the Mills is maintaining relatively stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, I think on the last call, David, you mentioned an expectation that, obviously, just don't just look at any one quarter in terms of spreads, but you said maybe the spreads come into the teens. Can you talk about what you're seeing post Q1 and into the spring leasing season? Do they still look pretty sticky at least --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Look I think, I've tried to &#x2013; I have been inelegant in my articulation of our leases and the fact that they're under market, but generally good retail has been around for a long time. And given the fact that good retail real estate, the leases tend to roll over seven to 10% per annum. It just takes a long time to bring those, that good retail up to market. And we are -- the good retail we're still feeling reasonably confident that we can deliver rental growth out of -- as in certain properties you're going to have a struggle to do that. But given that the majority of our income is coming from better properties, we still think it's sticky. And we would expect to continue to do it. Look, I think the nature of it may come in somewhat, but we still believe strongly that our leases are under market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann from Simon Properties Group. (sic) [Jonathan Habermann of Goldman Sachs]. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't realize I'd switched companies. I'm still at Goldman Sachs. But David --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't pay as much as Goldman Sachs does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought I'd start off with a NOI growth and, David, your comments certainly sound a little bit more positive than the last call, but 2.7% certainly positive versus your sort of plus 1% forecast. I guess, how do you see NOI growth trending throughout the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean we've been &#x2013; we're not going to move away from the flat to 1% growth. It's a tough retail environment. We're just trying to execute to the best of our abilities to deliver that. So again I don't -- you can't over react on one quarter, but we still feel like we're going to deliver the flat to 1% NOI growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it'll dip negative more toward the middle of the year as sort of these bankruptcies...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the real issue at the end of the day that is very hard to predict is overage rents. Now that's not a lot, but that does have some variability associated with it. And that's why we're probably a little bit more cautious. Obviously we're reserving a lot and you see the bad debt expense. It's still very high compared to historical standards. And that's the variability that's just really hard to pinpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other part of it too is the financing market. It sounds like you're more optimistic there as well, I mean I know you should be unsecureds. But have you seen the market improve even since -- in the last month or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think the corporate market is dramatically improved. I mean, it's good to see the industry begin to re-equitize. It's good to see the unsecured debt markets come back. Our spreads have tightened dramatically. That's all good news. The life companies are providing capital to the best, to the borrowers and the best properties. The one unknown in our industry is obviously the CMBS market and what happens there -- I'm not one of these guys sitting around assuming the government's going to help the real estate industry, but that's the big unknown and that's the market that lacks the most clarity on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And referring to the life cos. for a minute, I mean, you did mention that it's improved. I mean, do you see that as a very deep option at this point or do you think this is a flurry of activity from sort of the lack of activity from late last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think they have -- I think, look I think it's dependant upon the insurance companies, but there's other capital out there that wants safe mortgages with good borrowers on good real estate. And they now have the ability to kind of pick and choose and, in fact, drive pretty good bargains. So I think that market's -- it's not extremely deep, but it's there. And it's not just life insurance companies. I think we're starting to see debt funds and the like that are going to provide capital to good borrowers and good real estate at pretty good rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly just on GGP. Any thoughts in terms of how that's impacting your leasing or even in terms of cap rates in transactions that you might see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to tell. I don't sense it's going to have any impact on our operational aspects, leasing or, we're not going to, we -- it's very interesting as big as General Growth is and obviously as big as we are, we rarely have competed in markets. We may have three or four, five centers that had some overlap. We've always competed kind of on a national basis, but -- so I don't think it's going to have any impact on the operational side, other than as we said last quarter, I do think the landlord, from a retailer perspective, is really important. And to the extent we do think we'll get some residual benefit just because of the position the company's in, as well as the quality of our assets. I don't think at this point cap rates impact on financing. I have not seen it and I don't expect it to really play out for some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is <mark type="inaudible" /> here. I'm with Michael. Just the first question, a lot of your peers have being saying that a lot of the lease renewals have been doing so far this year have been for shortened terms of one or two years. I'm just wondering if that's something you're experiencing in your leasing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Rick. We've been interested to see the focus on this. Our leasing strategies haven't changed at all. And frankly, you can look at our termination schedule in the 8-K quarter-to-quarter and track it. For whatever it's worth, our number of leases less than two years is a dramatically lower percentage than anything that we've heard publicly discussed in the other calls. But you also need to bear in mind that there are a lot of very good reasons for having a shorter term.</p>
          <p>We want to have our retail spaces have the same expirations if we can put together a new room that's more marketable. We want to generate more rent. We want to change the mix. There are a lot of factors and I don't think that the implication that there's something negative in that trend is appropriate but, in fact, for us there's no material change historically in our terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of I guess your gross occupancy cost ratio with the mall portfolio with retail sales dropping about 7% over the year and obviously <mark type="inaudible" /> rents increasing by six or 7%. Just sort of wondering where that ratio is moving to and I know you said that you think the majority of your portfolio is still under rented. Are there any sort of particular tenants or types of tenants where the occupancy cost ratio is moving up and you've got some concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all historically, we've always tried to ensure that we were getting full rents but we have always run this business with a view towards ensuring that we can work with our tenants and, in fact, our occupancy cost within the malls is 14%, which is still very much within the traditional bounds where tenants can remain profitable even at these decreased sales levels.</p>
          <p>I would also point out and this was a point that was referenced by David, that in our Premium Outlet portfolio our occupancy cost ratio is only 8.7%. So in both platform, in Chelsea we know we have a substantial opportunity to bring leases to market. And that's reflected with the significant rent spreads we are reporting on renewals. And in the mall portfolio our occupancy cost percentage is such that we're still having constructive conversations with our tenant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Quientin and I would just say, look I think that's -- but sales is obviously having an impact on how retailers are thinking about their business and what they can afford to pay. And that's one of the reasons why our NOI assumptions are not growing three or 4% like they have historically. And that's why we think we're going to be flat so to up 1% so, I mean there is sensitivity that we have to our retailers, given the current sales environment. So it is somewhat of a governor on growth right now. But I think our under market undervalued leases allow us to kind of maintain the flatness of what we're projecting.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And David or Rick, it's Michael speaking. How much do you think, I mean, clearly it sounds like other landlords are moving down that path of shorter duration. Do you think it's more so from a retailer perspective of them pushing it and saying, look I don't know where things are going to be. I'm willing. I'd like to stay here, but cut me a break, I'll stay for another year or two and then we'll see where things are, rather than them leaving. Or, how much of it then is it the landlord saying, you know what, I'd rather -- I don't want to sign a long term lease at massively down rents if I know in two or three years things will be better? And I'm just trying to understand that dynamic --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think it's both, Michael, without question it's both. But the important thing is, when we deal with a major tenant, we're dealing with our entire portfolio. And the one thing that -- and if they're uncertain about sales at a particular center, our goal is to shorten everything up, as an example, because one thing we don't want to do is just have not such great stores expire when you have and then do the longer-term leases on the great stores, so we try to balance that.</p>
          <p>And in some cases it's a short-term band-aid. It could be from our perspective. It could be from theirs. Sometimes you're waiting on the right tenant for the space. As Rick mentioned earlier, that we think Sofore is going to come in next year not this year, so let's hold it over for a year. We had a situation at Dadeland Mall where we did that, as an example.</p>
          <p>So it's all part of the equation and it's not -- I will tell you it's not that dramatically different than what we've been doing over the last few years. Now is rental expense a higher priority for tenants? Absolutely. But the give-and-take, the duration of the leases and when you do it, when you don't do it, when you have a hold over rent or tenant when you don't, has been pretty consistent over the last several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you finding at least when you're having these portfolio discussions, clearly, your total portfolio is of high-quality, but if you were to bracket it into different classes, are you finding that at least on a lower quality or the lower sales productivity assets, is that hurting more or is that where retailers are becoming more concerned about at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it depends on the retailer really. I mean some of the high rent tenants had more dramatic sales decreases than what, I'll call the moderate to better. So it really is a function of the retailer and the marketplace. But clearly if the real estate is not that good, you're going to be in a match to maintain the cash flow of that asset and look, we've got some that are in that bucket, but we're still able to figure out how to grow our comp NOI even though we have assets in that class.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then -- this is a last question for Steve. Can you talk a little bit about the two CMBS loans, where you decided not to fund, effectively default on, and I know one it was basically just more of a legal ownership than economic, but talk a little bit about the one in Palm Beach. And then separate from that, talk a little bit about, clearly you have a lot of capacity today, $1 billion of cash and 3 billion of credit line capacity. Talk a little bit about the maturities in '09 and 2010 especially on the joint-venture side where you have a lot of secured larger loans. And then maybe talk about Forum Shops as just the biggest secured maturity on the consolidated portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk about the source in Palm Beach if I could, Michael, and then Steve could add to the last part. Let me first of all the source, we have a 25% carried interest in that property behind significant preference for what I'll call the true economic owner and there's two other partners in that deal. We have no invested capital in that project. We were working toward a refinance kind of as the manager of the -- property manager of that asset. We were working toward a refinancing of that asset and then, given Fortunoff's bankruptcy, obviously being the major anchor, coupled with Circuit City and Steve &amp; Barry's, the refinancing got impossible to execute.</p>
          <p>So we are actually trying to work with the true economic owner and the lender to figure out how to come up with an acceptable alternative to keep the -- to extend the maturity date and give us the time to figure out how to fill the space. Both the true economic owner and the lender have expressed an interest in us maintaining our role in that, even though we don't get any cash flow. Obviously the management fees the minimus in terms of in what we're doing. So we're actually trying to be an honest, happy broker to figure out how to make and give both of those, lender and the borrower, the ability to maintain the status quo for a better environment down the road.</p>
          <p>So that's the source and then let me turn to Palm Beach just to give you a little bit of history. Palm Beach, for those of you who don't know, we really acquired, that is, Simon Property Group acquired the asset, both when we acquired DeBartolo and Corporate Property Investors more than 10 years ago and those ownership interests, they were owned 50-50 and obviously they were very small in connection with the overall deal DeBartolo and CPI.</p>
          <p>And since that time, Michael, we invested millions of dollars renovating. We actually brought in Dillard's during that process. We retenanted the mall. And I think we did as good a job as anybody to maintain that center as an enclosed mall. But ultimately we knew that maintaining it as an enclosed mall was going to be very difficult. So we began to develop a significant redevelopment plan which, unfortunately because of the state of the retail environment, in fact we were working with IKEA, as an example. We were working toward maybe potentially demolishing the mall and the like, but when we lost IKEA, that kind of put that whole development on hold.</p>
          <p>Additionally during that period of time we lost Dillard's, and then subsequently we lost Macy's. And so we were trying to, and have attempted to, reach an acceptable resolution with the representative of the lender. And I will point out this as a non-recourse loan, but those attempts, the lender or the servicer I should say, really was not interested in having a dialog on this. And those attempts currently have not reached an acceptable resolution.</p>
          <p>So with all that said, that's Palm Beach and, again, we've worked very hard to maintain it and to try and redevelop it, but the environment is such that that's going to make it very difficult. This has been a cash flow drain for the company on this non-recourse loan. And I think our decision is obviously in the best interest of our bondholders and our equity holders and the like. So that's the status of that.</p>
          <p>I'll turn it over to Steve for your last part of your question. Other than to say, the good news in both our secured and our secured indebtedness coming in up '09 and '10 and our JV is a lot of that is with life companies that were well down the road. If you look at our consolidated nines the vast majority of that is with insurance companies that we have a wonderful relationship with. We've made very good progress on and the same thing can be said for our 10s as well. So -- but I'll turn it over to Steve to add more color if you'd like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, just to echo David's point, as an example, 75% of our '09 maturities are non-CMBS. The other thing that I'd point out is, in the nines, 10s then even going out to 11, our debt yield's -- current debt yield's based on current EBITDA is in the 15% range. So these are loans that in the aggregate are appropriately sized, even given the current market conditions, which is why we've made the statement that we expect to be able on a net-net basis to refinance our secured indebtedness in whole.</p>
          <p>Not to say we won't have to equitize certain assets. And, as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we actually got excess proceeds from a couple of the loans that we've done already. But net-net we think we're in pretty good shape. You asked about Forum Shops, specifically I suspect because of it's size and it is a large loan that I would also tell you does well north of $80 million of NOI. So again when you look at it from a debt yield perspective, it is certainly not over levered.</p>
          <p>And one of the great advantages of our company compared to many others is we have a big unencumbered portfolio and so the ability to mix and match our financing sources. We are not dependent on rolling over every mortgage maturity that comes due. And as David mentioned earlier, we certainly believe the bond market has substantially improved from where we saw it a month or so ago. So I feel very good about the ability to continue to roll over our mortgage debt and to finance the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to give you a perspective on that. That's what our line is therefore essentially. So take the Oklahoma assets that we refinanced, we actually paid off the mortgages --</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Yes, thanks. Do you think you're in a position now from a balance sheet perspective to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities that might come along or do you just still think that from where pricing talk is and where you are that you'd rather wait?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Paul, I will tell you that we are feeling better about the world generally. We obviously have been very conservative on capital, but I think the steps that we've taken, though painful in some respects and not something we wanted to do, I think we're feeling better about the market. Generally, I think we're looking to be -- we're looking more outward yet. It may be still too early to do to become more on the offense. But our mood here is getting a little bit more forward thinking than it has been over the last six months. And what's interest -- and I do think there is capital and lots of different ways for us to be opportunistic as the opportunities arise. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Paul, first of all I'd say welcome back into the fray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'd just echo what David said. One of the things that we have clearly seen over the last six months is the move of capital towards higher quality sponsors. I think at the height of the EMBS market who actually owned the mall or who the partner in the mall was, was maybe less important as I had ever seen it in the 20 years I've been doing this.</p>
          <p>I think we're at the other end of the spectrum right now. And money, and there is still a ton of money sitting on the sidelines, has gravitated towards the better sponsors. And so I think when you couple what we've done already from a capital raising standpoint plus some of the inquiries we have gotten about people wanting to put money to work side-by-side with us. I think David is right and that we're feeling a little better about the opportunities that we're inevitably going to see come down the road. Because there is obviously still a lot of distress in the market. And we're going to see opportunities.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you have been pursuing some of those outside the U.S. Is there a bias now for anything incremental being domestic or foreign?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>I think the primary focus currently will be domestic, Paul. Last question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Last question on just sort of visibility from a leasing perspective. In my experience ICSC comes and you start -- you talk about a lot of deals for this year it will be 2010. How much are retailers sort of willing to kind of think about sort of fall 2010 openings or has everybody just got a much shorter time horizon right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Interest, Paul, this is Rick. We've had in the last three weeks in anticipation of ICSC probably five to eight tenants a week coming in here, because with our portfolio and across the platforms, we get a lot more done and we are talking to them about 2010 deals. Obviously they want to see what the future holds as well, but three months ago no one was even thinking about it. Now they are starting to think about it for new stores, but we are actively finalizing our renewals and are working now on our renewals in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean did you think that the balance we've had a bit in sales has actually changed the attitude at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they are still wanting to see some firmer trends. What I will say, we have -- Dave and I've met with a number of these retail CEOs over the last several weeks. And they are at least more comfortable in understanding the trends. There was a period of time in January and February where they didn't really know what was ahead of them. Now I think they are a little more comfortable as to that. But they still want to get some firmer feel for how this is going to unfold over the next few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just say I think their mood is better. I got from the guys I talked to I think they're -- I think it's important -- no one knows for sure kind of where we're going to be the next six months in terms of the broader economy, but I will tell you that, given the dramatic fall-off from September to December and the slowing down of the sales rate of deceleration, that sounds right. I would tell you that their mood is more stable and more forward thinking, without question. That's not to the say, there aren't certain retailers that are still not seeing that rate of deceleration slow. But I think it's a little bit better clearly than it was in December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, look, we're going to look at that market when it's appropriate. Look, we chose to punch a whole in the capital markets, because we were concerned about the industry and concerned about the cycle that was out there. So we decided to take some short-term pain for hopefully a long-term reward. We don't have any regrets about decisions that we made. I mean our timing -- it's hard to know whether that we'd be where we are today, but we knew that that cost was expensive.</p>
          <p>We thought that by doing it, ultimately that we would be able access markets more cost effective and so far it looks like we're moving in that direction. That's a long winded answer say, yes, I mean we're -- we never think our cost to capital was where we were at the end of March. But we chose to incrementally suffer that pain, because we didn't like the cycle there we and/or the industry was in.</p>

          <p>Thank you. When you did the Mills deal, you talked about redevelopment opportunities. And they had some things in the works at the time including <mark type="inaudible" /> and potentially adding some Colonnade style features to some of the other projects. We haven't seen anything like that over the last couple of years and I'm wondering if it's just the environment or do you have things in the works that you might be willing to talk about in the next six months or so?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Rick, David. In fact we are in the process of finalizing right now a 15,000 foot expansion into the Colonnade at Sawgrass Mills. There are number of tactical things going on within the Mills portfolio David already discussed the last call. We're adding Off Broadway, a number of other small shops in the Mills properties. In terms of the more dramatic redevelopment in the Mills, malls obviously the capital programs of the fashion retailers that we are focusing on to reposition those assets, are on hold now and it is going to be some period of time before they are prepared to engage in the conversations on those redevelopments. At the Mills properties themselves, we are working on a number of other projects, but as has been our historic practice, we don't really talk about those things until we have something concrete to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say -- I would just underline that the Mills -- the actual Mills, we've actually done a lot of new boxes, Neiman's, we're doing a lot at Orange, Gurnee as Rick suggested. So I think our -- we're very satisfied with how we've positioned The Mills. We have two disappointments and I'll say that they are directly related to the economy and that's in Southdale and Del Amo and we think both are great long-term real estate opportunities it's just, I think those have been somewhat of a setback, not because we don't have the vision or the plan, it's just -- they're going to be on hold.</p>
          <p>But I'd say by and large The Mills progress, we've been very pleased with and the other one that we created was Gurnee. We were looking to do a lifestyle addition and we kind of put that on hold because of the economy, but as Rick mentioned, Neiman's is going there in any event.</p>
          <p>So I'd say we're bringing hopefully Casino to run The Mills. We did, Rick and I did that over the weekend, more Rick than me. I just found where Rick was, Okay. But I mean The Mills, we feel good about. We've got a couple of disappointments in those two big malls. But I think there are opportunities for when the world gets a little bit better.</p>

          <p>Well, I can't tell you, because you may tell somebody.

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Steve, wanted to ask you quick about -- or maybe even David, about what your optimal view is on leverage looking ahead? You've seen a number of other REITs come out and say that they're lowering their views on where they think their debt-to-equity should be longer term. Have you assessed what that is for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look I think we're comfortable now, I think, as we look to be more opportunistic we're going to need more firepower ultimately, but I think our balance sheet, the fact that the regional malls have the kind of cash flow resiliency, where we are. We're making steps to delever. We'll continue to make those steps. You see where we are with the rating agencies. I mean, I feel like we're there but we can always focus on our cash flow generation to delever and that's what we're in the process of doing right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, this is Steve. I'd just add one thing. If you think about the stability of the mall business and obviously the results that we've been able to demonstrate in terms of holding the EBITDA in a terrible economic environment. Support, we're covered in our EBITDA 2.6 times right now in terms of interest coverage. Given the stability of the cash flow, that's a very comfortable place to run our business. Now that leverage may change up or down depending on your view of cap rates. But I think if you just think about it from a cash flow coverage, running the business north of 2.5 times, I think is a comfortable place for us to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then related to the leasing spreads. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color in terms of how many of those leases were signed last year prior to the downturn and you still saw that positive widespread and if that should shrink over the next year or two as we start to see you report your results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mark, I'd say this -- I mean it's a huge portfolio so the size of the numbers does mean something. But having said that, I think as David mentioned in a response to an earlier question, we gave guidance at the beginning of the year expecting that lease spreads could go down to the lower end of our 15 to 25% historical range in the mall. They haven't done that yet, but does that mean they couldn't come down a bit as we get farther into the year? Sure they could. But obviously still feel leases are under market, still feel very good about our ability to generate meaningfully positive leasing spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just add to Steve's point on the metrics. Year-to-date, we've executed 3,347,000 square feet of leases comprising 1,071 deals. So in and of itself, that's a very large sample that's driving the stats that we put out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that color. And then lastly, Steve, I was wondering -- I noticed that repairs and maintenance expense came down relatively -- compared to last quarter relatively high and then your credit for losses doubled quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a little more guidance on your expectations for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, without talking about repairs and maintenance specifically, because things can move quarter-to-quarter. But if you just look at the overall operating cost at the mall, we have done a very good job of controlling our cost in this environment. And I would expect that kind of overall trend to continue for the rest of the year. As it relates to the bad debt expense, I think given the uncertainty of the environment that we're in, I would like to think that when we look back 12 months from now we will have been a little conservative in the fourth quarter, I mean in the first quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily expect that provision to be a run rate for the year, but I don't think there's any question that we're in an environment where bad debt expense in '09 could be higher than it was in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, good morning. When you look at leasing, what percentage -- I don't think you mentioned it, Rick. What percentage of the '09 leases have you got done at this point, expiring leases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're probably upwards of 85%. We have, in addition to the statistic I just said, we have another in our lease approval process, 7,126,000 square feet, that's being processed, another 2,109 leases. And I said, we're already well into our 2010 renewals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So year-end '09 occupancy is probably -- going to be what do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to speculate because we don't know what is going to happen in terms of tenants that end up filing, or what happens even with the tenants that have filed. One of the positive things that we've seen that I think is reflected in David's point in the capital markets is that, tenants that filed December, January, it was straight to liquidation. What we're seeing now is that there is more debt financing available, and a number of the tenants that have filed in the last 60 days are actively discussing which leases they want to assume, as opposed to just going right to liquidation. So it's very hard to project today where that's going to end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, good. Thanks. And then it sounds like -- and it seems to me that bankruptcy season in general was lighter, certainly than people expected, but how would you put in context historically? I mean, what do you think of this last -- this first quarter in the bankruptcies we saw, versus what we've seen in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Rich, this is Steve. I would just say, I think the concept of a bankruptcy season is probably less relevant. Rick mentioned that in the first part of the year, there was no disfinancing I think that muted the bankruptcies and for no other reason than people knew if they took the risk to go into bankruptcy, they would probably going into liquidation and no one wants to sign their own death certificate. One of the outcomes of the fact that there is a bit of disfinancing now is that there may be more bankruptcies here later in the year just because people have a little bit more confidence that they can do a reorg as opposed to a liquidation. So I mean I think it's hard to say, but we certainly would not be surprised if there were more bankruptcies yet this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you we lost a lot of occupancy due to bankruptcies the first quarter, Rick. So it's I mean our setback in leasing occupancy this quarter is all as a result of the bankruptcies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, good, yeah, thanks Dave. And, Rick, would you give us the hit parade of who the tenants are that are most maybe increasing their desire to open stores, your feel for more excitement to maybe among certain tenants with regard to your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you who, yeah, people that we are working with now that have opened -- are opening stores in '09 and still have expressed appetite in '10 are stores like Express, H&amp;M, Sephora, Forever 21, J. Crew, Apple, Zara.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell the other developers might <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right. But the good news is they're all the junior category. There are a lot of people that are interested in locating stores in our properties and in the outlet portfolio, the list is far longer. There is continued demand in the outlet portfolio. We're seeing a number of tenants come into the outlet portfolio that are new to the outlet portfolio. And so it's -- I don't want to say if anything that it's robust, but there's work going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks. And then on the GGP bankruptcy, are you guys involved in that in anyway, or do you just monitor it or what are you doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're certainly monitoring it. I mean, it has &#x2013; it'll be a fascinating thing to monitor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean you're -- you don't actually have discussions with them at any time, Dave, or is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not having any discussions with them currently. But this is going to be a long complicated process that can go a lot of different ways. So we're, obviously, we're going to stay closely abreast of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right and then last thing is on construction costs, are you guys seeing a drop in construction costs and does that provide any benefit here as tenants continue to avoid new developments, but may be going forward as they might take another look at some of these?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, yeah it certainly going to help us. <mark type="inaudible" /> Dramatic reduction in cost and perhaps more important is there's going to be a dramatic reduction in new supply. So over the next five years we anticipate that there is going to be very few new projects brought forth. It's going to materially help us increase the market share of our existing properties.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. Hi, just two quick follow-ups. First Steve, home and regional costs dropped off quite a bit from prior run rates and year-over-year. Just wondering if you can give us an idea of what's going on there? And then, Rick, you were talking about 2010 leases, or 2010 leasing activity. Can you give us a sense in terms of those, that early activity, the comment about spreads being toward maybe the lower end of the historical band, do you think that will carry over into 2010 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me comment on the renewals first. The renewal activity that we're doing to date really reflects David's comments. And happily, the properties that drive our results we still have pricing power and we are operating within the historic expirations. Properties that have less pricing power, there's more pressure, but overall we think we're going to continue as we have historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would just say we're going to be smart about renewals too, because we have confidence in our business, in our company and in our properties that we don't -- if you rush, rush, rush to do a renewal in a mall that you think is really good and get long-term growth prospects, I mean, you don't want to give away the store, in a sense. So we're just being very thoughtful about what the right rent is for the long-term of that space, as opposed to what it might be in this particular moment in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Mike, on your question about the home office costs. It's a couple of things, as I think David and Rick have alluded to over those past three or four calls. We got ahead of the curve with cost management that included rightsizing parts of the business that were construction development related. And then the first quarter of the year is where we do our incentive payouts for the prior year and they were lower in '09 than they were in '08.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just one point of clarity, guys. When you disclose lease spreads on expiring of renewal leases, that's for deals signed in the quarter, not for the actual deals that rolled over in a quarter, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No David. It's for tenants that actually open and close, so we match actual tenants whose leases expired or spaces who closed, compared to tenants who opened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that gives you tremendous visibility over the next couple of quarters because everything that's going to happen is pretty well signed at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what deals are signed to open or close in Q2 already, and so you pretty much would know what your lease spreads are going to be for Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I would say this, when we gave guidance for the beginning of the year, I remember people asking, why are you at zero to one, because a lot of people were more negative in their estimations. It was because two-thirds of our '09 leasing was done and we did have visibility into what those spreads might be, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What does your guidance assume about additional shares from the stock dividends for the remainder of this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance assumes, David, that we continue to pay a stock dividend for the remainder of the year consistent with what we've done this quarter. But it does not assume any additional equity.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. David, you guys co-own a mall with General Growth in Texas, the shopping center that is apparently being sued by a banker of  Dillard's  ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on the lawsuit and also perhaps how your relationship with General Growth has evolved since their financial troubles began last year, maybe either as it pertains to this mall or other malls that you jointly own?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say this, I mean this is a -- we picked up a half an interest in this mall when we bought CPI. General Growth has managed -- this was a joint venture between Ralphs and CPI. General Growth picked up their interest when they bought CPI. And they have been the property manager, what'd I say, I'm sorry, Ralphs. Thank you.</p>
          <p>They've been the property manager. They and Ralphs have been the property manager since we've ever been involved in it. And they have taken the lead on it and they have been leading the charge on the litigation. And we're just -- we're a partner, but we have no day-to-day involvement in the managing of the asset. Our relationship, General Growth we know Adam, the guy that runs it now. I mean, I'd say our relationship with him is fine. And we have asked to take over the management of this asset for a number of years. We have been turned down through that process, but it is what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Ben, just to be clear, this is the only joint venture we have with General Growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, I'm just wondering if you think the General Growth turmoil has in any way contributed to the deterioration of that center? Do you have any opinion on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think they are and we are supporting them arguing that the deterioration is not exactly what the Dillard companies have suggested. And so we'll -- given the litigation, we'll leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
