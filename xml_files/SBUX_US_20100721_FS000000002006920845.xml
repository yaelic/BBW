          <p>Good evening. My name is Steve and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's third quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. Also on the call today from New York is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO and with me here in Seattle is Troy Alstead, CFO. Before we get started I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of Starbucks' website at www.starbucks.com. And to the financial statements accompanying our earnings release where you'll find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call today along with our corresponding GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn the call over to Howard I'd like to take this opportunity to make you aware of our fiscal 2011 biannual analyst conference which will be held in December on the 1st in New York. And more details will be coming soon but we hope you'll reserve that date on your calendar and join us there. With that Howard, I'm turning the call over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, JoAnn. And welcome to all joining us today. I am very pleased with the strong third quarter operating performance and financial results that Starbucks announced today. Beyond simply reflecting a continuation of our past several quarters' solid performance, the figures we release today are notable because they represent the highest Q3 operating margin and earnings per share in Starbucks' history. And they demonstrate our ability to simultaneously drive and deliver solid growth, performance and profitability in our core business, while investing in and bringing significant innovation to new and existing businesses.</p>
          <p>The steady improvement in operating leverage inherent in our U.S. and international retail businesses are reflected in the record EPS and operating margins for the quarter. Our 9% increase in comp store sales driven by 6% growth in traffic in the U.S. is our highest comp store growth since Q2 of 2006. And it represents the third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth in both our U.S. and international markets reflective of both the health of our business and the relevancy and importance to our customers.</p>
          <p>Noteworthy is that the comp sales increase we saw in Q3 were accomplished in the face of continuing weakness and uncertainty in the global economy; and despite continuing very soft consumer confidence metrics. And our traffic growth takes on even greater significance in the context of same store sales trend data reported by other domestic and multinational retailers.</p>
          <p>In Q3 we invested heavily in new product innovation and in multiple significant brand and product launches. Troy will provide additional detail around these investments but we designed and executed them in a way we believed would enable us to simultaneously benefit and leverage both of our retail and growing CPG businesses. And while the investments did in fact provide tangible, quantifiable benefits to both businesses in Q3, of greater significance is that the Q3 investments will continue to pay dividends well into the future.</p>
          <p>Consider However-You-Want-It customizable frappuccino campaign for example. The campaign was an important contributor to our top performance by driving retail traffic in the afternoon and evening day parts and expanding the customer base by offering ingredient options such as soy milk and decaf coffee for customers wishing those options. In fact, our blended category contributed almost 2% of the overall 9% U.S. comp this quarter. Beyond that the campaign's halo effect on the brand helped drive increased sales of bottled frappuccino across CPG channels for the first time in over two years.</p>
          <p>And beyond even that it ignited significant consumer and retailer interest and excitement that continues to build around our $2 billion frappuccino brand platform overall just as we had planned. The success of our customizable frappuccino campaign illustrates the power of Starbucks' new business model. A unique model that will continue to enable us to innovate, cross-promote and leverage our global retail footprint, our investment and prominence in social media and our growing global CPG business going forward.</p>
          <p>Another major brand investment we made in Q3 was around the expansion of Starbucks VIA into grocery. In the third quarter we launched VIA in grocery stores throughout the U.S. to leverage the excitement and accelerating sales momentum from our retail launch. We also announced that VIA would be available in grocery in both the U.K. and Japan in Q4. VIA is now projected to contribute over $100 million to Starbucks' top line in fiscal 2010, a significant achievement by any measure.</p>
          <p>To put VIA's performance in perspective, consider that less than 3% of all new products generate over $50 million in first year sales. VIA is performing like few consumer products ever have. And we are continuing to drive steady increases in VIA distribution; channel by channel, continent by continent, country by country. On June 29 we introduced our next VIA innovation, iced VIA into all U.S. and Canada stores and just last week into Japan. The early indications are that we have another fantastic product on our hands, generating excitement and response from our partners and customers alike.</p>
          <p>Once again, credit for our overall performance belongs to our partners around the world who continue to deliver an improved experience to our customers. Despite the demands of increased store traffic, every single customer metric showed improvement in Q3, continuing the trend that begun in 2008. To say that I'm incredibly proud of our partners and appreciative of their efforts is really a profound understatement. What I am is humbled by their unwavering commitment to our customers, our values, our company and our business. And to all our partners I give them a huge thank you.</p>
          <p>The continuing improvement in traffic and transaction metrics, increasingly improved customer satisfaction feedback and operating efficiency and transformative muscle we've built front and back of store operations over the last two and a half years gives us confidence we can accelerate our investments in innovation in new and existing businesses and generate disciplined, profitable growth around the world; while at the same time increasing our dividend and building long term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now I'll provide a recap of key initiatives for Starbucks' global retail business, CPG, and Seattle's Best Coffee. Then I'll turn the call over to Troy who will go into Q3 financials in greater detail and provide an initial outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S. business. The 9% U.S. comp store increase we recorded in Q3 returned Starbucks' store traffic to among the highest levels in our history. Strong top line performance combined with efficient management of our supply chain, operational excellence and cost discipline throughout the organization enabled us to deliver Q3 U.S. operating margins of 15.6% and strong Q3 bottom line profits.</p>
          <p>The deep connection we've established with our customers continues to be reflected in the growing success of My Starbucks Rewards; our loyalty program that recognizes and rewards customers paying for their purchases with a registered Starbucks card. The program, launched just over six months ago, was created in response to our customers' desire for value and recognition that built on their relationship with their store and their barista.</p>
          <p>In Q3, our My Starbucks Rewards program drove significant incremental business for us and in fact was cited in a recent customer survey as a top reason for increased visitation versus six months earlier. To give you some key performance metrics of the program, our customers are again on track to load over $1 billion on Starbucks cards this year. Sales of cards are up 17% over last year. And the reload on existing cards was up over 59% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Now almost 20% of all in-store transactions are now being paid for by using a Starbucks card. And in Q3 we surpassed 1 million Gold Level members. The Starbucks card and Reward programs are powerful catalysts for customer loyalty and retention. And will continue to enable us to leverage our scale, distinguish us with customers and further differentiate us from competitors going forward.</p>
          <p>As you know, Starbucks has built the largest private Wi-Fi network in America. And on July 1 we began offering customers free, unlimited one-click Wi-Fi at company operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. As we announced last month this fall in partnership with Yahoo! we will leverage our Wi-Fi asset and launch our own proprietary Starbucks Digital Network, an online experience that will offer customers in our U.S., company operated stores unrestricted access to exclusive content and previews, a collection of select sites and services, free downloads and local community news.</p>
          <p>In addition to generating incremental revenue, the Starbucks Digital Network provides us with a unique opportunity to drive traffic, further connect with our customers and distinguish Starbucks from competitors who simply offer commodity Wi-Fi access. We're very excited about this new innovation and will provide you with additional details around the Starbucks Digital Network in future earnings calls.</p>
          <p>Our research shows that both Starbucks and our customers are uniquely well suited to benefit from rapidly advancing mobile payment and mobile gifting technologies. In Q3 we took our initial step in offering these capabilities by launching our new mobile payment application, allowing customers at Starbucks stores in more than 1,000 Target stores and a small number of company operated stores in Seattle and Silicon Valley to pay for their purchases with their smartphones. We now believe that offering mobile payment and mobile gifting capabilities will result in a more efficient in-store experience and provide us with significant competitive advantages and further differentiate Starbucks from competitors. And based on early success and positive customer feedback we are committed to expanding this program in the months ahead. So please stay tuned.</p>
          <p>We're exploring new ways for customers to experience their neighborhood Starbucks as a late afternoon and evening destination. In prior quarters we've shared with you the efforts and insights gleaned from our innovative 15th Avenue Coffee &amp; Tea store and our Roy Street store. Last quarter we opened a fantastic new redesigned store on Spring Street in SoHo, New York to really tremendous customer response. And in the fall we will be reopening our Olive Way store in Seattle with an innovative new store environment and expanded menu of new premium food and wine and beer, changes we expect to drive more late afternoon and evening customer traffic.</p>
          <p>Turning to international. As I reported on our last calls, with our U.S. business moving in the right direction, over the last several quarters the leadership team and I began increasing our focus on our international business. Our efforts have included working to increase our connection to international customers, incorporating greater local relevance into operations around the world, and perhaps most importantly applying the learning and operational rigor and discipline we developed for the U.S. business to our international businesses.</p>
          <p>I'm now pleased to report that the positive impact of these efforts is beginning to show up in a very big way. Our Q3 international business revenue was up 15% over &#x2013; year-over-year. And our operating margins reached 10.3%, well ahead of the 2010 target we announced. In addition, Q3 international comp store sales reached 6%, driven by a 4% increase in traffic, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of positive traffic, and all key markets showed improvement.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter international results are a testament to strong leadership that John Culver, our President of Starbucks International and his leadership team are providing to our international markets, joint venture partnerships and our store partners all over the world. In the third quarter we launched Starbucks VIA in Starbucks stores in Japan to an absolutely incredible reception that I witnessed firsthand. Let me put that in perspective for you by sharing that two months into the retail launch of VIA in Japan we have far exceeded our internal sales targets &#x2013; for the entire year. VIA helped lift comps in Japan in positive territory and improve the trajectory of our retail business of Japan overall, providing further evidence of the success of our unique new business model I described earlier.</p>
          <p>With regard to China we continued to deliver strong results in China as the team delivered double-digit comps for the quarter and are on track to maintain that momentum and to deliver solid profitability this fiscal year. We continue to seek opportunities to deliver locally relevant product offerings throughout our international markets and are seeing positive customer response through our localization efforts.</p>
          <p>The creation of products like black sesame green tea frappuccino and black bean kiwi tart are product innovations tailored for the Chinese palate. And we introduced these in Q3 across all of our stores in Mainland China. We have learned over the years that sensitivity and familiarity with the Chinese culture is critical in how we think about and execute all aspects of our business in China. This learning has positioned us to grow our China business more aggressively, more successfully and more profitably in the years to come. Chinese consumers love Starbucks. And we see it every single day in our stores. And growing our presence and relevance in the Chinese market is a top priority for our organization and our leadership team.</p>
          <p>Moving to Western Europe, we are seeing steady and sustained improvement in our company owned U.K., Germany and France markets. We are particularly excited about the positive comps in Germany and France, two countries where we are working to improve the business model. Each of these markets is confronting economic challenges and soft consumer metrics. But our local teams are making great headway by developing new operating muscle. And John Culver is collaborating with Cliff Burrows, President of Starbucks U.S. to make sure that the learning and the insights gleaned from the transformation in our U.S. business is applied internationally.</p>
          <p>Through the end of Q3 we opened our first store in Hungary, bringing Starbucks to our 53rd country around the world. As I previously mentioned we continue to explore opportunities to enter India and Vietnam. As we move forward on the international front, we will strike a smart balance between opening new markets and building depth, solid fundamentals and sustained profitability in our existing markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Consumer Products Group. Starbucks CPG is a huge opportunity for our company. In Q3 we continued to invest and bring innovation to the packaged and instant coffee markets with multiple product, channel and market launches. A year ago we announced our intent to reinvent and bring innovation to the $23 billion global instant coffee market, a market that had incredibly enough not seen any innovation for over 50 years.</p>
          <p>A year later early results in each of the four countries and soon to be multiple channels in which we have launched has validated the correctness of that decision. The power of VIA and the opportunity that VIA represents. By leveraging our unique global retail footprint to create awareness and encourage direct sampling and purchase we have created a tailwind for the trade that has been validated and facilitated our entry into CPG channels. And once again we are creating real growth and excitement around an important, but stagnant global category.</p>
          <p>But the early success of VIA says much more. It demonstrates that the power and the trust of the Starbucks' brand, coupled with our proprietary retail system enables us to influence consumer behavior and create use occasions without cannibalization; one cup at a time and around the world, simultaneously.</p>
          <p>We always expected VIA to be a big hit at the office and on the go, but what we have been surprised by and very excited is that recent research shows that VIA is gaining momentum in at-home use occasions as a more flavorful alternative to other single serve options while requiring no equipment and with less waste. VIA was designed and always intended to be a portfolio of instant coffee products, and innovating around VIA and expanding the product line beyond the original Colombia and Italian SKUs and into new channels will remain priorities for us. Decaf VIA and VIA Iced represent the very beginning of VIA innovation pipeline. Rapid innovation will provide opportunities to further increase awareness and trial of VIA and broaden our VIA customer base. Incredibly enough, VIA is now available in over 37,000 points of distribution, as we told you on the last call it would be, and we plan to expand VIA into grocery in Japan and Canada as I've already stated.</p>
          <p>We are confident that VIA's already strong sales philosophy will accelerate as distribution moves more broadly in the channel and the VIA product line becomes even more accessible to customers over the coming months.</p>
          <p>Q3 also saw us introduce Fusions Natural flavored coffee into our CPG packaged coffee business and in the premium coffee category overall, continuing the trend we highlighted last quarter. In May, we appointed Jeff Hansberry to head up this business as President, Starbucks Global Consumer Products Group and Foodservice. Jeff comes to us with more than 20 years of deep, global consumer products experience, first with Procter &amp; Gamble and more recently with the Gallo Winery, where he led the transformation of Gallo's Asia business and most recently led Gallo's flagship popular business unit to record share gains. Jeff brings the expertise and leadership Starbucks needs to move our CPG business into high gear and introduce our brands and products into new and existing customer product markets around the world. Jeff will be reporting directly to me and I'm delighted to welcome him on to our team.</p>
          <p>Finally, the ability to combine the power of our brand, our global retail footprint and our connection to consumers all around the world &#x2013; both in-store and through social media in order to build and accelerate sales through CPG channels is muscle that is unique to Starbucks and muscle that we will increasingly leverage going forward. We believe that this unique power and the benefits of the investments we made this quarter will become increasingly evident in the months and quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>As an example, we view Seattle's Best Coffee as a billion dollar growth opportunity. Until recently, a customer could get a cup of freshly brewed Seattle's Best Coffee only at about 3,000 venues. By the end of this fiscal year we will increase that tenfold and have Seattle's Best Coffee available in 30,000 points of distribution. We are just scratching the surface on the opportunity for SBC to grow distribution and reach new customers.</p>
          <p>This quarter we made significant investments in Seattle's Best brand. In May, Michelle Gass, President of Seattle's Best unveiled a new brand direction and identity for the company. The new brand identity will play a key role in the strategy to make high quality, premium coffee far more accessible than ever before. The new brand transformation is being fueled by significant, high profile relationships including Subway, which has completed its network-wide rollout, AMC Theatres which is in the middle of launching across nearly 300 locations, and Burger King, which began rolling out our coffee earlier this month on the West Coast. Burger King will also distribute SBC in Canada where we're excited to announce the extension of our partnership just this month.</p>
          <p>And we are expanding our footprint into grocery with a more focused sell into the CPG channel. While it's early days for our efforts to transform Seattle's Best, our focus and intensity has never been greater and we look forward to strong continued momentum.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Starbucks has been recognized by many as the number one brand in social media, and as the first brand on Facebook to exceed 10 million fans. And in Q3 we invested further in building global awareness of our brand and our brand values, and in connecting with our customers around the world on issues that matter most to them. Let me share one example. On April 15, we initiated a global effort to encourage our customers to trade their paper cups in for an eco-friendly option by rewarding them with a complimentary cup of brewed coffee. The strong positive reaction from customers all around the world that this effort generated was reflected in both increased transaction and enhanced brand affinity metrics. The learning from, and success of our efforts to scale local efforts and make them relevant globally is a muscle that we will continue to develop and refine, and will become more apparent as we approach many of the initiatives around Starbucks' 40th anniversary celebration next spring.</p>
          <p>I want to close my remarks by stating once again how pleased I am with the strength of our overall business and the progress that we are making. The lessons and learning of the past several years continues to guide the entire Starbucks organization every single day. And I personally want to thank all of our partners, customers and shareholders for their belief in the company and for the part each has played in bringing Starbucks to where we are around the world today.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Troy who will go through Q3 results in more detail and share our targets for fiscal 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard indicated, this quarter's performance was exceptional on many fronts. In particular, we were able to generate strong traffic growth in both our U.S. and international segments despite a still uncertain environment for many retailers. U.S. traffic growth accelerated from last quarter, further illustrating that the steps we've taken and continue to take to enhance the store experience are resonating with our customers.</p>
          <p>Additionally this quarter, our international segment set a record for quarterly operating income and reached double-digit operating margin, a threshold we did not expect to reach until fiscal 2011. We also recorded the highest third quarter consolidated operating margin and the highest third quarter earnings in the company's 39-year history. We achieved this record performance even while making significant investments back into the business to support future growth. Today, I will provide additional details on our fiscal third quarter results including those investments. And then I will update you on our expectations for the fourth quarter as well as our initial outlook for fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Third quarter revenues were $2.6 billion; up 9% from $2.4 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was primarily driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales attributable to a 6% increase in traffic and a 3% increase in the average value per transaction. Both the overall comp and traffic growth were the strongest we have seen in more than four years.</p>
          <p>We reported consolidated operating income of $328 million in the third quarter including $20 million of restructuring charges. Most of the restructuring charges were related to stores that were previously closed in the U.S. where Starbucks has been unable to terminate the lease or find subtenants for the unused space. Because of the continued softness in the commercial real estate market, which has made it more difficult than originally anticipated to sublease these spaces, changes in assumptions underlying the related lease accruals have impacted the expense that must be recognized. Lease exit and other costs associated with store closures in our international segment also contributed to the restructuring charges. Excluding those charges, non-GAAP operating income was $348 million. This compares to third quarter of fiscal 2009 operating income of $204 million and non-GAAP operating income of $256 million.</p>
          <p>Consolidated operating margin was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 13.3% on a non-GAAP basis, which represented a 270 basis point improvement compared to last year. In line with recent quarters, comparable store sales growth combined with operational improvements are creating powerful flowthrough to operating income. As I noted earlier, the margin improvement this quarter was achieved while making significant investments back into the business to support future growth. In particular and in line with our outlook last quarter, we invested roughly $0.04 per share in incremental marketing compared to last year to support the launch of VIA into the U.S. CPG channel as well as the introduction of our new customizable frappuccino product in our North American retail stores. Earnings per share was $0.27 for the third quarter compared to $0.20 per share in last year's fiscal third quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.29 compared to non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 a year ago.</p>
          <p>I will now review the non-GAAP results from our operating segments beginning with the U.S. business. Total U.S. net revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, a 7% increase from a year ago. Company-operated U.S. retail revenues increased 7% to $1.7 billion for the quarter primarily due to a 9% increase in comp sales, offset in part by a reduction in the number of stores. The comp increase was driven by a 6% increase in traffic and a 3% increase in the average value per transaction.</p>
          <p>The 6% increase in transactions was the second straight quarter with positive year-over-year traffic, accelerating from a 3% increase in the second quarter. It also marks the first time in almost three years that the U.S. business has had positive traffic growth over a two year comp period. In a still difficult environment for many retailers, this performance speaks to the resiliency of our business and the success we've had in upgrading the customer experience in our stores. Innovative products and store designs, additional marketing support, and our loyalty program are among the factors contributing to the increase in customer visits.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with a successful mid-quarter launch of our customizable frappuccinos, which contributed roughly 2 points to the overall 9% comp growth for the quarter. Considering the decline we have seen in the blended beverage category in recent years, the reestablishment of growth this quarter is promising. We hope to continue this trend as we now offer something our competitors cannot: a high quality blended beverage that is fully customizable.</p>
          <p>My Starbucks Rewards, our new loyalty program launched six months ago, has been extremely successful. Card loads, redemptions, and percent of tender are all up significantly over last year, and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Perhaps most significant, we estimate that the new program drove between one and two points of the comp growth for the quarter net of discounts.</p>
          <p>With respect to the increase in the average value per transaction, the pricing architecture work we started in the fiscal fourth quarter of last year contributed roughly half of the 3% ticket growth with most of the remaining increase coming from mix shift to the new customized frappuccinos, VIA, and the continued roll-out of our warming program.</p>
          <p>U.S. cost of sales including occupancy was 38.1% of total revenues in the third quarter, a significant improvement of 260 basis points compared to the year ago period. Most of the improvement was the result of sales leverage, lower food costs from our redesigned food program, and other supply chain efficiencies. U.S. store operating expenses were 38.2% of total revenues, a 50 basis point improvement over last year. Sales, leverage, and lower impairments in the current quarter compared to last year were the primary reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by additional marketing expenses to support the customizable frappuccino launch, which accounts for roughly half of the $0.04 of incremental marketing I noted earlier.</p>
          <p>The continued application of lean principles in our store labor deployment has provided us with better leverage in our operating model. They are also contributing to record levels of customer satisfaction in our stores. Aspects of satisfaction such as feet of service and taste of beverage have benefited significantly from the work routines we've developed and continue to refine for our store partners. In addition, other current initiatives underway such as a new point of sales system and a new inventory management system will impact the way our store partners operate and will allow them to focus more time on providing great service to our customers.</p>
          <p>U.S. operating income was $308 million for the quarter, a 36% increase compared to last year. The operating margin improved 350 basis points to 16.5% of related revenues from 13.0% a year ago. This operating margin improvement is mostly attributable to the additional sales leverage created as a result of the work we've done to become more efficient.</p>
          <p>The U.S. segment is a healthy, highly profitable business with room for disciplined growth. It also provides the foundation from which we will fund growth opportunities in other channels and other geographies which brings me to the results of our international segment.</p>
          <p>International total net revenues increased 15% to $551 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, the acquisition of the France market at the beginning of the fiscal year and favorable foreign currency translation. The comp growth was driven by a 4% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Broad-based strength across all of our company operated markets contributed to the comp growth with Canada, the U.K. and China leading the way. In total our company operated markets are profitable and the trends are improving.</p>
          <p>Also, while it does not show up in the comp number, we saw strong top line performance across most of the portfolio of licensed markets. The encouraging results across all regions are evidence of the relevancy of the Starbucks brand and reinforce the opportunity that exists outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>International operating income was $60 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, a 55% increase compared to last year; and as I noted earlier a quarterly record for international. Operating margin improved by 280 basis points to 10.9%, reaching double digits two quarters ahead of our stated goal for fiscal 2011. Key drivers of the margin improvement include sales leverage and supply chain efficiency.</p>
          <p>We've continued to make significant progress toward our vision that China will eventually be our largest market outside of the U.S. Comp trends are in the double digits and store profit contribution is among the highest in the system. In terms of regional profitability we are at a point where we expect Greater China to progressively become a significant contributor to the operating income of the international segment. With the contribution in fiscal 2010 projected to be roughly double the contribution in fiscal 2009. All this bodes well for the future and reaffirms our belief in the China opportunity and the strength of the Starbucks brand in that region.</p>
          <p>The international segment is one of the key growth engines for Starbucks. Affinity for the Starbucks brand is high as evidenced by the continued top line strength we see across most of our markets. There is still a tremendous amount of work to do in order to fully capitalize on the global opportunity, and the complexities vary by region and by market. However, with increased management attention, encouraging progress recently and a multi-channel expansion strategy in key markets, we believe we're on track to reach our longer term goal of mid to high teens operating margin while at the same time significantly expanding the reach of the business.</p>
          <p>I'll now move on to the results from the global Consumer Products Group. CPG total net revenues increased 8% to $198 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily driven by the launch of VIA, increased sales into the packaged coffee channel and Seattle's Best foodservice sales. Operating income for the segment decreased 9% to $60 million for the quarter, and operating margin decreased 550 basis points to 30.4%. The margin decrease was primarily due to increased marketing expenses for VIA and for packaged coffee, partially offset by strength in our bottled frappuccino business.</p>
          <p>The launch of VIA this quarter into the CPG channel follows a successful launch at the beginning of the fiscal year into our North American retail stores. Much of the benefit from the additional marketing investment, roughly half of the $0.04 noted earlier, should materialize in future periods as we are currently establishing the product in the channel by driving distribution, placement, awareness and trial. Despite having limited distribution in the CPG channel for most of the fiscal year we are projecting to surpass $100 million in sales across all channels for this first year. The early success from this platform is encouraging and reinforces our belief that VIA will eventually be part of our portfolio of billion dollar brands.</p>
          <p>The increased marketing for packaged coffee seems to be paying dividends as Starbucks gained 180 basis points of market share in the third quarter compared to the year ago period. This continues a trend we started to see in February and March which were the first months that we experienced year-over-year market share gains in almost three years. The bottled frappuccino business benefited this quarter from increased marketing expenditures related to the customizable frappuccino in our store channel. This halo effect exhibits the power behind a consistent brand message across channels, something we've not done on a regular basis in the past but that is now part of how we leverage our size and diverse reach.</p>
          <p>The investments we made into the CPG segment this quarter and the resulting margin compression are in line with the outlook we provided on last quarter's earnings call. These investments are necessary to support the future growth of this highly profitable business as we continue to build on our coffee leadership down the grocery aisle.</p>
          <p>Starbucks continues to generate significant free cash flow as a result of the health of our business model. As a means of returning some of this cash back to shareholders, last quarter we paid the first dividend in the company's 39 year history, initiated at a quarterly rate of $0.10 per share and with a targeted payout ratio of 35 to 40%. Today we announced a 30% dividend increase to $0.13 a share payable in August.</p>
          <p>In addition, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of Starbucks stock during the third quarter leaving approximately 14 million shares still available for purchase under the current authorization. The increase in the dividend after only one quarter is a strong signal that the Board has confidence in the financial performance of the company and the amount of cash that we generate, beyond that which is needed to fund the many opportunities that lie ahead. We view both the dividend and the share repurchase program as part of a broad approach to generating strong shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>We entered fiscal 2010 cautiously optimistic based on the trends we were starting to see in our business, but acutely aware of the tenuous external environment. As the year has progressed, the momentum of the business surpassed our expectations driven by stronger traffic into our stores.</p>
          <p>Now with a return to growth, and with three quarters of the fiscal year behind us, I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on how we expect the year to close out. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.23, slightly above the range I provided last quarter. This estimate includes approximately $0.05 from the addition of a 53rd week, which will hit in the fourth quarter, and excludes roughly $0.04 for restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>In addition to the earnings outlook, we expect mid-single digit revenue and comp growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year on a 52-week basis. Full year non-GAAP operating margins for both the U.S. and international segments are now expected to finish near the high end of the ranges I provided last quarter, which are 15 to 17% for the U.S. and 8 to 10% for international. Operating margins for the CPG segment are still expected to finish near 35% for the year. The result is an expected non-GAAP consolidated operating margin near the high end of the 12 to 13% range previously communicated.</p>
          <p>The operating margin outlook includes approximately $0.02 of incremental marketing in the fourth quarter compared to fiscal 2009. Most of this increase is to support the expansion of VIA in the CPG channel. Also, higher dairy costs are expected to impact fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.01. We now expect to add roughly 250 net new stores this year, and capital expenditures are now expected to come in at roughly $450 million for the year.</p>
          <p>I will now provide you with a high level initial look at several fiscal 2011 targets. As a reminder, we are still early in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, and we're still working through our plans for 2011. That work will better inform us on many of the underlying details for the year which may allow us to share more information on next quarter's earnings call.</p>
          <p>We expect mid to high single digit growth revenue growths for the year, driven by low to mid-single digit comp growth. Our comp trends have improved dramatically throughout this fiscal year, driven in part by the actions we've taken to improve the customer experience and also by perhaps a slightly better economic environment. As we move into fiscal 2011, we expect these trends to moderate as the comparisons become more difficult. Also, while the external environment may be slightly better than a year ago, we still recognize the challenges that exist in the current economy with high unemployment, a questionable housing market and unstable consumer confidence. We plan to add approximately 500 net new stores globally, with roughly 100 in the U.S. and 400 in international. The majority of the new additions in both segments are expected to be licensed stores.</p>
          <p>We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 500 million to $550 million for fiscal 2011. Full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement is expected to be 100 to 150 basis points in the U.S. segment and 100 to 200 basis points in the international segment. CPG operating margins are expected to be in the range of 30 to 35%; slightly lower than this year primarily different by increased investment to support the ongoing VIA rollout. Consolidated operating margin is expected to improve by 50 to 100 basis points over 2010. We expect fiscal 2011 earnings per share to be $1.36 to $1.41, or 15 to 20% growth on fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the benefit in 2010 from the 53rd week.</p>
          <p>We do not anticipate any restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 as the previously announced store closure program will largely be completed by the end of fiscal 2010. Any remaining costs beyond 2010 associated with this program will fall into continuing operations.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight a few items that are embedded in our earnings targets. First, VIA is expected to contribute modestly to fiscal 2011 earnings as we continue to build this important growth opportunity. We will continue to innovate on this platform and add points of distribution while investing in marketing and infrastructure to support the business.</p>
          <p>Next we expect to absorb approximately $0.04 in additional commodity costs for fiscal 2011 primarily related to higher coffee prices. Recent supply issues in the Latin American growing region have caused C market prices for Arabica coffees to increase.</p>
          <p>While the prices we pay for coffee do not move in tandem with the C market due to many variables, including the timing of our purchases, significant long-term movements in the market do influence our costs over time. According to various industry sources, including the International Coffee Organization, global coffee output is expected to rise next year led by gains in Brazil. It is believed that these increases in output should mostly offset current shortages, putting downward pressure on prices longer term. However, the current price inflation does pressure a portion of our supply for fiscal 2011, which is reflected in the estimated $0.04 per share impact.</p>
          <p>Lastly in terms of marketing, we expect to spend at roughly the same rate as fiscal 2010, which is approximately 2.5% of total net revenues. It is worth noting that the level of marketing spend in past years has been much lower, including 1.7% in fiscal 2009. These run rates include marketing expenses that we record directly such as those that are in our store channel plus marketing expenses that are recorded indirectly through shared profit models such as our packaged coffee business. We believe the increased level of marketing this year has helped drive incremental business and we will continue to invest in this area. Our one-voice approach to communicating a consistent message across multiple channels allows us to leverage our size and diverse business model to drive brand awareness.</p>
          <p>In closing, the third quarter continues to build on the momentum we have had in the business for well over a year. This quarter is a powerful demonstration of our ability to produce record earnings and record operating margins, while also making record levels of investment into future growth opportunities. In the U.S. customer satisfaction is at an all time high. Traffic growth is robust and the store portfolio is healthy. We have elevated the store experience to a place that other large competitors could not easily duplicate.</p>
          <p>Internationally, the business has progressed to what we expect will be sustainable double digit operating margins earlier than expected as we rollout key learnings from the U.S. and start to gain traction from their success. We are expanding that business in a focused, disciplined manner as we see the enormous long term opportunity and understand that we must execute well in order to fully capitalize on its potential.</p>
          <p>Outside the store channel we are aggressively diversifying our business and pursuing a greater share of coffee consumption by taking our great products to consumers in more places than ever before. We are backed by a solid balance sheet and strong cash flow, an experienced management team and a powerful, highly relevant brand. We believe that we now play from a position of strength and we have a unique opportunity to build the kind of company that has not existed before. One that coalesces the powerful combination of a large retail footprint, a significant consumer products presence and a highly engaged customer base.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. My question relates to both your international margin goals over the next couple of years and unit growth. Can you, Troy &#x2013; or can you get to those mid to high teen operating margins that you expect internationally simply by doing some of the things you're doing now? Which is to say, improving the operations of international. Or does it require &#x2013; how much of it requires &#x2013; is required in scaling those markets? That's number one. And when do you think you will start developing company store units again internationally? Is there a margin threshold you'd like to see first before doing that? Or is there some other gating factor to international company development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me speak first to the operating margin internationally. And over time we expect to grow toward that long term target as we talked about, mid to high teens internationally by virtue of a few things. One is what we spoke about this quarter. And we really began to see the benefit of it this quarter, which is applying many of the same lessons within the four walls that we've brought to bear in the U.S. in the past year or two and bringing those to bear outside of the U.S. Lean initiatives, innovation within the store, improving customer satisfaction, the loyalty program; a number or things that have been so successful for us here are extremely relevant in many markets outside of the U.S. We're seeing the benefits of that now and we'll continue to apply those in the years ahead to be part of that march toward the mid to upper teens.</p>
          <p>We also expect to add stores and add revenues and scale will help us both develop a consumer proposition and strengthen the brand exposure that we have in these markets around the world. And it will also provide scale and leverage on our G&amp;A structure that we have outside of the U.S. which is clearly built now and invested ahead of the curve for the larger business that we see in our future. So it's really those same number of things along with innovation in the business and expansion outside of our store internationally into CPG channels just as we've done in the U.S. It's all those things together that will help us really drive our scale, our reach and our operating margin targets outside of the U.S. And your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about company-owned stores, Troy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Our plans for company-owned stores internationally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have always had a shared ownership model outside of the U.S. As you know we're roughly 70% of our stores are licensed, the rest approximately are company operated and over time I would expect that same ratio to apply. We will invest and build in deep markets where we can bring to bear the capabilities that we have in places like Canada and the U.K. as an example. And then we will license other markets where we're able to significantly take advantage of very strong local operating partners who bring their capabilities to the table to help us grow the business locally.</p>
          <p>So I would expect us to grow in a similar ratio over time; not particularly in any one quarter but over the longer run I would think that we will operate in a mixed model outside of the U.S. In China, a market that you've heard us talk a great deal about and we're very excited about, we have a mixed structure in China as well where we operate an owned model that we are very pleased with and we're seeing great unit economics from. And we have licensed in JV markets for part of that country which really allows us the best of both, leveraging other's capabilities and also making sure that we can drive the brand, drive the business and enjoy the profitability that we see in the future.</p>
          <p>And I might add before the next question just one correction perhaps from my comments earlier. The revenue increase for the company was driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales in the quarter which is driven by a 6% increase in traffic. I perhaps misspoke by saying 6% comp growth but it was a 9% comp growth in the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. One question on VIA. Fiscal 3Q &#x2013; and you can correct me if I'm wrong &#x2013; was the inventory loading quarter for VIA for substantially all of the retail channel. So we would have expected to see more of a spike in CPG revenue growth and then perhaps a dip down in revenue in the coming quarters after of course you had that loading quarter. But perhaps there's something we're not seeing such as slotting fees or other promotion payments that are effectively more one-time in nature that were an offset to net revenue in that quarter. So how should we think about that VIA in the coming quarters and the contribution to profit and revenue? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll take that. In the quarter, VIA distribution was building as we went throughout the quarter and will continue to build as we move through Q4 and for some time. So it's definitely not a case where we launch and we're immediately at the levels of distribution that we will be at maturity or that we even will be in three months from now or six months from now.</p>
          <p>So as we moved throughout the quarter, we built distribution and that's why the load into the pipeline and the revenues you see and the impact on the CPG business was not perhaps as big in the third quarter as you might have expected. But rest assured, the rollout continues; distribution will build as we move into the fourth quarter. We're very pleased by the velocity gains that we're seeing in our key customers. So as we build distribution, as we drive velocity; all those things lead us to be as optimistic about VIA as you've heard us speak to.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. We've continued to focus on the quality of our food program and introducing healthier options be it beverage or be it food. We've had a great reaction from our, certainly our most loyal customers have responded well because with our digital channels now we're able to get immediate reaction. We've used things like free pastry days to introduce those products to a wider audience, and so we've seen it grow, and there's definitely a trend towards healthier products.</p>
          <p>To do with calorie introduction, both again on the menu boards, we have seen a great dialogue, which ultimately has led to a much more informed choice. We haven't seen it materially change the overall numbers of the store, but we have seen people welcoming the choice we're giving them and the informed choice they're making.</p>
          <p>I think one of the exciting developments is the customized frappuccino. For a very long time, we have been restricted in the options and we have been unable to offer the customization that people have enjoyed in the hot beverages. And in recent, really in the last quarter, we have seen this introduction where we've been able to introduce no-fat options on the milk and also soy options, which has extended the reach of our products to new audiences or to people with specific dietary requirements. So we see this as very relevant for us, very relevant for our customers, and we will continue to support it going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping perhaps you could touch on the remodeling program. I think you had talked about that a little bit in the U.S. last quarter and what the plans are for that.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, I think the headline that I'd like to just start out with is that over the course of the past year, as you know, we've opened a number of stores domestically and around the world that are consistent with the array of new palates that we've established, some of whom you might see, have seen, and SoHo is a great example of that.</p>
          <p>But from Japan to Hong Kong, to Paris Disney, and in the U.S., and now in the U.K., we've opened up these new stores and every single one of them have been met with great enthusiasm from customers. We then took the elements of those new stores and Arthur Rubinfeld and his team along with Cliff and his operations team are incorporating the elements of that new design into all remodels. And we will remodel more stores obviously than we open next year but, Cliff, if you can talk about it in specificity with the numbers and also the results that we're seeing from some of the things that have gone on already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Howard. And thanks, Sharon. Howard's absolutely right in terms of learning from some of the work we've done here in Seattle. I think one of the most significant changes was the one highlighted earlier, which is Spring Street in SoHo where we really have transformed the environment in that store, and we've invested for the long term. It is now a location to be incredibly proud of. It's somewhere that is very relevant for its environment in downtown SoHo.</p>
          <p>And also we are seeing improved sales from both our ability to serve customers more quickly and extend the range of products, be they food, in that case with an access to self-serve and in terms of the range of products with the introduction of Clover into that store. And all of those elements have helped to I think re-establish our relevance in the New York market, and we have seen growth well above our 9% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We are touching some stores in a major way, and those are generally our 10-year renovations and we are being strategic in the markets that we are going after more aggressively, and in some cases are accelerating those renovations. The strategic cities are quite obvious, they are the larger metropolitan areas of the U.S., and I would include New York, San Francisco, LA in that, and as we go forward into 2011 we'll continue that.</p>
          <p>And we are talking, we have touched approximately 100 stores in 2010; and roughly half of those in some significant way and half of those in a minor way. And we are using the palates that have been developed. We're also using relevant local materials and we're focused they're not only certified for all the stores in major renovations or indeed, with new openings to make those stores applicable for all our ambitions around the environment.</p>
          <p>So very pleased with the investments we've made. We continue to learn and evolve. And we will see ourselves doing about the same number of renovations as we go forward in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, I just wanted to add one thing, and that is we've established very strict financial disciplines in terms of the ROI on new stores. And we've had a very good year this fiscal year and we're applying that same discipline to the remodels Cliff alluded to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, if I may to correct, it's 1,000 stores that we will touch in the U.S. in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Sharon, to the last part of your question about China. China has among our highest unit economics of anywhere in the world. Great growing brand in the market, excellent return on investment at the store level. So we have a tremendous appetite to grow in that market, both in terms of growing our company owned markets and we have company owned businesses throughout much of China. And also working with our joint venture partners to accelerate the pace of their growth in the market. So you'll see us growing, both company owned and likely JV markets as we continue here in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just have one clarification and then a question. Just as far as I want to understand your commodity cost outlook primarily to coffee, should we assume you're looking at today's prices holding steady and not as though you lock those in, but if there's any sort of easement there would be a change or that's sort of a moving number, and you're just taking today's levels.</p>
          <p>And then my question also, is more so with respect to follow-on to David's, with regards to your, the rollout of VIA into the non-Starbucks retail stores but into the grocery. Can you provide some milestones where you think full penetration sort of mirroring the number of outlets that you have whole bean available and when will we see sort of approaching numbers close to over, a lot of overlap with your whole bean points of distribution and hitting mass grocery.</p>
          <p>If I look at that 37,000 number I'm still assuming that's got to, that's obviously more than a half of those, no, well, maybe at least more than a third of those are Starbucks stores on a global basis. So I just was curious where wiping out the, your store base of company owned, where you stand as far as the grocery distribution, now, at the end of the year, and then maybe at the end of '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Troy, why don't you take the commodity costs and we'll give Jeff the VIA question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll do that. Matt, on coffee prices, no you should not assume that we're just looking at today's commodity price and extending it forward. We are basing our projections and the $0.04 per share impact in '11 that I mentioned is based on what we understand of our coffee needs, our buying, the holes in the inventory that we need to fill as we progress throughout the year and what we see coming in prices.</p>
          <p>So it's based on that, it's not as a simple as taking today's price and extending it forward. So there is some room for that to change and go as we go through the year. And I think one point I'd make is that we have always maintained a fairly flexible buying pattern with coffee that allows us to be in the market when we need to and with prices that can be fixed contracts, fix them at various times. So we'll also use how far out we go and when we fix prices to afford us as much flexibility as we can as we approach the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So specifically on VIA if you break apart the 37,000 points of distribution today, 25,000 of those points of distribution are food, drug, mass in the U.S. And as we approach the end of our fiscal year we should approach 30,000 points of distribution. And I would expect that we will get to going at the end of fiscal '11 approaching 35,000 outlets. If you take a look at our roast and ground business today on an ACV basis we're in about 92% of the ACV of U.S. food drug mass. I would expect by the end of '11 we would be at that same kind of level, at about 35,000 outlets across food drug mass and also club.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a quick question on SBC. So we've reached 30,000 points of distribution, we're going to gain Taco Bell units next year. Beyond that, how much more opportunity do you see? Is there a C store opportunity? Is there a greater packaged good opportunity through a single serve option there? If you could give us a sense of the incremental opportunity beyond what we've already reached for SBC that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think Michelle Gass, the President of SBC is in the room, so Michelle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Keith. Thanks for the question. We absolutely see tremendous potential with the SBC in all the channels that you just cited. Just to clarify, we are in fact are in a test with Taco Bell, that has not been committed as of yet. But we're highly encouraged by the results we're seeing. But that said, the chief strategy for Seattle's Best is about making premium coffee far more accessible than it ever has been. And so we look forward to expanding it in multiple points of distribution, in C stores as you mentioned &#x2013; in family, casual dining, QSR that we've been talking about, and certainly a reinvention down the aisle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michelle can you frame how many points of distribution there are out there that potentially is applicable? I'm not saying we would get those accounts, but the total number accessible to SBC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you frame the entire market across channels just taking dining and C stores for example, there are hundreds of thousands of points of distribution where coffee is being served today in a range of premium states, I'll say from commodity to premium. And we see many of those points accessible for the future of Seattle's Best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I want to make a clarification, or just make it clear that we are going to extend SBC to ubiquitous points of distribution that the Starbucks brand has never lived in, and obviously is not compatible with. And there lies the opportunity to place SBC in places that we previously could not with the Starbucks brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Howard, I'll add just one final build. If you take the brewed coffee category in the U.S. alone, Starbucks today commands just 4% of that market. So there's clearly a lot of room for both of these brands to be highly complementary in the coffee category.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask also about the CPG business because I think, and maybe this has changed, at one point I thought there was a view maybe that it could grow on an annualized basis closer to the mid-teens. So I wanted to say first all, is that the case, like a longer-term view? And if so, what kind of drivers are there? And what does that imply about the returns on the advertising spend that you're making now? Because across the business you've put up some very impressive top line, but we're seeing a lot of reinvestment. So I guess I'm just trying to gauge, what kind of growth, where it would come from and what the ramp would look like.</p>
          <p>And as a related question, VIA I think contributed a little bit less to comps this quarter than it did -than it has in the past couple quarters. So is that &#x2013; is there sort of a natural fade to adoption or is there &#x2013; is that just because now you have it in a lot more points of distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sara, I'll respond to that. First on the VIA question on comps. You know it was actually pretty close to a similar contribution to the total comp number this quarter as it had been in previous quarters. So very comparable, very similar kind of impact. What we're seeing with VIA is just a very sustained result in our stores even as we've expanded distribution and as we've built that business out. So we would expect that to continue and that's not going to be different this quarter from previous quarters.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of CPG long-term. We've not put out there long-term growth targets but what we have said very clearly and still are very optimistic and confident in is that over the long run we would expect CPG to grow more rapidly than our other businesses in the store. That's not necessarily what would happen in Q3 or Q4 of this year. But over the long run as we build out our capabilities in this space, as we expand things like VIA, as we continue to innovate down the aisle, as we go back and support our long-standing packaged coffee business down the aisle by investing against it and innovating against it we would expect over time CPG to becoming a more significant contributor to the revenue mix and the operating income mix in the company.</p>
          <p>So we do expect that to build, but I would just suggest that that's a build that happens over a period of time not quickly overnight as we really build out these capabilities and the infrastructure, the product portfolio and the innovation to go after what we see as just a tremendous growth opportunity in the long run.</p>

          <p>Annie, do you want to take a shot at talking about the advertising and leveraging the CPG opportunity across the retail business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Thanks, Howard. One of the things that we had talked about is the strong business model that we have and leveraging this one voice. When we advertise VIA we get the benefit not only in our CPG channel but also in our retail channels. We have been extraordinarily pleased at the household penetration and the awareness that we're building. But more importantly the repeat has been just astronomical, 2X of industry average on repeat for VIA.</p>
          <p>And I think Troy alluded to this earlier. We're building this brand to be a single cup solution for our consumers. In the U.S. 50% of the consumption is happening in the home, 25% at work. And when you look outside the U.S. in countries like Japan that we recently launched over 60% is actually in-home consumption. It's extraordinarily complimentary to our whole bean business and to our retail business in our stores.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Hi. Thanks. A question on the cash that you have on hand on the balance sheet, cash to investments if you could remind us that number. And also the free cash that you're going to generate next year, just wanted to have a sense of a couple things. Why, I guess I think we talked about this, why China couldn't even be faster. But even coming back to the U.S. business it seems like your new store returns are as good as they've been in years, why we don't push the throttle a little bit in terms of new store development given your comps and the talent that's coming out of your overall store structure especially given record guest satisfaction scores, so that's the first point.</p>
          <p>And then secondly again given that cash on hand and the free cash generation I was curious how much stock buyback if any you had in your guidance for fiscal '11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Troy, why don't you start with the response on cash, and then maybe Cliff and I can talk about store growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, will do. In terms of cash you're right, our business produces a tremendous amount of cash. I want to be clear there is no constraint whatsoever to our growth whether it be in stores or otherwise based on the cash we have on hand much less availability should we need it. So we have a very, very strong cash producing business, strong cash on hand, free cash flow this year, 2010, that will reach probably in the range of $1.2 billion based on operating cash flow of about $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>And as I look at 2011 based on the significantly growing earnings model that we've put in our initial outlook I would expect those numbers to be at least that level or higher as we move forward. So very, very strong cash generation that we are prepared to invest in all of the high returning opportunities we have for our business both in China as we build those capabilities, to your question, and we build out the consumer proposition and into our U.S. store business as that opportunity presents itself. And with that perhaps Cliff might speak to the stores in the U.S. in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just, John, about the U.S. we are very, very conscious and holding ourselves in a very disciplined way as to how we approach growth. We have been focused on leveraging the opportunity within the four walls of our existing portfolio and we have started to add a selected number of new stores in markets where the economy allows us to do.</p>
          <p>Going forward we are looking at and starting to develop plans around how do we grow in the U.S. complementing our existing stores, leveraging the learnings that we've had from the renovations and the new palates and also looking at building the capability in a different way so as we do not get distracted from our core business. And I could talk about that from both a store development perspective acquiring, designing and opening those stores or indeed a retail side to make sure my field team are not focused just on growth. So I think it's disciplined growth. We see opportunity in the licensed environment as well as the company operating environment here in the U.S. And I think the focus has been on existing, on cleaning the portfolio and going forward you will see us talk more about growth in the coming quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions broadly to size up CPG. A fair amount of attention has been paid to VIA and Seattle's Best. I know you said on VIA that, I think you said 100 million top line in fiscal '10. I'm just wondering whether we can discuss the ramp up you expect one, from sales from VIA and Seattle's Best in '11 and beyond. And not just sales but if we can get any kind of insight in terms of margins either for either product line or channels or relative to traditional CPG. Just trying to size up those two in terms of both sales and profitability contribution over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering separately how you measure the cannibalization. I think you said there's been absolutely none from VIA. So how you measure cannibalization to Starbucks retail from either VIA or Seattle's Best just to assess what kind of impact it's having to your core business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the latter and then, Troy, I'll give it back to you on the issue of CPG growth and profit margins. I think before we even sold one box of VIA we had assumed that there would be modest cannibalization to our existing whole bean and ground business in our stores. Once we rolled that out at retail the encouraging news was that there was no cannibalization, it was just de minimus at best. That this was a new use occasion and new behavior. And that has certainly continued. So we don't believe that we're going to see any significant attrition from our core customers as it relates to VIA. And the innovation and the pipeline of innovation with regard to VIA will be highly complementary to what I've just described.</p>
          <p>With regard to SBC, as Michelle said with such a small single digit percentage of total brewed coffee in America despite the success of the Starbucks brand, we're going to reach thousands of new customers as a result of SBC's distribution that never would have had access to Starbucks in the channels that it's going to be in. So we're going to aggressively grow and build both VIA and SBC in ways that we do not believe at this point will have any negative effect on Starbucks' core retail business or cannibalize Starbucks in grocery.</p>
          <p>With regard to CPG overall I think you can sense that we believe that we have a very unique opportunity to build a very significant business outside of our retail stores that's complementary, that gives us another leg to the stool. And we're just getting started. It's very hard at this point to predict the size of these brands and the margins of these brands. But suffice it to say that going in we believe that SBC and VIA are billion dollar opportunities that we're committed to.</p>
          <p>With regard to VIA we've said publicly already that those &#x2013; the operating &#x2013; the cost of goods and the margin of VIA is analogous to our core coffee business. And we believe these are just the early stages of our ability and capability to build a complementary business and do it in a way that no single retailer or no single CPG company has been able to do before. Especially when you link it to the competency and the discipline that we've created and invested in around social media to be able to engage our customers in a way to lower our cost of advertising. And I think we're just getting started and are very, very excited about the initial results. Troy, you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will. I think I might just add to one piece you said, Howard, which is also to mention that the innovation we're doing around VIA, most recently VIA Iced has also similarly very incremental. And it's something that adds to our business and &#x2013; rather than cannibalizes. So even the existing current product lines and new innovation we have coming we think simply gives us a chance to grab more coffee consumption and more coffee occasions over time.</p>
          <p>And then with respect to targets, we don't have revenue targets for either SBC or VIA to provide to you at this stage of the game. Perhaps as we get deeper, as we get into 2011 and a bit deeper into the build of both of those businesses that we'll have a little bit more to speak about. But just remember those are our new focus areas that are growing tremendously, that we are investing behind and we would expect to build and grow as we move through 2011.</p>
          <p>And with respect to profitability, SBC we believe is a complementary margin structure to our overall business. We will build capabilities and invest and grow that over time and would expect it to be a good contributor to revenues, to profits and again complementary to the margin structure of the company.</p>
          <p>And then VIA also as Howard mentioned, very complementary to our product margins in our stores when we sell through the store channel, and a very good, healthy margin structure as we sell down the CPG aisle as well. Recognizing just as we did in the third quarter that given the long term opportunity of VIA we will spend against it. We'll spend against it with infrastructure and we'll spend against it with advertising and marketing to build that consumer awareness, to drive trial and to drive repeat. And so we'll continue building profitability and growing that business and growing trial and spending against it to drive that over certainly the fourth quarter and through 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for staying with me. My question again going back to the very initial question on the international profit margin improvement and potential, how much of that can you realize by applying the four wall lessons of the U.S.? And how much of it is related to the infrastructure that you put in place for licensed businesses around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Troy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, what I would say is both of those things are important pieces of the margin improvement. And I won't give you &#x2013; I won't be as satisfying to you probably as giving you a specific breakout of each. But there's no question that the profit improvement that we've driven through our U.S. stores in the past 12 months, and you've seen it very clearly show up in our financial results, we believe there is tremendous numbers of points of percentage point margin improvement that can come over time as we apply the pricing architecture work, as we apply the lean store principles in store around the world outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>So certainly an important contributor to that margin improvement both in 2011 in the targets that we've put out for next year and beyond, I would expect will come from those kinds of efficiencies. As well as supply chain efficiencies and procurement efficiencies and all the things that we have perfected much more significantly in the U.S. and are rapidly applying those things where they're appropriate outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>And then to your second question, leveraging the infrastructure we have in place is also no question a part of that equation. We have a significant, very important investment in our infrastructure capability outside of the U.S. And it's bigger and more capable today than our business is today. And the message there is that we have our sights set on growing a very significant, large international business. We have not hesitated to build the structure outside of the U.S. that we need to capture that and to grow that. That structure is largely in place. And I would expect going forward that as we add stores, as we grow revenues, as we add new channels of distribution outside of the store that you will see us fairly consistently now over time leverage that G&amp;A structure as just one piece of the margin improvement outside of the U.S.</p>
