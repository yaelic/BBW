          <p>Welcome to the Full Year 2008 Results Presentation for ANZ. For any of you I haven't met I'm Jill Craig, the Head of Investor Relations. I have with me today Mike Smith, the CEO, and Peter Marriott, the CFO.</p>
          <p>We'll present for about 30 minutes and then hand over for Q&amp;A. Mike?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks Jill, and good morning everybody and welcome. I'm going to open by giving you some observations on the current economic environment and some broad comments on our results and how ANZ is placed. Peter will then go through the results in more detail. In addition to Peter and I, we have a number of the members of the Management Board here in Sydney and on the conference call to respond to any queries or questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Turning to the environment, at our first earnings update in February, I used the words Armageddon and Bloodbath to describe the situation facing the world's financial systems. I think those comments raised a few eyebrows at the time but if you were a bank in the US or Europe you might very easily think that Armageddon happened. In Australia things are very different. First, while we expect the developed economies of the world will only grow at about 0.7% in 2009, our region, Asia, is likely to grow at almost 7% next year. With Australia we're expected to grow at about 1.8%. That's almost three times the average of other developed economies.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there is no way Australia can avoid all of the adverse impacts of that of what is happening in the rest of the world but Australia is better placed than most countries to deal with the deteriorating global environment. While we expect that growth will significantly slow we are unlikely to see a recession in this country. Second, right now there are only 14 banks left in the world which are AA credit rated. ANZ is one of those along with the three other major Australian banks. One of the reasons for that is that commercial banks have very different balance sheets to investment banks and Australian banks have very different funding models and credit underwriting standards than say the US banks.</p>
          <p>While the Australian government has chosen to guarantee deposits and term funding for banks, and I think the coordinated action in Australia has been very positive for the economy, there have been no bailouts to support Australian banks, as we've seen in the northern hemisphere. So in what is now an unprecedented global financial crisis ANZ's solid underlying result shows the strength of the Australian and New Zealand banking system and it highlights ANZ's ability to weather an extremely challenging part of the cycle.</p>
          <p>When I joined ANZ in October 2007, which was a very long year ago, it was clear things needed to change and we needed to put the Bank on a new footing. As well as internal change it was apparent there was a new reality in financial markets and because we saw it coming we were able to take action to prepare ourselves for that new reality. We increased capital. We strengthened the balance sheet and we significantly improved liquidity. We systematically tackled a number of deficiencies that we identified in processes and controls, particularly within the Institutional Bank.</p>
          <p>We began to change key people to build banking experience and we created a new business model to simplify the Bank to lift customer focus and to start the process of driving strategic cost reduction and performance improvement. And most importantly we have addressed what I believe to be one of the fundamental problems in banking today, that the world got to a point after so many years of economic growth that there were more banks than bankers and so we've upped the ante and we've built a strong management team of bankers with over 250 years of banking experience on our Management Board.</p>
          <p>Now some of you may think I'm a little old fashioned in this view but having been through my fair share of financial crisis over the last 30 years, I'm absolutely convinced there is no substitute for bankers with experience of good times and of bad and the experience to understand and see a crisis through to the end. The result is that, although this has been a tough year, ANZ is now in a much stronger footing than it was a year ago and because of that we are open for business.</p>
          <p>As you can see from our numbers, our underlying business is performing very well with deposits up 21% year-on-year and lending up 16%. Our 2008 high level numbers are largely, as we flagged to you at the time of the trading update in July, and they are generally in line with market expectations with no new surprises. High level of provisions or cash profits, down 23% to $3 billion. From the historic lows in provisioning we saw in 2007 we've had to absorb an increase in provisioning of $1.4 billion to a total of 1.9 billion. Underlying revenue was up by 11% but was hit by the accounting treatment related to credit impairment on derivatives, although we expect those to substantially reverse over time. Whilst not insignificant, these issues are manageable.</p>
          <p>Costs grew faster on the back of growth in Asia. There was cost for remedial work in the Institutional business and the full year effect to prior year investment in the Personal bank. Anticipating a period of softer economic growth, we have already moving to accelerate our productivity agenda and to reenergize a tough on cost culture within ANZ. Credit growth slowed noticeably across the sector in the second half and we will see growth in 2009, although at lower levels. The bottom line is that we have been able to maintain the dividend at $0.136 per share for this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to our businesses, Personal had an excellent performance and is one of Australia's best performing retail banks. Asia Pacific also performed very strongly taking full advantage of the growth opportunities available in the region. New Zealand improved market share during the year with gains in most business segments. The second half of the year was challenging with the impacts of a slowing economy, which started to flow through to margins, funding costs and provisions.</p>
          <p>In Institutional there were good performances from working capital from business banking and from global markets, which was pleasing. However, there were some past issues together with the challenging business environment, which impacted overall results and I don't want to underplay this. Provisions, in particular individual provisions, are high and while we'll &#x2013; we will substantially write back our CDS exposures, what's disappointing is that those exposures came from business which was not related to our core customer franchise.</p>
          <p>Added to this there were some situations that we have needed to manage. For example, securities lending, that has not been easy or particularly pleasant. But in recent months there has been a great deal of work undertaken to create a strategy for Institutional to put a new leadership in place and to tighten the management of risk. Together these actions will strengthen Institutional's core customer franchise, its business performance and position it for the new reality we're all facing. And I want to be realistic here. We've had the drains up on every aspect of this business. It's clear we still have another two years of work to get through the remedial actions and to rebuild momentum.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital, our tier one capital ratio now sits at 7.7% comparing well against global and domestic peers. If we were to use the UK FSA methodology this would equate to a tier one ratio of 10% or using the Canadian OSFI methodology it would equate to a tier one ratio of 10.7%. We've been proactive throughout the year to undertake a series of initiatives including hybrid raisings and to further strengthen the ratio we will be underwriting the final 2008 DRP.</p>
          <p>So in what has become an unprecedented global financial crisis we've maintained our dividend for shareholders. We have provided security and confidence for our customers and we have continued to work hard to meet community expectations with responsible, sustainable banking practice. This includes the start recently delivering on a promise to start passing on rate cuts as global conditions ease.</p>
          <p>Now I believe it will take another two to three years for the world to work through the current financial situation and its economic impact. We are going to continue to position ANZ for the best advantage during this time and draw on the experience we have of managing through such times. So we've born the brunt of the financial markets turmoil. This much can be seen from our numbers but I think the underlying results speak to both the strength of the Australian banking system and ANZ's ability to weather an extremely challenging year.</p>
          <p>Now let me pass you onto Peter to explain in more detail the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mike, and what I would like to do is to first of all take you through a series of the key issues, which have probably attracted your attention in going through the results so you can understand some of the things that have driven the outcomes for this year.</p>
          <p>First of all, I think when we last spoke at the trading update we said we were expecting profit, the cash profit, of above $3 billion. The final number here I think is probably a little bit less above $3 billion of what we had expected and when you go through and analyze why that has arisen it's really focused around further mark-to-market charges to the profit from the credit intermediation trades. You'll of course all appreciate and probably are not surprised about that given the volatility in the debt markets and the equity markets leading up to 30, September. And so that's where the &#x2013; that's been the principal driver.</p>
          <p>I draw your attention of course that this result includes a reclassification in that to align ourselves with global practice we've now got the credit risk on derivatives included as a negative income item. It was only $45 million last year but this year being $721 million it became more material and we've needed to reclassify that. But when you run through though and adjust for that looking at the other lines there hasn't been any real change of any significance as fundamentally the difference has been that higher mark-to-market charge to the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The underlying PBP is actually up by 13.7% and I want to take you through how I reached that conclusion. Because of that accounting adjustment that I just mentioned, it now means that those credit risk charges for derivatives are going through the income line, which distorts the traditional relationships that we see in the P&amp;L, so first of all we adjust for that and that's an 11% impact on the profit before revisions compared to the way that we traditionally looked at it.</p>
          <p>In addition, and I know a number of you have had some questions on this since the results have come out; there was a structured trade that resulted in a $127 million hit to income with an offsetting tax credit. That has also meant that the tax rate has fallen by 2.2% because of that with a $90 million permanent difference, and so adjusting for that to bring it back into income, so it doesn't distort the trend, there is 2.1% added on there, then the final adjustment being some foreign exchange. So the actual profit before provisions as the way we traditionally look at it has been quite strong for the year.</p>
          <p>That of course, though has been very much offset by a substantial increase in the level of credit related charges to the P&amp;L, which this year have been just short of 2.7 billion. You can see them set out there.</p>
          <p>Notably though when you look at that $2.7 billion, 52% of it has not actually resulted in a specific loss, i.e. 52% of it is related to the mark-to-market on our credit derivatives, and the collective provision. It's not &#x2013; most of this charge is in fact related to those non-specific items, as opposed to actual losses that have occurred during the current year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the &#x2013; taking this one step further, and looking at what's happened from a revenue point of view, again, adjusted for those accounting classification issues. The revenue for the full year is 11.5%, and importantly you see the momentum has continued into the second half with 5.3% growth on that adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual divisions likewise you can see that whilst prima facie, the Institutional division had a very low profit before provisions, performance and income performance. The accounting treatment of those items hides what was actually an underlying growth in income of 16%. But obviously the standout for the year was that 46% growth in the income within the Asia Pacific business.</p>
          <p>Overall from expenses, we've continued the philosophy of maintaining positive JAWS and making sure that revenue always exceeds cost growth, and we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go through the rest of these slides.</p>
          <p>Looking at margins, obviously the key thing from your point of view is after the first half where the credit crisis bit hard into the margin, the higher funding cost changes in asset mix and so forth meant that the margin fell quite substantially.</p>
          <p>The pleasing part in the second half has been a re-pricing of assets, both mortgages and business loans, to reflect the new cost of funding and higher credit spreads has substantially eroded &#x2013; substantially offset the normal competitive erosion in margins. And so we've overall from that half we've had our margins go up by almost 3 basis points.</p>
          <p>And one of the notable parts of the half though has been a lot more deposit competition. There's effectively about minus 5 basis points in additional deposit competition of being offset by re-pricing on assets.</p>
          <p>Lending growth has been strong across the year, but as you would expect, the rate of lending growth has slowed somewhat in the second half, as credit growth generally in the system has slowed.</p>
          <p>Deposit growth has also been very strong and continuing. Deposit growth, for example, during October continues to be very strong, which is important obviously from an overall funding perspective.</p>
          <p>Some of you would have been perhaps surprised when you looked at the other operating income number, because again the headline numbers are somewhat misleading. Headline numbers suggest the other operating income is down 2%, but again adjusting for those accounting classification issues around the credit risk on derivatives, and that structured trade, it was actually up by 19% with good growth in fee income of almost 12, and good growth from the market's business.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; looking at the chart on the right hand side, you can see that within the market's business there was actually 29% growth in income, reflecting making &#x2013; taking advantage of the current market uncertainties, being able to get more turnover from customer sales, leveraging off the institutional franchise and much stronger earnings as a consequence of that.</p>
          <p>Looking at costs, once again I stress that the philosophy that we have been adopting has been to invest for the longer term, whilst maintaining positive JAWS. And a key part of the point, a key point of difference for ANZ compared to our peers, clearly in this regard is our investment up through Asia.</p>
          <p>The investment in Asia adds 3.5% to our overall cost growth for the year, and 2.2% for the half. That's something that obviously that strategy is having significant rewards with income growth being up by 46%, and profit up by 52%. But it does mean though that there will be above average cost growth, and has been above average cost growth.</p>
          <p>When you look at the other parts of the cost growth for the year in Personal, I mean, this is the first full year of the effect of all the new branches, and the continuing investment in driving customer satisfaction and more focus on some marketing initiatives has meant that they had a contribution to overall cost growth of around 4%.</p>
          <p>Within the Institutional business, you saw the growth in sales &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; in revenue from corporate sales, and there has been correspondingly increases in FTEs to support that. Plus as Mike mentioned, remediation costs associated with some of the issues around securities lending and custody and so forth and the work to rectify those issues.</p>
          <p>In the half, the cost growth in the Personal business has come back after digesting the effect of the additional investment in 2007, but in Institutional that's where the bulk of the remediation spend has been holding up further costs there.</p>
          <p>As far as New Zealand, you might have been surprised by the growth there in New Zealand, but in large part that's due to the consolidation of a company that was acquired as part of a workout. So that we have to consolidate its revenues and expenses, and that was a driver behind, so the increase in cost within that business in the half.</p>
          <p>This then takes us onto looking at the credit risk on derivatives. And first of all let me remind you that there is a new accounting treatment here in these, because these credit risk charges are taken through as income charges, as a negative income.</p>
          <p>But starting from the bottom here, you have the items that you're used to seeing. The adjustment within the credit risk on derivatives that really reflects the equivalent of the collective provision, that previously was included in collective provision, but now is treated as a credit risk on derivatives and taken through the income item.</p>
          <p>We had three companies that actually defaulted during the year, and so we had losses on &#x2013; in the money derivatives. Two of those were mining companies and one of them was a financial services company during the turmoil over the last month. And so that &#x2013; they are actually realized losses.</p>
          <p>And then we come to the credit intermediation trades themselves, which is as Mike was stressed, this is a mark-to-market outcome. If these were actually on balance sheet loans, we wouldn't have this. But the accounting standards require us to mark-to-market, which means we're recognizing the blowout in spreads that has occurred in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And we'll talk a little bit more in a moment about the actual losses that are likely to &#x2013; so actual losses that could arise on this portfolio, and how unlikely losses are, because the subordination on these structures is extremely conservative. There's a very large level of conservatism in those.</p>
          <p>But nonetheless, the blowout in credit spreads leading up to 30 September, meant that the mark-to-market on the underlying assets in these trades increased to just short of US$1.4 billion from the around $1.1 billion when we last spoke to you.</p>
          <p>And also correspondingly, we have to mark-to-market the value of the protection that we have from the financial guarantors, and as credit spreads for the financial guarantors have also widened, then the offset has become less. So we've had both a growth in the mark-to-market of the underlying transactions. And also some mark-to-market decrease in the value of the protection that we have to offset that. All of which meant that this overall charge to the P&amp;L from the mark-to-market has gone up.</p>
          <p>But the question we regularly get for this is around these transactions is well, what actually could we lose? And the outcome of the work that we've done suggests that it would only be in a great depression scenario that we'd actually crystallize cash losses on these transactions. We've gone back looking at recessions throughout the previous century. And so the recessions there in the 80s and the 90s would not have resulted in any cash losses on these transactions. As I said, it would take a great depression scenario to actually result in losses, and even in the great depression scenario there would only be US$400 million of losses.</p>
          <p>So, we actually get a situation with these transactions where the mark-to-market exceeds what would have actually happened in a great depression scenario. And that reflects what's happened with credit spreads, and that it reinforces the point that Mike was making earlier that we actually expect to substantially recover these mark-to-market levels. Unfortunately along the way there will be substantial volatility, reflecting the volatility that you see in credit spreads at the moment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Individual provisions, you can see most of the growth in our individual provisions has been on the Commercial side of the portfolio, which is principally obviously in Institutional. Consumer credit loss growth has been very modest here in Australia, more in New Zealand and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.</p>
          <p>When you look on that chart in the top right hand corner, you might be saying what's the growth there offshore and that relates to our available for sale portfolio and the markdowns on that for impaired assets or sale of parts of that portfolio and one finance company, one offshore finance company defaulting.</p>
          <p>The New Zealand growth looks quite large. It's up three and half times on what it was last year, but in fact the loss rate is simply back to where it was in 2001. So this is &#x2013; we've gone from a very low level of losses in New Zealand and loss is now back at 2001 levels.</p>
          <p>From the pie chart in the bottom right hand corner, you can see that over a third of the losses here come from a relatively small number of customers and those eight customers are spread across brokering, mining, property, services and a financial institution.</p>
          <p>Looking at the collective provision, it's always been our philosophy here to try and keep ahead of the curve. And so that's what we've done here within this collective provision charge to recognize that the traditional model was standard approach that we use to calculating the collective provision wouldn't recognize the turmoil that's happening within the markets.</p>
          <p>And so we have two components in addition to the normal risk profile and volume growth components that you've seen within our collective provision charge. The first one looks at the general economic cycle and makes allowance for those levels of losses inherent in the portfolio that will be higher than normal because of the effect of the cycle has yet to be seen.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, we recognized that within areas like property and in financial institutions given the instability in those markets at the moment that there are likely to be more concentrated losses, that is that the average which is the basis on which we calculate the collective provision normally, is unlikely to be a good indicator of the actual losses, because they are likely to be more chunky than what they would be in normal times.</p>
          <p>Looking then at arrears and impairment. On the consumer side, interestingly within Australia here on the credit card portfolio the unsecured lending part of our book, arrears levels have not changed very much. And indeed overall loss rates for the year have only increased by &#x2013; so in fact haven't increased. In fact they're reduced by three basis points. So a very little evidence of impact on the credit card portfolio.</p>
          <p>Mortgage arrears though are trending upwards, particularly in New South Wales. You can see the overall level of 60-day arrears there has drifted from 24 to 39 basis points, but has yet to result in much in the way of additional provisions. Indeed, the provisions within the mortgage business this year in Australia aren't that dissimilar to what they were in 2007.</p>
          <p>On the New Zealand front though things are a bit different. The mortgage arrears there have increased from 20 basis points to 68, so a substantial increase in mortgage arrears. There have been very few actual losses, but nonetheless recognizing the trend in property prices within New Zealand it's been appropriate to raise some additional provisions for those, which are included within the results for the New Zealand business.</p>
          <p>Looking at impaired loans, you can see there from that chart that once again, our impaired loans are dominated by a relatively small number of larger customers. The 846 there relates to a customer where the debt has been rescheduled and so we've therefore classified it as a restructured loan.</p>
          <p>Across the other customers making up the larger component of our impaired assets, once again we have a finance company, a broker's services industry and healthcare being the principal drivers of the increase in the level of impaired loans within that segment.</p>
          <p>Mike made a number of comments on capital and clearly we've done a lot over the last 12 months and particularly the last six months to strengthen our capital position to one now that is a ratio which clearly compares extremely well to our peers and on a global basis.</p>
          <p>And it's a global comparison that's important and it's why we are making emphasis on the FSA and OSFI benchmarks as well, because there tends to be that investors look at capital ratios just on a headline basis and so when they go comparing the more conservative approach that APRA adopts results in what appears to be on the headline a weaker ratio and hence the benchmarks that we're including here.</p>
          <p>We've been quite measured in the way in which we've raised additional capital across the year through a number of initiatives, which has helped to boost the overall Tier-1 ratio across the half by 87 basis points and if you included the final dividend underwrite that would, in fact, increase that to 125 basis points.</p>
          <p>You might have been a little bit surprised by the risk-weighted asset growth component of that, perhaps a little bit less than what you were expecting. And that reflects some fine tuning of the Basel II measurement, some areas where we'd been quite conservative as we said at the time when we first introduced the Basel II numbers in March. And that's helped to reduce the overall increase in the risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Finally, moving onto looking at funding, I think we have got a well-structured funding portfolio. We've raised over $30 billion of term- $39 billion of term funding over the last 12 months and done that in a very consistent way. And at the same time, been focusing on building up our liquid assets, so that now our liquidity portfolio is just short of $54 billion.</p>
          <p>And I stress that what we include in the liquidity portfolio are assets that are repoable to central banks. So in addition to that, of course, we have other liquid assets sitting within the balance sheet and within the trading portfolio, but we only include those assets that can be repoed to central banks, because they're the ones if you can be confident can be turned into cash.</p>
          <p>And that $54 billion represents more than 12 month's of maturities of offshore wholesale debt, so should the international capital markets close, there's 12 month's of liquid assets to cover the natural maturities arising from that book.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I think the underlying revenue for the year has been strong. Clearly, that's been offset by a substantial increase in credit charges. And as we mentioned earlier, in large part, they are for losses that are yet to be specifically identified, but including the mark-to-market, for example on derivatives, which we would expect to reverse.</p>
          <p>And then finally from a balance sheet point of view, we have a much stronger capital ratio and very strong by benchmark comparisons and have a very good funding and liquidity position.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll pass back to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. And before I hand over for questions, I just want to reinforce that we believe it will take two or three years for the world to work through this international crisis and the economic effects that will flow from it. There will be choppy waters along the way and it's going to be difficult in the global credit markets for some time to come. They're going to be both volatile and skittish.</p>
          <p>The outlook for economic growth in Australia, as I said, was 1.8% for 2009. In New Zealand, we're not expecting that much, about 0.5%. Asia excluding Japan will likely to grow at almost 7%. So while the worst of the shocks will subside by the end of the year, we're now seeing a flow-through to the real economy. And we are going to see a continuation of more normalized levels of provisions, as Peter has said.</p>
          <p>In financial markets and banking, we're at one of those points in history where the game has changed. Its paradigm has shifted. What's also becoming clearer is that our super regional strategy focused on Asia will stand us in good stead.</p>
          <p>The new game, the new paradigm if you like in financial services, is the re-emergence of mega regional banks in the UK, in the US, in Europe and in Asia. With the significance of problems in the US and Europe now being more broadly understood, the importance of China, the importance of India and the importance of Asia to the future of the world economy is now becoming blindingly obvious.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I believe we have delivered a reasonable result in difficult circumstances in 2008. 2009 is going to be another difficult year as the economy softens, which we are on a better footing. We're better prepared than we were twelve month's ago and I believe we have a good future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is that correct? Changes to accounting rules that have been suggested about whether these instruments should be mark-to-market or held at book, what's the likely outcome for your &#x2013; trades that you have got?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the moment, as we've seen, there have been a number of suggestions coming out of the US predominantly and adjustments to US GAAP on holding certain securities to maturity without needing to mark-to-market. Unfortunately all derivatives are excluded from that rule at the present, so that answers the question. But I will make another comment as I've got the floor. I believe that the accounting standards IFRS at the moment is just absurd. One of the concerns that the industry had was in a &#x2013; what would happen in a downturn? What would happen? Mark-to-market is fine if you've got- sorry, mark-to-market is fine if you have a market. But if you have a completely dysfunctional market you are in a ridiculous situation and, as Peter said, if these exposures were loans there'd be no provision at all for the same risk. So it just doesn't pass the common sense test. So certainly I hope the industry, the banking industry, the financial services industry, continues to lobby the International Accounting Standards Board, but to date we haven't had much success</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one final question on looking forward next year, is there some sort of sensitivity you can provide that if spreads blew out another 10, 50 basis points from the September levels what that would do to the mark-to-market through your numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's not quite as simple as that because it depends on the actual assets in total over 1,400 names in the portfolio here. So the same indices are only a general introduction to this. It's also a function of what happens with the correlations between these individual names. So it's hard to be definitive. But certainly one of the things we pointed out in the document here to give you an indication as to how volatile this is. Of course, since 30th September spreads have gone up even further and that would have resulted in a further 400 million of charge to income, but just no change in the underlying expectation of loss. We don't expect to substantially recover all of this but it is very volatile with spreads at the moment at close to record highs.</p>

          <p>Hi, John Mott from UBS. Just a question on your media releases, a comment on here I just wanted to explore when you said in the median term the main game at ANZ is our super original strategy. Then the next further down that paragraph there are significant opportunities emerging from the environment. Just &#x2013; I had a question on the pricing that you're seeing. Obviously around the world and in Asia prices are coming back quite materially. Are they starting to come into a range where you think the opportunities are more attractive on a medium term perspective and following on from that under what conditions would you look to raise capital to undertake a more material acquisition up in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer to the first question is yes. I mean we are certainly seeing values become more reasonable in Asia. The differential between values here, in Europe and in the US to Asia have got quite steep so we'd basically said well fine. We'll wait &#x2013; we'll wait for the adjustment. The adjustment is happening and I think will continue to happen. I think that this has got some way to play out and we're in no panic. We will &#x2013; as I've always said, this is a very measured approach. This is to be done on the basis that it makes sense for shareholders. In terms of capital raising, obviously if there needs to be a capital issued it would have to be around something like an acquisition. But as to how we would do that, it would depend very much on the size.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Craig Williams, Citi here. Given the declining consumer confidence that we've witnessed in well as far as many western households and high levels of indebtedness of households that we see today. But noting more recently some policy support with respect to both fiscal and monetary. What sort of outlook for growth are you seeing in household debt in Australia and New Zealand over the sort of medium term, three to five years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's going to be a reduction. We're certainly not going to see the levels of growth that we have seen in the last 10 years and I think that that is actually a good thing. I think we need to have much more of a savings culture in this country. It is actually ironic that the highest rate of tax that we pay is on deposits and in fact you are encouraged to borrow money for a tax effective transaction and really we've got to I think find ways of encouraging saving. So we do need to see a change in that, so I'm not too worried by that.</p>

          <p>Mike, it's James Ellis here from Credit Suisse. Just a question on your organic strategy in Asia, can you talk about how the financial crisis has impacted the economies and banking markets of Asia and how's that benefited or impeded your sort of the 2012 objective of NPAT business of 1.5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the organic strategy, I mean we're very much on track and in fact that's actually been helped, because we've had a number of international banks withdrawing from markets as they've had problems in their home countries. So we are actually now facing really competition far more from local banks rather than from international banks and that frankly plays into our hands, particularly from the business which is originated from Australia or from New Zealand. So I would actually say that it's a plus rather than a minus. I don't know if, Alex, you want to comment more on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there will, as Mike said, there is a slowdown in Asia but it's not in any means similar to here and I'd put two factors behind that. Our strategy is very built around about building franchises, strong liquidity, which allows you to manage the volatility of risk. I think that's good. Pricing is going up in Asia, actually starting to go up faster, which is good. And, as Mike said, there are a lot of players who are exiting or really constrained and I think that's also very good for us. So I think things stick as they are. The shape of the revenue may be slightly different in terms of where it comes from product wise and I think there will be less growth on volume and more on margin. So actually it's &#x2013; we're looking very positive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman, Goldman Sachs JBWere. I just want to get a bit more of an outlook on the margin side if I could. The second half obviously showed a good margin performance up a few basis points. We're starting to see you dropping rates, just get a bit of a feel as to what we should be looking for into the '09 year? It's obviously a bit of a mixed bag with some of the fact, some of the things going on in the markets.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Group, because obviously the blended effect there is going to be an issue. In terms of Australia, I'm assured by Brian, who can answer this question for you that, that everything is going to be rosy. No I actually think that we are seeing a realistic &#x2013; a more realistic, value on risk being priced. Obviously, there is a fairly major competitive stress on deposits. But overall I think we will hope to at least contain the margin and possibly improve it, but I think we have to be selective here. We've got to be able to adjust a little bit more quickly than perhaps we have done in the past. It's a bit more agility, which New Zealand are beginning to do as well and New Zealand has been a problem because we've seen margin reduction there off the back of some of the problems in the economy and that is still a &#x2013; that's going to be quite a management challenge for Graham and his people. But maybe Graham can talk to that as well later.</p>
          <p>Brian, did you want to say anything on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would simply say that with rates starting to come down that generally benefits us given the ratio of loans to deposits, but it's not quite as simple as that for two reasons. One is that there has been a big shift to thinner margin deposits as people have moved more into term deposits and those sorts of things and there's a lot of competition in the market, so that benefit is somewhat offset. And then, of course, we still have continued volatility in wholesale markets, which affects our borrowing cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Graham, would you like to comment on New Zealand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks, Mike. New Zealand's really seen quite a heavy competition for the deposit market, particularly in this bit of second half of the year as the offshore funding became even more difficult or more expensive. And frankly that, as Brian said, that's impacted by mix in terms of people moving to higher yield deposits. But also the actual overall margin for deposits has sort of been squeezed as well. So particularly that's where the compression's been.</p>
          <p>On the lending side, as the costs of borrowing have gone up internationally then we've been passing that through into our lending book and achieving better overall lending margins, but, of course, the overall margin has been more impacted because part of our book, of course, in the lending side is fixed rate, so it takes a while for that to re-price fully through, whereas in the deposit side, the liability book, has a shorter timeframe and tends to re-price over a shorter duration, and therefore, the liability pressures have priced more quickly. Then we've been able to pass on the full benefit of the increased pricing on the lending book.</p>

          <p>Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. Mike, just following on from James' question about the funding guarantee. Do you feel that regardless of the cost you're almost forced to insure your term debt, so that you're not at a competitive disadvantage relative to say overseas banks or even other banks in Australia who would accept that insurance? And following on from that, do you have any feel for where you expect the average cost of say three year to new three year issues to settle in 2009?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No. I mean the issue is at the moment is that what happened when people like the Irish Government, and the French, and the German Governments came out and started to guarantee the term debt of banks in those countries what happened was that the weak became the strong and the strong became the weak. So what the government did here was very quickly support the banks here. I mean do we want that guarantee? No, we don't in the longer-term. But we have to be realistic to the effect that the market will need it for a time. What I think will actually happen quite quickly is that we will get a dual market that will have guaranteed debt and will have un-guaranteed debt. And I would quite like to go out to the market to test that fairly fast as markets reopen, because I think the AA banks around the world shouldn't need that guarantee, but with the market dislocation as it is, it's crazy. I mean I think you saw that deal from Barclay's a couple of days ago. If you consider that's got a sovereign guarantee, what was it yields 60 over mid swap, something like that? Or 20 over mid swap?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. I'm going to ask the same question I asked National Australian Bank, but I suspect Peter might actually be able to answer it. Peter, if you have a look at the capital ratio that you've come out with today all the banks are running around and you make these great claims that if you are regulated in Canada or the UK your Tier 1 ratio would be higher, despite the fact you're actually regulated in Australia. Today you're also telling us that during the period the Tier 1 benefited from basically optimizing some of the risk assets.</p>
          <p>We know that you got a reduction when you moved from Basel I to Basel II. But when you have a look at the peer group in the UK, and the US and around the world, the concept of pro-cyclicality actually saw their risk weighted assets increase. When you have a look at your balance sheet you've got a residual &#x2013; well you've got $11.2 billion of securities that go up and down like a yo-yo effectively, which basically does cause a mark-to-market through your statutory capital adequacy position. Can you just give us some comfort as to why that 10% that we're seeing around the world, which has struck off where asset base have fallen and the light of Mike basically telling us that asset base have fallen, why we wouldn't see at some point in time you coming out and saying, hey pro-cyclicality has slammed the Tier 1, here's the capital raising we need to actually recapitalize. Because to be quite honest if you have a look at the Australian banks where we are has actually been quite obvious for six months and I think, Mike, you ought to be commended that at least you saw it coming to some degree.</p>
          <p>But the commentary that we're hearing from the Australian banks seems to be very much looking in the rear window when it comes to capital, as opposed to looking forward. So can you make us feel comfortable about the pro-cyclicality of the capital and the mark-to-market impact of the credit intermediation trades on the capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look I think if you take the longer-term strategic view on this post this market turmoil you have to assume that the regulators are more likely to increase capital ratios than reduce them obviously. This is &#x2013; it is likely to be that the regulator response. At the moment, what's important is to make sure that you're capital ratio though is not out of step with what is currently the global benchmarks and that's what we've been doing, and I think all the Australian banks have been doing. We talk about the FSA comparison for precisely that reason, to make sure that people appreciate that all these ratios are in fact very strong relative to the global benchmarks.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>No. I can see where you are coming from, but in fact what we've &#x2013; the way I've tried to do this because you can't do it under the accounting standards, right? So what we've tried to do is to increase the collective provision for this cyclical outlook provision. Now, that's been a struggle in itself. But I take your point exactly, because you've got to raise capital. You've got to increase the amount of capital. And at the moment we are going to need that as the book &#x2013; as the values deteriorate. Yeah. And I quite understand your point.</p>

          <p>Mike, if I can just push my luck with one second question, I promise it won't be as long. Mike, if you have a look at ANZ at the moment for the last few years we've had the bank that's had higher cost growth as we're seeing a push into retail banking. We've also got an Asian strategy and you look at domestic financial services. Could you just rank for us in terms of immediate priority, given that your cost of capital has been dusted, your PE is a lot lower. Can you rank for us in priority cutting costs, Asia, domestic financial services, acquisitions? Can you just rank them in order? What is the immediate focus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key for the cost containment, if you like to put it that way, is in the domestic operation because that's where most fat is. And we're in the process of going through a delayering program at the moment. We had up to 13 levels of management. We're pulling that back to 7. We've got to get accountability much clearer. We've got to strip out some of the excess that has built up over the years. The other issue is the business reengineering of the back office, which is continuing. And so that is going ahead and is also happening in New Zealand now. So those would be my priorities because they are the easy ones to see. In terms of actual numbers Asia is actually a small change in terms of its overall business at the moment. That will change in time, but the big win on cost is here.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Mike, I actually meant as in strategic focuses, cutting costs, Asian acquisitions, Australian acquisitions, what is the order?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see. Well cutting costs has to happen anyway, because you've got to cut your costs to fit the form. And as the economy basically starts to weaken, we have to adjust. We've got to be realistic about that. But Asian acquisitions are going to be opportunistic. They are going to have to be based on the right &#x2013; they are going to may have to be based on the right numbers, and right now those numbers are too high. So we have to just wait and see what &#x2013; how the cookie crumbles on that. I'm sorry, your third one was &#x2013; domestic acquisition. Well, very opportunistic, we'll see how that goes.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Matt Davison from Merrill Lynch. A follow-on question just on the cost growth outlook for '09. On page 27 you've got the flagged $200 million of benefits from the transformation. At the same time in the last six months your head count's gone up about 1,500 people inclusive of the Asian businesses. I guess I'm just wondering with that sort of pressure behind on head count, what are you seeing that you can actually do in the domestic business in terms of slowing that head count growth? And what would be a broader outlook for Group cost growth for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important thing to hear is to focus on where we are growing headcounts and where we are growing &#x2013; where we're looking at income. There will be some businesses that we want to pull back on. And they'll be businesses we'll want to invest in. The overall growth in numbers is primarily in the frontline in the Personal bank. It's in the markets business in Institutional and it's been in Asia. And Asia has been the big growth in head count. In terms of where we are making the adjustments at the moment, it's very much in the operations and back office and processing the re-engineering side and in management, which has become too clunky. So it's slightly different, I mean you can't &#x2013; there's no magic answer to this. And I think we have be realistic as to where the economy is going and what we can &#x2013; we have to be able to afford or to spend what we can afford is an easy way of looking at it. And I think going back to Peter's concept of JAWS, we do want to keep positive JAWS. I do want to keep that underlying cost-income ratio moving down. If you take out the credit intermediation effect, the cost-income ratio came off close to 1% this year and we want to keep that going. Sorry, Brian, would you want to...?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just might add that if you look at the retail side of things, there's actually some very good progress. In the second half costs only grew 2% and we added a net 19 people across the entire retail bank in the second half. So it's clearly slowing down and we expect that to continue.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier, Wilson HTM. I had a question on the credit risk weighted assets. You said they didn't change very much and I think I'm right in paraphrasing because you understood better what you were doing this time. Can you break it up into the two components or the lack of change and the two components as to the improvement in your understanding and the deterioration that you would generally expect in your risk weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think our risk weighted assets for the half grew about 3% and that's in Basel II basis. On a Basel I basis they grew by about 4% and so the reason why the Basel II numbers didn't grow as fast as what Basel I did was because of some of the methodology changes that I mentioned before. From a &#x2013; and this part goes back to Brian's question before that pro-cyclicality. From a deterioration point of view how much risk weighted asset growth are we picking up at the moment simply because of portfolio migration? Across the year it's probably been around 6% just simply from portfolio migration and that's the thing we have to manage as banks now going forward. In the second half some of the methodology changes that we had, which were tightening up on some of the loss factors that were used where we were clearly out of step with our peers and aligning some of the methodologies in New Zealand back to the same approach as it was the top tier in Australia, et cetera. They offset a lot of that, so that you ended up having Basel I going up by four and Basel II only going up by three.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also add that we've still got more work to do on that. You know I think Basel II is a iterative process and as we move forward we'll get better and more efficient in the definition of what capital we need against what asset. But at the moment, I think we err on the side of being conservative and going back to Brian's problem, that doesn't actually worry me too much right now, because I think anything we can do to improve the overall Tier 1 is going to be good for us in the future.</p>

          <p>Ross Brown from Deutsche Bank. My question and it's not rhetorical, is in relation to the credit intermediation trades and the rating agencies view, given the further mark-to-market loss post balance date from your discussions with them are they also prepared to sort of look through the mark-to-market impact or do they assess that in terms of the rating outlook, or do they want you to hold more capital as a consequence?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think what has to be &#x2013; when you &#x2013; you should talk to the rating agencies, but the issue of the rating agencies have must be one, is your capital adequate, all right? Two, is your liquidity position adequate for your balance sheet? And three, are your provisions at an acceptable level for the future and to judge the credit quality of what your book looks like? Now, on that basis if there's a yes to those three questions, there should be no reason for them to adjust your rating. And obviously, the effects of the credit intermediation trades have to come into that, so I don't foresee a problem.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that you have to have a target which is in line with what the regulator wants, but if you were talking about an internal target I would actually see it higher than that. I mean I think that you've got to be looking and here we're looking in the medium-term. We have to look at ways of keeping to increase &#x2013; improve our capital rate, Tier 1 rating and that may take some time, but it can only go one way, because you've got to be realistic about what's happening in the world and capital is a very, very critical part of the dynamic.</p>

I'm wondering where we at with the turnaround in institutional bank and how you see ANZ positioned, but actually parlaying that a little bit more poignantly, what is the message that you send to the front-line troops, the people in the voucher processing, the people at the front line given the headlines they're reading, given the economic conditions in the banking system they're operated in to keep them motivated, keep them focused and keep them pushing forward?</p>

I mean I think you have to be somebody internal to actually understand just how much has happened within the organization. I mean I've got to say that we've made an awful lot of progress and I can feel that the overall morale within the organization is improving. There are certain parts of the organization that are a little bit under stress, but frankly, some of them needed to be and I'm not losing sleep over that. But, I think we have to push ahead. We have got a very clear strategy. We've got a very clear direction. They know what it is. They can understand what it is that is expected of them. The accountability bit was missing, I think and we're pushing that one through and I'm starting at the top. Accountability is what it's about. People have to be accountable for what they're doing, as do I. So, I think we've got a good story to tell and I think that most people are on the bus now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was going to get to Jill earlier though from this segment. Look, while it's not alarming by global standards and perhaps very much representative of the time of the cycle we're in. Can you please elaborate on the impairment expense on the available for sale assets of 98 million taken this half, the 156 million of credit risk on derivatives this year to the two mining companies financial institution, what sort of activities are sort of driving those things and the restructured items &#x2013; restructured loans of 846 million, which have now appeared. To what extent have these items arisen as a result of activities you might not have wished, you have participated again given your time over and the extent of risk which still remains with respect to the credit risk on derivatives outside of credit intermediation trades?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Well, first we're picking up the available for sale portfolio that was spread across some Alt-A securities that we sold, and I think I mentioned that at the time of the trading update. Some further Alt-A securities that as the judgment of 30 September they are actually impaired and, so therefore we needed to take the charge to the P&amp;L for those. And then the third component was a financial institution and you'll probably do a pretty good job of guessing who that is, who recently defaulted, and there was some of their securities in our liquidity portfolio and hence being in the liquidity portfolio it was available for sale, but it was a loss on those securities when they defaulted and that's what adds up to the $98 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of the derivatives, as I mentioned that there were two mining companies, in the scenario there these were commodity hedges that were provided to those companies. Both of them have had production problems and they weren't able to deliver into the hedges and, of course, you know what happened to commodity prices, and therefore we had a loss on those contracts. And the third one was again the same financial institution. It had some &#x2013; as a result of them defaulting there were some derivative losses. More generally, I think in terms of control over derivatives in most cases, if you of course if you're talking inter bank transactions that they are covered by the CSA arrangements. I always get this one, that one Credit Support Annex or something, but if what it really stands for, but the cash settlement arrangements of perhaps are more of sort of a common sense definition, which means that you are protected.</p>
          <p>There are exceptions. There can be operational problems with that, but generally it protects you on the financial institutions. You're then left, of course, with corporates and then the judgment there is just like lending to any corporate. Is it a good credit allowed for the risk and you could lose money on the derivative or you could loose money on the loan. The judgment is no different. And generally, the risk in the derivatives portfolio is actually small except when you get some fairly strange circumstances like we've had in the last 12 months, and who would have ever thought you'd lose money on a miner for example, in the last 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also add up that here on the CSA's actually it gives you a rather strange liquidity hedge against the currency because as the currency devalues you have US dollars flooding into the bank on the cash top-up, and that provides you with US dollar liquidity, and at present I think we've got about $5 billion of excess liquidity and that's true mainly through the UK on the back of that. So, there is a silver lining actually on that one. It's one of the few I've found.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. I suspect one of the horrible things about banking is that when you look backwards you always see the mistakes you've made, but if you ever look at the present time, we're seeing this result where the profit is down the dividend is flat. You're issuing more shares under the DRP to maintain the dividend, which dilutes the crap out of the future share count, makes it harder to pay the dividend. The justification I hear from banks is that you've still got a bucket load of franking credits, but when the loan loss tax deduction comes through the franking credits disappear and you cut your dividend. You're also saying today, I'm sensing that the Tier 1 capital ratio target is going up, which means anyway you cut it the sustainable payout ratio should fall. Why didn't you cut the dividend this time?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, but I think you are correct in that it was a question that had to be asked and one that had to be answered after careful thought. I felt the market just would not accept a dividend cut right now, and I didn't think we needed it right now. The issue is what are the alternative means of raising capital in the future. So, it's a bit of a balancing act. What I'm hoping is that the market will move and/or there will be opportunity to do other things.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>At present we won't, but doing the underwriting the DRP, as we have for the last two or three times has provided a level of capital. We have done the hybrid, which was better I have to say. It got a very good reaction and I was pleased with that. So, it's something that we have to consider. We have to look at it every time we pay the dividend, but I think at the moment I'd rather keep that as it is because there is an awful lot of shareholders out there who do like the yield and I think that again it's a balancing item.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I need to pick-up on a couple of points that Mike's just raising there because, I think, Brian, you were into change in talking about the dividend and the payout ratio and Mike's response was focusing on the dividend. And for the reasons that you've pointed out if banks run higher capital ratios and that becomes the norm then it will mean if balance sheet growth remains the same that there will need to be lower payout ratios. It's just mathematics. So that's sometime that you would expect to emerge over time, but there's a few caveats in there. What will the capital ratios do and what will balance sheet growth do? Will balance sheet growth continue to be as fast as what it has been over the last couple of years? And the answer to that is probably not, so there's a lot of variables that you're juggling, but certainly the focus is on maintaining that level of dividend in terms of cents per share, but probably over time you may see the payout ratio come down depending on the dynamics we just spoke about.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In franking &#x2013; and from a franking point of view, our comment remains that we expect to be fully franked for the foreseeable future. You pointed to a question about the timing of deductions from bad debts. Remember that the big chunk of the credit charges in Australia are actually intermediation trades, which we're actually not expecting to have cash losses, so we don't get any tax deduction for those. So a lot of that will &#x2013; and when you look at Australia's earnings and think oh look, gee, look how much it's come down, that's in large part because we booked these trades in Australia. But certainly we'd expect to be able to be fully franked for the foreseeable future subject then obviously to a rate of growth in Asia. There will come a point though where the franking would need to come off from being full to maybe even being 90%, but that's not something we see for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>I'm not as smart as Brian is, but once again if capital's going up and margins don't improve, then growth is what we have just works in the formulas that returns to shareholders are going to go down.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it will. I mean return on equity for the banking sector is inevitably going to go down. I mean the years of 20% ROE year-in/year-out have gone. You know you're thinking more of a sort of 15% ROE and that's global. That's not just Australia. That's going to be a global phenomenon, but you'll find that within, I mean, the whole equity markets are being readjusted.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Doesn't it go also to your re-pricing of risk and so-on? I mean you can work the figures backwards and forwards, but if the banking industry is happy to go back to 15 then re-pricing risk and your volumes and so-on that's how it all works. In essence the hopes are you re-price risk and then the volume growth picks up again and your ROE won't get hit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's absolutely correct, but that takes time. So what we're doing is we're going back into a cycle and then that will come out. And of course then the risks that people take will be too high and they'll be another problem because bankers actually have very fragile memories.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We all do. We all do. That's what makes our people make money because the new lot comes through and they don't have the memories right there. You know how that works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; so essentially what you're saying is it's going to be tough for two to three years, but the re-price risk when the growth gets into Asia we're not aimed heading down to 12% ROE. I mean that's the disaster scenario, isn't it?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think that's right. I mean, I think, you always find ways of using your balance sheet better. You use your capital better. You know you find your business model has to adjust, but that takes a bit of time to do.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Mike, I just wanted to follow-on your comment before about the Tier 1 target moving well north of 8%. Obviously, on slide 21 the management target is written at 7%. Should we take this as &#x2013; it's very much still an evolving process in terms of how you're looking at it and is the government guarantee having any impact on where you're going to finally set that management Tier 1 target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that is an internal target. You know that's an internal minimum. That's an internal minimum, that's the way to look at that. That's not where we want to be. And the government guarantee will have no effect on our capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your questions link back again to Brian's, so that's the minimum, but you're going to make sure you're maintaining a sufficient buffer to allow for the pro-cyclicality that you don't hit that minimum. And so that's why Mike's saying we need to head north of that to make sure that you never go below the seven. Thank you.</p>
