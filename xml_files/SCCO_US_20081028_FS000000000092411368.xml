      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Raul. Good morning everyone. And thanks again to be participating in our third quarter '08 conference call. Today, I will comment upon Southern Copper developments for production, operating cost, financial results, and the status on our expansion projects. After that, we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>As we all know, due to the severe crisis that is affecting the world financial markets, the basic metal markets are suffering serious price decreases. The economic weakness in US and Europe and concerns about a slower &#x2013; a lower growth in China had weakened their copper demand for the remaining 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, we think that our lower price environment will prevail for the rest of 2008 and possibly in 2009. However, we are positive about the underlying fundamentals of the copper market. The credit crunch prices and the curtailment of high cost operations are two new factors to add to the structural un-perform of copper supply. Nothing has changed regarding decreasing ore grades, labor unrest, energy and water shortages, all of these factors have been causing lower production levels than expect across the mining industry since 2004.</p>
          <p>Giving consideration to the strong long-term fundamentals of copper market, we think that as long as demand recover, so will prices, and Southern Copper will be ready to take advantage of this new cycle. During the third quarter of 2008, average copper price was $3.48 per pound, lower by 1% than the $3.50 per pound average for the same quarter of 2007, and 9% lower than the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's third quarter '08 copper production was 118,700 tons, lower 13% than the third quarter of 2007, about 3% higher than the second quarter of 2008. The reduction of 18,200 tons of copper in production quarter-to-quarter was mainly the result of the Cananea and San Martin and Taxco operation stoppages that have decreased the production by 13,200 tons comparing third quarter '08 with third quarter '07.</p>
          <p>Also the Toquepala production decreased by 18% or 8,500 tons due to lower minor grade of 0.6% in 2008, compared to 0.77% in third quarter '07. This great reduction is part of the company's long-term mining plan. It should be mentioned that Toquepala SX/EW production increased by 700 tons due to higher leachable material, ore grade and recovery.</p>
          <p>La Caridad production decreased by 200 tons due to minor variances in ore grade and recovery when compared to third quarter 2007. On the other hand, these production deceases have been partially offset by higher Cuajone production of 3,500 tons, an 8% increase due to higher recovery at this operation.</p>
          <p>Regarding our copper smelting production, I will like to report that the company finished in August the first major maintenance in the Ilo Smelter. We expect Ilo smelting grade per month to increase from 90,000 tons to over 100,000 tons. We expect copper production to be approximately 120,000 for the fourth quarter '08 and 484,000 tons for the full year.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum prices were $33.27 per pound for the third quarter 2008, 6% higher than the third quarter 2007. Molybdenum production increased by 3% quarter-to-quarter to 4,500 tons, as a result of higher ore grade, and recovery at La Caridad and better recovery at Cuajone. Southern Copper will produce a little bit more than 16,500 tons of molybdenum in 2008.</p>
          <p>Regarding zinc prices in the third quarter '08, average $0.80 per pound, 45% lower than the third quarter '07. Mine zinc production decreased by 2,400 tons in the third quarter '08 to 26,900 tons. This 8% production reduction is the result of the stoppages in San Martin and Taxco mines. Refined zinc production shows a 20% reduction quarter-over-quarter as a consequence of timing in program maintenance from second quarter '08 to August of this year.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper produces sulfuric acid as a byproduct out of our smelting operations. The company consumes internally about 18% of its sulfuric acid production in its own SX/EW copper production. The remaining production is sold in either long-term contracts or at the spot market. During the third quarter '08, the Company produced 354,000 tons of sulfuric acid.</p>
          <p>Net sales for the third quarter were $1,440 million. This figure compares with $1,606 million in the third quarter '07 and 1,462 million in the second quarter '08. Net sales have been affected by lower volume, sales, partially offset by higher volume and prices for molybdenum and higher prices in precious metals.</p>
          <p>The total operating cost for third quarter '08 was 764 million. This figure compares with a cost of 673 million in the second quarter 2007 or 669 million in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The cost of sales in the third quarter of 2008 was 646 million, 86 million higher than the third quarter of 2007. The cost increase is explained by the following variances. Fuel and power cost increased by 55 million due to higher prices on these items on the cost. Purchase of copper concentrates for the third &#x2013; from third parties to be treated at Caridad smelters increased by 37 million. Labor cost increased by 6 million, lower leaching material capitalization credit of 6 million at Cananea, and other material and cost increases of $12 million.</p>
          <p>These cost increases were partially offset by the following. Workers profit sharing decreased by 10 million, and we have a favorable exchange rate variance of 20 million for both Mexican and Peruvian currency depreciation. Despite the reported cost increases, we now are seeing some cost reductions in our power and fuel cost. Also, currently higher exchange rate, particularly in Mexico will offset local cost increases.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBITDA for the third quarter of 2008 was 784 million, equivalent to 54% of sales. This figure compares with an EBITDA of 1 billion or 63% of net sales for the same period of 2007. The company cash cost per pound of copper produced in the third quarter '08, before byproducts revenues was $2.03 per pound, $0.52 higher than the $1.51 per pound for the same period of 2007 and $0.18 higher than the $1.85 per pound in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Including the benefit of byproduct revenues, the company's cash cost was $0.18 per pound in the third quarter of 2008. These figures compares with a negative cash cost of $0.17 per pound for the same period of 2007. We believe that our company is well prepared to face the current difficult circumstances. Our cash position, even though affected by cost increases in recent years is one of the most competitive in the industry. Our ore reserves base and project pipeline will enhance this cash cost position by adding low cost copper units to our current production base in the upcoming years.</p>
          <p>Net income for third quarter 2008 was $480 million, 34% lower than the 628 million achieved in the same period of 2008 &#x2013; or 2007. Earnings per share amounted $0.47 per fully diluted share compared to $0.71 per fully diluted share for the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>A significant strength of the company is its cash position. As of September 30, 2008 it's in excess $1.1 billion. These funds will continue supporting our operations, our needs, as well as our capital expenditure program in process. In order to protect the company's cash investments, the Risk and Cash Management Committee comprised of members of senior management has agreed to maintain the company's funds in low risk and quality financial instruments with financially solvent institutions. As of September 30, 2008, we held corporate derivative contracts to protect 30,000 tons of copper production for the period October-December 2008. These contracts are zero cost collars with average floor prices of $3.4 per pound of copper and average ceiling prices of $4.23 per pound of copper.</p>
          <p>In third quarter '08, we had gains of $54 million on these derivative programs. In addition to corporate derivatives we hold exchange rate derivatives to protect about 30% of our Mexican peso denominated cost. In the first nine months of 2008, we recorded a gain of 2.1 million on this exchange rate transaction and we have an unrealized loss of 14.8 million in the open positions as of September 30, 2008. About Southern Copper Corporation capital projects, under the new economic environment a detailed review of capital budgets will be undertaken to target reduction in cost for all of our projects.</p>
          <p>In respect of Tia Maria, as of September 30, 2008, we have spent $79 million as part of the $580 million committed in purchases, orders and contracts for this project. After the approval of Tia Maria's environmental impact study expected by the first quarter of 2009, the company would begin the civil works corresponding to this project. The Toquepala expansion project is moving forward as expected. We have spent $5 million as part of the 87 million committed in the purchase of 273 cubic yard shovels, two mine drills and seven 320 ton trucks. We continue with the feasibility study, the basic and detailed engineering and procurement support. The environmental impact assessment should be completed by November 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding our copper deposit projects at El Arco and Los Chancas and the underground polymetallic mine in Angangeo, the company will continue to evaluate these projects taking into account the changes in the financial and economic conditions. With respect to labor matters, the company continue to take &#x2013; the company continues to take steps pursuing a positive resolution of the work stoppages at Cananea and San Martin. Based upon a recent ruling related to Cananea strike by a Federal Court which was favorable to the company, it is suspected that the labor judicial authorities will declare the strike illegal. If a favorable ruling is reached, the next step would be to regain control of the property and the operations and we believe that once in control of the operations full production can be ramped up in approximately three months.</p>
          <p>Finally regarding dividends, I will like to remind that it's the company's policy to review at each board meeting, the capital investment plan, the cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations, in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, the company will evaluate the payment of a quarterly dividend at the Board meeting at Seattle for October 30. At this point, we cannot provide guidance until the Board happens. Well, thank you very much for your attention, ladies and gentlemen. And now we would like to open up the forum for questions. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Felipe Hirai from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking me during this call. So, I have two questions here, first one is regarding the cost, we saw a significant increase in your cost structure in this quarter. What's your expectations for the next two quarters, where is this cash cost going. And the second is regarding your projects, you are saying that you might have to delay or review your projects and maybe try to reduce some cost there, if you &#x2013; I just wonder if you could give us some more details on what's your expectations for the startup of the project and also for any potential decline in cost? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Raul is going to give you a little bit more detail on the cash cost and our guidance for the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Felipe. The third quarter operating cost has been affected by two major factors, the first one is the cost increase in fuel and power, and as Genaro reported, it's $55 million for the third quarter, when compared to same period of last year and basically, we have an increase in power and fuel cost at the Peruvian operations due to a fill up of the gas pipeline that has increased the power cost in Peru significantly. This is a short-term event, should be finished by mid 2009, but during &#x2013; between now and 2009 we will have more hydropower production in Peru that will reduce the energy cost for the country. So we think that for the third quarter we had a high power cost, but that shouldn't be the case in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you know where oil price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, also oil prices, as you know, are coming down and that is going to help us obviously in the future. The second important event was the purchases of copper concentrates for Caridad, the smelter of Caridad that increased our cash position by $37 million. It has to be taken into consideration that we do these obtaining a profit in processing these third party concentrates. Other than that we believe that we'll see some cost reductions in the fourth quarter, but so far we can't give you any guidance on what we expect because it's a matter of talks in some cases with our vendors and suppliers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Raul, just on your last point, do you have any idea of how the purchase of copper concentrates are going to be for the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this is the season of the year where most of the contracts are being negotiated or finished, so we have no definite numbers at this point that we can comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But complementing the &#x2013; that answer from Raul, I can tell you that probably it's going to be around 12,000 tons of copper content and most of that is going to be in the form of tall instead of purchase. Then we have that alternative as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Genaro. And regarding the CapEx, any expectations for delays or reduction in the cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Delays in CapEx, you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, any because of &#x2013; one thing that you mentioned in your press release that you're --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that delays are going to happen, as we mentioned, we have all the financial structure in order to face all the capital expenses that are on process and what is important to consider is that we are going to review all of our projects in order to try to look for savings and that is what &#x2013; how the company is going to &#x2013; is trying to do in front of these new financial conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felipe, let me add that in the past copper cycles, capital expenditures when we pass from high prices to lower part of the copper price cycle, capital expenditures in total decreased in some cases between 40 to 50% for the whole industry. So, we think that the times where you have to travel to get capital equipment, it's going to be passing in the next few months, and considering that the companies are awaiting the cost &#x2013; the capital cost of all the projects, will try to obtain cost reductions on the budgets for these projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jorge Beristain. Your line is now open &#x2013; from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Sorry, you kind of in your introductory remarks quoted some volume guidance for the fourth quarter or the full year for copper and molybdenum, can I just get those key guidances again for your year-end December results in terms of copper sales volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. We expect the production for the last quarter of the year around 120,000 tons of copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry I'm &#x2013; I had a phone ringing, sorry could you repeat that again?</p>
          <p>&lt;&lt;A &#x2013; Genaro Guerrero Diaz-Mercado&gt;: Yeah, 120,000 tons of copper is what we are expecting to produce <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and for molybdenum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For molybdenum, we will produce 16,500 tons for the whole 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that implies a fairly low fourth quarter of around 3,500?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>3,500 for the quarter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that's 4,500. So it will be in line then with what you did in the third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it's 4,500.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And could you also comment a little bit about what you are seeing in the sulfuric acid market, and obviously prices have come down, but could you kind of quantify if these contracts have already been sold forward for some of the sulfuric acid if you would expect to still see very high prices into the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing these &#x2013; that the market is still very strong. It's not as strong as say six months ago. We are currently negotiating our contracts that we expect to have much better prices than in 2008 for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you quantify roughly sort of what levels you would be looking at year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I am sorry that I can't say that right now, because this is part of the talks that we are having.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could you also update us on your credit situation, just running us through what are your working capital lines, what kind of commercial paper facilities, do you have any credit facilities that exist but have not been drawn down, just kind of walk us through your big kind of headline credit numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our debt position is on the Yankee Bonds that are very long-term maturity. We have some information, some breakdown here &#x2013; our total debt &#x2013; long-term debt is $1.2 billion and &#x2013; go ahead --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, what we are going to pay in the next four years is $10 million for Mitsui loan that we took a few years ago. Then in 2015 we will have the payment of $200 million for bond issue that we did in '05, and after that our debts are very long-term. One, the Yankee Bonds that Genaro just mentioned for 2028 and 1,000 or 1 billion &#x2013; I am sorry $1 billion bond issue that we did in 2005 that matures in 2035. At this point, we don't have any credit lines.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, would you be looking in this environment to establish credit lines, short-term credit lines?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a possibility, if we need it for our projects. We have been in contact with all agencies to finance products that are coming from US, from Japan, from Germany. We also have &#x2013; we have been maintaining conversation with agencies from those countries in order to hope to maintain an open window if we need to finance the equipment that we are importing from those places.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Carlos de Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Could you give us please sensitivity on the effects from the Mexican operations as well as the Peruvian operations, either on EBITDA or on earnings, that will be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Carlos, we don't have that sensitivity at hand right now, but I can comment that local currency expenses represent 40% of our total expenditures in both Mexico and Peru. That will give you an idea of how can we adjust or &#x2013; variances in exchange rate will affect our EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And is there any timing on the Cananea labor situation that you can comment upon. And when would you expect to hear from the labor authorities in Mexico in terms of hopefully final resolution on the strike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In September, actually in September for the company as I mentioned, receive a favorable ruling with regards to the Cananea strike, and as I mentioned, based on this decision, we expect that shortly before the end of the year their laborer judicial authorities will make a resolution in this respect declaring the strike illegal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can I have a &#x2013; there is not a specific date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is not any specific date of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically if you get a positive resolution by the end of the year and then it takes about three months to ramp up, we could expect that by the second quarter you will have full capacities if everything goes well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is our expectation, and the three months is a period of time that we consider as a ramp up and that, of course we would start running as soon as we get control of the operations again.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Oscar Cabrera from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning gentlemen. The first question has to do with your CapEx, can you just remind us what's the level of expenditures that you expect with Tia Maria and the Toquepala &#x2013; the Toquepala expansion over the next two or three years, just based on what you spent so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Oscar Gonzalez. And what we are expecting right now, and it was mentioned by Genaro, our commitment for Tia Maria is in the order of $570 million. Right now, we already paid 79 of that. And we expected that by the end of 2010, we will spend the &#x2013; around $1 billion; that is the cost of that project. And in Toquepala, we think that, right now, we are waiting for the tractability story from this company Hatch from Canada that is doing this in Santiago, Chile. And we feel that the cost is going to be higher of what we had before of &#x2013; a little more than $640 million, then we will need &#x2013; as was mentioned to evaluate with that extra cost if the Toquepala spending or the prices of the copper will need to go at the same speed, we will need to revise that in order. We already had purchased in the &#x2013; all the mining equipment that we are going to receive this year and pay it next year, and with that we will start moving all the material, because that mine has a ratio of 7 &#x2013; is going to have a ratio of 7 to 1 for ore, then we will need to use that equipment that we are buying, that equipment from Komatsu or from Caterpillar. Then again, Toquepala is going to &#x2013; if everything continues as we expect, it is going to be released by the end of 2010 or the first quarter of 2011, the new concentrate of 40,000 tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Mr. Gonzalez. The next question has to do with cost and your flexibility to reduce cost. You just commented on the effect of the exchange, but can you give us a sense of the amount of diesel that your operations consumed, that's first? And secondly, most mining companies, I believe you included, having mining below reserve rates, have you thought about increasing your head grades in the &#x2013; for the next three to four quarters or one year, or do &#x2013; are you going to wait and see what the copper prices do before you take those measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar, regarding head grades, we are not doing any changes in that. Let me remind you that our cash cost is currently $0.20 per pound which is very low and we think that we have one of the most competitive cost positions in the industry. We have some cost flexibility in the sense of some cost items that they are dramatically reducing its wait in our cost as we have for reduction in price. Let me comment on two of them. One of them is the profit sharing which represents roughly 9% of our profit before taxes. And obviously, as prices are going down, so the profit sharing charge to copper sales. The second one is the royalty payments that we do &#x2013; that are related to copper prices in Peru and represent about 1% of total sales and will be decreasing its importance as prices are reducing as well. On diesel, we are consuming, I don't have right now the figure of our annual diesel consumption. We believe that both of our operations in Peru and Mexico have been affected by diesel prices in the past and we will start to recover some cost savings on this matter. Where we are seeing the first effects of fuel cost reduction is in the what is called bunkers oil which is basically diesel No. 6. And on this one, we are seeing some important cost reductions for the year and for the quarter specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Raul. If we just circle back to that, $0.20 per pound, but what were the molybdenum prices and sulfuric acid byproducts that you had at that cost? <mark type="inaudible" /> Molybdenum, we have in the press release, but sulfuric acid prices that &#x2013; that you've had --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sulfuric acid price for the quarter was in average $140 per ton and the molybdenum price during the third quarter was $33.20 per pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar, I would like to add that we are expecting our sulfuric acid prices to be higher for 2009 than what we are --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is just on the expectation &#x2013; because of your &#x2013; of the lag in your &#x2013; under your long-term contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a combination of that. And also, the sulfuric acid prices are now regulated commodity, and then &#x2013; the price is different, it depends on the region where you are selling and depends on the condition that you are making the contracts and the volatility as well has been affected due to this product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that's <mark type="inaudible" /> I mean these prices have fallen from like $400 a ton to less than half. So, I am assuming that the long-term contract &#x2013; nature of your contact will benefit the company. Second, just I had one more question, in terms of your zinc operations, zinc prices have fallen quite dramatically, are there any plans to curtail zinc production or do you guys plan to maintain the <mark type="inaudible" /> refinery going near capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at this point of time. We are going to maintain our production plan. We think that &#x2013; well, even that the zinc &#x2013; it has been a little bit more affected probably before &#x2013; even before the financial situation that we are currently believing. The zinc also has been &#x2013; having an effect on all the situation. But as of the rest of the metals, we think that the fundamentals are going to be recovered and as a result of that, we would like to maintain our production in the zinc product &#x2013; in the zinc --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar, please keep in mind that zinc comes along with silver, lead, and copper as well, that's an underground process from our <mark type="inaudible" /> so far it's profitable operation. And we don't think that zinc production will be affected even though at these prices.</p>

          <p>A couple of questions. First, if you can comment on what you are seeing on the molybdenum market these days, the last couple of weeks, as far as what was the price levels you are seeing? And second, if you can give us a sense of what your mix of sales of copper ore of the spot vessels contracts?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Molybdenum has been slightly affected by the current economic environment. We are seeing reductions of prices; they are around $27 per pound as we speak.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2009, we don't have a figure right now, we are working on that. And obviously we are going to review very carefully all the budgets in light of the new economic circumstances. For the fourth quarter of 2008, well the same thing I would say, is we are reviewing all the &#x2013; all of our capital expenditure programs, but even that I would say that &#x2013; well we have spent on fuel in the third quarter 142 &#x2013; up to September 30, we have expended $140 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean do you expect fourth quarter to be --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, we are going to spend about $150 million in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then do you have &#x2013; is your range for your budget in '09, I realize it's a fluid situation, but it would &#x2013; would it be kind of within 20% or so of what you spent in '08 or is there anything &#x2013; any guidance on that or should we just wait for next conference call to get more detail there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine. And then just my &#x2013; my next question is just on your strategies for derivatives, do you plan to continue hedging some of your copper sales after December or what &#x2013; can you give us some guidance on what your derivative policy is regarding copper sales?

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this moment we don't have any guidance that we can disclose. Of course, as a policy of the company, we always follow very close the expectations on the copper markets, on the metal markets. And if there are some opportunities, then we will decide or the committees will decide to make or to continue with the hedging program. But at this point of time, we don't have anything to disclose.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, everyone, a couple of questions. The first one is what are you planning to do with the FX derivative position, I mean with the Mexican peso derivative position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that we are going to maintain the position. The term is not so long, it's less than one year, and we are maintaining a very long position in dollars, then that is giving us a natural hedge against more or more severe movements in the FX in terms of Mexican peso and sols in Peru.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the next one would be what do you see &#x2013; I don't know if you have already your budgets in terms of copper price for the next year, but can you give us your point of view of copper prices for the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is a very difficult question. At this point of time, the volatility is very, very high and I would say that the drivers during the last time have been the sentiments or the feelings more than the fundamentals. Then we need to wait a little bit in order to try to get more clear expectations about copper prices in &#x2013; during 2009. Analysts are making very &#x2013; often adjustments, then it's difficult given that where we can say that &#x2013; or we think that the copper price is going to be in the neighborhood of $2.10, $2.20 per pound during 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My last one will be how do you estimate the operation margin for the next year given this increases in the cost you already commented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point it's premature to comment on that, but as we explained, we believe that as long as we have Cananea back on track, we will be operating at a much lower cost that has to be considered in our 2009 expectations. And also as long as fuel and power costs are decreasing, that will reflect in lower operating costs for our current units. Fuel and petrochemicals products will also go down somehow. At this point we don't know how much, but we are optimistic about that and the fact that we will be operating at a lower cost in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the third quarter couldn't be an indicator of the full year, I mean the 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, difficult to say, but well we can consider that that we are going to be in that level of margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I want to ask some follow-up questions on the copper market, specifically you said you are going to be reviewing capital investments. You didn't mention whether you do actually have plans to cut projects or how that might go. So I'm wondering how low would copper prices have to fall before you are going to be faced with production halts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have done our project evaluation with very conservative copper prices and byproduct prices, even lower than today's market prices.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

We think that circumstances have changed and that has to be reflected in the capital budgets of the projects and that's different than considering that at this point we should eliminate some of them from our list. They are all moving forward. We are looking at them with &#x2013; under the current new circumstances, obviously with a different point of view.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, you mentioned you're making contracts at this point, talking to a number of other companies. It sounds like buyers are hesitant to make contracts for next year just with the market volatility. Have you experienced any of that or have you had any difficulty making next year's contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not experiencing any difficulty. We already have got our negotiations for volumes for next year. And basically we are finding a house for all of our production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Well, those are all my questions. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Dan Richmond, who is a private investor. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. One relates to your income tax expense on your income statement where I noticed for the third quarter of 2008, your average tax rate is 37.3% of pre-tax income, whereas a year ago it was 31.9%, and for the nine months of 2008 it's 33.2%. Could you shed some light on the big percentage increase in your provision for income taxes and give us some guidance as to what we should expect for a tax rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Well, basically the effect that we are having in the tax rate is due to the FX situation in Mexico basically. We've got at the end of September a 61 cents pesos per dollar devaluation and that is affecting the effective rate for September and August, that is, as we maintain a long position in dollars then in Mexican GAAP, this is affecting our incomes and that is the reason that the tax rate is increasing for this period, and when we convert these Mexican GAAP into the US GAAP, the effect in income is eliminated, but we are still having the effect in taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My next question relates to your stock buyback program, where your press release, as of yesterday you had spent $158.8 million repurchasing 10.5 million shares. According to your cash flow statement as of September 30, you had spent 68.5 million on the stock buyback. Can I conclude then that so far during October you spent 90.3 million buying back stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't hear your last part. Can you repeat your last part, we couldn't copy you well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the press release was as of the date of this report, you had spent 158.8 million buying back stock, looking at your statement of cash flows as of September 30, you had spent 68.5 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I then conclude that you spent $90 million so far in October buying back stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is correct. Yeah</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been very actively in the repurchase of SBCC shares based on our 300 million program that was disclosed last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right, the difference is because we have been active in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At under $10 I think it's a good idea. Have you purchased any of these shares from Americus Mining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We have been purchasing the shares from &#x2013; directly from the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, when I did the math with 10.5 million fewer shares outstanding and Americus Mining shares remaining unchanged, the percentage ownership is approximately 76% as of yesterday and your press release still says on the last page 75.1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these are not the Grupo Mexico shares. These are Southern Copper in treasury shares. So you can't attribute those shares to Grupo Mexico, they were bought for all the stockholders not only Grupo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am attributing them to Americus Mining. The percentage of shares remains unchanged and there is fewer shares outstanding, so the percentage ownership goes up. I just pass it along to you, you may consider that for your next press release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Carlos de Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-up question, could you share with us your long-term assumptions for molybdenum and copper prices when you did the analysis of your project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Carlos we have made our copper price &#x2013; I am sorry project evaluation based on the copper price of $1.50 per pound and a molybdenum price of $12 per pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And on &#x2013; with these assumptions, what would be your cash cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, roughly in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per pound depending on the prices that we assume for power, fuel, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
