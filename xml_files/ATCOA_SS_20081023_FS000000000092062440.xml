          <p>Good day and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q3 Result Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Hans Ola Meyer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon/good morning to everybody. My name is Hans Ola Meyer. I am the Chief Financial Officer of the Atlas Copco Group and I will be leading this telephone conference. I am more than happy to welcome you to this conference call on our third quarter report and I will in a few seconds hand over the word to Gunnar Brock, our Chief Executive Officer, who will give his comments in 15 minutes or something like that, during 15 minutes, and then we will have a Q&amp;A session following that. So further without ado, please Gunnar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Ola, and good morning and good afternoon everyone. As is customary, I will try to stick to the PowerPoint that we have posted and I start immediately by the highlights in slide three. It may be a bit repetitive, but I think we have to say once again that it was a very good order intake and a record result. I think one perhaps should put that in the context of five years of more than 20% growth every year, so it's still a good growth and a good result coming from a rather high sort of cruising speed.</p>
          <p>We have seen good growth in most markets from a geographical point of view, but also product markets. I'll come back to that more in detail in a little while. But we can also say that the important after-market is continuing to grow at 15, 20% across the board, which is of course very rewarding. And particularly when you have a lot of equipment sales, you sometimes tend to sort of lose a bit of focus on the after-market. But I think that the organization has managed to keep that concentration alive.</p>
          <p>Now, record operating profits and margin, I don't think we need to speak so much more about that, but our company, like most companies, have of course faced over the last years and until, let's say, mid this year or April, May quite some cost increases of raw material, which of course now is beginning to turn the other way.</p>
          <p>Currency has played a role, but for the first time, I think, almost in six years it's been basically neutral. We can come back to that later as well. And since we are navigating rather choppy waters or uncharted waters at the moment, I think it's perhaps timely to say that our financial structure is very solid and duration of our different loans, maturity, et cetera, as you can see later in the presentation, is giving us a good night's sleep as we speak.</p>
          <p>Next, slide four, I don't think I need to state what you can read. I think it's good that the profit before tax increased 19%, earnings per share went up 29, a bit of a favorable tax situation that is not going to repeat, but still a very good result.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the first map, slide six, as you can see, 19% year-to-date growth in local currency, and as we say, moderating a bit and 9% the last three months. Good growth relatively because, obviously, as I said, we come from a very high cruising speed, barring Asia, and I'll come back to that, where we recorded a small minus, basically relating to Compressor Technique, and I will be back to that.</p>
          <p>Next, slide seven, US, North America, pretty good I must say. Particularly coal mining is going extremely well and we have managed to acquire some very good position in that market segment. But also, generally, rather good in US. And Compressor Technique, for instance, if you allow for a very large order in August last year taken by a company we just acquired at the time called Mafi-Trench, you take away that order, the Compressor Technique still growed 13% in North America. If you allow for the Hurricane acquisition, in fact it still grew 8%, which I think is very good in the present economic situation.</p>
          <p>The automotive industry is not making anybody terribly happy, not us, included. However, I think we have managed to do relatively better or less bad than most in that category.</p>
          <p>Mexico, particularly mining driving Mexico, but also the industrial parts. South America, as we speak, still growing very strong across the board. It's Brazil particularly, of course, but it's all business areas. All three of them basically had a 30, 35% growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Jumping then to Europe, still growth in Europe a bit of a mixed picture. Of course, Eastern Europe tractioned a bit bigger or higher, particularly Russia still doing very well, but also Western Europe not too badly and Germany doing well, for instance. We see some lower activities, as we've talked about before, particularly in construction, housing related, rental companies involved in construction business. Some of the companies that produce consumer goods require less industrial compressors and so on. So it's a bit of a mixed picture, but still growth. Scandinavia, Alpine region and the Eastern Europe are the brighter spots. If we then take Africa, Middle East, good growth everywhere and also good growth from all business areas.</p>
          <p>Turning then to slide nine, Asia and Australia, you will see a minus 3. And if I then take away Compressor Technique, we are seeing quite a good growth in both Industrial Technique, who is actually working pretty well with the automotive industry as well as general industry, and also Construction and Mining, which is doing very well.</p>
          <p>Now, Compressor Technique had a couple of big orders last year in China and India, gas and process related, but even if you allow for that it was a decrease in China particularly. The rest of the area growing reasonably well actually, but China was softer. You could claim or talk about Olympic effects, but I think overall there is a softer picture in China.</p>
          <p>I think also in our case we have seen &#x2013; you could go back over the last couple of years. Perhaps if I use the analogy with our old rental business or retailing, we have seen same-store growth as well as acquisition or starting up of new stores. We are not opening up that many more offices in China for Compressor Technique as we are pretty well covering most of the country. So that effect is showing. Also there may be a trend that there is a trading done. As you know, we have three different price levels or precision levels, three different brands, and you could see perhaps in some areas, some medium-size industrial compressors, there may be a shift in trading down.</p>
          <p>If we then turn to the Australian continent, we see a very good &#x2013; still good growth in the mining area and relatively soft, but still a small growth in the other areas.</p>
          <p>Turning then to slide ten, I don't think there's much to say with the 26th consecutive quarter of good growth. The next slide shows you the bridge, orders received, revenues, and I think you can perhaps see that the currency effect is rather small for the quarter, but still a couple of percent for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>If we very, very crudely analyze the currency bridge, you could say that's about 200 million or just short of that is on the minor side, if you compare average rates Q3 this year and last year, and there is another perhaps similar around 200 million plus on the period and rates end September.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, there you see the ROCE and you see the 12-month rolling figures. So that's why you have a operating profit of close to 14 billion and operating margin of 19.3 and a return on capital employed around 34. That includes the customer finance, which is not separately accounted for. So if you take away that and just look at the industrial businesses, you should add another 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Moving on, 14, a nice picture of a compressor, an oil-free air portable compressor. As I said, we had a little bit of a slower growth or rather a &#x2013; call it a decline in Asia and China particularly, but for the rest we had a 4% organic growth.</p>
          <p>North America, as I said, good. I think I've said most of what needs to be said about Compressor Technique in terms of geographies. Of course, we see lower demand for construction-related portable equipment. Rental companies are not really ordering much these days. The after-market grew 17% year-to-date and is still around 27% of the total sales, add then rental we talk about 30% roughly being after-market and rental.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, 21.3, compare that with the same period last year, where we also made a capital gain on selling some businesses. Take away that, you could see a slight improvement. But I think there is still a bit more to be done. We are not entirely happy with the way our latest acquisitions are fairing and I think we can do a bit more there. The problem is after a while they get integrated to the extent that it's hard to unscramble. But I think we have a way to go here to improve.</p>
          <p>Then the next slide is just showing what I basically said in the graph, so we jump to next which is Construction and Mining Technique, still very good growth in the quarter &#x2013; organically 17%. Mining industry still very strong from basically all parts of the globe. The profit went up 30%. We inaugurated a couple of factories.</p>
          <p>Now, after-market here is also important. It's about 50% if you take the mining part of Construction and Mining, and that grew 20, 25% if we add spares and service together. The after-market share for the construction-related businesses is somewhat lower since we have no &#x2013; not that much of consumables.</p>
          <p>Looking at the construction around the world, we still see a good growth in infrastructure, particularly in Asia, and I think that listening to statements made from several parts of the world, I think there may in the crisis, as we see, be more efforts, not only in Asia, but perhaps also in the Western world put on major infrastructure projects, which then of course will be playing our way.</p>
          <p>Looking then at the margins at the next point, slide, sorry, you can see that we are now remaining on a high level. We have 18.8 and I think we had 18.9 in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Industrial Technique, slide 18, a 4% organic growth. It says growth in motor vehicle industry. Yes, we did grow quite well in Europe and Asia. And at the same time, we had a decline in North America and US, particularly.</p>
          <p>After-market is growing 19%, and today it's a little bit more than 20, about 22, 23% of the sales. The margin went up from Q2. But of course, it's still shy of what it was the same period last year and the answer to that is the factory restructuring that we are doing. We are basically running, as we speak, with a factory too much.</p>
          <p>The closing of our UK operation will be finalized early in the next year and then we will have a setup with a new efficiency, which should be substantially better than we have. So we will see most likely that improvement coming from then on.</p>
          <p>Moving then to the slide 21, I don't think I need to dwell on that. I think you may rather want to ask questions.</p>
          <p>Then we have a couple of slides about profit bridges and I will just summarize that by saying that, yes, it's a bit lower than what you have seen the last quarters. But I &#x2013; if I'd start from the bottom with the Industrial Technique, you basically have the restructuring case as an answer to that, and that's what I have said from early next year, we will run with a much more efficient setup, which will sort of put that back on track.</p>
          <p>Talking about Compressor Technique and CMT, we have a delay in cost increases of components and materials that happened during the spring that sort of came in with some adjustments into the third quarter figures. We also started to increase prices mid-year, July. That will, of course, not have an effect really in the revenues until end of this year. So I think we are going to see a different picture as we talk from next quarter and onwards.</p>
          <p>Coming then to the &#x2013; towards the end, what we are not happy with is the balance sheet and what we are not particularly happy with is the build up in inventory. Yes, we have a currency effect on the balance sheet. But we have a large sales stock and work in progress in inventory and that is the effect of, I would say, four, five years of being constantly unable to meet production demand and customer demands and, of course, investment that we have made.</p>
          <p>So we have now reached an efficiency, but unfortunately a lot of customer centers have doubted their brother's efficiency in the factory, so there has been built up to stock around. So this is a lot of sales stock that is currently being invoiced, as we speak. By the end of the quarter, we had a lot of goods stuck in harbors and that is all going to be invoiced to customers, as we speak.</p>
          <p>Also the sub-suppliers of raw material, but particularly components, have had difficulties, but they are now since two quarters, so they're able to deliver what we need and more, so the whole flow has been a bit over stocked.</p>
          <p>So although this is not a -- impossible to do anything about and it's also an effect of the growth that a lot of inefficiencies come to the surface. So this is now being addressed, and I will be very surprised if we haven't restored most of the order when we close the year.</p>
          <p>Coming then to the end of the presentation, the capital structure, you see on the net debt to EBITDA, an unchanged quarter three compared to quarter two. That is basically currency effected, would be a bit smaller or lower, 1.3, 1.35, if we allow for currency, but I think Hans Ola may address that if you are interested more in detail.</p>
          <p>Then finally coming to the loan maturity profile that I initially mentioned on the first slide, I think we are very happy or whatever word we should use that given the state of the world today when it comes to financing abilities and financing cost spent, we have a very, very good duration and profile on our financing.</p>
          <p>So I think I have said enough about the cash flow, so I don't need to repeat that and I think that the outlook does not necessarily need to be read loud. So thank you very much and we are looking forward to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Then can I ask the operator, please, just to repeat how to pose questions on the conference, and then we will take it from there.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question for today comes from Johan Eliason from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. This is Johan Eliason, Cheuvreux. Just a question on the inventory build-ups there. You say that you have a lot of goods in progress to be invoiced. But how much of the quarterly inventory build-up is actually due to currency effect in subsidiaries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I will let Hans Ola answer the question on how much is currency. But I &#x2013; one thing I didn't mention that perhaps we also should tell you about, that's of course the shift, geographic shift of our business today is such that we deliver more from, let's say, European factories to far away places in Asia, Australia, Latin America, et cetera. And of course, the shipping time is very hard to do much about. So therefore, you may see a natural sort of anatomic shift in our business. That's one thing. And then, of course, we are also, as we build up factories in China, India, et cetera, we're using local component supplies from these places to deliver to factories and other parts of the world. So there is more, so to speak, goods in transit. But no doubt, the larger part is the sale stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The currency has had an impact on the balance sheet items, including inventory, of course, because the period-end rates from end of June to end of September was &#x2013; included a very dramatic shift on the dollar, although, as we speak, now in October that seems to continue. But anyway, it's roughly somewhere between 8 and 900 million Swedish krona on the inventory side that is pure translation from June to September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then while we are at this subject with the currency and obviously versus the krona the dollar is speeding ahead. And looking at Q1 next year, it's up like 25, 30% year-on-year. What hedges do you have and what sort of effect should we apply going forward if we assume the current spot price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we can say that when we look at Q3, as we have talked about, we have no specific currency hedge effect at all in Q3, we are meaning that Q3 is basically reflecting the spot rates in the third quarter. Now, if we look ahead then into fourth quarter, the direction is obviously very positive for us from that particular aspect. And we will, considering what happened in the fourth quarter last year, as it looks today, see a considerable positive currency bridge, the way we express it, in the fourth quarter. To go in and make speculation &#x2013; or let's say, calculations on that, I don't think it's very relevant since we have seen both 40 and 50 &#xF8;re in one day between the dollar and the krona rate. So perhaps we can come back to that when we have the Capital Markets Day on the 2nd of December instead and give a little bit of more in depth comment about that. But obviously since we knew what happened to the dollar and the Swedish krona in the fourth quarter last year, we already know today, of course, that it will be a positive bridge unless something very, very dramatic happens in November and December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally, a detailed question, I understand you have been laying off people in Germany in Kalmar, which I suppose -- like construction equipment, I'm meaning Dynapac. So what is happening in Dynapac right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I just comment your statement on laying off people, as we have seen and said during the year, we have seen weaknesses in construction, and particularly residentially related ones, but also more in general terms. And therefore we have adapted not only the Dynapac, but also construction tools in Sweden and Germany. And so if you add together what has been released and will be happening until year-end, we talk about close to 500 people and some of those are in Dynapac. Dynapac, as such, given, of course, the rather tough market environment is actually doing better this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, although business volume is about the same. So I think we are on track to improve the business. But obviously, the North American and part of Europe is not terribly strong.</p>
          <p>We see good business in Latin America, Brazil particularly, but also in Asia. And we inaugurated just a couple of weeks ago our new Dynapac factory in India and I am very hopeful that we will see some good business there. So the German factories that we have talked about some quarters ago of being problem children have actually shaped up and are doing much better. If we look at the type of equipment that's most effective today when it comes to the demand side, it's of course the light &#x2013; what we call the light and concrete, which is handheld equipment and also more related to the residential construction. Then we are fortunately &#x2013; Dynapac was not that strong in US. And if we see, I think this is where the sector has had its toughest time. So from that point of view, we also did feel a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. You mentioned, Gunnar, that the leverage in Compressors and Construction and Mining Technique should come back from next quarter onwards, given raw material input prices and also price increases. What about mix then? You should probably have a negative mix in Compressor Technique. How much would that be? And so if we should adjust for these delays in input cost and price increases, what's a good organic leverage at the current factory &#x2013; in your factories would you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very good question. I'm not sure I can answer that entirely, 100% truth and honest because I think there are so many variables on that. But what I'm saying is that if you look back a couple of quarters we have had 35, 40% flow through the way we have measured it. And I see no reason that there's anything principally or systemically, which is a word that is used often these days that should change that. And we have identified these cost components and material increases. So if we come to some kind of a steady state where things are not upset by violent price increases or price decreases, I think we should be seeing that kind of figure.</p>
          <p>Now, when you come to mix, yes, the biggest mix factor is, I would say, the difference between the equipment and the after-market. So if equipment as a category goes down and after-market goes up, it does bode well for the margins, of course. If I look at individual machines or categories of equipment, it is not that much. Sometimes large gas and process orders may be won at lower-than-average margins for the whole compressor business. But it's not huge difference in the margin picture between the different divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. May I also talk a bit about currencies? If I read your annual report, you don't have &#x2013; you don't display any currency risk for the rand or the real or stuff like that. So my question is really, when you sell mine equipment to South Africa or even Australia or Brazil, do you invoice in US dollar? And do you think that the recent weakening local currencies would affect your pricing here or how should we look upon this? Is it relevant to look at the SEK, to these currencies? That's my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's relevant to look to the SEK at these currencies. We invoice in local currencies. And as we have said before, we have a big business in Australia, we have big business in South Africa. What we do when we have major contracts, larger ones with a degree of security, et cetera, we may hedge those specific contracts specifically. Otherwise, we lead the running business at spot rates for the business areas and then at the corporate level we may do certain things. Now, when it comes to the &#x2013; if that is what you sort of implied in your question, the competitive pressure of currencies, I guess you could say that in the Construction and Mining area, most of our &#x2013; or you would have basically euro-based competition and US dollar based competition. That's basically where you have manufacturing and cost of goods for our competitors and you, of course, can guess who they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So is there any possibility to have some of the revenue streams, part of your revenues coming from these currencies, if you only take South African rand, riyal and Australian dollar, but also of course the Chinese yuan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perhaps Hans Ola can give you a sort of a summary of how we look at hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In the annual report that you referred to, Peder, of course there is only the major currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listed, but quite rightly we have virtually hundreds of currencies. I was about to say, not that many perhaps that are positive exposed. Let's say, we have more income that cost, but they are very minor. The ones that you mentioned now are bigger because it's mining &#x2013; mining business is big in Australia and in South Africa and so on. We have of course an exposure there. And as Gunnar said, the reason is we sell quite a lot in that local currency. However, in the mining industry, there is also quite a lot of direct sales due to the customer preference or due to other reasons. That means that we sell in US dollars also part of these bigger deals, so to speak. But most of the business is carried out in these local currencies. But when we comment on the currency effects, of course, we include them all. So &#x2013; but normally, you find 80, 90% of the explanation by looking at those currencies that is highlighted in the annual report. That's where you find the biggest explanation factors always, even though there is an exposure in other currencies as well.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Ben from Merrill Lynch. Two questions please. Firstly, Gunnar, in your statement you talked about contingency measures to cut costs and improve productivity, can you give a bit more color on what you mean by that? Do you mean there are charges coming at all or do you tend to do on a pay-as-you-go basis? And if so, was there anything taken in Q3? That's the first one. And the second, you obviously sound more cautious on mining in your outlook statement. Can you just maybe give a bit of color on what you saw order-wise in September and October and how quickly you expect it to kind of come off its peak? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ben. Question number one, contingency measures, well, we have been talking, as you may remember, for quite some time about the need to slowdown a bit of the investment in treating the street, that we have been quite aggressively doing over some years. And at the time, we said the reason for doing that was mainly the fact that we are not really able to keep up with the training. We were sort of choking ourselves. So we started some time ago to look at that. And what we are doing now when we say contingency measures, we are now accelerating the streamlining of that side of the business. At the same time, we are also looking at our headcounts around the world in various areas. But as I think we can agree, we have at least, as we speak, no need for major large-size sweeping reductions and close downs because we have a lot of variable costs in our business model. So what we are doing is that we are &#x2013; when we see volume going down, we can then reduce the assembly work we do outside and we can pull back working to our own factories, et cetera. So &#x2013; and of course, as I said, when the factory in UK will cease to operate early next year, of course, the workforce there will leave us. So we do not really have to take major charges, if we continue to do this, if we're starting to do this, which we have just started to do already. So I think that &#x2013; you can never speak about the long-term future given what is happening today, but I don't think there's any dramatic change. We can still reduce our run rate of costs quite well without those measures. So I don't think there's much more to add to that.</p>
          <p>The other question was reduction in mining demand. One of the interesting thing in a way is that we had quite a good September, not only CMT, the whole company did well in September. So the last month of the period was actually quite good, but we don't expect this, how should I call it, extraordinary high growth to continue. And I think it's evident when you read papers and hear customers talk. But to the extent it will go down, it's difficult. We are, of course, extremely vigilant in trying to understand that, so we can follow what's happening. But surely last quarter last year was very strong and it's perhaps not realistic to believe that the demand will be of that pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess your next question would have been, so I put it on your behalf. Have you seen cancellations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why not? Yes. We have seen the old cancellations, but we haven't seen a tidal wave. We haven't seen large, huge sort of &#x2013; well, when we speak large, huge, it's not perhaps what other companies call large and huge. But we haven't seen &#x2013; we have seen the odd postponements, one or two cancellations, but we are prepared that it may increase and trying to safeguard ourselves to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe the follow-up on that, of your &#x2013; I think I remember you saying previously that a sizable portion of your drill rigs assembled by third parties, can you put a figure on how much is not completed within your factories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's not only drill rigs, it's also loaders, et cetera. So I think if I take the trucks and the loaders, I think we are today &#x2013; but yes, I am not sure. I think it's about 30% or something like that. It's quite a big part. And on drill rigs, it's probably a bit lower, but it's quite a considerable part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just to complement that, the load, as you can see from the invoicing levels, of course, the load in those factories are still very, very high. So the need for using that capacity outside is still there.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. Just a follow-up actually on orders for your Mining division. Recently an article was published in the US press in which one of your general managers working for the mining division in your North Bay factory pointed out that mining orders were being canceled and that customers have started to cancel on the 1st of October and cancelations were still taking place now. Is that a little bit more negative than you thought for the whole group? That's the first question. Then regarding your inventory levels and your working capital levels, how long do you think &#x2013; you probably answered that already, but how long do you think it will take to unveil or decrease your inventory levels to acceptable levels that you can work on for 2009, which is supposed to be a lower growth year maybe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a last one, on compressors, have you experienced any trends in pricing behavior recently or do you continue to believe that the price increases that you put in at the moment will pass through and will continue to pass through in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Yes, I think it's interesting you referred to that information on the way. Actually it is not as perhaps ominous as it may sound because what it was is the internal orders from sales companies to the factory for drill bits and consumables. So it's not equipment and it's an internal thing. So that was a bit unfortunate, but that doesn't change what I said earlier on the outlook.</p>
          <p>Inventory levels, yes, I think that we should be done with most of it at year-end. As Hans Ola said, it's a little bit of a tricky thing because our factories are running flat out because we have a big order book. And actually the book-to-bill for Q3 was 1. It was positive for the company, and particularly so for &#x2013; actually both CT and CMT had a positive book-to-bill. So the factories are working flat out. At the same time, we are trying to tell them to sort of watch out and behave. And of course, given the past when they have been delayed in deliveries, they have taken perhaps less efficient ways of securing material and components. But if there are no major cancellations of sales stock, and I don't expect that, then we should be done by most of this at year-end.</p>
          <p>Your last question was pricing for compressors, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Have we seen a different behavior in terms of &#x2013; I guess you mean competitors as well as customers to accept price increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>More from the customer side actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they never like it. That's for sure. So it is &#x2013; until now, and as you can see, I think the CT bridge is about 3% price in the bridge. We have been able to do that. The &#x2013; of course, as we speak, we have increased prices by mid-year that will come into effect and show itself, so to speak, in the invoicing in this quarter basically because you increase prices, it takes time, and then you have quotations, et cetera. But it takes time to get them implemented. Today to go out and ask for price increases is pretty difficult because you have, in most cases, of course, material, raw material, scrap metal, et cetera, falling quite quickly. So whatever trains you did miss mid-year, you cannot jump on them now. But so far, I think we are keeping pace with the cost increases. And as I said, we got the cost increases late spring, early summer and don't expect more of that for sure now on the contrary. At the same time, we have increased prices mid-year. So that is what I could say as a summary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I add a follow-up on that one? And I know this is maybe a little bit difficult to ask now. But if you take out your crystal balls and I ask you about the pricing in 2009 and if you were in this scenario, let's say, there is a nightmare scenario in which things are actually going against you, could prices for Compressors or could prices for your CMP operations go down? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think is the most important thing for us is the margin. So if prices go down, costs should go down. Now, we &#x2013; it's hard to &#x2013; how should phrase it? It's not something you like to do, particularly if you have worked hard to mitigate cost increases. But if there are such major shifts in costs and components that market prices tend to go down, they will go down because costs go down. So I don't think the margins would suffer.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Fredric Stahl from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Fredric here from UBS. Could you maybe tell me &#x2013; when you're implementing these contingency plans, could you tell me what kind of a scenario you're working with, what kind of a world you envision when you take these measures? Secondly, if I could ask you about, if you have seen any pockets of weakness in your after-market business? And then finally, if you can remind me about the order backlog in Construction and Mining? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are busy writing because we can't keep too much in our heads at the same time. Okay, the contingency measures against what world scenario, well, I think the most important thing is we have a little Atlas Copco scenario and that basically says that we have been growing more than 20% during five years, every year. And we have for sure built up a lot of inefficiencies. The major aspect or aspiration has been to keep customers happy. We haven't had capacity, we haven't had the raw material and components from some suppliers. So with that background, trying to meet customer deadlines, you do a lot of things that are not very efficient. One of them is trying to build up inventory when you can get the inventory, et cetera.</p>
          <p>One is that you are using more expensive methods of transportation and using outside consultants, and there are a lot of things that don't sort of come to the surface when you grow that much. So regardless of the world scenario, whether that is, as it is, whether it is 10% down or whatever, we have quite a bit to do anyhow. So if we just assume that the outlook we give for the first quarter, we can still do quite a bit to become a bit more efficient. So then, of course, if there is, and we do have, but I think they are internal scenarios, we have scenarios where we have much more, let's say, severe environmental situation. But given our large share of variable costs, I think we have a reaction time which is perhaps shorter than most.</p>
          <p>After-market business, you asked whether that was basically keeping pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I asked if you've seen any &#x2013; examined any signs of weakness, even if it's just a small area. I understand you're doing overall very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no sort of major sign of weakness that I can see. But you have different levels. We have an after-market penetration in China, India which is substantially lower than in Western Europe, et cetera. But the &#x2013; it's growing from that pace. I cannot see any trend, at least not now, that customers try to do it themselves more than resorting to their suppliers. So that is &#x2013; there is no sign of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's still more the other way round that customers today are more interested in doing their core work and leaving optimization of their equipment to their suppliers.</p>
          <p>Then after-market &#x2013; sorry, the CMT backlog, I don't have it in my head. But as I said, we have had a book-to-bill that's been positive for many quarters. Generally, we have equipments with three months, two months delivery time. We still have equipments with up to a year delivery time, so the average would perhaps be in between.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hans Ola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, one can qualify it a little bit more perhaps than the &#x2013; it's actually not such a big difference between Compressor Technique and CMT. If you just look at the orders on hand versus total revenues, we come to only three -- perhaps a little bit more than three months, but obviously we have almost 40% of our revenues that doesn't count orders on hand even. So on equipment, which is the relevant ratio, we talk about on average about six months in both CT and CMT, but there are very big swings inside between the various divisions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions, please. I was wondering if you'd be willing to give us any detail on the rough difference at the moment between the after-market and the OE margins across the group rather than by business area. And the second question was just you are indicating obviously that you are going to run down some sales inventory. I was just wondering if we should assume that this would have any impact on Q4 margins, just given a slightly lower production rate than perhaps we had been modeling in for sales? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with your last question, I don't think the sales inventory or sales stock will have a major change on the margin. I cannot tell you exactly off my head the mix of that sales inventory, et cetera. But I don't think it should really be playing any role really on the Q4 margins. I don't think so, no.</p>
          <p>On the after-market and equipment margins, I think we have to state that they are substantially higher in the after-market and we are talking a pretty big magnitude. They used to be much &#x2013; well, not much, they used to be a bit higher. But I think we are doing not that badly on the equipment either these days. But you can start with a factor three and go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for that. And just, sorry, one more question on your crystals ball gazing, in terms of Atlas Copco's own CapEx plans, have you in the last couple of months made any significant changes to CapEx plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are doing is that we are perhaps delaying &#x2013; we have taken decisions over the last, let's say, two years of investments in property, plant, equipment, et cetera, and we have seen these coming on stream, as we speak. And we are today delaying some acquisition of equipment because that's basically what we talk about a little bit. We also &#x2013; I feel that to get the full efficiency out of what we have already put in place, you need to run pretty full to really get the efficiency before you get in more equipment. So we are delaying a little bit, but it's more a matter of being prudent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And now we will move to Johan Trocm&#xE9; from Nordea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. If I could ask two questions, please. First of all, Gunnar, you mentioned these preparations you are making for perhaps the environment around you cooling off a bit in the quarters ahead. Could you just remind us where you stand today in terms of your flexibility with a high degree of outsourcing, with a bigger share of variable costs compared with a number of years ago. How big a volume decline do you think Atlas Copco could manage today without having to do, what I think you referred to as a more sweeping or comprehensive restructuring program? We're talking 15, 20% volume drop without a big package like that or what sort of levels should we keep in mind when we form our view on where we are heading in the world.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just a quick follow-up on the inventory level. Looking at the inventory there and obviously the equipment, not the currency effect, are we talking goods or work-in-progress for goods which have been ordered by customers and will be delivered out or is there some sort of element in that excess inventory of goods which have been ordered by sales companies, but don't really have end-demand for them out there and which there would be any sort of risks of markdowns or write-downs for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think most of the goods is ordered goods and what we call sales stocks. There is also some element, as I alluded to earlier, that sales companies haven't trusted delivery times, so they have perhaps pre-ordered a bit. But as we are delivering pretty much standardized equipment, should it be a case of a compressor or a drill rig or whatever not being needed in one country, it is pretty liquid in terms of being shipped to another country. So from that point of view, the standardized makeup of our equipment is helping. But it's &#x2013; as we said, it's components coming into our factories, it's work in progress in the factories, it is sales stock going out on ships onboard. Just an example, we had a big, big &#x2013; big shipment from our Garland factory in September that we couldn't get them out of the Galveston harbor because it was closed because of the Hurricane Ike. That's now gone. So there are different things. I am not too concerned. We just have to really make sure that we clean it up.</p>
          <p>Then your other question was, are we very different today from sometime ago when we talk about flexibility and to adapt to a different volume. And you said, the 10, 15% would not require major restructuring and close downs. And I think that's exactly &#x2013; that's fine. I don't think we need to do that. We can handle that volume, as I said. And that's why we are hopefully going to at least not have too much of under absorption, if that scenario is coming true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And without putting an exact number on it, would it be fair to say that if we're looking at more like a 20 or 25% decline, that's the level where you would have to consider things like moth-balling production lines, closing plants or giving notice to a fair number of permanent employees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately most adaptations are requiring some kind of sacrifice on the employment side, which is very unfortunate. But as I said earlier, I think this is happening more around the globe than in any given factory. As I said earlier also, the amount of assembly we do outside is pretty &#x2013; is pretty big and we can also change between our different factories reasonably easily. So I think we are in a good shape to weather whatever the future holds.</p>

          <p>All right, thank you. We will move to Roddy Bridge from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I was certainly looking for just a bit of guidance. Your tax charge was quite low in the quarter. I was wondering if you could let us know what you sort of expect for the year and going forward. Similar, your eliminations in the sort of operating profit line. And I was also just wondering if you can make some comments on the dollar and likely effects on margins. This is something you've been struggling with many years, and you get a very sudden reversal. Is that actually causing as many problems for you at the moment as it is opportunities or what should we be thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the tax charge, Gunnar very briefly alluded to being favorable tax rate in the third quarter and that has to do with certain tax rate adjustments in some countries and such things. So the below 25% that we recorded in Q3, one should not take that as the run rate, rather something like 2 to 3% higher than that going forward is what we would expect. When it comes to the corporate line, it is including some quarters some effect from the corporate hedges as we have said before. We do on a little bit more of a opportunistic basis, if I may say so. We don't have a system whereby we cover X% of our flows, as you know.</p>
          <p>But apart from that, the main thing is really the running cost of the corporate units as well as some elimination of internal profits of sales between the business areas. It's difficult to say what is the run rate. If anything, this quarter and the previous one has been clearly lower, so best guess would probably be around a 100 or something per quarter. But again, one has to qualify that and be careful because if there are sudden and big currency moves, as we are seeing right now, that can be totally different. As we are now seeing a favorable currency development, it means that we see a better and better possibility, of course, and a positive effect in the business area results.</p>
          <p>But as we have done some hedges from September onwards, taking advantage of gradually higher and higher US dollar rates particularly, we will actually have an offsetting negative in the fourth quarter if everything stays as today. That's how it works. But again, I stress that it is in no way hedges that takes away the full exposure, so to speak. So we will look at some positive effect in Q4, if as I said initially things doesn't reverse again.</p>

          <p>Does the dollar cause you some problem in the operating divisions?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the competitive dynamics of the currencies, yes, we have been fighting now six years with a dropping dollar. And of course, we have during that time had and we still have quite a few competitors with a cost of goods footprint in US dollars. That, of course, is now turning more in our favor, everything else being equal. Still we have competitors who have their footprint in euro. We have, of course, more in Swedish crowns than anybody else. We have, of course, American competitors. However, not all American competitors manufacture all their product in US. But everything else equal, it should be less or somewhat better for us, of course, when the dollar goes from 6.50 to 8 crowns to 7.80 competing with the dollar-based competitors.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Roddy. Then we have reached the final question for the session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Our final question for today comes from Magnus Ax&#xE9;n from Evli Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Magnus Ax&#xE9;n here from Evli Bank. I have a question regarding the variable costs in your business model, if you could say that it is approximately the same ratio there in terms of leverage across the whole line of business. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I hear you. And the answer is yes, not that different. We try, of course. We have the view all our product lines should be standardized if possible in Industrial Technique and CMT and CT. And we try to work on our own proprietary developments, manufacturing the core components, and then outsource and partly also out-assemble. So it is pretty similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I then may, a very short follow-up on the cancellation part within mining. Have you any idea, perhaps not a question, but regarding the reasons for those cancellations that have been, if there are more tactical reasons or to have a direct question related to financing issues along the customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you probably have both. As I said, we fortunately haven't had that many, but I think you &#x2013; I can only read and hear what everybody else is talking, financing and demand, and some play the one part against the other. I think you have both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. That concludes today's session. There might be quite a number of questions still to be asked, but I say as we usually do, we will try to, both myself and Ingrid Andersson, our Investor Relations Manager, will try to help you with those questions also after the call as much as we can.</p>
          <p>Finally, though, I would like just to remind everybody that we have a Capital Markets Day coming up in December, December 2. There has been invitations going out, but we would just like to remind that the last registration date is November 17.</p>
          <p>So with that, we thank you all for participating today and have a good night or day. Thank you.</p>
