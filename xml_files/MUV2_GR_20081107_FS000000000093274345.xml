        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, from Munich. We start our telephone conference, Munich Re conference on the figures and results of the first nine months. This telephone conference is also broadcast on the Internet, and there is simultaneous translation in English also on the Internet. That much on the technical aspect's content.</p>
          <p>In recent weeks, we said that we are relatively strengthened in this area of prices, and that our capital and equity basis is very solid. We'd like to share this with you once again, today. Dr. J&#xF6;rg Schneider, the CFO of Munich Re, he will walk us through the financial data of the first nine months; then Dr. Torsten Jeworrek, Chairman of the Reinsurance Committee, Board Member, and he's responsible &#x2013; he will give us information on the cyclical developments, and he will also tell us how benefits can be achieved. Dr.Oletzky, CEO of ERGO with an update up to 2012 from the vantage point of ERGO. We see overwhelming chances even during this time of crisis. Then we will entertain Q&amp;A questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Mrs. Weber. This financial crisis is really the litmus test ever since we have had reporting. It was a difficult year for Munich Re. The share price losses have affected us. As an insurance company, we are of course, affected by the declining economic growth. However, we have done fairly well and we can also say that we see opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>I would like to start with a survey. If you follow the presentation on the Internet, I'll start on page four. We have profits in the first nine months of &#x20AC;1.4 billion. For the third quarter, it was only a small plus in the amount of &#x20AC;12 million. In front of the backdrop of the financial crisis, this is a satisfactory result. However, in view of the considerable further losses of the share prices, it is not probable that the annual profits to the tune of &#x20AC;2 billion will be feasible. What is much more important, however, is that our financial strength remains robust. Our equity has been stable since the first of July, and here the quality of risk management of course, is brought to bear. And we owe this primarily to our well-balanced capital investment portfolio. For this reason, we also reinforce our ambitions for the years ahead with a profit target of at least &#x20AC;18 per share for 2010.</p>
          <p>We continue to our share buyback, and we will propose to the Supervisory Board in the Annual Meeting to keep the dividend unchanged in the amount of 5.50 per share also for the current fiscal. In spite of the darker clouds on the business even are not unrealistic because the financial crisis makes reinsurance more important, and our customers will benefit from the stability of Munich Re.</p>
          <p>On page five, you see the development of the Munich Re shares, and the most important comparative indices during the current year. Of course, we are not happy with a loss of more than 20% up to the 5th of November. Yesterday, there was even another change, but indices declined even more. So, the difference has become even more pronounced. Munich Re shares, since the beginning of the year and we can go back even further, these all-important other indices in spite of the decline of Munich Re shares since the beginning of the year. So, the markets appreciate the clear course of Munich Re, and they also praise the expertise of Munich Re.</p>
          <p>Now a few comments. You know that the accounting regulations have become use the IASB in London, and the EU Commission rapidly entered new regulations for accounting, which allow the financial institutions to reclassify their shares. And we welcome this in as much as this can stem the crisis. However, Munich Re does not use these easier terms, because even until now when signing to the various categories, we were very conservative when it came to using these options in accounting, and time values were only used where they were useful to serve the interest of the category under review. And in economically turbulent times, we wanted to preserve continuity and to also guaranty the transparency of our accounting activities. Munich Re does not need these changes and will not use them for the time being.</p>
          <p>Now page eight gives you a rundown of the dramatic changes in the marketplace that we observed in the marketplaces. Now, here you'll see the time sequences since the beginning of 2007 for shares and the risk-free interest on the left panel since the beginning of the year. The EuroStoxx up to the 30th of September went down by 31%, also very substantial losses for all other important indices.</p>
          <p>The spreads have become more pronounced. This of course, decreases the value for risk fixed-interest bearing vehicles, but of course, it offers opportunities for careful investments which we may use often, I will talk about this a little later.</p>
          <p>The capital base is &#x2013; even after the losses caused by the financial crisis, remains robust. Of course, we have less equity than we had at the beginning of the year, a minus of &#x20AC;4 billion, but on the 30th of June we have the same situation in the rate, which might be even more interesting because of the changes mentioned since the 30th of June in the third quarter, very few unrealized losses, minus &#x20AC;2 million, and high positive changes because of the developments of the rates of the exchange, and we could afford to buy back our own share. So, there is only a small minus of 8 million in terms of our own equity. The book value or the equity value per share is &#x20AC;105 at present.</p>
          <p>Now this good capitalization also creates a considerable leeway for us. The available capital for the basis of the risks to pay &#x2013; to use to cover the risk which we have is more than sufficient. Our internal account says that the available sums have gone down during the current fiscal, plus almost equally the necessary capital has also gone down for the simple reason that we had much smaller market risks in our investment portfolio then was the case at the beginning of this year. Also as far as the rating is concerned, we have a very stable position. We are well placed in the AA rating domain in all important aspects, the solvability ratio belong &#x2013; it's 270% of the necessary level.</p>
          <p>So, we have a very solid capital base, which opens scope for action for an organic growth of our business and also, for selective acquisitions, but let me mention, the strategy is the most important feature in our eyes. So, we will not opportunistically for the reason of short-term benefits buy something which doesn't suit the overall design of the company. And secondly, we're extremely careful and conservative, when it comes to backing the financial solidity and the future prospects and also, we see future acquisitions in this light. We are not in a hurry, prudence is more important than speed.</p>
          <p>The composition of capital investments is on view graph 11. Here you'll see the investments, we have 22.2% loans, which have gone up considerably. These are fixed interest vehicles, which we are booking in the balance sheet that the up &#x2013; they are immunized, in Europe, the ups and downs of the rates of interest. And this also shows the conservative accounting of Munich Re, because we didn't benefit from this when the interest rate was high and we did not show them as profits. What is striking is the reduction of the share count to 9.3%, and taking into account, the derivative instruments, it's only 4.6%, and you see this even more clearly on view graph 12, 9.3% without and 4.6% when we take into account derivatives. If we were to do a check today, we've reduced our risks even more, the hedging ratio was stepped up, and so we would have an exposure to the tune of 2 to 3%.</p>
          <p>The yields of our capital investments are shown on view graph 13. We had high non-liquidity active write-downs of shares to the tune of &#x20AC;4 million &#x2013; 4 billion, of which 1.8 billion in third quarter, also high write-downs and write-up. In terms of derivatives, however, we had a positive balance here. The derivatives are being used by us to hedge against share price losses, and we had 1.5 billion negative in this context. Then we had write-down on fixed-interest financial instruments of &#x20AC;20 million, and a clearly small sales result by 1.4 billion below the previous fiscal. The previous fiscal would emphasize, this was characterized by high extraordinary revenue especially in the field of real estate and shares, both phenomenon. The sales phenomenon and write-down and write-up account for about a 3 billion deterioration of the capital investments, and that is the difference between this year and the next.</p>
          <p>In the bottom of the page, you'll see composition &#x20AC;3.3 billion that was the average capital share development, 3.1% return, which is acceptable in view of the general market situation. The reason is primarily to be seen in the composition of our fixed-interest portfolio, which you see on view graph of 14, it's well-balanced, that's the beginning of the year. And even today, we have a lot of government and semi-government bonds, which means that we have an overall performance, compared with the competitors. And of course, they had much more risk exposure, credit risk exposure products in which the competitors invested. We have attractive spreads and we've increased our involvement, you see this on the left, in structured products, 5 instead of 4%; right the US agencies are &#x2013; which are now run by the US government are included in this; then Corporates 8%, compared with 7, and Pfandbriefe, which we still feel are very safe in spite of the most recent reduced liquidity, 27% instead of 25%. So, we have interest in spreads and we make use of them.</p>
          <p>Now here a brief look at the segments, before my colleagues will &#x2013; Mr. Oketzky and Jeworrek will talk about the operational developments in the various segments.</p>
          <p>On page 15, you'll see a survey of the operating and consolidated results of further declines in all segments. In reinsurance, it was moderated by the ERGO dividend, which is paid to Munich Re AG, in its capacity as reinsurer is the hatched areas in the view graph. Then the figures on reinsurance are on page 17, I can be very brief, gross premiums written stable. Then of course, investment result declining in spite of the ERGO dividend combined ratio for property casual, 100.2%, which is more favorable than many expected this from the outside. We had high hurricane losses, however, the base portfolio &#x2013; the base development amongst major losses has developed as gratifying for us. The operating result was &#x20AC;2.7 billion for the third quarter, only &#x20AC;132 million.</p>
          <p>On page 19, now you can see combined ratio in quarter three. A simple situation, we had huge foreign currency results because of the US dollar, pound, sterling and Canadian dollar are important currencies. There were considerable weaknesses. To note, there was a reduction of Life reinsurance, which declined almost compensated by the affects from the purchases by Midland and Sterling, and also, by interesting organic growth, also partially in direct &#x2013; in activities which were close to direct insurance activities on page 19. The combined ratio now because of higher natural disaster expenditure of 760 million, and man-made disaster of 458 million, both of course, slightly above the average of the last five years. We can be quite satisfied with the overall result. The Hurricanes Ike and Gustav accounted for almost 400 million in this sum.</p>
          <p>Now some comments on direct or primary insurance, chart 91, booked gross premiums written a moderate growth, and capital investment results clearly declined &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Combined ratio property-casual 90.2%, and because of this gross combined ratio also an operating result decline, which in view of the difficult constraints is quiet acceptable, &#x20AC;674 million as operating results.</p>
          <p>22, gross, hardly any foreign currency effects, because our sales are almost all written in euro. The acquisition was a Korean direct insurer, Daum Direct, with &#x20AC;74 million, and very gratifying organic change in organic growth in Eastern Europe and in Turkey we are pleased to report on that. The premiums in life insurance were by and large similar to those of the previous 0.6% decline, a moderate decline. However, we are not altogether happy with that development, because the effects of the least possibilities made themselves felt at the end of the year, so the savings options refers to capitalization of product had of course, a plus of 11%, whereas in the rest of the business, the IFRS premium and the prime premiums that can fixed as gross premiums were declined &#x2013; have declined by 2.3%. However, we were very happy with the development in the property casualty developments on chart 23, both in terms of growth and results.</p>
          <p>We had a combined ratio, 88.7 in the third quarter, and also, for the first nine months, 90.2% confirm, the operational strength of ERGO that takes the lion share in this development. The decline of combined ratio was attributable to the fact that we had somewhat less natural disasters, which caused losses, and also, because we consistently tried to improve our cost structure. We had a moderate improvement in &#x2013; that could be expected in this context.</p>
          <p>That much on our figures, I would now like to ask Torsten Jeworrek to report on the opportunities in the reinsurance industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, J&#xF6;rg Schneider. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to give you an overview of the market situation in particular, at the beginning of our realignment phase. And I also would like to talk about the questions, what has happened during the two months of the Monte Carlo, and I would like to talk about two things, the financial situation of the insurance and reinsurance industries worldwide, which has a great impact on our renewal situation and also, supply and demand. And two, I would like to talk about the developments, which the reinsurance industry can see, and I would like to talk about the flight to quality that is higher risk awareness, when it comes to buying reinsurance products.</p>
          <p>I am going to start on page 26. I would like to give an update about a chart, which I showed you in Monte Carlo. It is about the question what does the capitalization of the insurance, as well as, the reinsurance industries look like. At the time, that is in the beginning of September, we announced an estimate based on an internal study, where the capital or the developments of the capital base &#x2013; at the time, it was August &#x2013; was estimated for the period until end of August, and for the reinsurance market, we arrived at minus 8% in comparison with the figure of the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>According to the recent developments in the capital market, we updated our estimates, completed it, and you can see the latest figure, the estimate is minus 13% by the end of 2008. This means because of the capital market development over the last two months, we have the expectation that the equity basis will be accelerated in our sector. And at the same time, and I'm sure you're familiar with that, there are various external estimates from <mark type="inaudible" /> for instance, referring to the US market or rather the US insurance markets, P&amp;C and casualty. This means, by the end of the year, the equity base in the property-casualty sector will fall by 80 to $100 million, this means that the so-called excess capital in the American sector will be used up completely, and this means that the insurance industry in the United States is really, say, in difficult times.</p>
          <p>And then, you see that we have now an environment with lower interest rates, and for the insurance companies, this means that the capital yields with a view to cash flow will be reduced, this means technical prices and respective requirements will rise. So, technical pricing will be increased, as I said, and in order to be able to cover losses or claims.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the capital yields will go down. This will also have an impact in particular, for the development next year. It is our estimate. And the consequences for Munich Re has not been changed because of all this, but we believe that, as was our original announcement, we have confirmed the developments. This means we will have more pressure with a view to technical pricing, but nevertheless, the Munich Re will stick to its ideas and will improve things considerably.</p>
          <p>Two, in the beginning negotiations about renewal, we &#x2013; this depends on customer and segments &#x2013; we have clear indications to reduce the retention rates. And of course, this is a trend, which we've seen in other areas as well, not only deductibles have been maintained, but also the deductibles were reduced. Third, in particular, in distress &#x2013; that is companies in distress, there is demand for high yields; this refers to life, as well as non-life. They will offer an alternative to capital or equity financing and other matters.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we also have an increased risk awareness when it comes to buying reinsurance products, so the flight to quality is increasing. And there is a recent study from Benfield, which is a week old, they are the reinsurance broker headquartered in the United States, and for 2009, they expect and as &#x2013; say, defend or uncertainty for the clients, we cannot say that a broker has got one or the other bad intentions with a view to reinsurance companies, and I can say that the brokers' statements tally with the statements with &#x2013; coming from us. So, we can see that there will higher prices in the near.</p>
          <p>On page 27, I would like to elaborate on flight to quality. I believe this is very important, because in times of systemic risks and realization of systemic risks, a sustainable &#x2013; or promise of sustainable or lasting performance means that even in the case of claims which have to be paid out several years later, the company is still in a position or will be in a position to fulfill its promise. Now, the ratings do not always reflect the best picture of a company. When talking about the economic stability of the company, we can say that we and many market players and customers say that they read this from the markets environment, and credit default swaps are being used. They are shown on page 27.</p>
          <p>Here you can read the capital market opinion, that is, to what extent is the failure &#x2013; or higher &#x2013; how high is the failure rate. And if you look at the CDS and how can you use them to safeguard your company? Basis points are used to measure it, and for us it is very important that if we compare this directly, Munich Re versus other market players in the insurance and reinsurance industries, there &#x2013; and here you'll see the comparable values in the footnotes. These are the companies with which we compare ourselves, then you see there is lots of confidence and trust in the activities of Munich Re.</p>
          <p>So, in other words, you must also quantify things like this, if customers want to safeguard themselves against any losses or any failures from Munich Re, then I think, this is all very well projected here.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, it means a very good product, which the &#x2013; which Munich Re sells the customer may look like those of others but the quality of the product is often not a different one. And I mentioned that already, we feel confirmed in our activities and we will not get away from our strategy. And of course, we've got to differentiate the approach, depending on the profitability height, the loss experience and customers and markets, that's quite sure.</p>
          <p>Now customers can expect that we will offer high capacities, make available these capacities if the prices are right. On the other hand, we will also be very consistent when it comes to reducing capacities or when it comes to shifting interest-bearing things to other regions.</p>
          <p>Now, the estimates and this &#x2013; the scene from retrospective view, if you look at the market's development in the market then it all depends on how the reinsurance response to retrocessions. And of course, the responses will be different. On the one hand, capacities will be made available, this is one approach. When it comes to the retrocession market then I can say that the retro capacities are falling, that is the capacities made available from capital players have been reduced drastically during this year, as in other renewals are also being reduced, and the retro market became narrower, which of course, is also reflected in the prices. And therefore, it should not be a surprise that some of the market players think of &#x2013; and even announce buying few of those retrocession products.</p>
          <p>I would like to conclude with chart 28, and I would like to point out that when it comes to pricing, and when it comes to increases in prices, one aspect is very important to us. We are going to couple this or link this with our policy of offering differentiated prices, so the differentiation practice will be changed in our business. We believe that this is not only good for Munich Re, in particular, where we need higher prices. We also believe that different products will take into account the different levels of safety, and that different prices must be offered to the customers and the customers will be ready to pay these higher prices. A win-win situation actually. We offer performance, we offer capacities, we as Munich Re, and of course, we make sure that we will benefit from the prices and that's what will happen in the future. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Jeworrek. Thank you very much. As the figures of the direct insurance business have already been discussed by Mr. Schneider, I would only like to discuss the number of changes in ERGO. On a number on topics, we have made progress. As far as sales are concerned, the bundling of the brokerage systems of the various ERGO brands, and for a clear cut development of the volume have been promoted furthermore with the rollout of the next generation of our field service has been started. So, the various measures from the sales project are fully up-to-date, and as far as the health insurance markets are concerned, transparency was our main issue. We want to set new signals and the first results can only be reported. The Victoria "Riester" policy has been defined by Finanztest as the best product in this field.</p>
          <p>In international business, we are starting to take over the last shares of ERGOISVI&#xC7;RE, our Turkish subsidiary. And in international business we had considerable premium growth, especially driven by the developments in Poland and in the Baltic states. And furthermore, also when it comes to process optimization, cost reductions we're fully in plan and making considerable progress.</p>
          <p>I would now like to discuss briefly our three important domestic segments on chart 31, we talk about life insurance. In this field, of course, we are dealing with the consequences of the financial crisis. The negative developments in the markets will obviously be a burden for the insurance industry and the customers, and there is no denying that.</p>
          <p>Don't feel safe, but ERGO's capital investments are conservative, and we have reduced our share portfolios. So, our customers and policyholders needn't worry. The financial market crisis, obviously also offers long-term opportunities because the requirement for good, private, old age insurance is very promising. And of course, we benefit from the inclination of the population to save money and the insurance industry is in a good position, compared with other products.</p>
          <p>On chart 32 in terms of health, of course, we are planning for the 1st of January, 2009, this is our focus. The health reform does not solve any of the problems we think and the competitive strength of the legal health insurance systems will hardly benefit from the legislative measures.</p>
          <p>So, we try to provide good quality provisions, and we wanted to get a good foothold there. A new product generation has been started, which offers modular tariffs, and it is designed to meet the specific needs of various target groups. And obviously, because of the new constraints and the framework of conditions, we are also focusing on customer loyalty, and of course, we have had various headlines to implement this. We are a private health insurance company, and we can offer superior health insurance products. So, our customs in composite business is shown on chart 33. They very gratifying development of ERGO continues. Our loss ratio is on an excellent level and also, in new business and premium development. We are fully in plan of the year 2008 up to now. This is true for private clients in motor where the exclusivity organization, our co-operation with BMW is developing quite well.</p>
          <p>But, it's also true for commercial and industrial business, where our knowhow is a great asset. That much on the current developments, and I'd like to give the floor to Mr. Schneider to summarize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can be very brief, and thank you very much, Mr. Oletzky for your statement. We had a very satisfactory nine month result, because we're in an exceptional year when talking about the capital markets. Our annual result will not reach the target, which we set ourselves but in the mid-term, in the mid-run we are still optimistic and this is due to the aspects, which Mr. Oletzky and Jeworrek mentioned.</p>
          <p>We remain optimistic that we will generate a profit of &#x20AC;18 per share for the financial year of 2010, and we think that we will still be able to meet our or reach our objectives because we have lots of scopes, lots of latitude. We want to continue with our share buyback programs. We are going to conclude these programs with a view to 2008.</p>
          <p>But there is another important signal, the dividend for 2008 correspondence to that of last year that is &#x20AC;5.5 per share. I think, this is an excellent yield for the Munich Re shareholders. Our capital strength, despite the losses, which we sustained, is quite robust still. And, we believe that, we will be strong &#x2013; we will go through with the crisis and will be stronger after the crisis in comparison with other competitors. Thank you very much and now questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Operator Instruction]. First question Axel Hertla from the Handleplatt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have got two short questions, could you tell us what the write-offs are for the fourth quarter, and in view of weaker market? And the second question, what's &#x2013; to what extent would this correspond to the profit of the share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Mr. Hertla. Prices in comparison with the 30/09 of the EuroStoxx have fallen by 16%, DAX, 17%. This is quite a lot. Therefore, we would like to write-off more. But according to current regulations, we are writing off very speedily, so we are not pushing or delaying things. But I cannot quantify and I will not do so, because it doesn't really make sense to give you a current figure that a figure for today. Of course, there will be a profit, and there will be a respectable profit, but I cannot give you more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, do you mean, profit for the whole year or for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a profit for the whole year, but I cannot give you any figures for the fourth quarter, unfortunately. Usually we would generate 6 to 700 million per quarter. The fourth quarter is not a quarter where dividends will emerge. And of course, we also have an exposure to &#x2013; because of natural disasters. Therefore, I don't think, we should give any statements or announcements in the beginning of November talking about the respective quarter. And of course, any other aspects have to be taken into account, but at end of the day, we can be quite optimistic.</p>

          <p>Our next question Stefan Koenig, Bersen Sitrome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And my question follows the question of my previous person. What about 2009 and the outlook for that year? As you mentioned, there will be more pressure on the reinsurance yields, now could you give us some kind of guidance? Or are you looking at a situation or looking at the market development in a very cautious way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Koenig, I think, this must be a misunderstanding, because I hoped that I expressed the contrary. There's no pressure on yields, but we will higher rates, when it comes to reinsurance technologies. Here we want to raise our profitability and this is what will happen during the renewal phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Mr. Jeworrek, I did not misunderstand you, because you also mentioned the other use, because of the low interest rates. And therefore, we thought there will be a pressure on the insurance contracts. So, in this respect, I would like to ask my question. Will this development, this downward trend continue in 2009 or will there be a guidance for the results or are you still cautious with respect to these figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Mr. Schneider answering this question. I'd like to take over, this is Mr. Schneider. We're not that negative with a view to 2009, because owing to our relatively conservative accounting methods, which is very close to the respective quarters, we will be able to handle things right away. We are not delaying things. Our current interest rate is not impaired, we have got interesting spreads when it comes to company credits, which will also balance off things to some extent. So, for 2009, we do not see any special burdens so to speak for our results with the exception of course, of any business related or cyclical developments. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question Oliver Swiss from Bromark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In comparisons with the Hannover Re, I would like to ask you and also, Swiss Re, you see they said that they will scrap the dividend for 2008. Or they will discontinue share buybacks in order to benefit from the development in the reinsurance market next year. Why did Munich Re not do that? Do you want to keep the same dividend or want to pay the same dividends this year in comparison with the one paid last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've got plenty of buffer and we can continue and you see share buybacks at lower prices are more attractive in comparison with higher prices, so why should we discontinue. Well, doesn't that mean, how shall I put it? Don't you think you &#x2013; few financial possibilities, smaller latitude or leeway. This means, if you leave it on the same level in comparison with the profit, well, you see this an important aspect, but the leeway is sufficient. We are not entering the markets with flying colors. We will be very cautious in handling our capacities. But Mr. Jeworrek is the better person to answer this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one comment. Mr. Schneider mentioned the buffers, says Mr. Jeworrek. I can say, that our capitalization is really very robust. We were be able to absorb or digest write-offs. If you look at the new business and what it means, with a view to capital requirements, all this has been reflected in our risk model, which we publish once a year. And you see that even with substantial higher contributions which we need with a view to our &#x2013; diversification of our portfolios. Of course, this means we will need more capital, which when looking at today's capitalization, can be handled using these buffers. So, I think if condition &#x2013; terms and conditions and prices are right, then our business will be, okay, thank you. And our next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I've got a question about the overall burden the company has to bear because of the financial crisis. Could you give us an idea, so that we can quantify the situation? And about Iceland, is there an exposure in this respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mrs. Dawa the overall, say, burden in particular, for the profit or loss accounts &#x2013; now looking at 2000, sorry looking at 2008 and 2007, if I look at this two years together. Then I can say that we've considerable, substantial write-offs and burdens with a view to shares and fixed interest bearing, securities 250 million was the figure. If you add up everything, then you end up with a 3.6 billion burden on the results. But this has to be correlated with profits from the derivatives, this means we will now have a figure of 1.4 billion, this relates to capital aspects only. So, we have a minus of 1.4 billion with a view to our profit and loss accounts, the income statements. So, all this is because of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Well then the next question, Iceland, it doesn't affect us. We can say that the exposure is of a smaller mid-sized, well, it's a medium two digit amount, in terms of millions amount. And the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we hear you very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Okay. I just wanted to ask &#x2013; and I think this was in the second report you said that you will use structured finance products again. Are you going to continue to do that, what will it look like, and when do you think you will increase your proportion of the shares? Now, is that something, which you do not discuss or not want to do, or do you plan a further reduction of the shares you hold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Gold. In the first quarter, we invested in structured bonds, but in a very moderate way. After that we held back, but these are tactical decisions of may ark and of course, I rely on their activities after the performance which we had over the last two to three years. About the shares, now this is very difficult question, having had the shares &#x2013; or having shares is something, which is not really fun. Mr. Jeworrek wants to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our de-risking program, we reduced our share exposure down to 8% until the beginning of this year, that is, within the group. And I can say that when looking at the risk aspects, if something really goes wrong, then I can say that we always felt very well with this situation. The current situation is the risk management measure, and I think it was put into practice very well by our company and this is the reason why we are well positioned in this respect.</p>
          <p>Now, the plan, what we're going to do well, we've got a plan with a view to the risks and we did not take away the old framework. So, we also would like to buy some more shares but not higher than the 18%. So, the risk will be handled, opportunities well, I do not know when the share stock, or the share base will be increased. We do not know. If you use some kind of gambling process and start buying things, this is something, which we will probably not do. But nevertheless, we are thinking about this.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian Kramer Reuters. Yes, good morning, Reuters, Munich. I think, one or two of my questions have been answered already. Therefore, I've got one left only. About primary insurance, you see in Austria, the Fokus Bank AG, has to raise its capital base and this involves Victoria as well. So, I would like to ask you whether we would go along with this capital increase and how much money you will invest, and this is my question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's right. We have a shareholding in the Fokus Bank AG. We cooperate with the <mark type="inaudible" /> and others and I think what worked well in good times, should also work in bad times. But please, bear with me that I cannot give you specific details about this capital increase.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two brief questions. First, addressed to you Mr. Schneider, in the past you always showed your interest in parts of the American AIG, you made this known, have you made any progress. What is the state of affairs there, is there a time window in other words, what is the process like for the time being and a question to Ms. Oletzky, please. We all expect that next year, there will be a recession. You sounded relatively optimistic, I must say, as far as the future &#x2013; the immediate future is concerned. What else do you expect for primary insurance business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Mr. Frumpt first, on AIG. Yes, we said we're interested and that is true because parts would fit our portfolio very nicely and of course, we have had very good experience when it comes with the M&amp;A tactics and the time handling, et cetera. We want to be fairly close now, so I hope you understand this. Mr. Oletzky, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course, we cannot exclude that there will be a next &#x2013; a recession next year when the business situation will become difficult. And of course, that will also affect the insurance industry, sometimes with a small delay. But of course, we have to expect that the insurance industries, especially primary insurance, will be affected.</p>
          <p>But when I sounded relatively optimistic, is for the reason that, compared with our competitors, we are firmly based and the loss development is quite good. But of course, the situation might become more difficult in life assurance, and we will feel this just like the competition. I think it is a little premature to want to comment on the future developments of demand.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question Heiki <mark type="inaudible" />, Der Spiegel</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Heiki <mark type="inaudible" />, Der Spiegel. There are two questions to Mr. Schneider. Mr. Schneider, you've said that the group results will not reach the 2 billion. But you never said how much you do expect in fact. And I wanted to know the small profits in the third quarter, will they have a repercussion on the payment of the Board members of Munich Re?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That was intentional that I didn't say what profits we expect for the current fiscal, for the simple reason that the share prices fluctuate to such an extent at present and because our rigid accounting rules that we are embracing. The lowest value principal is also being used for IFRS. And you see we have a very small share exposure. But that still involves sums that are important for our overall result, not for capitalization. Here, we are fairly resilient and resistant. So, I hope you bear with me that I don't give you a new forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Second question, will it also affect the remuneration of the Board members?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have incentives, which is based on a very well balanced system, short and medium-term elements. The medium-term element plays a very important part in our remuneration,, because we want to make long-term progress in our company. And the annual bonus is dependent on the return on risk-adjusted capital. The risk-adjusted capital has changed very little; the return has changed very much. It has decreased, and of course, we'll feel this in our pockets, and that is perfectly all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you give us more &#x2013; how much will you feel this is the follow-up question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that can be read in the business report. I cannot even give you a spontaneous answer. I always look at this situation a year after the fact. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question. Herbert Fromme, FTD, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Mr. Schneider, you said more than 3 billion profits have been between 2 and 3 billion, now you are less than 2 billion. Sometimes we feel that Munich Re does not accept the fact that there is a crisis and that it will affect Munich Re, is it so smart to do this in such a piecemeal approach? Is it always reasonable to say that the competition is worse off and, to Mr. Jeworrek, I'd would like &#x2013; should I ask immediately or afterwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can respond to your question Mr. Fromme. Thank you. Obviously, we changed our overall targets twice and we did not indicate a new target. I would have preferred a different situation, I must admit. But should I have said in August that the prices will go down by another 20%, share prices status. And I come up with the statement, the only alternative would have been not to mention target from the very outset. But I'm under the impression that the majority of our investors are quite happy with our philosophy in this field. One, we want to have a return on risk-adjusted capital and then we say what assumptions and conclusions under normal situations would be the result.</p>
          <p>And our investors can follow very precisely how the assumptions will prove to be correct or incorrect. And they can also do their math, what this means for us. If you see, for example, where the analysts assess our results, both for the current quarter and for the entire year, then you'll see that you can follow this very nicely based on the information we provide. So, I do believe that what we do is quite appropriate beginning with next year. We will then use operating results, and so this will also include a certain degree of normalization with the CDS rate. Of course, it can change. But, we believe that we are resilient enough that we can handle negative developments. Sorry, I cannot understand the question, the telephone connection is very bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The rating was quite good. Then it was deteriorate &#x2013; now you have the spreads. Isn't that dangerous, if all kinds of new competitive standards are introduced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not believe that because it's really striking &#x2013; in the CDS, then it comes from the right direction. Because we know that some of our customers of our clients are protecting, hedging themselves with CDS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you use the capital market as the main yardstick for the risk adequacy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I only want to see to it that we are using these rules, I'm not saying that this is the only criteria and rating continues to be important. Now, the question for Mr. Jeworrek, Mr. Fromme?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said repeatedly that the market is getting tougher and of course, there are only a few weeks until the first of January, and you must be able to report till that date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Fromme, we're at the beginning of the renewal. In the treaty business, we have the first negotiations, but no contracts have been finalized, and I expect a repetition of the last one or two years, where most of the treaties were concluded early, or in the middle of December. In other words, the negotiations have been started, levels are being tested, that is the current state of affairs. We see concrete signs in the field of retrocession. On the facultative side, where we not only, as of the first of January, concluded treaties but also get new risks on board during the year in facultative and energy and also, aviation. Because the renewals started on the first of October.</p>
          <p>And the situation in these areas is as follows, aviation plus fire, industrial is experiencing a period of change, all types of rating developments are observed in aviation. It starts to go up, the renewal shows the first effect, in fire, industrial we have both situations, we have price hikes more than 10%, incidentally 10 to 15% in other classes. We have price reductions, however, they have something to do with the fact that this is into the behavior of the competition where portfolios, or partial portfolios ,were the intention of these activities. The energy business, the oil platform, offshore energy et cetera, price increases and aerospace sees price increases.</p>
          <p>Then there is an area, which you have to look at in a separate context, that is credit. In credit, we have some highly exposed markets, Spain, UK and the United States. Here, we have clear cut price increases, however, if you will, these are a reflection of the increased expectation for a recession, so with the prices you cannot automatically say that the profitability goes up, because you will also have high default ratios. And you have to see to it, how much do we actually need in the other markets. Germany and the other European countries, it is more moderate, but in credit prices go up. That is the state of affairs. Now, contract, I cannot tell you. Treaty, I cannot tell you, sorry. And I think, I don't want to give you any indications during the negotiation phase because it is also an obstacle for quarterly calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions to Mr. Oletzky, if I may. The first one, life insurance especially Victoria, in view of the share crisis, do you now have problems to pay for the guarantees that you happen to handle the guarantees that you have given? And in Europe, of course, the life insurance business is very much a capital investment business, so do you feel that the stock market crisis and other crises are already a disturbing factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. First question, the answer is no. Victoria life will not have any guarantee problems. We have a share ratio, which is so small that the development in the share markets will not create any dire straits for Victoria leading capital investments, while we certainly won't encounter any problems with guarantees in Eastern Europe. For the time being, there is a moderate weakening that we can fully fear the repercussions of the crisis, something that I cannot confirm now. And I think probably there will be a time lag, and it will make itself felt in the insurance industry. But of course, we follow this very closely, especially in the Eastern European markets. And market share, Victoria, the current market share, is that what you want to know?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will it go up or will it go down, or what do you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have not succeeded in a full turnaround.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question  Liebenau from <mark type="inaudible" /> Magazine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got three short questions. The third quarter surplus amounts to 1% in comparison with the figure of the previous year. Don't you think that this figure could have been a negative as well? Therefore, my question, what about the loss provisions for the third quarter? Next question, what about the book value per share, how can it increase? You see the equity figures have been going down since the third '06, so the best procedure or approach might be to buy back shares. How many shares were bought back in the third quarter? And then I would like to compliment you on the good performance of the Munich Re shares at least today, I can say, plus 10% at the beginning of trading, and at present &#x2013; it means that you are present at the marketplace also with share buybacks. And the third question, long-term returns; the plan was 4.5%, now do you intend to correct or modify this return target or what will you do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for this question. Well, a small company and quarterly surplus and provisions, of course, this is a question, which immediately comes to your mind, I understand. Now, I can reassure you, we have looked at the good and bad developments that I can say that there will &#x2013; that there won't significant changes. Book &#x2013; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the loss provisions, so same amount as last year, third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there were ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, and this has to do with a speed of how we handle any claims. So, you've got large, short tail events that can be handled and processed very quickly. if you've got long tail, if you want to extend your long tail business, then of course, you've got higher loss or claim provisions. But it is not something special, what we did in this respect that in particular, we did not dissolve any loss reserves, when looking at the result as a whole. Book value per share, yes, indeed, it's a bit high because of the share buybacks. And you will find that on our &#x2013; or you will find the details on our website, and in particular, in the third quarter, normal programs were executed second tranche until the 30th of September, 2.4 million shares were bought back.</p>
          <p>Your question whether we are present in the marketplace? Yes, we are present in the marketplace with very a small element from the current buyback program, but I do not know what is done today, because we've got tranches between 150 and 250 million, and they will be passed onto one bank. And then, we completely refrain from interfering in any decisions that the banks might do. So, we think that these purchases will be handled in a very profitable way, and afterwards we do not influence anything, so I do not really know what is going on at present. You can only see that on the website with a few days delay. I think, these were your questions. Long term return, oh, sorry, yes, I forgot that question.</p>
          <p>Well, we will not modify or correct this figure. We want to see what the development will be in the near future. And it is also very difficult to assess what the risk free interest developments will be. You see the expectations have been lowered slightly. On the other hand, we have to see that the facing countries which have to finance lots of measures will enter the marketplace, and I'd be a bit cautious whether or not this trend of lower interest rates will be reflected in the returns. And then, the spreads and the credit risks have become attractive, and this means we do not see any reason to lower our expectations, in the mid-run, we would still use the 4.5%.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Oletzky, I would like to ask you, what is the proportion of the ERGO shares, 5%, or was that changed, because this is what you announced in June 2006, i.e., you wanted to buy these 5%, and then if it is still is 25%, what about the remaining 55%, when will you, or when do you intend to buy them?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, property 75%, life at the beginning of the year was taken over completely, and the remaining 25% well this is something which we want to take over before the end of the year. So, I'm talking about property insurance.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's a short question, following upon what Mr. Zeus asked you. It is about the share buyback program, as far as I understood you, you said you've got enough money to do everything, share buybacks, then money can be channeled to the operative business, payout dividends, no question &#x2013; no question of priorities. So, you've got plenty of money to do everything you want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Gould, we are not really talking about say very large amounts, if you think of the remaining share buybacks 2008 and 2009, still a large amount has to be bought back that is 2009 until the AGM. So, these are not amounts, which are of crucial significance to the capitalization. Dividend, 1.1 billion, I think, this is an excellent figure, but I think, we want to emphasize continuity. We also want to have our shareholders participate in our activities and developments. And Jeworrek described that all this is being done within the framework of our well diversified portfolios. So, talking about M&amp;A, I can see that we do not see any spectacular M&amp;A chances meaning that we could use or raise our reserves. I can only say that the capital base is a robust one, and we've got necessary and sufficient buffers. And this offers various alternatives and options. Now, choosing one or singling out one or the other option, well here we have to take into account priorities, but at present we cannot say that everything is being kind of drives by bottlenecks or something like that.</p>

          <p>Well, we haven't got any more questions. Therefore, I would like give Mrs. Weber, the floor for your final remarks.</p>
