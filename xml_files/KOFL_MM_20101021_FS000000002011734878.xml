        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter of 2010, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our different business profile. Despite bad weather conditions in our Mexico and Latincentro divisions, and the challenging sweetener cost environment we have faced during the year, we improved the profitability of our balanced portfolio of franchise territories.</p>
          <p>Our ability to selectively increase prices across our territories and the strong results posed by our Mercosur division were the main drivers of our performance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were close to 25.7 billion pesos, down 1% from the third quarter of 2009 mainly due to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar. On a currency neutral basis, our consolidated total revenues grew 13% for the quarter driven mainly by selective price increases implemented across our territories and the strong performance recorded by our Mercosur division.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our consolidated sales volume remained stable. Double-digit volume growth recorded in our Mercosur division compensated for the volume decline due to adverse weather conditions in our Mexico and Latincentro divisions. That resulted in disruption of our distribution network.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated gross profit increased slightly to 12.1 billion Mexican pesos in the third quarter of 2010. The appreciation of the local currencies in the majority of our operations as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominator raw material costs combined with the operating leverage from higher average prices per unit case offset higher sweetener cost across our territories. Consequently, our gross margin improved 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated operating income grew more than 7% to 4.2 million pesos in the third quarter again supported by the stronger operating income growth achieved in our Mercosur division. Operating leverage across our territories accomplished to higher prices in local currencies produced an operating margin expansion of 130 basis points to 16.5%.</p>
          <p>On a currency neutral basis, our consolidated operating income grew approximately 21%. Our consolidated EBITDA increased close to 6% to 5.2 billion pesos in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our net controlling interest income remained stable at 2.1 million pesos. Higher operating income was mainly offset by the expenses related to the restructuring of certain compensation plans within ourselves and distribution workforce and the recording of our financial costs related to the sale of bonds in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Now let me expand on the performance of our operations. In the face of strong volume growth in the third quarter of 2009 in Mexico and the effects of unusually bad weather conditions during this quarter, our Mexican operations sold more than 315 million unit cases recording a less than 2% volume decline year-over-year. These volume-related events were responsible for disruptions in our distribution network.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, 3% volume growth in our single-serve water portfolio was more than offset by a mid single digit volume decline in our bulk water business combined with a 1% volume decline in our sparkling beverage portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our average price per unit case rose 5% in the third quarter. This increase resulted from selective price increases implemented over the past 12 months combined with lower volumes of our bulk water portfolio, which, as you know, has a lower average price per unit case.</p>
          <p>As a result, our Mexican operations' total revenues grew more than 3%, reaching almost 10 million pesos. With regard to profitability, the impact of higher sweetener cost was offset by our operating leverage from higher average prices per unit case and the appreciation of the Mexican peso as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material costs.</p>
          <p>Compared with the third quarter of 2009, our gross profit increased close to 4% to 4.9 billion Mexican pesos, and our gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 49.3%. Our operating income decreased 1% to 1.7 billion Mexican pesos. Operating expenses rose primarily as a result of the resources deployed at our Mexico division to support our growing but still diverse platform, enhance our execution of the point of sale, bolster our turnover base and improve our cooler coverage.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 16.9%. Our EBITDA remained stable at 2.1 billion Mexican pesos, compared with the same quarter of last year. In summary, our Mexican operations demonstrated the strength of our defensive business portfolio delivering stable results for the quarter despite the unusually bad weather conditions, which resulted in lower volumes. The strong preference among consumers for our portfolio of sparkling beverages allowed us to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our ability to increase prices, the appreciation of the Mexican pesos applied to our dollar-denominated raw material cost, and our operations' ability to balance our sweetener needs with high fructose corn syrup are helping us to mitigate the higher cost of sugar.</p>
          <p>As we enter the final quarter of the year, we continue to see volatility in to our prices. Despite this challenge, we believe that our revenue management strategies and our cost discipline will continue to enable us to partially compensate for sugar cost pressures.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn our attention to our Latincentro division. Our Latincentro division's volume declined 5% in the third quarter. This decline was also related to unusually bad weather conditions in our Columbian and Central America franchise territories.</p>
          <p>In Columbia, total volume declined 5% during the quarter. Higher volumes from flavored sparkling beverages were outpaced by lower volume from brand Coca-Cola, our water portfolio and our still beverage categories. Despite the unusually bad weather and increased competitive environment, consumer preference for our portfolio with sparkling beverage has allowed us to gain market share on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, our volume decreased 5% during the quarter. Low single digit volume growth in brand Coca-Cola was more than offset by lower volumes in our flavor sparkling beverage portfolio. Despite this volume decline, over the past several months our sparkling beverage portfolio has been enable to outperform the industry.</p>
          <p>Our Central American operations sales volume also declined 5% as a result of unusually bad weather conditions during the quarter and that reflects on our distribution network.</p>
          <p>Our Latincentro division's total revenue declined 22% to 7.6 billion Mexican pesos. This decline resulted mainly from the effect of the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela. On a currency neutral basis, our Latincentro division's total revenues grew 16% driven by higher average prices per unit case across our operations. With regard to profitability, our Latincentro division gross profit declined close to 20%, reaching 3.6 billion Mexican pesos as a result of the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>The impact of higher sweetener costs across the division was offset by the effect of the appreciation of the Columbia peso as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material costs and operating leverage from higher average prices per unit case in local currencies implemented over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Compared with the third quarter of 2009, our gross margin expanded 170 basis points to 47.1%. Our operating income declined 3% to 1.3 billion Mexican pesos. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues in local currencies combined with lower marketing investment in Colombia and Venezuela resulting in operating margin expansion of 320 basis points reaching 16.4%.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA declined 2% to 1.6 billion Mexican pesos compared with the third quarter of 2009. Our Latincentro division delivered stable results compared with the second quarter of 2010 despite the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela and the unusually bad weather conditions in Colombia and Central America. In local currency terms, the selective price increases implemented over the past several months designed to compensate for local inflation on higher sweetener costs are helping us to increase our Latincentro division profitability.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about our Mercosur division. In the third quarter of 2010, our Mercosur division total revenues grew 23% to 8.1 billion Mexican pesos. Excluding beer, which accounted for 819 million Mexican pesos, our total revenues reached 7.3 billion Mexican pesos. Higher average prices per unit case and volume growth accounted for all of these incremental revenues.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in our Mercosur division was up more than 10% in the third quarter of 2010. Our Brazilian operations recorded more than 13% volume growth driven mainly by brand Coca-Cola in the turn over presentations, along with the continued strong performance of the still beverage categories supported by the Jugos del Valle line of beverages.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, our volume grew close to 3% resulting from the solid performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 5% and our still beverage categories reported by Aquarius, our flavored water brand. With regard to profitability, our Mercosur division's gross profit increased 26% to 3.6 billion Mexican pesos. Higher sweetener cost across the division combined with increased PET costs in Argentina were offset by our operating leverage from higher prices in local currencies implemented over the past 12 months and the appreciation over the Brazilian real as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominator raw material costs.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 44.8% for the third quarter. Our operating income grew 37% to 1.3 billion Mexican pesos. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues in Brazil was partially affected by higher labor and freight costs in Argentina. Our operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 16.2% in the third quarter. Our EBITDA grew 27% to 1.5 billion Mexican pesos. In summary, our Mercosur division delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2010. Leveraging strong consumer and economic environment in Brazil, the continued preference for brand Coca-Cola among our consumers is driving higher demand.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the rate of our beverage categories are growing at double-digit rates. In Argentina, we have recently seen strong macroeconomic indications. However, we remain cautiously optimistic about the translation of these figures into consumer demand and a sustained level recovery in this market.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed the integration of Matte Leao brand products into the non-carbonated beverage platform we share with our partner, the Coca-Cola Company. Incorporation of these products into our portfolio will reinforce our offering of non-carbonated beverages in Brazil and will help us to capitalize on to strong brand equity, consumer preference and high growth potential of this brand segment.</p>
          <p>Now, let me walk you through our financial performance for the quarter. This quarter our geographically diverse portfolio franchise territories help us to deliver sustainable cash flow generation compensating for seasonality or weather-related events. Our pricing initiatives across our territories and the strong performance of our Mercosur division were the main drivers of our cash flow generation. As of September 30, 2010, we had a cash balance of 11.20 billion Mexican pesos, and our total debt was 17.2 billion pesos. Our net debt to EBITDA coverage ratio was below 0.3 times, and our EBITDA to net interest coverage ratio was close to 14 times highlighting our financial flexibility and the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The ample cash position and the strong cash flow generation our company has built, has given us the flexibility to continue growing our business both organically and to acquisitions in the beverage industry while increasing dividends to our shareholders. With this financial flexibility, we embrace the important responsibility of being prudent and disciplined with our usage of cash and ensuring the value creation of the alternatives we pursue.</p>
          <p>As you may know, on October 14, we made an announcement regarding the preliminary understanding to acquire Grupo Industrias L&#xE1;cteas in Panama. We are pleased and enthusiastic about this potential transaction, which will allow us not only to incorporate into our Panamanian operations, the leading player in the non-carbonated beverage segment in the country, but also to capitalize on the vast experience this company has built in the dairy category.</p>
          <p>As this is a specialty process and since we are bound to a confidentiality agreement, we are not disclosing original information about the transaction. Rest assured that as we advance in the negotiations and we receive the necessary approvals from local authorities, we will share more detailed information with you.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our operation delivered positive results for the quarter. The performance of our Mexico division continues to demonstrate our ability to increase prices in real terms for the second quarter in a row building on the strong brand equity of our portfolio products. The solid performance of our Brazilian franchise during the year has been an important driver allowing us to deliver increased profitability.</p>
          <p>As we enter the final quarter of the year, we remain vigilant about prevailing economic conditions and cautiously optimistic regarding consumption trends across our territories. We believe that our company is taking the right steps to compensate for the still challenging high cost of sweetness. We are confident that the brand equity of our products, the operating capabilities we have developed and the financial strength that we have achieved will help us to continue outperforming our industry.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued trust and support. And now I would like to open the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Lauren Torres. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. H&#xE9;ctor, I know on several occasions you mentioned weather impacting volumes in Mexico and your Latincentro division. But just curious how much of that weakness that we saw in the quarter do you think was truly weather-related or are you seeing any fundamental changes with respect to how consumers are behaving in these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Lauren. We believe, and it's kind of difficult to have an estimate of the weather effect, but we believe that the majority of the fact that we have &#x2013; of the production in Mexico and in Central America, especially because of the very heavy hurricanes that hit the area at the beginning of the quarter. Clearly, we have extraordinary rain and extraordinary cold weather compared to other years.</p>
          <p>That's very difficult to estimate. The estimate that we have that is a little bit more realistic has to do with the disruptions of broken bridges and highways that were interrupted, and that's causing a lot of problems for us to be unable to reach our clients, which are the small mom and pops. Some of these small mom and pops also disappear for a while because they were under water for weeks. Now we're in the process of refurbishing or helping to refurbish some of these mom and pop stores with new coolers and things like that because some of the equipment was destroyed.</p>
          <p>The estimate that we have on that respect &#x2013; with respect of the logistics interruption, it's not that a large impact but is in the range of 1.5 million unit cases in Mexico that will explain around a third of the reduction that we have in volumes around. Of the 6 million unit cases that we have in Mexico and <mark type="inaudible" /> interruptions. The rest is very difficult to judge if it's related to the weather, although, as I mentioned, we had &#x2013; for example, July was the month that we had heaviest rain in the last 60 years in Mexico on record. So, that's clearly <mark type="inaudible" /> very difficult to give you an estimate.</p>
          <p>And I also believe that as we improve prices, increase prices in real terms that also has small effects. The good news here is that as we look at some of the market share trends, this clearly has been more an issue related to the holdings. And therefore, we have been able to increase slightly our market share according to recent industry posts.</p>
          <p>In Central America, it is very similar impact. The similar explanation about logistic interruption obviously are in a much smaller market. In Central America, we are seeing around a million unit cases that would percent a &#x2013; a larger percentage of the drop in <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And then when you move to Columbia and Venezuela, it has to do more with values from other trends that we are seeing like the Columbian consumer spending a little bit more on durable goods and, therefore, saving a little bit on some of the consumption of our products. Venezuela has to do a lot with a microeconomic environment. And then both Brazil and Argentina, we did have the positive impact of volumes mainly as a result of, as we said in the press release and the speech, related to the introduction of Matte Leao brand products in Brazil, but has presented an affordable products to the consumer that is helping us a lot on that consumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, may I just follow-up and kind of round it out? A couple days ago, Coke's CEO mentioned that he expects to see Mexico return to more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. I assume you're comfortable with that comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are confident with that comment. The only caveat that there is that October it's a month where last year we had very, very difficult high comp because it was like the record October on <mark type="inaudible" />. So, for the fourth quarter we'll see volumes starting to recover in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Gustavo Oliveira with UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. The question is on the price mix and the price increases that you are delivering in Mexico. Could you please comment a little bit the reasons for that substantial increase in this quarter? And what are your expectations going forward for the price increase in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In Mexico, we have been doing some price &#x2013; selective price increases in different markets, and I'll give you some examples. We moved the 600 ml at the beginning of the year in areas other than Mexico City from 7.5 to 8 pesos. Then we &#x2013; more recently, we moved it in Mexico City the same movement, from 7.5 to 8 pesos. The three liter Coca-Cola, we moved it from 20 to 22 pesos, which is like a 10% increase, which is an important increase in pricing. That was done in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Very importantly also, you remember this line of business that we launched with Jugo del Valle Foods, the flavor drink with low juice content that we started when we launched that a couple of years ago at 3.5 pesos. We took a leadership position, and now as we are the leader there, we are doing important price increases. At the beginning of the second quarter, we increased the price from 5 to 6 pesos. That's basically a 20% increase that will give us gas the rest of the year. And the same is true for the same product in 2-liters from 11 to 12 pesos.</p>
          <p>So, if you turn it &#x2013; in the rest of the year, I don't think that we will move any other prices in Mexico because we pretty much have the prices that we want, the pricing architecture we want. Obviously, it is going to be very important to judge how sweetener costs continue to move, and if that is being translated or not into some pricing pressure in our industry. If you give it &#x2013; my best estimate is that we stay with the price points that we have that would take us to positive prices in &#x2013; slightly positive prices in the end of the year. And we're happy with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a follow-up question on your commercial policies. You also mentioned in Mexico that you are deploying extra resources in coolers and in the distribution and so on as part of your new commercial model. Could you please provide some &#x2013; the status of this implementation and what stage you think you are and whether you're still going to see some OpEx pressures for most of 2011, or are you going to start seeing benefits of this new commercial model already kicking in in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gustavo, I think it's &#x2013; you bring an important point there. The Company has gone through a process of designing and what we believe is improving our commercial processes to tackle and to be able to handle a larger number of SKUs as we diversify our company's growth to improve our categories. Without those efforts, selling food and buying in Mexico together with South America will be practically impossible. That restructuring is pretty much advanced in Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico, we mentioned that we had a hick in other income line below the operating line, and we see that in the consolidated numbers that is basically related to restructuring our sales and distribution, the compensation of sales and distribution workforce.</p>
          <p>What is happening here is that as we segment the market or challenge in a better way, we didn't necessarily have the flexibility to move the compensation packages of our sales and distribution employees to draw more flexible manner. In other words, we are attending a very large client that will distribute a large stock, a very large drop of cases there. We're &#x2013; I'm going to use the word contaminated by the way of saying a very high variable compensation related to a number of cases that were working.</p>
          <p>Those cases were, to me, a big drop size. It was most important to start the rescaling &#x2013; reshaping this compensation package so that we can pay more on an upward delivery basis regardless of the number of cases that you are delivering. So, that's part of the restructuring charges that we had this quarter. It amounts to between $25 to $28 million in Mexico. And we believe that the savings that we will start to see starting in 2011 and in the future would basically &#x2013; would pay for that restructuring with a year and a half or two years of savings in the future. So starting in 2011, we should be seeing this better operating expense line in Mexico where we are doing the restructuring. In Brazil and the rest of the countries, we're pretty much advancing the segmentation. We need to work a little bit also on this restructuring. And then we will continue to roll out these new models in the other countries.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Jos&#xE9; Yordan with Deutsche Bank Securities. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. Quick question on the difference in let's say the gross profit increases in Latincentro versus Mercosur. With lower volumes, you were able to increase your gross profit 170 basis points, as opposed to Mercosur with great volumes and pricing and also a strong currency and only 100. So, can help us understand why the big difference? Is it all price in the strong Colombian peso or was there something else going on there that is not immediately apparent? And I guess the other question I had was, if you can remind us why you're showing FX losses when the peso has appreciated this year? And even net of the derivatives gains it's still showing a loss so &#x2013; try to understand that better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. The Latincentro division is presenting some numbers that are difficult to explain because of the large evaluation of Venezuela. When you look at Venezuela and you have &#x2013; and you convert those numbers into Mexican pesos basically by half. You, obviously, would affect out to see the total revenues with a very large reduction versus last year. But as we have been able to increase prices very importantly in Venezuela and the profitability of Venezuela has not suffered that much when you look at &#x2013; as the numbers translated into Mexican pesos.</p>
          <p>One of the elements that is a bit of strained analysis explaining is increasing gross margin is like &#x2013; is that last year, we were acquiring some of the raw materials. Remember we had a lot of pressure from the Cabibi Institute, the agency that distributes foreign exchange to buy raw materials. So, we were acquiring &#x2013; raw materials that are extremely high, affects compression rate. So in some cases, we were buying close to eight bolivars per dollar because otherwise we would not have the raw materials and would have to stop our production.</p>
          <p>With the new instruments that the government in Venezuela has presented to the industries in order to have access &#x2013; when you don't have the ability, you don't have the proper documentation, you have access to a third official that generates around 5, 5.3 bolivars per peso. They also improve a lot in the delivery of dollars at the number one bracket, which is 2.6 bolivar per peso. So, nowadays a lot of our raw materials &#x2013; most of the raw materials because we have all the documentation in order, we are having access at a 2.6 exchange rate in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>That has created this starting our improvement in the margin when you compare to last year and that we were buying raw materials. We not only &#x2013; we didn't have access to the control it generates, but we were buying in &#x2013; at the silent market because that was the only possibility there was available. And that's the main reason why you see very large reductions in revenues because of the translation of Venezuela bolivar at half the rate into Mexican pesos. Profitability in Venezuela has improved a lot because of this fact that I mentioned in the raw materials, and some price increases that we have achieved at the total profit level. Basically the Venezuela result has doubled and, therefore, it has stayed &#x2013; once you divide that by an exchange rate that is doubled, it is basically staying the same in Mexican peso terms. Long explanation, but I think that it merits the explanation.</p>

          <p>In the &#x2013; the other element that Venezuela brings in to the table and that's why the interior cost of financing looks a little bit weird because we have a lower debt level and rates have come down, although we have some rates that are fixed-rates, so obviously that we are not benefiting from this reduction of rates in that area. But as we have been able to buy some Bolivar &#x2013; excuse me, PDVSA and Venezuelan government bonds in the marketplace so that we take advantage of the official process to buy dollars in the market. We have been buying some of these bonds. And, as we said, those bonds basically to have cash balances in our Venezuelan operations and to pay for some services, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We have been incurring some losses, accounting losses. We register everything at 4.3 and we are getting some dollars, green dollars, in our cash balances in Venezuela at a rate below the other <mark type="inaudible" /> market, below the 5.3 bolivar. But we have been doing some of that activity, and that has affected our total cost of financing. And that's also &#x2013; the situation in Venezuela is disturbing some of our P&amp;L numbers, and that's the case on the financing cost.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good day, Hector, and I was curious with respect to the charge in Mexico. I wasn't really clear in terms of whether or not this is a one-time payment that you're making to change union employee contracts that will allow you to go to kind of a larger component of fixed. And then, I'm also curious as to, over the near-term, how much will this add to your fixed cost structure until you can begin to post the operating leverage that you expect over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Robert. Yeah, this is a one-time restructuring effect and that's why we put it in that specific line, and then we will disclose that with our royalties. Otherwise, it would have been in the normal operating line. As I mentioned, there's around $25 to $38 million restructuring. Basically, we are compensating the employees, the sales industries and employees because of the contract that they have, and rehiring them, most of them with a new contract where we have the flexibility that we want. The savings that we estimate to start in 2011, it should be around $12 million, $13 million on a yearly basis. So, that's why I am saying between one-and-a-half, two years to repay for this one-time expense.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes, good morning. I was curious regarding the new acquisition in Panama. Admittedly it's a small piece of the overall business. But it puts you into the dairy segment a little bit with probably different logistical and cold chain requirements and vulnerabilities to a different set of input costs. Can you comment a little bit on whether you plan to go more heavily into this area going forward and how you plan to deal with the new challenges that the acquisition brings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Margaret. Let me start a little bit on that, and obviously some of the details, as I mentioned, we are bound by the confidentiality agreement with <mark type="inaudible" />. Some of the specific details of the company and the transaction we cannot disclose. But let me give you some background on this. When you look at the profile of Coca-Cola FEMSA, and in conversations that we have had with our partner, the Coca-Cola Company, obviously, because we are <mark type="inaudible" /> on this venture. We see that we have very good penetration in carbonated drinks and sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>We have a relative growth penetration in water. We still need to do a lot of &#x2013; some more competitive market. We were late in that category. So, we have a long way to go there. We may &#x2013; two, three years ago we were in a position with Jugos del Valle to enter this category with a number two run in Mexico and a number one run Brazil. Our partner acquired <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil, which is now part of the system in Brazil, which revolves under the same scope of this 50-50 joint venture. Would you look from a strategic point of view there is this missing part in the non-alcoholic beverage segment, which is dairies and value-added dairies, which is really what is important for us.</p>
          <p>And that category in the territories where Coke is present at the moment, it's almost the size of water and is double the size of juices and nectars. And so it's a huge area of opportunity where we don't have a large experience other than selling some products that were products produced by us &#x2013; by others &#x2013; produced for us by other companies, and we did some meals with chocolate flavor in Brazil and Mexico and things like that.</p>
          <p>So, when we learned that this company was for sale, it was very clear for us that it was an opportunity to enter a very small market where we have a national footprint. This company has a 60-year presence in the &#x2013; the absolute leader in Panama any way you measure the market share and revenue share and everything. They are the leaders on <mark type="inaudible" />. They are the number one players in non-carbonated products with juices and nectars, which we haven't started our introduction of Jugo de Valle line of business in Panama. They are the number one player with beverages with low juice content, having more than 50% market share in the Panamanian market.</p>
          <p>And are starting to do something with bagged fruit. They <mark type="inaudible" /> the fruit citrus in Mexico. For us, it's important also to take into consideration to that. They are the absolute leader in ice cream. They have 85% market share in ice cream, which is a small market, but it is also there. And so, for us it's what I'd say a picture perfect opportunity to enter this category, learn from that, understand better that category. They don't have any agricultural &#x2013; they buy their meat from local producers. They don't have any cows in their company. Our main competitor, the Pepsi competitor in Panama is <mark type="inaudible" />. They are competing in milk. They are the number one, in long duration, competitor in Panama.</p>
          <p>So, when you put together all these factors, it was clearly an opportunity &#x2013; a very important opportunity that we should &#x2013; that we think that we should take advantage of that. Our idea is to operate that market. This is a small country -- a totally controlled environment for us in that respect. And if we have good learnings and we see that we can export those learnings to other opportunity, then we'll analyze case by case. It is very competitive. We have very strong competitors in the other countries &#x2013; in the other countries where we participate. But I think that is an opportunity for us to experiment and do some learning and see what can we export from those learnings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Hi, H&#xE9;ctor. My question has to do with the trends of non-carbonated soft drinks versus carbonated soft drinks in Mexico. I'm a bit confused. I'm seeing a deceleration &#x2013; well, first of all, a decline in non-carbonated soft drinks in both Mexico and Latincentro, but what I'm surprised is that the decline is much faster than the carbonated soft drinks consumption in those two regions, in Mexico and Latincentro, isolating obviously for jug water and bottled water. And the question is how do you see the role of non-carbonated soft &#x2013; first of all, what's explaining that and number two, how do you see the performance of non-carbonated soft drinks going forward in those two regions, H&#xE9;ctor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alan. You are right. I mean when you look at some of these trends, it looks like that some of the non-carbonated groups are decelerating. I think that we have two or three points that is important to highlight. One is that also these weather related events obviously cause a lot of disruption. And as I mentioned, some of the clients were under water for a long time. But that <mark type="inaudible" />. I believe that because of the smaller base, even a small reduction in number of cases looks a little bit larger in terms of percentage wise.</p>
          <p>And the other &#x2013; I believe this is the most important element, Alan, is that we have been substantially more aggressive on the pricing side on these non-carbonated products. I gave some examples of how we grew, how we increased the price of, especially the orangeade, the Valle Fruit that we started &#x2013; I mean, a little bit more than a year ago, we were at 3.5 pesos, and now we are at six pesos in some retailers. So that has created much better profitability for the company that we're looking for that, but that's also obviously, as these orangeades represent 35, 40% of the volume of non-carbonated products. That certainly has slowed down. It is not growing at the pace that we were running when we were selling at 2.5 pesos.</p>
          <p>So, I'd say those are the main reasons. I'm not worried about the deceleration of these. I think that the normal trends of juices, nectars. Juice-based products growing a little bit faster than carbonated soft drinks where you have very high per capitas in the country where we participate. And not so large in the non-carbonated products. I think that that trend will continue, but this is &#x2013; my feeling is that it has to do a lot with the pricing and, as I mentioned, a little bit the weather.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just &#x2013; I mean, if I am understanding correctly, basically you will continue or you will try to close the gap between non-carbonated and &#x2013; if you see strong demand in non-carbonated soft drinks, you will take pricing there so as a way of managing or balancing the demand between carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated soft drinks in Mexico going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that we need to have the portfolio and give the consumer whatever they are requesting. I think that we have done very good market share inroads in the non-carbonated products, including some products where we were very far way in terms of market share like in isotonics. I mean, obviously, we are not off marketing all of the time because of the work up and all of that is making very large inroads versus <mark type="inaudible" /> and the isotonic categories. These are growing very interestingly.</p>
          <p>We have obviously a very small market. Energy drinks are also increasing with some products that are designed with a lower price level and with a different consumer than the normal Red Bull and things like that. And obviously, juices and nectars, which is the base of all of these has also been going through a lot of regulatory changes with respect to labeling and what you can sell or not sell in the schools, and things like that. But juices and nectars continue to grow not at a very fast pace compared to the other products that I mentioned like teas, isotonics and energy drinks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very useful. One quick follow-up on a totally separate topic, the dividend. You mentioned that &#x2013; in your prepared remarks that one of the things that you will be taking a look at now with the record low levels of net debt to EBITDA that the company is having right now. What's the message for investors regarding the dividend for managing expectations for next year because the yield remains quite low, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that we have been, obviously, receiving a lot of indications, a lot of the preoccupation of the market with our capital structure. And basically that means that pretty soon we'll have no debt. As we have said in the past, we have in our D&amp;A this idea of continued growing. I think that although we -- there have been some opportunities like this Ecuador franchise that we mentioned in the past that obviously we were not <mark type="inaudible" /> that franchise. But we continue to see some opportunities.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned in the past, I have been presenting to the finance committee and to the Board of Directors this specific issue which is we have capital structure that is not efficient. And we don't have an acquisition in the near-term, and it's very difficult to judge if near-term means 12 months or 18 months or whatever. We should be thinking about increasing the dividend here. And the Board of Directors have been receptive and the finance committee have been receptive, but we believe that at this moment in time we cannot decide if we are increasing or not our dividend yield importantly, because we think that we'll have opportunities to grow. And that's basically &#x2013; we are pretty much in the same state. What I want you to have comforting is that &#x2013; it's and issue that is present in our minds and the Board of Directors and the finance committee is aware of this issue.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Martha Shelton on behalf of Celso. My question is around operations in Argentina. I just wanted to see if you could offer an update on the commercial model roll out going on there? And also any thoughts that you have around the consumer environment in Argentina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Martha. In Argentina, I think that Argentina &#x2013; let me just stay back here, step back. Argentina, the main issue that we have is that we have pressure to &#x2013; both to increase prices by our plans, the big supermarkets that are run by the government unofficially. We have pressures on the salary and wages that had impacted a lot of our own salaries and freight costs because a lot of it is done by third parties, and that they have a lot of pressures on the salaries.</p>
          <p>They increased the freight charge to us. So, in there what we are working is expanding this commercial model to the big clients, to the supermarkets. And I'm trying to replicate what we have been doing in Mexico and to a certain extent in Brazil. And we segment our channels to have a different way of approaching how we serve the big clients.</p>
          <p>As a very important element, I think that that is important for all of you to know is that we just opened a new distribution center in Argentina that is dealing a lot with automization and laser-guided decoys to load and unload trucks and all of that. It is a way to starting to move into a more automatized warehouse. I think that we are going to learn from that. We work very closely with the union leaders also so everyone is an agreement that is a new model that will help us have a better efficiency in our facilities.</p>
          <p>And I think that will be a learning experience for the rest of Coke FEMSA to see if we can also import that knowledge to other countries. But I think that in Argentina the restructuring that we have to do has to do a lot with the margin that is staying with the intermediary because in some cases in areas that are very difficult to cover, we use third parties with margins and the changes in the commercial malls have to do more with that. How we restructure the margin that is there in the marketplace without increasing the price to the consumer, but capturing a bigger share of the margin that is there in the budgeting.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Argentina, we are seeing a little bit more &#x2013; something similar to what I expressed about Colombia for the consumer because we are seeing an important growth in the economy. The consumer is dedicating a little bit more resources to our goods and that's why we have been &#x2013; this quarter, we have a positive volume number. We have a stronger with the volume numbers in that region. And I believe it's an industry wide trend because we also see positive market share and numbers in Argentina.</p>
