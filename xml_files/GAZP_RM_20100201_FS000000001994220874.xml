        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome you to yet another teleconference dedicated to the publication of our consolidated financial reports by Gazprom prepared according to IFRS covering Q3 '09.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] My name is Peter Bakaev. I am in-charge of the Department for Finance and Economics, and I would like also to introduce people from other departments. Sorry, Head of Capital Markets Directorate.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Amongst us at this teleconference in attendance we have First Deputy General Director of Gazprom Export, Sergey Emelyanov.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Head of Consolidated Reporting Department, Mikhail Rosseev.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We have also Vasily Smirnov, who is the Head of the Economic Appraisal for Pricing; [Foreign Language] Alexander Dushko, who is the Deputy Head of the Financial and Economics Department.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And also amongst us we have our colleagues from the Department of Accounting, Department for Foreign Economics Operations, the Department for Marketing and Gas Refining and Liquid Hydrocarbons. [Foreign Language] And specifically, Alexander Nikolayevich, who is the First Deputy Head of the Marketing Department.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As usual, we are holding today's conference in our traditional format and we shall start with a presentation for your convenience, our slides as is the custom were supposed to be uploaded on the Gazprom slide in the financial reporting part of it, hopefully there are there now. [Foreign Language] And this is being confirmed.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The main emphasis for our today's teleconference, we suggested we should make on our nine months reporting since by the end of this week, this coming Friday. We are holding the Investors Day of Gazprom investors, where we'll be able to raise questions to the management and executives of the companies, covering all areas of interest to you and next week the meetings, which shall take Tuesday in London and Thursday in New York, where the members of the management board will be participating, the Deputy Chairman of the Board, Andrei Kruglov. Similarly, we will have Alexander Medvedev, and Mrs. Vasilieva, who is our Senior Accountant of the company and the Head of the Department of Strategic Development, Vlada Rusakova and also the representatives of Gazprom Neft and Gazprom Energo Holding.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Before we start with our operational results for Q3 '09, I suggest that we should take a look at slide number four, which is our general picture of the main financials and then later on we shall come back to them to discuss them at a greater detail level.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Compared &#x2013; looking at Q3, the company revenue was RR 771 billion, having gone down by 8% compared to the previous period last year. [Foreign Language] The company revenue through nine months was RR 2.4 trillion and this decline was taking place against the backdrop of the declining of sales in our leading markets. [Foreign Language] The adjusted EBITDA here in the reporting period was RR 208 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And despite the sales revenue going down, the net profit went up by 33% being at RR 175 billion in Q3 '09 comparing to the similar period last year. [Foreign Language] It is worthwhile noting that by the end of the reporting period, the total debt of the company changed towards the negative figure comparing to June '09, but the debt burden remains at an acceptable level.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now, let us switch over to the operational results for Q3 '09 and start with our leading market, which is the gas market. [Foreign Language] The total gas sales by Gazprom in 3Q '09 practically didn't change compared to the similar period in '08 and was at 103 billion cubic meters. [Foreign Language] And despite the reduction of the European sales by 18% in Q3, the revenue from the European sales went down by 8% despite some tangible reduction in the gas prices there. [Foreign Language] And despite some reduction of the gas sales and despite the higher gas prices in 3Q '09, the revenue from the gas sales in former Soviet Union went down by 26% being at RR 24 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now let us take a look at slide number seven, which shows situation in the Russian market. [Foreign Language] And so, despite the situation our changes were amounting to about 10%, but thanks to the adopted pricing policy and the increase in the regulated prices, including as of July 1, 2009, it all led to the increase of price in the domestic market in Q3 by RR 237 or 14% compared to the similar period last year. [Foreign Language] And consequently, the revenue from gas sales in the Russian market practically hasn't changed, amounting to RR 78 billion in Q3 last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So now let's switch over to the financials, and I would like to pass the floor over to Mikhail Rosseev, who will be telling us about it in greater detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Good evening, dear ladies and gentlemen. Now let's take a look at slide number nine.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As one can see, various factors, which affected the financials of the Group in Q3 '09, were [inaudible] destination platform.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Because of the negative dynamics in the operational costs, the third quarter saw the reduction of the operational profit ratios of the level of RR 149 billion lower than during the similar period in '08. [Foreign Language] And at the same time in 3Q '09, the average net profit from sales went down by 8% or RR 68 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Overall, during this reporting period, revenue compared to last year went down by 7% or 184 billion. [Foreign Language] As was noted by Peter Bakaev because of a difficult market situation, the sales volume in Q3 were lower than the similar results in '08 and this particular factor served as the basic reason behind the reduction of gas sales, which went down by RR 53 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And despite the reduction of the gas revenue sales, the results of the Group also suffered from the reduction by RR 30 billion from the gas condensate sales, mainly because the world prices were lower than the similar kind of price levels in '08.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as you may note on the slide, the reduction in the operational profit was compensated both by one-off factors and changes in the exchange rates averaging between the profit and losses &#x2013; sorry, profit and expenses.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Amongst the most basic transactions, one should attribute losses in the third quarter because of the reappraisal of the Eni's buy option for the acquisition of 100% of Gazprom Neft. [Foreign Language] And consequently not having it to be confronted by such negative factor in '09 positively reflected upon our results in '09.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Amongst other factors, one should note the reduction of power costs in profits actually that you can see from the slide because of the reduction of the profit tax in Q3 '09, the Group was able to earn a higher profit during this period than in the same period in '08.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Much of the reasons, which brought our profit tax down was the reduction of a tax rate from 24 down to 20, as well as the dynamics of our extensive and which basically are not taxable and specifically here is the reappraisal of the options that I have mentioned in this period.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] On the subsequent slide, which is slide number 10, we tried to demonstrate the way one of the line items has been changing, which during all of the telephone conferences dedicated to the results of '09, which was Q1 and then H1 and these three quarters, was the results of various changes which occurred because of the exchange rate changes.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And so, the slide shows the dynamics of the financial profit and losses because of exchange rate differences. [Foreign Language] As you can see on the slide because of the various exchange rate fluctuation and the need to reappraise our &#x2013; the financial results was strongly affected by the application of the exchange rate differences. [Foreign Language] And whereas in the first quarter, the Group registered the loss because of that as 140 billion during the second and third consequently registered the profits, which are &#x2013; which can constitute the figure that you can see in respect to it.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now let's take a look at the operational expenses, which you can see on slide number 11. [Foreign Language] So, in the Q3 '09 compared to the similar period last year, it went up by RR 81 billion or 15%, but overall during three &#x2013; nine months of '09 comparing to the similar period last year, operational expenses went up by RR 250 billion or 16%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now the factors of growing expenses during Q3, they have been different. The main reasons behind during nine months was the dynamics of our expenses for acquisition of gas primarily because of the [inaudible] for the Central Asian Gas.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Without taking into account the expenses within this particular line item, operational expenses during nine months went up by RR 59 billion or just 5%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] In Q3 '09, our gas acquisition expenses didn't change strongly, and so the main factor behind them growing were the ones, which were reflected within the line item of other operational expenses.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now considering the results specifically of Q3 in '09, it is worthwhile noting that the most significant changes which affected other operational expenses came from changes in profit and losses because of the reappraisal of assets reflected in the foreign currency and specifically the receivables.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And actually this is the question which we discussed during the previous teleconference dedicated to H1 report, so I don't think this is too big of a surprise for you.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Amongst other things, within this particular line item was affected by the operations of Gazprom Neft and specifically the consolidation of other divisions like [inaudible], Sibir Energy, Moscow Refinery, and the expenses incurred by other subsidiary banks such as Gazprombank and Netzaprombank.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And please allow me to finish my part of the presentation with that and pass the call over to my colleague from the Financial and Economics Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now we're continuing to present our financials, and on slide number 13 you can see the picture of the company debt.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As you can see during the nine months of '09, the debt burden of the company went up comparing to the previous reporting period. In terms of net debt, the difference is RR 134 billion, or it bounced 10%. At the same time, the overall debt went up by less than 3%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I'd like to note that with respect to &#x2013; the relative, the debt coefficients, they remain within the acceptable framework, considering the reporting period -- them growing was brought about by a significant EBITDA reduction, but at the same time they remain to stay at a comfortable level for the company.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And speaking about fourth quarter of '09, we are expecting to see a significant reduction of the debt burden. For example, speaking about the parent company only, the overall debt will go down by more than RR 4 billion because of a large-scale planned debt payment, as well as a payment &#x2013; repayment of number of loans. U.S. dollars. Sorry, it was quoted in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Then in conclusion of today's presentation, we would like also to describe to you the main factors, which affected the operations of the company and its financials throughout 2009.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Despite a significant reduction of the gas sales in H1, in the second half of the year, we witnessed a rebounding or written so in Q4 Gazprom increased its sales of gas into Europe by more than 19% comparing to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And the lack of having to require gas from Turkmenia also reflected upon the operational expenses line item. These fractional changes as well in the Gazprom Group also positively affected our profit, our revenue and debt throughout '09.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] One of the strong factors as already been mentioned, which affect our financials, as well as our debt figures were the changes in the hard currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So now to summarize, I'd like to say that 2009 was not a simple year and financial crisis has introduced certain changes into our operational plans. However, our long-term goals and objectives remain unchanged. We intend to stay reliable, supplier of gas and strengthen our leadership position amongst the global energy companies. Thank you very much for your attention and now we'll be happy to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We have approximately 40 minutes set aside for the Q&amp;A. So, you are welcome, and we would like to ask the operator to open up the line for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Olga Fedotova, HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Yeah, this question comes from Olga Fedotova from HSBC Bank, which would like to ask a question about the company's cash flow figures. So, she is saying that she knows that in Q3 there is a slight worsening of the cash flow positions, so the question is what are the company's targets for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] It will be Mikhail Rosseev, who will be answering this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I would say that our cash flow figures, which you found in the part of the statement &#x2013; I would describe them as quite predictable in terms of their dynamics simply because our operational results turned out to be slightly weaker than in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And so the reduction of the revenue, and also by way of another factor, which would require additional explanation, would be the changes in our working capital.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And specifically speaking about Q3, I would say that the overall effect from changes in the working capital was about RR 112 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The strongest effect from it came from our settlements with customs of &#x2013; and that was basically the indebtedness that we incurred by about RR 56 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And the reason, so to say, behind such advance payments and down payments or not being able to finalize these settlements is the fact that there is still a certain uncertainty or rather discrepancy in terms of the custom clearance procedures, because of which we are obliged to make full 100% customs payments without being able to receive a full confirmation of such expenses being incurred.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And amongst the factors of which we changed our working capital, you could quote a certain slight increase in our financial investments and reserves, which is quite a usual type of a situation, which is a temporary relocation of assets.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And Mr. Bakaev will say more about our projections for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Let me describe the situation as follows. As far as today's conference call is concerned, let us speak more about the results that we have achieved and as far as the outlook and projections and possible answers for the future, I would rather we keep them for Gazprom's day, which is Friday next week, so as to consider &#x2013; to let you consider that in debate with the leadership of the company.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the issue about the customs payment most probably will be &#x2013; again, will go back to the arrangement which we used to have in the past, and so this way, it will produce positive results this year upon our cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Second part of the question is covering more of 2010 again. Is it possible to hear something about the borrowing policy that the company will pursue for &#x2013; if not next year, then this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as our borrowing policy is concerned, our debt situation for this year, I should say that it is very much similar to what we used to have previously, meaning that in our budget, in our plans, we've got about RR 90 billion of borrowings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question is whether this constitutes any new borrowing or refinancing of the old debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So, the kind of borrowing that you are -- is closing to be the new one. And in terms of the question that you are trying to specify, whether it's new or not, you should take a look at what we have in the budget and what we anticipate to be the spending part of the budget, which is investment program or the servicing of the loans that we are planning for 2010.</p>
          <p>All of this put together. And you are trying to specifically describe and connect to this sum of 90 billion, which is exactly related to the budget purposes and objectives. So, you can relate them to our budget goals as far as expenses are concerned.</p>
          <p>So, if you find refinancing in the budget, you may relate that to the budget. But if you don't see it in the budget, but all of a sudden it might come in 2010 in the form of a pre-term payment of a loan, which we didn't plan to pay in advance. Or, for example, we have the opportunity, because of the market &#x2013; favorable market situation, we didn't previously plan to do that, for example you can see that the rates allow us to optimize our debt structure, and consequently to effectively refinance some of the debts of the company. So things like that in terms of raising or borrowing for these purposes will come on top of this 90 billion.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Tatiana Boroditskaya of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] This is Tatiana Boroditskaya from UBS Bank. The question is &#x2013; several questions. And so the first one is, what has been the gas sales dynamics during the January 2010 and during Q4 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We mentioned a few words, speaking about the Q4 in the quarter presentation about it. We've also mentioned the extent to which we [inaudible].</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as January is concerned, it is a bit premature to close any figures.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We can ask Sergey Emelyanov, representing Gazprom Export, who -- the Director of Gazprom Export, who will say a few words about the way the dynamics are re-establishing themselves in terms of selling gas to the western market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I should say that in Q4, the supplies of the Russian National Gas through Gazprom Export to the western countries were considerably bigger than what we had during the same period in '08. And as far as our deliveries and shipments in January are concerned, I also must state that the January volumes are very significantly greater than what we used to have. So, you're very welcome to come and meet with us on Friday and so you will be able to find out more about it.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] In the presentation, when I was making it, I mentioned that more than &#x2013; by more than 19% in Q4, this figure went up comparing during the same period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as the Russian domestic market is concerned, I will then ask for a few words, our Deputy Head of the Department for Marketing, Gas Refining and Liquid Hydrocarbons, Mr. Alexander Medvedev.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Usually what we do &#x2013; we, as a rule, compare the respective quarters of the previous, of the current or the current and the subsequent annual period. So, let me give you this particular view on this.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Specifically, I should say that in January this year, the Russian consumers they took by six billion cubic meters of gas more than in January last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as the consumers in the former Soviet Union, they also had demonstrated a very serious dynamic in increasing their consumption in January this year comparing to January last year. And more specifically such countries, which went through some big reductions like Ukraine, they climbed back to the consumption of the volumes of gas, which is almost &#x2013; equals the amounts they consumed two years ago.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And the record consumption was demonstrated by Estonia, Latvia and Lietuva despite certain negative dynamics, which they went through in terms of the gas consumption previously in power generation.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The second question is, by which margin the price for gas may go up for industrial consumers as well as for the household consumers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I would ask Vasily Smirnov to answer this question, who is Deputy Head of the Department of Pricing and the Department for Economic Appraisal and Pricing of Gazprom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] In December last year, the Federal Tariff Service decided to raise the gas prices as of January 1 this year by 15% for industrial consumers and by 5% for household consumers for the subsequent sale to the household individuals. But at the same time a decision was made that the gas prices for, what I described, subsequent sale to the households will be raised by 15% as of April 1, 2010. So, annualized because as they say of a phased price increase in '09 that would amount to 26.6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Is there any plans to issue Eurobonds, and if positive then when or within which period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Every year, we principally make plans to use and deploy different instruments in order to raise different bonds, which includes Eurobonds and bonds generally as well as different loans. And the selection of an instrument depends upon the market environment and specific requirements that the company might have. So, we do not rule anything out, but customarily, half of what we might need the company usually raises through bonds and then the other half through the straightforward loans. And these are exactly the plans that we entertain for this year. And in terms of timing or exactly the time or period when the public instruments could be used are usually are not being disclosed until the very last point in time.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] The question is about the trading volumes that the company has in the export market. And which are the gas acquisitions in the Central Asia that you might expect in terms of results during the nine months, as well as the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Now, in terms of your question what we would like to say is this, today, as far as the precise trading volume in the European market is something which is quite difficult to quote because for example, our foreign subsidiary, which is Gazprom Germany, as well as the companies which are part of its structure are currently applying different instruments, simply because they work in a very active [inaudible] in a very active market. And so, to be able to identify a specific path which goes for trading or for the scope trading right now is quite cumbersome because the volume of the operations has been growing and even when preparing ourselves for the annual reports I am sure that we will go back to this information and simply because during the interim reports we remember this point was of interest to quite a few people. So, it will be difficult to separate various line items and possibly, I may try just to give you overall figures for &#x2013; on the acquisition side for the gas and for the Central Asian front. For example, simply because the Central Asian volumes in terms of different supplies is something that we do not disclose.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So, the overall volume of the acquired gas through nine months of '09 amounted to 107 billion &#x2013; 105.7 billion cubic meters during the similar period in '08, we acquired 83 &#x2013; 89.3 billion cubic meters of gas comparison-wise.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And in terms of the gas from Germany, we have about 50 billion of the volume during nine months of this year compared for example to 30 billion during the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And what is worthwhile noting is that significant amount of what gas from Germany stands for is being done by in the open trading platforms, which is the trading activity per se.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Maria Radina of Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So, two questions. First about the reporting presented as well as the supplies to the FSU countries.</p>
          <p>So, the first question is about the sales price of gas sold to the CIS or FSU countries because it went down much stronger compared to the sales price that the company had in Europe, which looks quite surprising, taking into account that the main contracts right now are connected to the same kind of a formula which is applied in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] To start with, I believe that Mr. Vasily will start the explanation, then we will ask Nikolayevich to continue.</p>
          <p>The thing is that, in our report, we are presenting the average figures, which are basically weighted by contracts, weighted by various countries. And so, the changes of these shares or weight in the countries -- let's say of the former Soviet Union -- would demonstrate that the sales prices, they are different anyway, because currently all of them are being raised to the level of acceptable profitability. But at the same time, they remain different. So, the picture, which is reflected in the reporting is simply just the average estimated values, but in terms of what kind of prices they have been and how they changed in different countries, I will ask my colleagues from the Marketing Department and we will have Alexander Nikolayevich who will give us further explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I will make an attempt to answer your questions without quoting specific figures, but rather by sharing with you a streamlined rationale behind what is going on. Now, with regards to the Baltic States, we took them up to the European price formula two years ago.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And so, in their case now, the same kind of formulas are being applied, which Gazprom Export uses in dealing with the Central Asian countries.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Of course, one should mention that such a formula in the case of every rich company would be different than specific, but overall they are very much identical to what Gazprom Export is applying.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And there is also a certain nuance, because in the Baltics you have quite a big underground gas storage, which is Inchukalnskoye.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And these countries were able to store quite a significant amount of gas in this underground storage having bought it beforehand before the prices started moving. As a result, this helped them through that particular acquisition to pass through the seasonal spike having enjoyed more favorable prices for themselves.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as the supplies of gas to Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Kazakhstan are concerned, during the recent years, we have been definitely able to raise our prices. This formula in their cases is also relying upon the European pricing principles.</p>
          <p>They used to be reducing coefficients, but we have been also stopping to apply them. And so, for example in Ukrainian case, there are no more. They have been brought down to the minimum in case of Belarus. And we believe this could be the right way, which is being confirmed by the facts that we are able to enjoy the regular and timely payments for our gas from these countries.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And maybe one other explanation in conclusion of my part that I would like to offer with respect to the Belarusian price. We are maintaining the principle of pricing for them in the following way. It is European price minus the price for the cost of the transit for the European market, and also minus the customs duty, which is basically being &#x2013; not being levied upon the Belarusian gas because it is quite high. But with respect to everything else, it will strictly comply with the level of European prices, starting from next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The next question is about the export duty, because historically, export duty amounted to approximately 5-7% from the FSU countries' revenue. And now in Q3, we can see that that amounted to about 22%. So could you please comment as to [inaudible] interest? Or do we have to incorporate this particular account into our exported destination models, which we're going to apply in subsequent quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Well, principally speaking, the amount of the export duty, which has been defined by the government for the FSU countries hasn't been changed, neither this year nor last year. But as far as the size of the export duty, which actually have been levied, an explanation here may come from what my preceding speakers here were saying, because of a certain type of relationships that we started having with the customs last year, while the amount of export duty itself remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And we can assure you that by the end of 2010, when discussing the results of this forthcoming year, you won't have a question about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Just a second. On top of it one should mention one other thing, because the amount of export duty is being influenced by two additional factors. The first one, basically the volume of shipments and deliveries to different countries because, for example, in the Belarusian case, the export duty is not being levied. So destination matters plus on top of it, the volume of re-exportable gas and in this particular case, it is difficult to be exact in terms of what volume will be there in 2010. So maybe it would make sense to sit and simply take into account these factors and to monitor in their dynamics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question is whether one should take into account the export duty and plan on it as far as the gas is concerned, which is being bought from the Central Asian countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is negative on the contrary.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] For example, whereas in the past, we delivered to Ukraine the gas through the re-export mode. This year, very significant demands of gas, which were sent there clearly specifically from Russia only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question is do we now have to incorporate this export duty in a larger amount from the revenue, because we are now looking at the gas delivered to the FSU countries. Is it correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And the answer is, yes, it is correct, because you have to take into account the volume of the acquired Gazprom-Central Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The follow-up question is whether there are any exemptions that being made available because of the gas is being re-exported?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The answer is that this is not the Russian origin gas. It is being acquired not for domestic consumption. It passes in transit through Russia to other markets and that is why it is not subject to duty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Our time is running out. But before we conclude, I would welcome one more short question, if there are any, and we will wrap up.</p>
