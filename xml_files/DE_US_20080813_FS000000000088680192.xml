      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marie. Earlier today John Deere reported another quarter of impressive operating and financial performance. Sales and net income were the highest for any third quarter in the company's history. Farm conditions remain quite strong throughout the world, driving our ag operations at an unprecedented level. In addition, consistent execution is helping our non-ag businesses remain solidly profitable in spite of the slow U.S. economy. What's more, the big picture still looks good. Farm commodity prices have fallen back recently, but it wasn't so long ago that $5 corn and $12 soybeans would have been considered pretty spectacular. Today's grain prices continue to lend strong support to farm incomes worldwide.</p>
          <p>Also, the underlying fundamentals, based on increasing global affluence and the world's growing need for food, fuel and infrastructure, remain intact. They offer great long-range promise for our company.  John Deere is moving aggressively to capitalize on these exciting trends by making continued investments in new capacity, new products, and new businesses.</p>
          <p>Starting with slide three, you can see that we have continued to invest in growth, to support the strong agricultural equipment markets worldwide, and with the outlook strong for some time. The large harvester manufacturing facility in East Moline, Illinois, which ships grain combines around the world, will complete a 30% capacity expansion early in 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition, two acquisitions in the quarter provide scale, customers, products and distribution for John Deere Water Technologies, propelling our business to number three globally in agricultural irrigation.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide four, this morning Deere reported record third quarter net income of $575 million, the top end of our guidance, on record equipment net sales of approximately $7.1 billion. Even with the challenging material and logistics cost environment net income increased 7% and diluted EPS rose 12%.</p>
          <p>On slide five, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 18% compared to the third quarter of 2007. About five points related to positive currency translation, and there were about two points of price realization as well as about two points from acquisitions in the ag and commercial and consumer equipment divisions. The remainder is from increased volume.</p>
          <p>On slide six, you can see that our third quarter production tonnage was up 13%. For the fourth quarter worldwide production tonnage is expected to increase 18%. For the full fiscal year 2008 worldwide production tonnage continues to be forecast at a 17% increase. All are driven by a very strong global market in agriculture.</p>
          <p>Regarding our company outlook, let's turn to slide seven. For the fourth quarter of 2008 we expect companywide equipment operations net sales to be up about 29%, including about three points of currency. Net income is expected to be about $425 million in the quarter. For the full year, we are now forecasting net equipment sales to be up about 21% compared with fiscal year 2007. This includes about five points of currency and about two points of price realization. In addition, there are a total of about two points from acquisitions, including LESCO and those in John Deere Water Technologies.</p>
          <p>Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with agricultural equipment on slide eight. While the press release describes the major items affecting financial results, let me mention that of the 35% net sales increase in the third quarter, currency translation accounted for about eight points. Operating profit increased 47% to $634 million. Looking ahead, global ag fundamentals are very encouraging. Worldwide stocks to use ratios remain at low levels, particularly for corn and wheat.</p>
          <p>Slide nine portrays our assumptions for yields for key crops planted in the U.S. during the last three years. Yesterday the USDA updated its 2008-2009 crop outlook, increasing the U.S. corn yield to 155 bushels per acre, while reducing the midpoint of their price range to $5.40. This price is extremely attractive to grain farmers, while lessening the burden on livestock producers and consumers.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 highlights Deere's projections for the prices of corn, wheat, and soybeans, which in spite of recent moderation remain very favorable by historical standards.</p>
          <p>Deere's forecasted commodity prices are on slide 11. Note the increases for the 2008/2009 crop year from last quarter's forecast, and the corn price is very similar to the USDA's midpoint announced yesterday. The strong markets for crops are driving good levels of farm cash receipts and income globally.</p>
          <p>And as shown on slide 12, note that our forecast for total U.S. farm cash receipts for 2008 and 2009 are considerably higher than our outlook from just one quarter ago and at dramatically increased levels from those of just a few years ago.</p>
          <p>We ran yesterday's USDA numbers through our model and the result is a less than 1% difference in 2008 and 2009 cash receipts. All of this translates into an excellent outlook at John Deere, not only for tractors and combines, but also for products like sprayers and seeding equipment, and strongly supports our outlook for industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada, as shown on Slide 13, which is now up 20 to 25% from last year. In addition, our 2008 industry outlook for South America is now up about 40%. One of the previous uncertainties has been eliminated with the resolution to the Retencione situation in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 complements the increased industry forecast for South America, demonstrating solid farm income in Argentina with a dramatic increase in Brazil. Slide 15 highlights the strength in the European agricultural market as well.</p>
          <p>And shown on slide 16, our 2008 industry outlook for Western Europe is now up about 5% for the fiscal year. Demand continues to grow rapidly in Central Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States countries, including Russia. And Australia is recovering from its severe drought, with Deere sales there up nicely.</p>
          <p>So putting this all together, slide 17 depicts a stronger worldwide outlook for the sale of John Deere farm machinery and services. Net sales are now projected to be up about 38%, with currency translation accounting for about eight points of the increase. Just as currency translation will affect net sales, it will also affect forecasted operating profits, adding about 150 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>While we will not have our 2009 outlook for you until the November call, early indications from the field are very encouraging. Retail requests in the U.S. and Canada for many products, including 8000 and 9000 Series tractors, combines, sprayers and seeding equipment, are up dramatically from year-ago levels. For example, retail requests for 8000 Series tractors effectively put availability into July of next year and into September of next year for 9000. For combines, about 70% of expected 2009 retail sales have orders. Though we do not have similar early order programs outside the U.S. and Canada, order positions in the rest of the world show the considerable strength of the global agricultural equipment market. Now it is early, but these results are exciting and confirm to us the great promise of our agricultural business into 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to our commercial and consumer equipment business on slide 18, reported net sales were down 1% in the quarter, with a five-point contribution from LESCO. Operating profit was $91 million, even with production tonnage down 14%. The division continues to manage costs and inventories carefully during these difficult economic times.</p>
          <p>Moving to the commercial and consumer equipment outlook on slide 19, for fiscal 2008, we continue to expect sales to be up about 4%, with LESCO contributing about six points. Portions of the business remain affected by the housing slowdown and general economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Exciting new products offerings in the market this year, including the Precision Cut Fairway Mowers, premium homeowner models and utility vehicles, continue to drive customer interest.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on construction and forestry on slide 20, where sales were down 7% in the quarter. In this very demanding time, with production tonnage off 15%, operating profit was $93 million or about 8% of sales. The 2008 net sales forecast is down 5% from 2007, as seen on slide 21. Given the challenging market conditions, construction and forestry is aggressively executing its trough management plan, including carefully managing assets, producing closely to retail demand and controlling expenses such R&amp;D and SA&amp;G. Based on our present outlook, we expect construction and forestry to remain solidly profitable for the year.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our credit operations, as you see on slide 22, credit losses continue to remain low with the current provision running well below its 10-year average, demonstrating the quality of John Deere Credit's portfolio. Credit's third quarter net income was about $80 million as seen on slide 23. Our forecasted credit net income for fiscal 2008 is now about $335 million versus the previous forecast of about 350 million, with the two primary reasons being a modest impact on crop insurance income from the floods in the Midwestern U.S. and a slightly higher loan loss provision reflecting market conditions in C&amp;CE [Consumer and Commercial Equipment] and C&amp;F [Construction and Forestry].</p>
          <p>Before moving on to retail sales, let's review receivables and inventory. Looking at the quarter, on slide 24, consolidated trade receivables and inventory ended higher than a year ago. Construction and forestry had a benefit of about $50 million due to the sale of Nortrax South. However, the company increase was basically accounted for by the ag division. Currency comprised about a quarter of the ag division's change year-over-year. Other items include the two acquisitions of John Deere Water Technologies, adding about 150 million, the production startup in Brazil and the significant growth in markets like Central Europe and the CIS, including Russia, which require longer shipping times for finished goods. The majority, however, is supporting our growing level of sales in Deere's global agricultural business. Although you have seen trade receivables and inventories increase year-over-year, slide 25 clearly demonstrates that the increase continues to be driven by the growing level of sales.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 shows that our 2008 year-end forecast calls for relatively flat inventories and trade receivables in C&amp;CE and C&amp;F. The increase in the ag division is consistent with our larger global footprint and accelerating global business conditions. The division again plans on increasing stocks of raw materials and parts towards the end of 2008, just as we did in 2007, for the higher level of production expected early next year. There also is a forecasted increase of about 150 million due to the John Deere Water Technologies acquisition. Finally, currency accounts for about 160 million of the total year-over-year increase.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 27 presents the product category detail for the month of July, expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were down 7%. Deere was down a single digit but more than the industry. Row-crop industry sales were up 38%. Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel drive tractor industry sales were up 49%. Deere was up more than the industry. Combine industry sales were up 31%. Deere was up double digits but less than the industry.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, you see that for row-crop tractors Deere ended July with inventories at 14% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 15% of sales. Turning to slide 29, in Western Europe sales of John Deere tractors were up a single digit, with combines up triple digits in July. And on slide 30, Deere's retail sales of commercial and consumer equipment in the U.S. and Canada were down a single digit in the month. Construction and forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada were down double digits on both a first-in-the-dirt and a settlement basis.</p>
          <p>Before we touch on a few housekeeping items, let's turn to raw material and logistic cost increases as well as pricing actions. Slide 31 shows our raw material and logistics cost increases of about 140 million in the third quarter &#x2013; I'm sorry, about 250 million. For 2008 the forecast ranges from 425 million to $475 million. For the whole company, since we anticipate about two points of price realization for the entire year, in round numbers, we should cover our expected cost increases in 2008. However, the price realization occurs over the course of the year, while approximately one half of the raw material and logistics cost increases come in the fourth quarter. So our margins will be under pressure as reflected in our fourth quarter 2008 forecast.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are aggressively pursuing cost reduction activities to mitigate the effect of rising costs as well. But this is a near-term issue, as we have taken several pricing action globally. Here are a few examples from the U.S. On large tractors we took a 3% increase in April of this year, and earlier this week we announced another 7% increase on large wheel tractors. On 2009 combines we took a 9 to 10.5% increase. In commercial and consumer prices increased from 0 to 6% in late May. In construction and forestry we raised prices 0 to 5% in July and yesterday announced increases from 4 to 9%, effective 1 November 2008.</p>
          <p>The bottom line is our backorder position limited the revenue impact of price increases in 2008. However, with the pricing actions we have taken and our cost reduction efforts, it is our intention to restore our cost price ratio, and you should begin to see evidence of this in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&amp;D expense on slide 32, R&amp;D is now expected to increase about 16% in 2008, with continuing investment in new products across the enterprise. Moving now to slide 33, SA&amp;G expense for the equipment operations was up about 16% in the third quarter, with about seven points of that increase coming from global growth initiatives and currency translation. Our fiscal year 2008 forecast includes SA&amp;G expense increases of about 16% over 2007, with about 10 points of the expected increase coming from global growth initiatives and currency translation.</p>
          <p>Regarding the tax rate on slide 34, during the third quarter the effective tax rate was approximately 36%, the same as the rate projected for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 35, in May the Board of Directors approved repurchase of an additional $5 billion of Deere and Company stock, demonstrating their confidence in our ability to continue to generate strong cash flows. At the same time, investors received the sixth dividend increase since 2004, bringing the cumulative increase to 155%.</p>
          <p>As can be seen on slide 36, we have returned about 5.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase since 2004. 18.5 million shares remain under the current 40 million share repurchase program. This is in addition to the 5 billion authorization approved in May. Actual shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were 427 million. You can also see the history of share repurchases since 2004.</p>
          <p>Slide 37 provides some additional information related to fiscal year 2008. For equipment operations, capital expenditures are forecasted at about $775 million. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $475 million, and we continue to anticipate funding about 425 million in pension and OPEB contributions over the year. For financial services, the forecast for capital expenditures relating to wind is about 275 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, John Deere is on the home stretch of another good year. Based on the guidance provided today we expect 2008 to be our fifth consecutive year of record sales and earnings. Results like these along with our focus on asset management are helping generate strong cash flow, cash flow being returned directly to our shareholders and used for longer range investments and growth.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the broader global economic environment remains quite favorable for a company like ours. All in all, we are confident John Deere is well positioned to continue delivering strong financial performance and high levels of value for both customers and investors well into the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Marie, you guys were pretty explicit about your expectation for ag equipment, at least production, for '09, and acknowledging you're not giving guidance and very clear on that at this point. I wonder if you can take us through your initial thoughts for the construction equipment and forestry business, as well as the credit business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Terry, we would not have comments available at this time for those businesses. It's just premature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we just focus then on what's going on in the construction equipment business, looks like you have lowered your production forecast. Can you talk about how you are feeling about end markets and inventory position assuming that you take production down here in the fourth quarter looks like pretty significantly, how do you feel about inventories relative to where kind of retail is heading into '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually feel very well positioned with our inventory position as a result in part of the reduction in receivables in inventories we made last year. For those of you who may not recall, we took $250 million out of our inventories over the course of 2007, so we went into 2008 with our inventories fairly well positioned, and as evidenced by our guidance with our ending inventory and receivables estimated to just go up about $25 million, and candidly that reflects some currency movement more than anything else. We continue to feel well positioned as we head into 2009. Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add on construction and forestry, I think that they are executing according to what our strategy has been all along and that is fundamentally to produce close to retail demand. And as we have seen the adjustments on the retail side, we've tried to get their working capital in line. And similarly, I think they're pulling on the levers of our trough management, so that we get the SA&amp;G and other expenses in line so we can kind of maintain our margins through this. And I think they're doing a pretty good job given the external environment we're facing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, just to be clear on that, is the lower production forecast now a result of weaker retail in '08 or a combination of that and a more tempered outlook for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we're not going to comment specifically on 2009. It's no secret certainly in view of what's happening in the United States that the markets have continued to soften, so I think you can attribute our reactions more in line with what we're seeing in the markets today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly R&amp;D expense revised up, can you talk about where that number is headed and why that revision was made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again a little bit of that would really reflect what's happening with currency but as we are continuing to see growth opportunities in the markets, and a lot of this candidly is occurring outside the U.S. and Canada, we've got a lot of opportunities there. We are investing resources and that's why you see some of the increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should expect that to continue to grow at similar rates here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would get into guidance for 2009, which I'm not able to do at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One clarification. Tax rate went up to 36% for the year. What caused that? And will the tax rate for '09 be the same or will it go back to 35?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason the tax rate went from 35, which was our previous guidance, to 36%, really, Eli, is that old word, discreet items. It doesn't attribute to any one particular factor. For the outlook for 2009, we're actually ourselves still working on our forecast, so I wouldn't be able to give you any more precise guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I had a couple of questions on the ag business in particular. You're talking about very big shipments in the fourth quarter, I mean were some shipments delayed in the third because of bridges being out and the flooding that give us such a big fourth quarter? And tied to that you indicated the early order plans are very strong for the 8000 and 9000 tractors and the combines. How much more production can you get in '09 versus '08 in each of these products and the price increases that you have announced, are the early order plans under the old prices or the new prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are many questions in there. In terms of the fourth quarter shipments we did actually up our tonnage estimates a bit for the full year for the ag division, so in the fourth quarter you're seeing more of the impact frankly not of delayed shipments, but rather of some higher production. In terms of pricing, all of the orders that we have for 2009 will have some price increases in them and it would vary depending on the time of when the order was placed. We did take an interim increase, so on many of those orders you would be looking for at least a 5% or more kind of increase. And again we're specifically talking ag here. And the combines as Susan mentioned, those are 9 to 10.5%. I think there was one other item but I'm not recalling what it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The incremental production that may be available in '09...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, well, we've talked about the fact that at the end of May we approved a capital investment and it was announced that that will take our harvester works, which is our factory where we make our large combines, up about 30%, and we expect to have most of that capacity available for the year, not for the full year, but most of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we announced in February a tractor <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. Although a lot of that benefit will hit more into 2010, we do anticipate to get some additional improvement a little bit in 2009. And then several of our units although neither one on the same scale would be making adjustments in their -- it's not only capital but just in their operating processes to accommodate our farm customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you are indicating a double-digit increase is possible in both tractors and combines &#x2013; with combines being more than tractors at this point?</p>

          <p>Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question, just for follow-up on Eli's question on pricing, given sort of this highly inflationary environment that we are in, are you guys contemplating any structural changes to your pricing policy just beyond price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Structural changes. I'm not sure what you would be getting at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, incorporating surcharges, being able to reprice backlog just being more aggressive on pricing than we've been historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that our customers would tell you 9 to 10.5% is probably a meaningful increase, but certainly required in the current environment. But we have made some adjustments in our acceptance of some orders. We use the term effectively, place our backorder to July, position not all of the orders that we have been assigned a retail date. That does give us the ability with the recent price increases then for those price increases to apply to those orders.</p>
          <p>We have some available production. If we would need to make additional changes in pricing that would be affected by that. It has not been our intention for many, many years of our practice to put surcharges on; a deal is a deal. And Deere's felt very strongly about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is not meant to be as a question for '09, but this is going about just a structural operating leverage for the ag business. Earlier in the cycle, we talked about operating leverage may be 30, if everything works out well, 40. Now, we are in the teens. Is it reasonable to assume that in the long run operating leverage in the ag division could return to sort of high 20s, low 30s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, 30% would be our guidance on average over a long period of time. That assumes you are not making any investments for growth. And we are seeing opportunities in the ag division globally and that is reflected in higher capital expenditures but also in higher R&amp;D and SA&amp;G as we are making investments and you've seen frankly some of the very early payoffs of that as we look at our net sales, we talk about the tremendous growth outside our traditional markets. So, we will have guidance again in another quarter, and we will be making a decision in terms of how we are going to continue to invest for 2009. So, I don't have a definitive answer for you at this time. Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the other thing that it is going to depend upon, in addition to investments, which I think Marie hit on, is probably the most important aspect. But I think it also is a little bit of a function of mix in terms of where the growth is occurring. So that's another variable that does play into the incremental margin calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But between pricing and mix, you're building out Eastern Europe and North America. I mean all these things sort of sound positive. And I understand that even if we continue with incremental investments, it should not be worse than this year, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, and then on that same idea, the raw material contracts that maybe have come up recently and you've signed for next year. Can we think through on that cost assumption, which is obviously what's driving your targeted pricing, how much of your '09 costs are part of contracts you've already signed? You have good idea of your '09 costs. And at a minimum maybe describe it as &#x2013; at this point last year versus this point this year, do you have more visibility into your next year costs than you'd say you did a year ago, like contracts signed in the last eight months or so into '09?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have spent a considerable amount of time as you might imagine with econometric modeling, working with our suppliers. We are also looking at cost reduction activities. I think you are looking for some guarantees that we're probably not in a position to provide.

          <p>With corn prices pulling back, is it possible to chat a little bit about the price of corn that you think would continue to support the strong levels of demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we talk about them pulling back but the reason that we included the particular price chart, slide number 10, was to demonstrate that although they have pulled back a bit from the highs, they are still by any historic measure extremely good. And even with the fact that our customers are experiencing higher costs, these current prices in the market are still very attractive and profitable for them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's important to recognize farm cash receipts are really the product of the volume times the price. And so when you look at those farm cash receipts, our estimates are substantially higher than they were just a quarter ago. And I think you can make an argument that there is actually a real benefit to some moderation in the corn price in the short term in terms of demonstrating the productivity of farmer customers and the ability to produce crops for both food and fuel. And I think that helps within the policy debates that are occurring right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no change in philosophy. Actually last quarter, we discussed that we have a supplier who has a problem that's been in the Wall Street Journal, with the cracking blades. And in view of the situation there, we are simply not doing some of the projects, putting down payments on some of the projects that we otherwise would have. And they are in the process of working through a resolution; we're working very closely with them. And this is just a timing issue.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing? Referring to specifically, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more color on what you are seeing in the Brazilian market. I mean, obviously, you've kicked up your sales forecast. But in terms of your overall capacity relative to demand, how are you feeling at this stage of the game? And then, obviously not getting into guidance for longer term, but I mean, what are the opportunities in Brazil or in South America that you think that you can incrementally improve that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are less than a year into full operation of the new tractor facility in Brazil. And so we are reaping the benefits of having that additional capacity as well as having broadened our product line, we've added five new tractor models last year. Some higher horsepower, some in the lower horsepower ranges. So, we are much better positioned to provide product to our Brazilian customers then we ever have historically. Ramp-up of that facility occurred much earlier in the year. And so we're really reaping the year-over-year benefits of having that facility fully operational. Having moved tractor production out of our factory in Horizontina, which produced combines, will also over time, as that factory goes through its adjustments, provide for additional opportunity there as well.</p>
          <p>So, we are feeling very good about our ability on the manufacturing. And we have a very strong dealer network, very solid and our traditionally our issues have been that we were capacity constrained, we could not provide them with enough product. So we've got the product in place, we've got the distribution and the market conditions and fundamentals in Brazil and really throughout South America look very promising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then referring to the pricing in that region, obviously there's been a lot of talk about pricing with some of your competitors. I mean what are you seeing specifically in Brazil from a pricing standpoint? If not number-wise, can you give granularity &#x2013; is pricing I guess trending the way you want it to? Or is it ahead of your expectations? Or how would you describe the environment now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing the same kinds of raw material cost inflation in Brazil as we are seeing really throughout the world. And we have taken a number of pricing actions there, just like the amounts maybe vary a little bit by model, but you know, similar to what we discussed earlier on the call. And I don't have a comment about what's happening competitively. But we have had taken some price increases.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of the questions have been asked. But I have a question on the non-U.S. and Canada operations. If I look at Q3 revenue increased 6% and operating profit dropped 3% last year and then at Q2, 5% revenue growth and 21% operating income growth from that area, what were the reasons for the change on a sequential basis? Was in all input and transfer costs? Or was there some seasonality and mix in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no question that there are some issues in terms of &#x2013; I would say transfers but maybe more of where we are building versus where we are selling. As I think you know with the tremendous growth we've seen in the former Soviet Union, a lot of that product does come out of the U.S. And so the U.S. operation gets the benefit of building it. And you have the overseas operations then just getting the benefit of the marketing margin but having the full sale. So that can change things.</p>
          <p>And that's why very frankly when we report our operating profit and our sales for the ag division we're looking at it on a worldwide basis because it is really very relevant there. The other thing that can distort it is we have had a fair amount of growth in our non-ag businesses, the commercial and consumer and certainly the construction business. So people in the past have I think kind of ignored those or said there wasn't a year-over-year change as they tried to calibrate, and those do have an impact. Mike, I think you want to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's a fundament point, is that when we look at the business you really need to add both the non-U.S. and U.S. together to get a true picture because of the distortions that can occur with the absorption and some of the factories versus where the products are being sold. And what we tend to do to in terms of management, we look at a very narrow granularity on a profit by product approach. We look at all of the processes. But we look at each of the product categories, each of them has that same high standard we are trying to maintain relative to the return on assets that we're demanding.</p>

          <p>I would just maybe just pipe in with one other observation and that is we talked earlier about SA&amp;G and R&amp;D and the investments that we are making for growth, that a lot of that is the occurring outside the U.S. and Canada and so of course that maybe a little bit of a disproportionate cost as you are investing to grow those operations right now. Thanks for the question; do you have a follow-up?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on a separate issue, with the share price weakness over the last few months, given concerns about various factors. Is there any thought internally to kind of accelerate in any one period, maybe not this period, but any one period where you see share weakness and take advantage of what you see differently than what investors may?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right, Andy, we've kind of said in the past, we are not going to have a specific rate at which we are going to buy back shares so that we are going have out there that we would adhere to. In this particular quarter Q3 I would just comment that sometimes we have to be out of the market for various things. This quarter because we are going for the authorization for the new share repurchase and we were going through the authorization of the dividend, it took us out of the market, we had to have some blackout days we wouldn't ordinarily have. And that kind of impacted the share repurchase in the third quarter. But not going to be able to provide much more guidance on future activity.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My questions were on the fourth quarter net income guidance. I am struggling to get down to the 425 million that you forecast. Can you talk me through a little bit of what you are anticipating in terms of incrementals or decrementals, maybe incrementals on the ag side and decrementals on the construction and forestry and consumer? I know you said construction and forestry will be solidly profitable. Can you just help me understand where my margins may be wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first place I would take a look is the raw material costs, which we were pretty blunt, about half of them hit in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I presume that those will disproportionately hit the ag sector then since volume is stronger there than anticipated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It affects all three equipment divisions. But I mean given the relative strength of the ag market that's probably a fair observation. I think that's the single biggest area I can think of. In an earlier question, someone observed the fact that our construction equipment division would have a lower production volume and although we would in our forecast contemplate some remaining profitable, they do have a lower production in the fourth quarter and that would have an impact on our margins and it's actually the factor in why we would have revised our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two other factors come to my mind. One is tax rate, which is certainly one of the discreet items that Marie was alluding to earlier. And another one I think is lower credit company income, really reflecting two things. One is crop insurance commissions or crop insurance income I guess I should say. We talked about actually a very good diversification they've used in risk mitigation, but nevertheless it's going to be down I think about 5 million for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still profitable, nicely profitable, just down a little bit from previous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And I think there is a modest increase in the provision for losses as well on credit for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="inaudible" /> those in I was struggling. Okay. That's very helpful. Can we talk a little bit about &#x2013; you are talking about adding capacity for combines &#x2013; when you talk about -- I think you said something like order book sold to or booked to 70% of next year's expectations, when you look at your next year's expectations are you baking in the 30% capacity expansion or, you kind of talked about your 70%, where you were at this time last year. Just help me again; I just want to try to understand next year's capacity additions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be fair. Again, the 30% is not available for the entire year. But it will be available for a good portion of the year. When we talk about 70% and that is of what we expect to retail, now that's a U.S. and Canadian number. So, we are not looking at what we're expecting to see in the rest of world, we threw that out, just as an indication of the fact that we were still seeing very, very good market activity, extremely strong market activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I shouldn't think that you are 70% sold out of 130% capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question sort of on the credits of detail. I wondered if you can comment on the past due experience, sort of month-to-month or quarter-to-quarterly in the construction and forestry side, whether that's stable or getting worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really continues to be maybe just a little dead. We have been running -- it would have rounded to three in terms of our write-off as a percentage of the portfolio. And we may be bumped up just a little bit, 0.35%. I think I meant to say 0.3 earlier, so maybe 0.35. But your provisioning is based on what you think you need. And as you look at the fundamentals in the commercial and consumer and construction and forestry and credit market, it just seems prudent to us to slightly increase that loss provision, given the difficult fundamentals. And that's really what you see reflected here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this slight increase in provision, is that in line with the increase in past dues or do you assume past due doesn't translate to a loss and so you provision a little bit less as one of your competitors does?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I understand the accounting rules say that your provisioning is based on what you expect you will see in losses. And so that's what that's reflecting. Our past dues continue to be -- if you look year-over-year are virtually unchanged at &#x2013; it's 0.26%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. I'll stop there and maybe I'll ask an opposite question to one that was asked earlier. In the current environment, you are seeing a slowdown in global economies and some asset prices maybe getting cheaper. Is there any thought on your part to favor asset purchases over buybacks, conserve powder in other words?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are actively looking for business development opportunities all the time. These things have a long gestation period and we are continuing to have interest in growth. So to the extent we can find business development opportunities where there is a good fit and we think we create value we have an interest. And I don't think that fluctuates so much as a view of the transient prices as something we are looking for all the time. And two good examples this quarter that came to fruition were the acquisitions in the water space. But these take a long time to build a platform like we are going to do. We're going to make these relatively small acquisitions and hopefully invest around them and build up a platform, that's going to be a multiyear activity, but that's how we think we are going to create some value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, if I heard your comments correctly, among other places that you are planning to take price increases you are taking them in construction and forestry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And they sounded pretty significant. On the one hand, this is addressing the input cost issue, on the other hand when you talk to the other construction vehicle manufacturers, the one place that they cite pricing power weakness is in small and medium size vehicles in North America. Are you seeing something different in the marketplace that makes you comfortable you can push this through or is it heavily weighted towards specific vehicles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not announced any specifics other than to say that the range from 4 to 9%, this announcement actually was just made yesterday. But we have not really assigned it to a specific product. So I am not able to comment any further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably the announcement implies that you feel comfortable that price increases in construction vehicles in North America that you are going to be able to successfully push them through without losing a lot of volume. Is that a correct inference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a fair inference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, let me just come back to the bottleneck in agriculture for a minute. So, the way I read the release was 30% increase in combines next year. But I think what I just heard you say was that by the end of the year your capacity will be 30% higher. So, a good chunk of that benefit sort of arrives in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Actually we will have a good portion of that 30% available to us we anticipate for first fiscal 2009. I am stopping short of telling you exactly how it weighs out because things happen in any kind of a building or a machine tool or a redo project. But we do anticipate to have a good chunk of that available to us for the bulk of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then similarly for the Waterloo facility relief that really comes available in 2010 and we really shouldn't expect much incremental out of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Waterloo is working very hard to rearrange its processes to accommodate our customers in this period of strong demand and so they are working as hard as they can to implement what they can. Where we are limited is where we have machine tools and a lot of those machine tools do not arrive until late in 2009, but there are some things that can be done in terms of process flow and things like that to better accommodate our customers and we're working there, but the bulk of that, that increase does hit 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and one last thing in Waterloo you I believe maybe almost two years ago now you talked about the order to delivery time was down to 11 days and I seem to recall you --</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Squeaked in here at the end. I guess first just a clarification, Marie, do you feel like you could have kept the 2.2 billion net income guidance without the higher tax rate and the credit and lower income at the credit business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are four factors that affected the overall guidance, and the first you were correct is the tax rate, the credit income, it is lower volume in construction and forestry. And then a lesser factor, but worthy of just note is the fact that we did complete these two acquisitions in the water and so you have a little bit of integration cost that hits this year that was not in the forecast originally because we didn't know that we would close on these acquisitions for sure, so it's four factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, thanks for that. And then just can you characterize, you said 70% of your combines at this point are booked or essentially sold for '09. Can you give us an idea of where that number stood at this point last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we wouldn't have even been able to quote a number last year, because the early order program didn't open until the 1st of September, so it would be zero.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Eastern European and the CIS business for the ag side, can you characterize how big is that market today? Really what type of growth rates are you seeing there and are you investing in the distribution channel there? Is that part of your growth initiative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, absolutely we're investing in distribution. In fact about a quarter ago, we announced that we were investing in the distribution center in Russia that would help us in the parts side and training. So, we have a dealer network. We are investing in dealer development in that part of the world. In terms of specific sales numbers, we will provide that for you geographically on an annual basis, but you saw in 2007 that our sales were over a billion in that specific part of the world, Central Europe and former Soviet Union or Commonwealth of Independent States, I should say, and the growth rate was I think about 60%. So we most definitely have seen the growth and we are investing in infrastructure to continue to support that part of the world.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Barry, just fine.</p>

          <p>The C&amp;F margin was the lowest margin in that segment in 20 quarters. When I look at the historical relationship, there is a good linear regression relationship between C&amp;F profit and sales in that division. But using that equation for the first half and applying it to the third quarter, there was about a 50 million profit shortfall. It's pretty significant.  It was also odd that in the third quarter your actually lowered the material and freight decrement estimates.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. It applies for the full year, but we went from a guidance of what had been 100 to 75, but they did cut production. In the quarter, they produced less than what they had anticipated and then they've taken their guidance for the full year down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so what I needed to know was what would be the breakout between the cut in production impacting the profitability in the third quarter and the shortfall of pricing versus materials and freight in the third quarter, a breakout between the two as to why that margin was so low.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a comment more specifically than what we've already provided. Actually, very candidly, we look at their profitability in light of the significant decline in the market and believe that they are performing extremely well. But they are certainly impacted by the increase in raw materials and this is one division, although for the full company we will cover our costs, this particular division will be unable to do that in the current environment. They are big users of plate and that has been more difficult. So you're correct that that is an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the overwhelming impact on the decline in the profitability I think can be attributed to the volume in the quarter.</p>
