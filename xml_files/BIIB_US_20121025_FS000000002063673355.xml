          <p>Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>Ms. Claudine Prowse, Vice President Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Melissa and welcome to Biogen Idec's third quarter 2012 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, please visit the investors section of biogenidec.com to find our press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financial results are summarized in tables one and two. Table three includes the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results, which we believe provides additional insight into the ongoing economics and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow discussions related to this call.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current intents, beliefs and expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and I encourage everyone to consult the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional detail. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations.</p>
          <p>Today on the call, I'm joined by Dr. George Scangos, Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Doug Williams, Executive Vice President of Research and Development; Tony Kingsley, Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations; and Paul Clancy, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. We'll also be joined for the Q&amp;A portion of the call by Dr. Al Sandrock, Senior Vice President of Development Sciences and Chief Medical Officer.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to George.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Claudine, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Our strong momentum continued in the third quarter. We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late stage pipeline. As you can see from the press release, we had a very solid quarter across the products and delivered strong earnings growth to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Our GAAP EPS was $1.91, up 19% year-over-year, although this number was bolstered by a one-time item of $32 million relating to the monetization of our royalty and other rights related to BENLYSTA.</p>
          <p>The AVONEX business continued to deliver improved contribution driven by share performance within the ABCRE [AVONEX, BETASERON, COPAXONE, REBIF, EXTAVIA] class both inside and outside of the US. The AVONEX Pen, designed to improve the self-injection experience, renewed physician interest and helped to maintain share of voice and awareness of the brand in a competitive market.</p>
          <p>We continued to see steady year-over-year growth in TYSABRI units both in and outside of the U.S. Awareness remains high for our risk stratification tools and we're seeing nice growth in testing volumes. The key attribute of TYSABRI continues to be strong efficacy. We believe the investments we're making in the product risk stratification will keep the growth trajectory moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>We also made progress with our late stage pipeline. We were delighted to announce positive top line results from our registrational study for factor IX in hemophilia B, and we're expecting results for factor VIII in the near future.</p>
          <p>Last week the FDA informed us of an extended PDUFA date for BG-12 to allow more time for their review of the New Drug Application. The extended PDUFA date is now in late March. Additional studies were not requested, and we continue to work with the agency to facilitate their review.</p>
          <p>While this three-month delay is, of course, disappointing, our view of the potential of BG-12 to benefit patients with MS is not changed. Awareness remains high aided by the recent publication of BG-12's pivotal data in the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies, which form the foundation of the regulatory filings, support BG-12's potential as a new oral option for MS treatment.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month we also shared more than 50 company and partner sponsored presentations at the ECTRIMS meeting in Lyon, France. These presentations included data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI; AVONEX's 16 year history as a proven and effective, safe MS therapy; analysis of pooled data from the Phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM trials of oral BG-12; as well as supporting data on daclizumab and anti-LINGO as possible treatments for MS.</p>
          <p>The breadth of our presence and the presentations highlight our continuing leadership in MS and our commitment to bringing better medicines to patients in all segments of the market: the well-established injectables, the high-efficacy segment as well as the growing oral segment.</p>
          <p>So with those highlights, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams to take you through the pipeline advances in more detail.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks George.</p>
          <p>During Q3 we continued to make progress on several fronts with our R&amp;D programs. These advances should position the company for substantial future growth. Let me begin by focusing on our late-stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>Last month we announced positive top line results from B-LONG, the registrational study of our recombinant, long-lasting factor IX. Let me briefly summarize the study objectives and top-line results from the study.</p>
          <p>Primary objectives of the B-LONG study were to assess the safety and tolerability of long-lasting factor IX, efficacy in all treatment arms of the study, and a comparison of the annualized bleed rates, or ABR, between the episodic treatment arm of the study and the weekly and individualized prophylaxis arms of the study.</p>
          <p>The results showed that compared to the episodic treatment arm of the study, the ABR of the weekly or individualized dosing arms of the study showed reductions in ABR, where the overall median ABR was 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized prophylaxis arm, and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes that occurred were controlled by a single injection of long-lasting factor IX.</p>
          <p>Importantly, at least half of the subjects achieved a dosing interval of 14 days or more in the individualized prophylaxis arm. No patients developed inhibitors to factor IX and there were no cases of anaphylaxis. Long-lasting factor IX was generally well tolerated in the study.</p>
          <p>While there is still ongoing analysis being done with the B-LONG study, we're now working very hard to complete our regulatory submission for filing in the first quarter of 2013. We look forward to sharing with you top-line results from A-LONG, the registrational study for our recombinant, long-lasting factor VIII in the near future.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our late stage neurology franchise, we showcased the interim results from ENDORSE as a late-breaking presentation at the ECTRIMS meeting. ENDORSE is a double-blinded Phase III extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of BG-12 at a dose of 240-milligrams BID or TID. At the time of the analysis, ENDORSE had enrolled over 1700 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, who had completed the DEFINE or CONFIRM studies.</p>
          <p>In ENDORSE the safety profile for patients was generally consistent with that of DEFINE and CONFIRM and no new safety issues were identified in subjects who continued on BG-12 or were treated for more than two years. The incidence of serious infections was low, consistent with DEFINE and CONFIRM and there were no opportunistic infections in patients treated long-term with BG-12. The types and frequency of malignancies that were observed in the treatment group were expected in the population under study. This trial will continue until our expected completion date in 2016.</p>
          <p>In a second late-breaking presentation at ECTRIMS, we highlighted primary efficacy results from SELECTION, the one-year extension study of SELECT, the first registrational study of daclizumab HYP, or DAC. The results of SELECTION supported the positive findings seen in SELECT, and indicated DAC's clinical effect was sustained through the second year of therapy. Safety results of SELECTIO showed that the safety profile of DAC was similar in years one and two of therapy.</p>
          <p>Moving on to TYSABRI, we continue to build and improve upon our risk stratification tools. The generation 2 assay was launched in Europe earlier this year and we anticipate launching in the U.S. in the coming months. This assay will provide for improved sensitivity and specificity to detect patients with low levels of JCV specific antibodies.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the remainder of 2012, we expect to share top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study of long-lasting factor VIII, in the near future, and the Phase III study of PEGylated interferon one-beta &#x2013; one-alfa in relapsing MS in early 2013.</p>
          <p>For EMPOWER, which is the Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS, the study remains blinded and we expect top-line data readout by late this year or early next year. In late September the last patient completed 12 months of treatment in EMPOWER. As a result, all clinical sites are now actively working to evaluate all patients still active in the trial for their final study visit. The timing of these visits will drive the timing of the top line data read out. I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress for our late stage programs in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the early stage pipeline and research, I'm pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this past quarter in the Phase II study of anti-TWEAK for lupus nephritis, and the Phase IB study for BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
          <p>The TWEAK program will examine the impact on renal function of treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TWEAK in combination with standard of care. The TWEAK molecule is associated with renal flares in lupus nephritis patients and the absence of immune effects of TWEAK make this an ideal molecule to combine with current standard of care treatments such as Cellcept which are profoundly immunosuppressant.</p>
          <p>Our BIIB037 program is a multiple ascending dose Phase Ib study of our anti-beta amyloid antibody in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine the reduction of beta amyloid by imaging to define the optimal dose for future studies.</p>
          <p>Proof of concept studies for anti-LINGO are expected to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of this year for optic neuritis, and the second half of next year for relapsing and progressive forms of MS.</p>
          <p>Finally we have decided with our partner, Portola Pharmaceuticals, not to proceed with the planned Phase IIa trial in RA, because the lead compound did not meet the stringent target product profile to be competitive in this specific market.  We're continuing to do exploratory work in allergic asthma as a possible indication for the lead molecule and are focusing on additional six selective backup compounds for what we believe is a key pathway in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</p>
          <p>We also took steps in the quarter to strengthen our discovery research capabilities through a restructuring and reallocation of resources to support those early stage activities. These steps are consistent with the strategic priorities of the R&amp;D group which I laid out in some detail at the analyst day in June.</p>
          <p>With that I'll now pass the call over to Tony.</p>

          <p>Thank you Doug.</p>
          <p>Solid execution of our product strategies drove 6% revenue growth in the third quarter. Global AVONEX revenues increased 8% driven by a 5% unit increase year-over-year as we continue to experience competitive share performance within the ABCRE class across markets. We continue to be pleased with the uptake of the AVONEX pen and believe strong commercial execution is driving strong performance.</p>
          <p>Convenience is an important differentiator in the ABCRE class and as a once-weekly treatment AVONEX has become a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. During the third quarter more than two-thirds of all new AVONEX starts in the U.S. have been with the pen. We have also seen strong conversion from the pre-filled syringe to the pen, which we believe will benefit longer term retention.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we have seen significant interest in the AVOSTARTGRIP, as over two-thirds new starts on AVONEX in the third quarter titrated with the AVOSTARTGRIP.</p>
          <p>Outside of the U.S. AVONEX remains the prominent MS therapy and we maintained our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong, increasing 8% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S., the AVONEX pen is continuing to drive strong unit demand across Europe.</p>
          <p>Moving on to TYSABRI, third quarter global TYSABRI units increased 9% versus prior year. We experienced strong unit growth both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. with TYSABRI units growing 10% and 8% respectively in the third quarter versus prior year. We are seeing solid growth in new patients with 2100 added during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. TYSABRI's core efficacy message continues to resonate with physicians and risk stratification and the use of the JCV assay continue to build physician belief in TYSABRI's benefit risk profile. We see testing volumes growing nicely. Physicians are increasingly testing new candidates for TYSABRI, and we see greater confidence in moving the product earlier in the treatment paradigm.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, U.S. discontinuation rates remained stable quarter-over-quarter, and TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed patients increased to the low double digits, providing confidence in our commercial strategy.</p>
          <p>In Europe the rollout of the second generation assay has contributed to a moderate increase in discontinuations. While we believe that TYSABRI will continue to see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, we believe we will continue to see an overall solid growth trajectory.</p>
          <p>While we were obviously disappointed by the PDUFA extension in the U.S. for BG-12, we feel well prepared as we continue to invest in prelaunch preparations and detailed tactical planning.</p>
          <p>We are also accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchises given the recent positive readout in factor IX and in anticipation of the upcoming factor VIII readout. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place, and will continue to build out the team, infrastructure and supply chain necessary for a successful launch. The hemophilia market will be a new market for Biogen Idec, but we understand the requirements for commercial success as we continue to build awareness, establish trust and credibility and attract world-class talent.</p>
          <p>We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategy successfully, and believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches.</p>
          <p>With that I'll hand the call over to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank, Tony.</p>
          <p>Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the third quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration and $8 million related to the research restructuring executed in the quarter. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.91, up 19%. As Georges noted, this quarter we favorably benefited from the $32 million recognized from the sale of our royalty and other rights related to BENLYSTA. In addition, as a result of our decision not to move the Syk inhibitor program into Phase II, we did not incur the previously anticipated $23 million milestone payment.</p>
          <p>Let me walk through the financial results now. Q3 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 8% to $736 million. In the U.S. AVONEX grew 12% to $462 million. U.S. unit volume increased 1% versus prior year and was up 2% versus last quarter.</p>
          <p>Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at slightly less than two weeks, a modest increase compared to the prior quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there may still be some AVONEX stocking in the retail outlets to likely balance the demand for the prefilled syringe in pen. As a result, we're cautiously believe that there could be excess inventory in the retail channel that may unwind over the next couple quarters.</p>
          <p>Internationally, the underlying AVONEX business is strong as units increased 8% year-over-year. International AVONEX revenue was $274 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% compared to third quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange was a meaningful headwind for the quarter, weakening AVONEX by $29 million. This was offset by a $9 million hedge gain, as compared to a $9 million hedge loss in Q3 2011. AVONEX international revenues were also impacted by certain modest price reductions across a few select countries and a mix shift to lower-priced distributor markets.</p>
          <p>TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $404 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year, Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $275 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $98 million. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenues were down 8% to $177 million, while units increased 8%. The disconnect between units and revenue growth was driven by approximately $14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate and the impact of foreign exchange. FX for the third quarter weakened TYSABRI international revenue by $19 million versus prior year. We offset this by a $3 million gain from hedging, compared to a $2 million hedge loss in the prior year.</p>
          <p>U.S. RITUXAN sales were $787 million, up 7% versus prior year. RITUXAN continues to experience continued penetration in NHL maintenance setting and further uptake in CLL. Our U.S. profit share from that business was $259 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside of the U.S. were $29 million, the result was $288 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.</p>
          <p>FAMPYRA revenue was $12 million for the quarter. Recall that the GBA gave FAMPYRA a level 5 rating and provided a range of approximately &#x20AC;1000 to &#x20AC;3000 per year as the price that they're willing to reimburse. We're currently in price negotiations with the German authorities and expect a resolution in early 2013. As of August 1 we have been recording FAMPYRA revenue at a net price that assumes the lower end of the range, and we'll continue to do so until the final price is established. Royalties were $47 million and we recorded $12 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&amp;L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year, was driven by higher AVONEX revenue, higher cost of the AVONEX pen, nurse training fees and increased funding related to the JCV assay.</p>
          <p>Q3 R&amp;D expense was $296 million or 21% of revenues, lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain clinical trial expenses and the avoidance of the expected $23 million payment for the Syk program. Our research spend was also temporarily down during the quarter due to the research restructuring. Q3 SG&amp;A expense was $298 million, or 22% of revenues, an increase of 15% over last year as we prepared for potential commercial launches. Collaboration profit-sharing line, totaled $76 million.</p>
          <p>We now have a new line item on the P&amp;L, as you may have noticed, called gain on sale of rights. Prior to this quarter, we're eligible to receive low royalty from GSK and HGSI on global sales of BENLYSTA. We sold our BENLYSTA royalty and other rights to a DRI Capital managed fund. DRI will now pay us a multiple of those royalties for the period covering October 2011, through the third quarter of 2014. This will be recorded on the gain on sale of rights line.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, we received $32 million from DRI, representing essentially three-quarters of activity. We expect quarterly payments through the third quarter of 2014 as a gain on the P&amp;L to be less than the amount paid this quarter and dependent on the uptake of BENLYSTA.</p>
          <p>Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q3.</p>
          <p>Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2%.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately one-third is outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.91 in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to our updated full-year 2012 financial guidance. Overall we're raising our full-year guidance to close to a double-digit increase in non-GAAP earnings. This has been a year characterized by very solid commercial performance on our core products, coupled with meaningful investments to mature the late-stage pipeline and prepare for potential product launches. We expect full-year revenue growth of mid-to high single digits, a modest improvement over prior guidance. While we're working to resolve the AIFA TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of year assumes revenues recorded at the lower end of the GBA range. Our full-year forecast also assumes a modest slowing of U.S. RITUXAN revenues in the fourth quarter, due to wholesale dynamics, which is characteristic of past year-end trends.</p>
          <p>Our expense targets are largely on track to our original full year business plan: cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue; R&amp;D expected to be between 24 and 25% of revenue.</p>
          <p>Our R&amp;D forecast includes approximately $20 million to$ 30 million of an upfront payment in the fourth quarter earmarked for a discovery collaboration which we're in the process of negotiating. Additionally we expect to incur some supply chain spending related to dexpramipexole to be prepared in the event of a positive readout.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the fourth quarter we expect meaningful increase in investment for prelaunch activity, building out our customer-facing resources, product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, preparing the patient services organization, and readying our supply chain and distribution organization. This spending is purposefully back-end loaded as we get closer to the potential BG-12 launch.</p>
          <p>We put our Denmark manufacturing facility into service during the month of September, which is a very positive milestone, and we'll seek formal regulatory approval for TYSABRI supply in mid-2013. The short-term P&amp;L impact of this was a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. This will result in approximately $7 million of non-cash expense in the fourth quarter, which will be recorded on the OI&amp;E line.</p>
          <p>We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pre-tax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.40 and $6.50, and GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the BENLYSTA related transaction and the strength in the core business.</p>
          <p>As you likely noted we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be the high water mark for the year and the fourth quarter, conversely, to be the low water mark. This is due to many of the P&amp;L items I have highlighted including the significant prelaunch activity in the fourth quarter, the potential research collaboration highlighted, the step down of the BENLYSTA related gain, and the interest expense related to the Denmark manufacturing facility.</p>
          <p>So this was a solid quarter and while we have an additional quarter to go, we're positioned nicely for a successful year.</p>
          <p>I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul.</p>
          <p>As you can see during the quarter we made excellent progress across our financial, commercial, R&amp;D objectives for the year. It is an exciting time for us as we look to close out the year and move into 2013. We had a positive result for the long-lasting blood factor IX for hemophilia B and have three more pivotal trial data readouts ahead of us: factor VIII for hemophilia A, dexpramipexole for ALS and PEGylated interferon for MS, an all-time high for Biogen Idec and the result of the commitment and productivity of the talented employees across the organization.</p>
          <p>As we prepare for the potential of multiple product launches in the coming years, we'll continue to be vigilant, keeping a tight lid on costs while investing where necessary to ensure that we have successful launches and a pipeline that delivers sustainable growth for the future. We believe that we're on track to deliver solid revenue and EPS growth in a year in which we have had a number of pipeline successes, and in which we're investing heavily for the future growth that we anticipate from our new products and that's not an easy thing to do.</p>
          <p>I want to thank our dedicated employees who have helped us to achieve our goals, as well as patients and physicians who are always central to what we do.</p>
          <p>With that we'll now close our remarks, and open up the call for questions. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another solid quarter. George, just a quick question on the BG-12 PDUFA date delay. Did you receive a reason for that delay from the FDA? Was some sort of data resubmission classified as a major amendment and if so, what might that have been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. Why am I not surprised that's the first question?</p>
          <p>[Laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look, technically the answer to your question is: yes, it is a major amendment, but let's understand what the term &#x2013; you know, the major amendment is kind of a term of art. In the normal review of an NDA, the FDA asks questions of the sponsor to which the sponsor, in this case us, responds in writing. So the FDA has the ability to determine that any of those responses can be classified as a major amendment.</p>
          <p>So by doing so the FDA extends the PDUFA date for three months, and as far as we know there is no other mechanism by which the FDA can extend the PDUFA date by three months. So the fact that a response is classified as a major amendment doesn't necessarily mean that there are problems with the application or the drug. It can mean only that the FDA believes it needs more time to review the application, the answers to the questions, and will not be able to meet the original PDUFA date, and we believe that's the case with our application. And as you know, Eric, the three-month extension has been applied to a lot of other compounds including recent approvals in MS.</p>
          <p>So we believe we're on track and we have a three month delay.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, I guess just a follow-up to that, and to some of Paul's comments on the fourth quarter. It sounds like you guys are investing pretty heavily in the BG-12 infrastructure ahead of time, but maybe just give us kind of an update with where you are with respect to hiring, promotional and what sort of costs that you've already incurred and maybe the timing of when you think you'll start to roll out some of the more commercial personnel costs with respect to the launch? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Geoff, Tony and I will try to tag team that, so &#x2013; and I'm glad you asked the question because certainly there's &#x2013; as my guidance implies, there's some lumpiness in the quarter-to-quarter trends on SG&amp;A expense, and that's very purposeful on our end. Costs for Q3 were a little bit lower than we expected for both R&amp;D as well as actually SG&amp;A. That's just kind of the way things turned out for Q3, and resulted in some pull-through on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>But we do intend &#x2013; and it's more than just the personnel costs, right? It's more than just the customer-facing resources. We do intend to over the next 90 days, or now narrowing in on the next 60 days, to really prepare for BG-12 across customer facing, medical education, scientific education, preparing the whole organization.</p>
          <p>So, you know, I think that is very consistent with what we have said over the past &#x2013; this is a rare opportunity that we have. We don't want to be penny wise and pound foolish, so we'll put the investments in as we get ready for what we hope is a BG-12 launch early in the second quarter of 2013. Tony?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Paul. So Geoff, look, we had to plan for approval. Obviously you would want us to do that and resource in the critical areas for approval, particularly getting people trained and in place. So we are obviously well into that ramp for the right reasons. But we also plan for the contingencies, so we will have to adjust, redeploy and look to manage discretionary spend in the light of this delay and manage the ramp over time. So that's what we will do tactically at this point.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...question, and just to follow up on some of the commercial comments rather than BG-12. First can you help us reconcile TYSABRI? The patient growth trend looks like it is in the high-teens year-over-year. I know there are some one-time items in there, so if you could just sort of bridge us back to that patient-growth trend.</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you let us know about the pricing? You mentioned a couple of negative pricing effects for AVONEX. Could you give us a little bit more detail about the magnitude and whether that is likely to continue to play through the results for the immediate future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Geoffrey, it's Tony.</p>
          <p>So on the numbers, TYSABRI is never an exact straight line between patients, units, etcetera. We have seen, we think, as we look at U.S. and Europe, solid unit growth year on year, and solid patient growth year on year. But as Paul will talk to, the impact outside of the U.S. was more pricing, particularly AIFA and then some FX issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and just to add, Geoff, I think this is probably continued commentary from our partner's conversation yesterday. Most of the imprecision, if you will, is rest of world patients. We have pretty darn good visibility, we think, driven by the TOUCH program in the United States for the patient calculation.</p>
          <p>Outside of the United States, it really is &#x2013; you know, I apologize. We present it as if it's precise data, but outside of the United States it is a combination of registries in certain countries, literally unit triangulation in other countries where we don't have registries. So I don't &#x2013; and we adjust those as we look backward. I don't think that as we do that, we look back, it has at all changed the fundamental story.</p>
          <p>You know, the disconnect outside of the United States between units, patients can be driven by what we just talked about, the imprecision of the data. It could be driven by compliance, which we don't think is a big deal, right? We have seen that in past years with TYSABRI with drug holidays, suspension. We're not sensing that outside of the United States in Europe. And then it can be driven by inventory and parallel trade dynamics in Europe specifically. We do know of some parallel trade issues in the quarter that we &#x2013; you know, work extremely hard, like any other biopharmaceutical company, to try to limit those. But there was some dynamics and what ended up happening is units show up in one quarter versus &#x2013; as opposed to the other quarter from a patient perspective.</p>
          <p>The second part of your question, Geoff, was designed around AVONEX. I'd underscore it was modest price reductions. We had seen some price reductions driven by austerity measures in 2010, 2011. Spain was one of those as we pointed out in our SEC filings. This quarter the most notable one was France, where just kind of normal price conversations with France resulted in a little bit of a &#x2013; like a low single-digit decline in AVONEX price there, but I think we're weathering through that quite well in the aggregate.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. First one is &#x2013; did you guys submit any &#x2013; maybe this is for Al, I guess, did you submit any Fumaderm data in your BG-12 regulatory package either in the EU or in Europe?</p>
          <p>And then on dexpramipexole, hey Al, we all understand statistical significance if you hit your p-value or not. But assuming you hit your p-value, what do you think the data would need to show so that the ALS community would really view the drug as a really important breakthrough and that would then allow you to get perhaps MS-type pricing? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. This is Doug. With respect to first question, I'll take that and then I'll pass it off to Al to address the question about ALS. With respect to Fumaderm, no, these are two different drugs, as we have been maintaining all along. Fumaderm is a mix of fumaric acid esters and BG-12 is dimethyl fumarate in a different formulation. So, you know, obviously the regulators are aware of the data around Fumaderm, particularly in Germany, which is where that drug is approved for psoriasis, but two different drugs in different populations of patients with different comorbidities, so no, it's not necessarily relevant, we believe, to the BG-12 situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, on the dex question, the primary endpoint basically has two components, the Functional Ratings Scale [FRS] and survival. And you kind of have to break it down into the both &#x2013; into the two components in order to know whether or not it's clinically meaningful. So on the ALS FRS, the community &#x2013; the ALS physicians have decided that a change of greater than 20%, so a greater than 20% change in the slope of decline is considered clinically meaningful.</p>
          <p>And then on the survival, you know, riluzole is sort of a benchmark for survival. As you know, in the States riluzole is not very commonly used, although in Europe and Japan it's quite commonly used and riluzole had about a three-month extension of survival on average. So I think that that's certainly a benchmark that people will use.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just wanted to follow up, on a comment, Paul, I think you made about dex, you're building up manufacturing there. Is there anything that you are seeing in the blinded data that that would cause you to do that, to give you more confidence or is it really just a hedging strategy?</p>
          <p>And then I was curious separately if you could talk about the Xenoport product? Al or Doug, if you had a view of that being competitive with BG-12 based on the early Phase I data? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rachel I'll start with the first part of the question. So it has nothing to do with the data. I don't have any &#x2013; that information at all. And I'm glad you asked because we hate to have it be read that way at all. The basic thinking is that if this trial is a positive trial in this disease and in this patient population, it's such a high unmet need that we need to be prepared for that. I mean and you know &#x2013; we would need to be prepared for a potential relatively quick review and the potential to supply patients even before that in some form or fashion, so that &#x2013; and the lead time otherwise even for a product like dex is well beyond &#x2013; we need to start it now.</p>
          <p>So that we have taken on as what we call at-risk spending, it hits the P&amp;L, we can't capitalize inventory until we get to a Phase III readout. So that literally is just our thinking around in case this is a positive readout.</p>
          <p>From a commercial perspective we have paused with respect to a lot of dex infra &#x2013; we're doing a little bit of work there, but we haven't done it, certainly to the magnitude that we're doing it in BG-12, but we think that if it's positive we will quickly be able to turn on the dime there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rachel, this is Doug. With expect to Xenoport, obviously we are aware of the data. We have been tracking what Xenoport has been doing with that compound and, you know, we feel very confident in BG-12. We have got very large data sets that we have accumulated in the Phase III program, and now supplemented that with the ENDORSE results which we presented at ECTRIMS which further extends the safety experience with that drug.</p>
          <p>So that, plus the fact that we have our own lifecycle management activities going on that we feel good about, I think we feel like we're in a great position.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...so I have two questions. One just &#x2013; I don't know if you can answer, but maybe if you can give us a little bit of a sense: Gilenya, Gilenya's price came out much higher than was expected. Aubagio's pricing is pretty good. How are you guys thinking about BG-12 versus these two drugs? And then I had a follow-on for Paul, also.</p>

          <p>We'll think about it right up until the day we price it. I think we've said in the past so I don't want to comment in any kind of detail on pricing strategy. We're looking very closely at what is happening to the category, and we're going to try to strike the right balance.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When we calculate the data, and from different sources we're getting to around a 30% gross to net. Does that make sense to you in MS? And how fast do you need to discount until you're going to see a gross to net for BG-12 once it launches?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yaron, this is Paul. It's a function of a bunch of different things, including the channel dynamics, as well as the government mix in that product. MS isn't going to be that different product-to-product-to-product, but the government part of the business, as you know, in the United States is limited to the kind of &#x2013; essentially a CPI index, so I guess the other big factor is the percentage of the business &#x2013; or the product's business that is helping to support unemployed people in patients at need, so, you know, I just pause to say it's &#x2013; you know, that probably isn't too far off of the mark, but it can change product-to-product.</p>

And in relation to that, the delay that you got in the U.S., was that actually a submission of data or any sort of submission of safety that trigged it or it's simply a response to questions?

          <p>Thanks for making the question.

          <p>And then just second on hemophilia, given that we've seen B-LONG, maybe it would be helpful if you guys could characterize what your thinking would be, good data from A-LONG, particularly in terms of dosing frequency? Thanks.</p>

Nothing terribly new to report with respect to where we think we stand in the EU as well as in the United States with the 999 patents and the five years of data exclusivity even underneath that. I think what you are mostly referring to is our &#x2013; what we have done is filed for a formulation patent that has the potential to extend it out much later than that. That has been filed over the last year and we don't have visibility and probably won't for a little bit of time in terms of the ruling on that.</p>

          <p>Marshal, this is Doug. Just speaking to your question about success in the hemophilia A study, we haven't really quantified that, I think, in terms of, say, a target product profile with percentage of patients and frequency of dosing, but I would just take you back to the Phase I, II, experience where that change in half-life translates to somewhere around the order of 50 to 80 fewer infusions for a patient with hemophilia A. If we can replicate that in the Phase III experience, I think we'll feel very good about the product and what its potential is in the marketplace.</p>

So where we've added commercial focus is on thinking about product positioning and how to build awareness over time, thinking about health economics data, etcetera. We're obviously still a long way from adding true customer-facing resources, but distribution strategy, patient services strategy, that's all the stuff we're thinking through with kind of the core central team. And then as we get closer to launch, if we get there, we'll obviously build out the customer-facing stuff.</p>

          <p>And then just separately on TYSABRI, is there any defined process we can look towards for that dispute resolution in Italy? Any timetable? I know you've said unlikely this year, but how should we be thinking about that going forward? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'll take number one, Paul, which is the aspirin study. No we don't anticipate that we'll be able to add that into the initial filing. There's no mechanism where we can do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I think the other thought you had, Brian, were synergies now that you appropriately kind of have the math right that there is closer alignment between the U.S. FDA approval and the EU approval. I think the way to think about that though is that they are modest. Outside, in Europe in particular, as you know, there's approval and then it is country by county rollout. So certainly Germany likely is going to be one of the first, and the normal as you would think.</p>
          <p>And the last question, Brian, I think you had, was around AIFA timing. We, as our partner, you know, we're frustrated and disappointed that we weren't able to get it done this year. It's still not over, right? It's just that that is the guidance that we have built into the financials and want to have that for expectations. I think that's appropriate. As we move into 2013, we certainly &#x2013; that is a big objective of ours.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei from Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. On SG&amp;A with the third quarter SG&amp;A number coming in a little bit lighter than the whole Street had expected, that makes the Q4 SG&amp;A larger than what we had modeled and at the midpoint of the guidance that you have given on SG&amp;A it looks like that &#x2013; basically that number times four would get you to the SG&amp;A consensus for 2013. And so I just wanted to understand a little bit better, should we assume that as you actually go into 2013 and there are actual product launches underway, there should be a very healthy increase in those costs beyond what the run rate is in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thomas, thank you. This is Paul. Let me give a little more color to help on that. A lot of the step up, three to four, some of it is labor, personnel, customer-facing costs, but a lot of it is fees and services. So, you know, we have the ability to kind of &#x2013; and we purposefully wanted to throttle that a bit more going into the fourth quarter, closer to launch. So that's a bit purposeful. So I think that's just kind of a helpful framing.</p>
          <p>And then as it relates to 2013, quite frankly, we really need the next few months under our belt &#x2013; next three or four months under our belts, which will give us a greater clarity on the next set of pivotal trial readouts. I think I have described that 2013, you know, could be a year of launching, zero, one, two, three, or four products, and that if it's the right-hand side of that equation, it obviously puts upward pressure on SG&amp;A for all great reasons. And if not, it puts a little bit less of upward pressure on SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So I think it's going to &#x2013; as we spin into 2013, it very much is a function of the pivotal trial readouts that are upon us over the next &#x2013; this cohort of pivotal trial readouts. And we'll get &#x2013; we should get greater visibility obviously, as we have noted, soon with respect to factor VIII. By the end of the year, or early 2013 for dex, and I think &#x2013; so then we'll be able to talk a lot more about SG&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to ask one question for Doug and then a couple of housekeeping if I may. Doug, on 037, given the data that came out with sola [solanezumab] at ANA [American Neurological Association], and I recognize that this was a phase one, dose ranging study with MRI endpoints, but has your thinking changed there with respect to the clinical development of 037?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, Tony with respect to AVONEX OUS, sequentially, I recognize a tender occurred in Q2 in Brazil, but does that actually get recorded all at one time? I'm trying to understand the sequential decline ex some inventory.</p>
          <p>And then finally, Paul, on Southern Europe, I recognize Italy, but did Spain pay you this quarter or are they still on credit? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tony. It's Doug. No, it hasn't really changed our thinking about the development of our own antibody. I think we're pretty bullish on the fact that the antibody we have is distinctly different in terms of its mechanism. I think the ability to remove plaque beta amyloid plaque is going to be, perhaps more like the Roche antibody that has been reported out just based on our mechanism versus the mechanism for the other antibodies. So we believe that the ability to rapidly remove beta amyloid is going to be a benefit that our drug will demonstrate in this Phase Ib study. I think that's important in terms of demonstrating efficacy.</p>
          <p>I think you also have to take into account the population of patients that was looked at in some of the early studies. We, like everyone, are moving to an earlier population of patients, which I think is a prudent and intelligent way of approaching treatment in this patient population.</p>
          <p>So we're going about the study and I think in a very rational and systematic way using imaging as a way of defining optimal dose for our drug to go forward into what I would characterize as sort of proper efficacy studies, where we'll be looking more carefully at endpoints like cognition. So I think we're learning from the previous studies that have been reported, and try to apply that learning to our own molecule, but we're still excited about the antibody and the prospects.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tony, it's Tony Kingsley. On the Brazil situation specifically, so specialty products in Brazil are purchase centrally by the government. AVONEX falls under what's effectively an administrative tender, which is essentially kind of a once a year price negotiation. In fact, they end up ordering quarterly, so shipments that are actually made are done on a quarterly basis, based on the government's estimate of what they will need to fill the demand in the hospitals.</p>
          <p>There is sometimes some quarter-to-quarter timing just when the shipment comes based on what the government does, but it's not like an all or nothing tender that you see in some different places. It is largely administrative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to build on &#x2013; I think what you are trying to get at is kind of the sequential AVONEX unit trend. Q2 was an extremely strong AVONEX unit if you recall. One for what you had noted. The second was that we actually benefited in Q2 from a refill from the product supply issue we had in Q1. The net of that is, hey, we're very pleased with our AVONEX unit trend as we swing through a year-to-date basis outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>The other part of your question I believe was with respect to accounts receivable in Southern Europe. The second quarter was a very strong payment from Spain, as many pharmaceutical companies &#x2013; so we benefited from that as well. The third quarter I think Spain has kind of gone back to what was more traditional over the last year or two.</p>
          <p>We remain at &#x2013; you know, the three countries in Southern Europe, Italy, Spain, and Portugal as our areas of key focus from an accounts receivable perspective. We have in aggregate a little bit over $200 million of accounts receivable in those three countries, and I think as people know, in Greece we're actually on a cash basis with a distributor relationship there. So for us it is centered in on those three.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I think there was a previous question on dexpramipexole and pricing. Just wanted to come back to that and ask what your thinking is, if you did show a 20% or 30% decline in the slope of the ALSFRS-R?</p>
          <p>And then my question was actually regarding daclizumab, if you can give us an update on the Phase III study, and how you think the drug could be positioned if approved in future years. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's Tony. Let me comment on pricing for dexpramipexole. Look, obviously we look at all sorts of analogies, but there are huge swings based on what the data says. It would be very difficult to try to center in on what makes sense. We're obviously looking closely at it and looking at the obvious analogies, but I still think there is a lot of questions on the table of what the data will end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On daclizumab, the Phase III trial is fully enrolled, it's a two year trial so we expect the readout in 2014, you know, in terms of positioning. I mean, we'll have to see what the data shows, but in the first registrational study, we saw a very strong effect on disability progression, which was unexpected, and it was actually significant. And also a very good effect also on relapse rate and on MRI endpoints.</p>
          <p>And also you combine that with once a month subcutaneous dosing. So we'll see what the Phase III data shows in 2014.</p>

I think we have got a great few months coming up ahead of us. A lot of data readouts and base business continues to do well, so I think we're in a good place. Thanks to all of you.</p>
