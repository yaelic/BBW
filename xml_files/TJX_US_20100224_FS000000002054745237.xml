          <p>Thanks, Sherry. And joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman.</p>
          <p>2009 was a great year, but it was a great year on top of many great years and I believe that we have many more ahead of us, which is why I'm going to spend a lot of time on this call talking about &#x2013; not talking about '09's results. I will focus instead on why we believe so strongly that our consistent profitable growth is sustainable. I'll discuss why we are convinced that our new customers will continue to shop with us even when times improve, and we will continue to gain market share. Then I'll delve into why we believe our strong margin is sustainable. Lastly, I'll discuss the many ways in which we are growing this company profitably for the future. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to recap full year and fourth quarter results.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody. I'll begin by recapping the full year fiscal 2010 results. To begin, net sales reached $20.3 billion. That's a 7% increase over last year on a reported basis and that's up 8% on a 52-week comparable basis, which excludes the 1 point benefit we got from the extra week in last year's fiscal calendar.</p>
          <p>Consolidated comp store sales were up 6% on top of last year's 1% increase, which was a much tougher comparison than those of our retail peer group. As we've noted many times before, comps were driven and continue to be driven by increased customer transactions as the value of the average basket was down in the mid single-digit range.</p>
          <p>For the year, diluted the earnings per share were $2.84, up 37% over last year's $2.08 per share. The prior year benefited from an extra week in our fiscal calendar as well as certain other items, which impact comparability and which we've detailed in today's press release. If we exclude these items on a 52-week comparable basis, EPS increased 48% over last year's adjusted $1.92 per share. Foreign currency or exchange rates were not a significant factor, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 this year compared with a $0.01 benefit last year.</p>
          <p>So clearly, we have a business model that delivers consistent EPS growth. We've delivered 14 consecutive years of EPS growth on a continuing operations basis, and we've achieved compound annual EPS growth of 18% over the last five years, 13% over the last 10 years, and 23% over the last 15 years. Clearly, our financial performance and growth have been consistent. We have a model that is much more stable and less volatile than the vast majority of retailers with very high returns on invested capital.</p>
          <p>Continuing with last year's results, the consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 9.6%. That's up 200 basis points from prior year on a reported basis. Comparisons to prior year were adversely impacted by approximately 40 basis points due to last year's 53rd week as well as certain items impacting comparability that again are detailed in our release this morning. Foreign currency exchange rates did not meaningfully impact the pre-tax margin comparison. The gross profit margin was 210 basis points above last year, primarily due to very strong merchandise margins combined with some buying and occupancy expense leverage.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense improved 10 basis points as a percentage of sales despite a 50 basis point increase in expenses related to performance-based incentive compensation as we exceeded our plan so significantly. As we've discussed on prior calls, we have a broad based incentive comp program that goes very deep into the organization and includes thousands of associates including our store managers. Excluding this item, SG&amp;A expenses improved 60 basis points compared to prior year.</p>
          <p>As to inventories, at the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis including the warehouse were down 10%; and excluding the impact of foreign currency they were down 12% per store. We begin the year with very clean inventories, extremely well-positioned to take advantage of the enormous buying opportunities in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>At Marmaxx, our total inventory commitment including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order was essentially flat versus last year on a per-store basis. We would expect Marmaxx's inventory commitments to be flat to slightly up over the first half of fiscal 2011 given the strong pace of our business this year compared to last.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the fourth quarter results. Net sales for the 13-week fourth quarter were $5.9 billion, a 10% increase over the last year on a reported basis and up 18% on a 13-week comparable basis which exclude the 8-point benefit of the extra week in last year's fiscal calendar. Consolidated comp store sales were up a very strong 12% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter were $0.94. That's up 62% over last year's reported $0.58 per share. Again, prior year's results included items impacting comparability which are detailed in today's press release. Excluding these items, diluted EPS increased 104% over the adjusted $0.46 per share last year.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated pre-tax margin was 10.7%, up 330 basis points over prior year for the quarter. Comparisons to prior year were adversely impacted by the prior-year reduction to the computer intrusions reserve, which benefited last year's pre-tax margin <mark type="indiscernible" /> 40 basis points. So they are actually up a little bit more than that this year excluding <mark type="ph" /> that impact.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin improved 410 basis points over the last year due to extremely strong merchandise margins, combined with buying and occupancy expense leverage. The benefit of the 53rd week to last year's gross profit margins was essentially offset by the negative impact from mark-to-market adjustments on inventory hedges during the same period last year.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense for the quarter was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales with the positive impact of cost reduction initiatives and expense leverage more than offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation and contributions to the TJX Foundation, which combined had an adverse 110 basis point impact, so excluding that impact, SG&amp;A actually leveraged by 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call back to Carol and I will recap our first quarter full-year guidance at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. So let me go straight to the major themes I want to highlight on this call, which are: first, why we believe our strong comps and customer traffics are sustainable; second, why we are confident that our margins are sustainable; and third, how we plan to increase square footage growth while simultaneously delivering strong financial returns.</p>
          <p>We are very confident that our outstanding 2009 performance was not a one-year phenomenon, and we believe that we can ultimately grow this company to be double the size it is today. I'll begin with what gives us confidence and the sustainability of strong comps and traffic. First, we enter 2010 with significant momentum, which bodes very well for our future. If we look at our two and three year aggregate comps, the trend in our business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Second, we believe that there has been a paradigm shift among customers to value. We expect that the economic recovery will be muted, and our history shows that after recession new customers stick with us and comps increase. Regardless of whether the economy is weak or strong, value isn't going out of style. Also, if some of our newly acquired customers go back to shopping at their favorite high-end department store more often than in the past, it does not mean they'll stop shopping us. Our value proposition meets the needs of the consumer in an unconventional way. Our no walls business model enables us to shift rapidly as customers' tastes change.</p>
          <p>We can entirely eliminate one category and open a new category within weeks or months. We are sourcing products around the globe. We've opened over 2,000 new vendors in 2009 bringing the number in our vendor universe to over 12,000. We are actually more of a sourcing machine than practically any other retailer, and I'm not sure this is understood as well as it should be. I believe the quality of our merchandise mix is more exciting than ever and getting even better. My expectation for 2010 is to wow our customers even more.</p>
          <p>The third reason we believe our strong comps and traffic are sustainable is our broad customer demographic reach, which we believe is wider than just about any other retailer. With our various concepts and international scope, we appeal to high, middle and low-end demographics. Our numbers tell us that new customers are driving our transactions, and that we are pulling new customers from a widening range of income levels.</p>
          <p>There is a whole new group of customers out there who have discovered us and could not be happier with the value that we are bringing to them. Even more exciting is that our research shows us that new customers intend to continue shopping with us. Our research further shows that 75% of U.S. shoppers have not shopped our stores in the past year. That means there are tens of millions of untapped shoppers in just the U.S. alone who we can attract to our stores with great value.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we are making significant investments in marketing to drive traffic and then our shopping experience keep our customers coming back. We expanded our advertising reach in 2009 and we'll go even further this year. We will be continuing with our educational messaging, increasing our advertising spend and our penetration will be even greater than last year.</p>
          <p>While our marketing message is driving new customers to our stores, we understand that a great shopping experience is what keeps them coming back. In 2009, we began an extensive store remodel program, and by fall 2010 Marmaxx will have 700 stores in the new prototype. As this represents 40% of Marmaxx's stores and we are seeing lift in remodeled stores, we believe this creates an opportunity for us in the back half.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue our aggressive remodel program over the next three years. When we consider the combination of our momentum, the paradigm shift of consumers to value, our unusually wide demographic reach, the strength of our marketing and our upgrading the shopping experience, what all of this means for the future of our business, we believe that our strong momentum will continue.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll move from top line drivers to margin sustainability, which we know is a big topic of discussion out there. Let me start by saying that we expect pre-tax margin to increase slightly in 2010 on top of the very strong year we just delivered. Jeff will get into the details in a moment but let me share with you why we are confident that we will achieve our margin goals.</p>
          <p>First, our gross margin increases in 2009 were largely driven by lower inventory levels, and we plan to run even tighter this year. Our inventories are turning faster than ever before and our plan is to turn them even faster in 2010. Leaner inventories and faster turns force our buyers to buy even closer to need, driving mark-on and reducing mark downs. Merchandise margins increased significantly in 2009 and we are planning them up slightly in 2010 on top of 2009's strong performance. Further, we continued to improve our supply chain to run faster and better, getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right time. The bottom line here is that improved merchandise margins are sustainable as long as we manage our inventories well and keep them lean.</p>
          <p>Second, we have seen the benefit of our cost containment initiatives in the last few years and believe that significant opportunities still remain. For 2010, we are planning expense reductions of $50 million to $75 million and I believe we have a good chance of exceeding that range. Our big <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:58) continue to be non-merchandised procurement, in store, and DC labor efficiencies and supply chain.</p>
          <p>Third, we continue to have significant leverage opportunities. Our younger businesses are still moving toward their targeted profit margin potential and we gain leverage as they grow their store bases. We also gain leverage as our established business, as Marmaxx and TJX Canada continue to grow their store fleet. Our European expansion enables us to spread costs across a wider store base and leverage our pan-European structure. Further, our newer European businesses are showing very attractive financial return potential. Our stores in Germany continue to outperform and we expect our German business to be profitable this year. We are also pleased with Poland's initial trends.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to how we plan to grow square footage and simultaneously drive strong financial returns. We netted 91 stores in 2009 and the vast majority are exceeding plan. With the success of our growth vehicles, we now believe we can grow square footage at a rate faster moving from 3% in 2009 to 5% in 2010, or a net 130 stores. Further, in 2011, our plans call for accelerating square footage growth to approximately 6%.</p>
          <p>Let me share with you the reason for our confidence in accelerating the pace of our growth. TJX has plenty of room to grow. With over 2,700 stores today, we believe we have the potential to ultimately grow to over 4,200 stores with just our current portfolio in our current <mark type="ph" /> markets alone (16:54). That's before further expansion in Europe or a rollout of our stand-alone shoe concepts or any other new concept.</p>
          <p>We have a successful track record of delivering growth with financial return. Returns on invested capital have increased as we've grown our business and now stand at 20% after tax.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about how we're looking at growth. We continue to believe that we are far from finished in adding stores to Marmaxx. We see the potential to add several hundred more stores at this division and grow it to be over 2,000 stores long-term. Because we see this potential, and because of the huge leverage we get from Marmaxx, our priority is to aggressively add stores to Marmaxx while supporting growth for HomeGoods and A.J. Wright.</p>
          <p>HomeGoods had an outstanding year in 2009, delivering segment profit margins that support our growth plan. A.J. Wright also had a great year, achieving store contribution levels that give us the confidence to rollout this chain further. We will take a steady approach with these businesses in 2010 and may accelerate store growth in 2011.</p>
          <p>Further, we are pleased with our standalone Marshalls Shoe Megashop concept, just one of our growth seeds. TJX Europe is exceeding expectations and the landscape is wide open for our price. In addition to Germany performing well customers response to HomeSense in the UK is phenomenal and Poland is off to a solid start.</p>
          <p>With the early success of these businesses, we will be growing at a faster pace in Europe this year and likely will do more next year. We also want to tell you about our plan to launch a new off-chain concept in spring of 2011. We are not ready to let you know the name or the details yet, but it has the potential to be a 90 to a 100 store chain. Stay tuned as we will be sharing more with you as soon as we get onto this exciting venture.</p>
          <p>The final point I want to share with you on growth is that we are investing in our infrastructure and hiring the best talent globally to support our plans for square footage growth acceleration. Now I'll spend a moment on our financial strength.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we are taking a balanced approach to managing our cash. First, we're aggressively investing in our growth and we are increasing our CapEx to $750 million range. Jeff will provide details on this in a moment.</p>
          <p>Even with this increase, we plan to buy back close to $1 billion of TJX stock and expect that our Board of Directors will increase our dividend by 25%. With all of this, we still forecast ending 2010 with cash well over $1 billion</p>
          <p>In terms of our financial plans for fiscal 2011, we will continue to plan conservatively and strive to surpass our goals as we have done successfully over time. Jeff will go through guidance in detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>So in closing, I hope that I have &#x2013; in closing I hope that what I shared with you today make you as confident as we are in the continued profitable growth of TJX. We are very confident that our top line and bottom line performance is sustainable. We started 2010 with great momentum, which we believe bodes extremely well for our businesses. We are not an average retailer. We operate an extraordinary business model on a very large scale that delivers consistent performance in strong and weak economic environments, that enables us to create merchandise categories quickly to meet and stay current with the customer demand. We believe we are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the value-oriented mindset of consumers, which believe is here to stay.</p>
          <p>We have very broad customer appeal, and it's only widening in its environment. All of our growth vehicles are performing well, and we have plentiful opportunities in front of us and are confident in our ability to deliver growth with financial returns. I am excited about our growth prospectus for 2010 and believe we have many more great years to come.</p>
          <p>Our no-loss business model allows us to drive costs, we're increasing the rate of square footage growth, and we plan to run with even leaner, fast return in inventories which allows us to increase margin. While aggressively reinvesting in our business, we are also distributing significant returns to our shareholders. We are careful and methodical in our approach to our business and have the confidence that TJX will be a $30 billion and then $40 billon company.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff to go through our guidance and then we will open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol. Let me first provide you with our view of the three-year model. We continue to model on annual EPS growth rate for the next three years in a 12% range, which as Carol mentioned, we have exceeded over time. This model is based on a comp-store sales increase in the 2% range, square footage growth in the 5% to 6% range, margin expansion contributing approximately 1 percentage point of EPS growth and 3 to 4 points of EPS growth coming from the stock buyback. This differs from prior models, as Carol noted earlier, as we're planning acceleration in the square footage growth.</p>
          <p>Let me downturn the guidance for fiscal 2011 and cover both the full year and the first quarter. My full year comments are going to be at a high level and we're providing guidance for TJX on a consolidated basis only at this time. On the other hand, the first quarter guidance will be more detailed and will have a full model with division detail available for you.</p>
          <p>For fiscal 2011, we expect diluted EPS from continuing operations for the full year to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.20, which represents an 8% to 13% increase over $2.84 which we earned in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Some of the details: This guidance assumes consolidated top-line sales of about $21.5 billion -- $21.7 billion and a consolidated comp store sales increase in the 1% to 2% on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.</p>
          <p>For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be 9.5% to 9.8%. This represents a 10 basis point decrease to a 20 basis point increase over fiscal 2010's strong margin performance. We are confident we can deliver this level of profitability at a very low single-digit comp increase given continued inventory management and cost reduction opportunities. Some of the elements, we expect gross profit margin to be flat to slightly up and SG&amp;A to be flat to slightly down as a percentage of sales versus fiscal 2010, again, on a 1% to 2% comp. Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels, provides about $0.01 of the planed EPS growth over fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we are planning net interest expense in the $40 million range, a tax rate of 38.4%, which is up 60 basis points over prior year and a weighted average share count of 409 million. Capital is planned in the $750 million range and we are planning to buy back in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. While we are not providing guidance here on our first quarter, we would expect comps to be stronger in the first half and then flat to slightly down in the back half as we anniversary last year's strong numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to first quarter guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65 which is a 22% to 33% increase over last year's very strong $0.49 per share. We are assuming a first quarter top line in the $4.8 billion range with comps in the 3% to 5% range on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. As the monthly costs for the first quarter, for February we are planning comp sales increases of 8% to 9% on a consolidated basis, and 9% to 10% at the Marmaxx Group, and I should note that these increases are coming despite the unfavorable wintry weather that we saw during the month. On both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group, we are planning on comp increases of 2% to 4% in March, and flat 2% in April, which are reflective of the shift in Easter earlier in the calendar this year.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 8.5% to 9% range in Q1, up 70 to 120 basis points over prior year. In terms of some of the elements, we're anticipating first quarter gross margin in the range of 25.8% to 26.2%, which is 100 to 140 basis points above last year's strong performance.</p>
          <p>We're expecting SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales to be about 17% to 17.1%, now that's up 10 to 20 basis points over prior year. This increase is largely driven by higher store payrolls, because we are up against some very deep cuts last year, probably too deep, and also are impacted by the impact of our European new businesses and certain other factors, which combined, slightly offset our planned cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Again as I mentioned earlier we are planning SG&amp;A flat to slightly down for the full year on the 1% to 2% comp, and comp our ability to leverage. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense to be in the $10 million to $11 million range. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 414 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>I will wrap it up with our store growth plans for next year, for fiscal 2011. As Carol mentioned on a consolidated basis we plan to net 130 stores for a total of 2,873 stores by year end and increase square footage by approximately 5%, so let me talk to these statistics.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. starting with Marmaxx, we planned to increase the store base by a net of about 43 stores for a total of 1,746 stores by year end. At HomeGoods we've planned to net nine stores for a total of 332 HomeGoods stores by the end of the year. At A.J. Wright, we anticipate netting eight stores for a total of 158 stores by year-end. At TJX Canada, we plan to net four Winners stores and two HomeSense stores to end the year with a total of 296 stores in Canada.</p>
          <p>Now to Europe, where we expect to add a net of 44 new stores in fiscal 2011, in the UK, we expect to add 10 T.K. Maxx stores as well as six HomeSense stores for a combined total of 265 by the end of the year. We will continue to take advantage of the phenomenal real estate opportunities we're seeing in the UK. We also expect to open 25 stores in Germany for a total of 49 stores in that country by the end of the year. In Poland, we expect to open three stores in fiscal 2011 for a total of seven stores in that country by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And finally, like last year we are maintaining a fund in our capital plans to take advantage of the best real estate opportunities, the bulk of which will likely be at Marmaxx and in the UK. These additional stores are included in the 130 stores we plan to add in fiscal '11, but not in the divisional plan I've just recapped.</p>
          <p>We ask you please &#x2013; we'll open the questions now. We ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to enforce the one question limit, and we appreciate your cooperation.</p>
          <p>So thanks, and with that I'll turn it back to Elan and we'd like to take questions now.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, I think you gave a lot of compelling reasons as to why the operating margin is sustainable here, I am just looking back historically, and there has been slight volatility over time in that operating margin and I am wondering if there has been a fundamental change in the way we run business that leads you to believe that may be some of that volatility has been removed? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've been obviously striving over the years in terms of the supply chain to lean-up our inventories and to make us faster, fresher, that's been a goal that we have been working on for several years. So, I think that this year was a big step for us in running our inventories a lot leaner and turning almost a week faster. I believe that we have reached a level that we can go a little bit further, but I think there is a shift in the way we run our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have in the past and really historically when you look back beyond three to four years back, when with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:20) back into the business, we had typically planned our businesses at higher levels of comps. And what happened is that if we had a miss, it was harder to pull back both inventory in cost dollars which led to some of that volatility. And I think now given that we plan our costs much lower than we did in the past, we set the inventory plans, as Carol mentioned, much leaner now as a result of that as well as actions we've taken to improve the way we manage inventories. And we're also more focused on cost reduction over the last three, four years than we were in the past. All those things really helped take the volatility out. The one other thing I want to add is that when you look at the volatility of gross profit, our volatility is so much lower than any other retailer out there, as I am sure you know given the way that we can chase goods and opportunities and adjust inventory levels.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks very much. A question on inventory turnover, we have seen this nice acceleration in turn, I'm wondering where you ended up by division with in-store turns and where you think it can go from here. It's already remarkable to start with. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, we don't -- we really don't talk to the individual division turns. I can, however, tell you that again we do believe that there is room for us to turn even faster than we did in 2009 and that's what we're striving for.</p>

          <p>Well, we did start an Internet business in Europe and we're actually very pleased with the results. We are well aware of what's going out there in terms of the Internet and as we always do, that will be a future possibility for us and again we want to be methodical, thoughtful and when we do get to entering that arena in the States we would like to do it right. We were in the Internet business in the past, we closed it but we have been researching it and I think it's a future potential for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Turning to the store build out, it looks like there is more of an emphasis on the core Marmaxx over the next couple of years. I'm just wondering what's driving that. Is it lower rents? Are you finding better opportunities? And, also on the A.J. Wright business related to that, it looks like we're building fewer stores than I would have thought if, say, the business is where you want to be. Is there just more work that needs to be done before we definitively roll that out in a bigger fashion and can it still be the growth vehicle you have been contemplating the past couple of years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, you know what, it's all about prioritizing. It's just, when you have an opening to buy, we see &#x2013; we take the moment in time to seize the day. Marmaxx what we're seeing is with the Marshalls next to a Maxx, both boxes are performing extremely well, we've differentiated the businesses over the years, and we're really at a point in time when we are putting the two together, they both do extremely well. So we're seeing more room there. We are also seeing our Mega Shoe concepts doing well. So it's really a matter of prioritizing, so we are feeding A.J.s, we are feeding HomeGoods, but at the same time we really want to accelerate Marmaxx and Europe because the return on investment is so strong there. So we absolutely believe that A.J. Wright right has the potential to be 500-plus stores, but again, it's just taking that capital and being intelligent how we invest it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Carol, in the past you said that, as you see less attractive buys, as inventory turns start to pick up in the wholesale channel that you can increase AUR. Would love to hear your thoughts on the potential to take up AUR by segment, your outlook for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, we've planned it conservatively, so we have planned our average retail is slightly down. However, that's only going to be on the plus side as it trends up and we're going to see how it goes through the year. It is leveling off at this point and we are seeing a little bit less of a decline from a year ago. So again it's about keeping that distance between us and the department stores. So to us it will be just upside, if it's flat or slightly up this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Excellent results. Just had a &#x2013; I guess, question about one or two of the divisions in the fourth quarter of the segment profit at A.J. Wright specifically and then I guess, looking specifically related to your comments on the vendor base having grown so substantially in 2009 what &#x2013; are you at this point pretty satisfied with kind of current size of the base and the mix of vendors or do you see potentially even further opportunities given the continued fallout from the recession? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well I'll talk to the vendor base and then Jeff will talk to the A.J. segment profit in the fourth quarter. We are going to keep increasing our vendor base, I mean, we have worked very, very hard in the last several years and as I talked before we have over 100 people in Germany, we have offices now in India. We have offices in France. We have offices in Denmark. So, the excitement of our mix in the future is constant change and newness and being ahead of our fashion curve. So we'll continue to increase our vendor base. And obviously there'll be vendors that we drop because they may not be appropriate for our business, but this is never going to stop. I mean, this is part of what and who we are and that's part of our supply chain machine. So, we will increase that. Jeff, you want to go through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm going to anticipate your question here, Daniel. I am going to assume &#x2013; A.J. Wright last year reported a second profit margin of 2.7% in the quarter and this year it's 2.5%, so I assume you're curious as to why it would be down 20 basis points when we threw up an <mark type="ph" /> 8% (38:13) comp on the business. And it's really simple. It's a function of the 53rd week and the bonus, last year we benefited 70 basis points from the 53rd week. We obviously didn't have that 53rd week this year, and also the bonus impacted A.J. Wright by about 70 basis points. So, you throw those together, A.J. actually, excluding those factors, increased its pre-tax segment profitability by 120 basis points, which is really in line with where we would have expected it to be.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; I'm going to just &#x2013; you didn't ask this question, but we actually had a very similar situation with Europe, where Europe was down 100 basis points on a reported basis. But when you back out the 53rd week and the bonus, you actually have quite a bit of leverage there too. So, I will anticipate that might be a question of yours or others and that's the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. It was really to the, I guess the question of did those divisions in light of those two sort of non-comparable factors, were they in line with your margin expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so, actually above the margin expectation. Yeah, we're seeing strong merchandise margins across those businesses just as we did our other businesses and we're continuing the leverage costs when you split out the bonus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks guys. Can you maybe share with us your traffic first ticket assumptions that underpin that 1% to 2% comp guidance? And Jeff can you maybe give us a breakdown on CapEx as how to split up that 750 between new stores and remodels and other projects you might have going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't give specifics on traffic, but I can assure you it's continuing and it's very, very aggressive and we're seeing that continue in the month of February. So we have pretty strong momentum there. Jeff you want to go through...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think as you think about it the retail flat to slightly down, transactions would be up and that would be implied in the 1% to 2%, so. In terms of capital, maybe I'll just talk to increases, Paul, if that's okay, we would anticipate that between new stores, remodels, and in-store initiatives that that would represent about two-thirds of the growth in the CapEx budget year-over-year. The balance of it is adding distribution capacity to support our European growth as well as some systems investments to support European growth and to replace some end of life hardware is probably the way to say it, in the United States. We're doing nothing in the systems or, by the way that would put our business at risk. There is no major software replacement so anything any sort of note. The one other thing included in the increase is that we do have an opportunity fund or a contingency that's available to Carol to either add some more new stores or other investments as we see fit, so it's kind of a kitty that we are maintaining in corporate and that's about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:10).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost to open store in the U.S. versus &#x2013; you were going to say something, why don't you go ahead and take...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I was going to say, Paul, we're going to in terms of traffic, we're going to continue pretty close to that pace going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean the cost to open a new store in the U.S. it's obviously more expensive in Europe just kind of flipping into some numbers here to make sure I give you a good number. I think with inventories it's almost twice as much in Europe, but that said, our European stores are significantly more productive than our U.S. stores because of the density that we typically find around the store which allows us to generate similar contribution margins as we would make in Marmaxx.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, couple of questions here real quickly. One, incentive comps, and I'm wondering is part of the increase that we are seeing in the first quarter due to the fact that you're going to try and smooth out the incentive comp accrual in the new fiscal year? And then also, if you can kind of break out for us the leverage in buying and occupancy versus merchandise margin improvement that you saw for the fourth quarter and year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in terms of the impact of the bonus on the first &#x2013; you wanted that on the first quarter, right Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First quarter and then for the year as well, I presume that it was so large in the back half of the year because you just had under-accrued during the first two quarters. Maybe that's not correct but I'm assuming that's part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of it was a pick up. As we look at the SG&amp;A rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, incentive comp doesn't have a big &#x2013; isn't big factor because we were essentially on our plan or slightly ahead of the plan last year in the first quarter, so we didn't have a big kick-up in incentive comp last year that we're going up against this year.</p>
          <p>As we look at the full year we do have, to kind of breakdown the SG&amp;A, we've got &#x2013; we'll have pick up for the full year from bonus, Jeff, because obviously we have a higher bonus expense in fiscal 2010 that we're going to have in fiscal 2011 because of the &#x2013; we're planning fiscal 2010 &#x2013; fiscal 2011 as we plan for fiscal 2011 &#x2013; sorry, we're planning fiscal 2011 plan have this plan whereas in fiscal 2010 we significantly exceeded the plan. So there is a pick up in the bonus. That is largely being offset by some expense increases in some other areas. We get a little bit of a deleveraging effect as we put the rapid expansion in the European business. The average retail we're planning down, as Carol mentioned, that means we have to ship more units to do the same business, so that has some impact on SG&amp;A. There is some increase in medical costs and so on. So those largely offset the pickup we get from the bonus next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And buying and occupancy and merchandise margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we really don't break that out. I guess what would tell you is that we saw significant buying and occupancy leverage for the year and for the quarter, but the lion's share of the improvement in the gross profit margin is being driven by merchandise margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question; you had mentioned, Carol &#x2013; I mean obviously a big focus is to hold on to the new customers and drive that stickiness, so I'm wondering the remodels, it sounds as if you're seeing a comp lift, any sort of help in terms of quantification? Because when we think about the guidance for the year, the 1% to 2%, you are obviously starting off very strong, with strong momentum in 3% to 5% for Q1. I am just wondering since 40% of the Marmaxx will be in the remodeled format, why then should we expect the comps to decelerate to that 1% to 2% for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Adrianne, obviously we really don't give out specific remodel cost, but and I think that, as always, we put a conservative model out there, what we feel that we want to obviously build our cost to, and then anything above that, obviously, will flow aggressively to the bottom line. So, we are planning prudently. We are doing very similar to what we did last year with our hope and our intent to beat those numbers. So, we've got a lot of good things going on but we have no idea, again, with the economy what's going to happen. So, I think we are being again planning prudently and being careful.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, understood. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, if I could, in terms of the accelerated square footage that you highlight, I'm just wondering what you say to, we've seen an environment where it seems like imitation, is sort of, highest form of flattery, a lot of people are looking enviously to the off-price sector, whether it's Nordstrom accelerating The Rack or Bloomingdales announcing sort of an outlet division. So, help us understand as you too see opportunity to accelerate square footage, help us understand and speak to the Mayfairers, where you're not, there isn't an issue as it relates to perhaps securing real estate, securing inventory as more and more people kind of try and follow your lead? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of our competitors, we are always looking at our competitors, but we are a very different business and very unique in terms of our sourcing, our supply chain and our flexibility. So we &#x2013; I get asked obviously the question of is there going to be goods out there and I can answer this 100 times, a thousand times, a million times, we are not concerned about it. Again, I just keep coming back to the sourcing, the way we source, our foothold all over the world. So, that is not a major concern for us. What we always look at is our competitors. We always want to make sure our value is right against our competitor's and that's what we focus on. So, I think we feel very confident going forward, and I think it takes people a long time to get to where TJX is because we've built this business over tens of years.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a lot of scale. And on the real estate side, Adrianne, we just work continuing to see terrific deals. So, as long as we see strong deals and strong returns, as Carol mentioned, most of the deals we did last year are exceeding our numbers. So we'll keep investing aggressively as long as we continue to see that.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you guys made a really compelling case as to why comp growth is sustainable and of course the history supports the case because you've grown comps 4% on average during recessions and 3% on average during all other periods since your IPO. But &#x2013; and I understand your conservative guidance of 1% to 2% but what I would like to get a better feeling about is what you see or what you're planning on the average ticket since it was down pretty decently last year, the comparisons are easy, I would expect some stabilization in the ticket and obviously in the better environment that might even trend up because I'm just curious what you're seeing and if you could just address that trend, the average ticket trend in 2010 versus last year? And then how does it change with the potential for 90 to 100 doors move the needle to any great degree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you will see when we announce it that if that we believe it has the potential to be as fairly profitable business and so again more to come on that. And as far as the average ticket goes, we've planned it slightly down, so that anything that comes close to flat or above will hopefully be gravy and drive comps and certainly drive to the bottom line but what we want to do is make sure we absolutely have the best value out there and that's what we're really striving for.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. Carol, I was hoping you could kind of talk to us about what you see as the areas of opportunity in terms of merchandising focus? And also if you guys could expand on the supply chain initiatives, getting the right product to the right place at the right time, when should we feel that impact, what are you doing in terms of profiling the stores, what level, that sort of thing? And then just a clarification on the SG&amp;A, you said $50 million to $75 million, is that the reduction in SG&amp;A dollars or is there some offset so it's not down that much? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Stacy, you only get one question, which one do you want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want you to address the merchandise and supply chain stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We've seen many, many areas of operation and we obviously, I always say take a walk in our stores because this is not something that we share exactly what we are planning by division. Many, many different initiatives are in each division they're not the same. And then we obviously leverage our no walls, so we've got plenty, plenty of new opportunity for next year, and we are very excited about it. And this year we test a lot of new categories, we are testing some different categories for next year, but we think in some of our divisions where we had some weaknesses in the apparel areas, I think we are seeing some strength and I like where we're going with that.</p>
          <p>The supply chain has been ongoing. Every single year we get more pointed, and that's been part of our investment over the years. And I think we have a long way to go but we definitely made some inroads last year, and I think this year will be even better in terms of targeting our stores. So that's an initiative that's going to go on for the next several years. Again, we don't go in and say, let's just change our entire systems and do anything dramatic. So, we have been building on our base and getting much more focused and more pointed on it. So that will just be ongoing, but we did see some pretty good results in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us any sense in terms of how you are thinking about the stores, Carol? Are you saying this is a fashion store, this is a &#x2013; how are you profiling the stores and how are you getting the right product there? Can you give us any more detail there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very deep. We take a very deep cut in terms of the level of store, the type of merchandise, how contemporary it is, the type of customer that is shopping that store. We have a very, very deep understanding; the different weather patterns, early deals with Marmaxx in terms of North, South, Marshalls, Max in Canada, he deals with all different weather patterns. So, we are pretty detailed and we're getting a lot more detailed. Do you have any comments to make, Ernie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think just backing up what Carol said, we have &#x2013; our planning organization really does a great job on this and I think we have become more sophisticated in the last few years at zeroing in by climate, but by demographics, by location. So, I think we are really in a different place than we were a few years ago, and I can see that continuing to improve over the next couple of years.</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot. Carol, can you tell us &#x2013; would you be willing to share with us, over the last year, has there been any significant change in the percentage of your buys that were maybe off-price relative to the percentage that comes from upfront buying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, if you ramp up square footage growth just overall, is there any change to the size of the different boxes by concept?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laura, yeah, again, as we get better and better at understanding the consumer, we look at the specific locations and the box is a relationship obviously to the demographics, the number of people that are in a certain radius. So, we flex dramatically. If there is a site in New York City and it's a smaller box, but very, very high traffic pattern, we can do a smaller store and drive it. You will see the same thing in London. We have some stores that range as small as 12,000 square feet, to stores that range to 50,000 square feet. So, again, that's the flexibility of our business and we can take full advantage of all of the real estate that's out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at the average, the average at all outs, we can do larger boxes, smaller boxes, and Carol mentioned how we flex more. But we also &#x2013; when you look at just the average square footage, it's pretty consistent. It actually ends up being pretty consistent, so that, I think in the past we might have opened &#x2013; we didn't have as much diversity in the kinds of deals that we did. Now we can have more diversity, but the average size of the box is pretty comparable to what it has been before.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, congratulations. Jeff, I think Carol's kitty needs to be like three times. I could spend her kitty on a good weekend. I was very curious about two things, first marketing, you could talk about what your &#x2013; we know what you are doing here in the U.S., if you could talk a little about what you're doing in Europe and as you expand in Germany and Poland, just to support these brands? And then, just a follow-up kind of clean up thing, could you just touch on loss prevention and shrinkage and remind us when you do a fiscal inventory at the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of marketing in Europe, it's very, very different than in the United States, the United States we tend to drive TV a lot harder. Each country is very different. What Paul does in the UK is very different than what he does in Germany and in Poland. So, we are not going to divulge our trade secrets, but they're very, very different strategies. And Ernie is also looking Canada and really leveraging some of the things that we're doing in United States with Canada, as we're also leveraging some of the things that we are doing with Marmaxx, with HomeGoods. So, we really look at each brand very differently and how we market each brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are marketing all of these brands in these countries.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of loss prevention, we take a full physical inventory at the end of the year for each of our chains, every store in the chain. And in terms of shrinkage we really don't comment on that, that's part of the gross margin results, and if it were a significant factor, it's something we'd talk about but it really hasn't been significant to the results for many years.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from David Weiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my call. So, I had a question on long-term margin potential. I think in October during your Analyst Day, you had kind of broken that down by brand. Has there been any meaningful change to your kind of long-term pre-tax margin goals by brand and how that rolls up to the total company? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in total as I mentioned in the three year model, David, we've got about a point of our EPS growth over the next three years coming from margin expansions, that would equate to about 10 to 20 basis points over that time period. And that's almost entirely coming from leveraging our &#x2013; increasing our margins at businesses other than Marmaxx and Winners, which we plan flat. So the business, Marmaxx and Winners will be plan flat, other than Marmaxx and Winners we've assumed some leverage as we roll out new stores.</p>
          <p>As we think about the potential margins, the only thing we would say is at Marmaxx at the time we were saying 10.5 to 11.5, Marmaxx came in at 12. I think as Carol mentioned earlier we think we can maintain that, we'll see how well we can do, so that'll be interesting to see.</p>
          <p>I think with T.K. Maxx in the UK, historically we've said eight to nine. We are approaching nine as we exit the year and we still have leverage opportunities with Europe. So clearly T.K. in the UK can go higher and we would now anticipate that more in the 9% to 10% range. And we are going to see how high we take that. What's interesting is that that our distribution network is pan-European, we have many shared services that we are leveraging. And so as we grow Europe we are getting leverage in Europe, we are also getting more leverage in the UK.</p>
          <p>And lastly with HomeGoods, I think before we've said we thought it was about 8% business, we're now thinking it's more like 8% to 9%, because again HomeGoods is approaching that 8% margin this past year and we still have, we could still double the fleet in terms of the number of stores. So there should be more leverage available there as we grow that. So those would the changes that I will highlight.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd say good afternoon and add my congratulations. In terms of your TV advertising in 2009, I believe that you went from regional to national buys, and as a result reached a lot more markets in TV advertising than you had before. I'm just wondering if you've analyzed the success for that and the returns and just wondered how much of your success in 2009 was at least partially attributable to the approach you took at your TV advertising and the reach of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we were very, very happy with our advertising strategy last year. And this year we are shifting more media back into the network TV. We are actually going to be taking our individual brands, Marshalls and Maxx and going network, which is going to be a pretty big increase in penetration. We've loaded up the back half and we are going to continue more aggressively also on our dual strategy. So, we are really very, very happy with our marketing strategy and I think we are going to be a lot more aggressive this year coming up.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Jeff, and just quick a follow-up, could you give us a rule of thumb on the flow-through if you are able to get incremental sales over planned, what kind of incremental flow-through as a percentage of sales that you generally carry to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would quantify that around like in the low 30s, so for every dollar of sales above planned I think 30% to 33% kind of in that range, and another way to think about it is point of comp above plan specifically gives us about 20 basis point of incremental margin on the bottom line for a full year.</p>

          <p>Right. Diana, we are very, very happy with the Cube, and in terms of &#x2013; and we're happy with the Runway. But in terms of taking that internationally, yes, we have no walls and where an initiative works in a division, the other divisions appropriately, if it makes sense for their business, can take the initiative in. So, Europe has actually had several different things going on and we'll learn from that. So, the idea is then, with no walls that we're constantly sharing the information so that every single brand can maximize their business and do what's right for their business. It's in part of our really getting together almost every single Monday, all of our presidents and our seniors and the sharing of information. So that will continue.</p>
