        <plist>
          <p>A warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening to SingTel's earnings conference call for the quarter ended 30 June 2011. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Yang Song (0:00:11) and let me introduce management on the call: Ms Chua Sock Koong, group CEO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO Optus; Mr. Hui Weng Cheong, CEO International; Ms Jeann Low, group CFO. They are assisted by other members of the management team, both from Singapore and Australia.</p>
          <p>Before we start taking the questions I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks <mark type="ph" /> Yang Song (0:00:38). We announced our results for the quarter ended 30 June 2011 this morning. Let me just take you through some key highlights of the group's performance. If you look at the group's operations in Singapore and Australia, that remains resilient and we continued to grow our revenue.</p>
          <p>Higher taxes from Bharti due to reductions in tax holiday benefits, and non-recurring exchange gains last year, led to a 3% decline in net profits. The stronger Australian dollar helped lift the contribution from Optus, although this was offset by the weaker regional currencies.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, revenue excluding fiber rollout revenue, grew 4%. EBITDA declined 4% and that's due to mioTV content and service costs. I'd just like to highlight that we started incurring the costs of EPL from August last year. In Australia, Optus revenue growth moderated to 3%. That reflects an intensely competitive environment. We were still, however, able to improve EBITDA slightly.</p>
          <p>The group and its associates continued to register strong customer growth. We now have 416 million mobile customers. Pre-tax ordinary earnings from the regional mobile associates declined 10% due mainly to the weaker regional currencies and the impact of Bharti Africa's losses. In constant currency, and excluding Bharti Africa, earnings for the regional mobile associates would have been stable.</p>
          <p>Overseas operations now contribute 77% of proportionate EBITDA, Optus 30% and the regional mobile associates accounting for about 45%. During the quarter, the group successfully completed S$3.7 billion of revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes and also to refinance our existing facilities, we had support from major banks.</p>
          <p>We also successfully launched Singapore's second satellite, the ST-2, and that has a footprint covering Asia and the Middle East. ST-2 will help enhance our ICT capabilities and our offerings to businesses, and that includes shipping companies and direct-to-home operators. We also launched Asia's first premium priority mobile broadband service, and we call that Priority Pass, that is to ensure that customers who subscribe to higher speeds have a consistently faster mobile data experience.</p>
          <p>In Australia, Optus reached a landmark agreement with NBN Co. on the migration of HFC services to the National Broadband Network. The payment from NBN Co. are estimated at about A$800 million. That is on a post-tax NPV basis. Optus also won an A$200 million five year contract for NBN Co. satellite services.</p>
          <p>Just a word about Bharti Africa. Bharti has operated in Africa now for a year and we have seen steadily improving customer numbers and usage levels and that has translated into improvements in revenue and EBITDA. The transformation and restructuring plans for Africa are progressing well and we expect Africa to be well positioned to deliver further growth for Bharti.</p>
          <p>So with that let me hand over to <mark type="ph" /> Yang Song (0:04:07) to take questions.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you, Sock Koong. I would like to remind participants that this call will last for about an hour. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our operator will now assist you to put through your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. I have four questions, two on Australia, two on Singapore. I'll start with Singapore first. We have seen revenue for managed services and international lease circuits in Singapore decline on a sequential basis. So my query is, is this decline seasonal or is this decline kind of a structural nature due to pricing pressure?</p>
          <p>My second question is well, I guess, we are seeing a huge content cost impacting the bottom line, how soon breakeven can be achieved on those costs? It seems you focus on ROIC as you always say, what kind of ROIC we are you talking about for these content costs?</p>
          <p>And then, my last two questions on Australia. If you can just comment on the relative performance of Optus and Telstra, just to give us an idea of what's happening exactly in terms of competitive pressures in Australia. And the last is a bit of a question, what if hypothetically, what would happen to the Optus numbers if mobile termination rate are reduced from A$0.09 cents to A$0.06 in Australia? I'm sure you are working towards trying to convince the regulator, but if in case it is done, what kind of risk we are talking about? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Allen can take the Singapore questions, and Paul the two Australian questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with regard to the first question, managed services and ILC, the decline on the quarter-to-quarter basis is due to primarily in Q4, the last financial year we had some one-off revenues for managed services.</p>
          <p>As you know, managed services, basically we provide more than just network lease and rental services. We provide sometimes equipment to go with the services that link into our network. So some of this equipment are charged on a one-time basis and we have more of that happening in Q4 than we had in Q1 of this year, so that accounted for the decline on the quarter on quarter basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of content cost, you had two questions there. The first one on content cost was how soon can we expect turnaround in EBITDA for the Singapore business. Basically, we've guided for a flat EBITDA for the year. So I think Q1 the major primary reason for the decline is because we didn't have the sports content cost in Q1 last year. As Sock Koong has mentioned, we started to amortize or started to account for content cost from August of last year.</p>
          <p>So second quarter this year we will see three quarters of content cost versus two quarters and a bit for last year. I can't predict exactly which quarter will turnaround, but certainly we reaffirm that for the Singapore business we'll be guiding for a flat EBITDA for the year, so I think you can take the conclusion from that. I'll hand over to Paul to answer the Australian questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Allen and thanks Sachin for the question.</p>
          <p>Well, look, you know naturally, I don't think it's my place to get into a detailed critique of our results versus the Telstra's. But I would just make an overall comment on the industry here, which is if that you look at the industry, both of our major competitors are sacrificing yields and profit at the moment.</p>
          <p>Telstra have taken A$1 billion off their bottom line and they were quite open in saying that was designed to try and stop the share erosion and try and regain some momentum. Our smaller competitor has negative revenue growth, and has indeed got quite a few challenges. And we're the only one of the three who is actually growing both revenue and EBITDA. And from that point of view, I think it shows resilience and strength in terms of our strategy.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question on mobile termination rates, I think it's an important point to make that we believe there's a competitive and regulatory issue here primarily, not so much a financial issue. We are very firm as, indeed, we've noticed others in the industry that it is a mistake to simply apply the rationale that lowering mobile termination rates is good for competition.</p>
          <p>First point I'd make is that, unlike other jurisdictions, Australian carriers have to cover a huge landmass, the size of the US with a very low population, a population let's say of the Netherlands, and that gives you different economics and different drivers and if you want to make sure that carriers can continue to invest in the mobile sector you need to take a can't of the externalities associated with mobile termination rates.</p>
          <p>The second point we make is that, as was demonstrated by the previous reductions in mobile termination rates, the ACCC has no ability to force Telstra to pass those onto the end customer. And the net effect of the previous rounds of reductions was to give a windfall to Telstra. In fact, such a windfall that it even was material enough to be featured on the previous CEO's results slides, as a material benefit.</p>
          <p>And that actually is an anticompetitive outcome. It actually meant that the incumbent was better armed in terms of being able to defend and slowdown mobile competition. That's the core of the argument that we're advancing to the commission. From our point of view, it's not so much about a financial issue as it is about the impact on competition. And obviously given that we're very strongly advocating for S$0.09, I don't really see a lot of value in speculating beyond that in terms of a reduction. So I might leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on that one. I mean, just to check, this quarter we have seen EBITDA decline probably about 17% quarter-on-quarter. I understand this a seasonally weaker quarter than 4Q, which is seasonally very strong, but even then the magnitude of decline is kind of, you know, it's quite big and surprising to me. Is it just what kind of &#x2013; is it due to the competitive pressure by Telstra, newcomers, or is it just something you expected already? And this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:10:24).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about the whole Optus EBITDA quarter-on-quarter, which is A$560 million, which declined by 17% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and that's primarily driven by the mobile performance, in terms of the seasonality that exists. But I'll let Murray King, our CFO just talk you through some of the details, so you can get some insight on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Sachin, as you've previously seen, historically there is a reduction between our quarter four results and our quarter one results, and that's because of the seasonality, particularly in relation to the March quarter, where because of the holiday season and the shorter months in the March quarter you see lower acquisition costs and lower revenue.</p>
          <p>But I'd also point out, as detailed in our quarter four results, there was a one-off out-payment provision release. So that was a one-off benefit to the EBITDA line in the March quarter. So if you take that out of the analysis and then just look at the movement in respect of the March quarter to the June quarter, it's not abnormal or contrary to historical trends you've previously seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Roshan, Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. I've got three questions. First one on Singapore again, just in terms of the EBITDA guidance being flat for the full year, the cost savings would largely be coming from stable pay TV content in the next few quarters, or is there any other cost item that could see a meaningful reduction in the following quarters? And related question is the rugby content, pay TV content, is that on an exclusive basis, which was acquired?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the NBN. You talked about 22,000 fiber broadband subscribers. Is this growth coming in from migration of existing subscribers or these are all new subscribers?</p>
          <p>And third question is on associates. What's SingTel's view in terms of PT Telkom talking about buying back 35% SingTel's stake in Telkomsel? What are the different options that SingTel has and what does any of you like the outcome? And a related question is, any timeline in terms of turnaround or improvement at Warid and PBTL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me answer the questions on Singapore. Firstly, in terms of the EBITDA guidance and what we expect going ahead in the remaining three quarters, I think the content cost is the big difference compared to last year. I think in addition to that, I think you can also see subscriber acquisition costs in the Singapore business for our mobile business has also declined from last year. It's a function of optimization of the way we provide handset subsidies as well the strength of the Singapore dollar.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing very strong growth in mobiles, so that will have some impact on our EBITDA for the year. I think, overall, I think in the Telco business, we will continue to look at ways to be more efficient and to optimize our costs there. And as I mentioned earlier, while I can't tell you which quarter we are going to start to see positive EBITDA growth compared to last year, we will reaffirm our guidance and we will definitely indicate that we will start to turn around in subsequent quarters in the EBITDA trajectory.</p>
          <p>In terms of 22,000 fiber customers, we don't give you a split, but there is a percentage of these customers that do come from existing copper-based DSL plans. So I think, both in the business as well as in the consumer segments, there are customers where we have their profiles of their usage of internet plus their propensity to take some of the four unique applications that we have. So we do market to these customers, but we do get our fair share of customers who migrate over to us from our competitors or are establishing new households in Singapore. So it's a mixture, in short &#x2013; but I can't disclose the details to you, because we don't share that publicly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question of the Telkomsel's share buyback, we understand that will be completed in May. The management of Telkom was instructed by the Malaysian Government to conduct a review of merits of the repurchase of Telkomsel shares. Telkom is required to submit a report to government by the end of this year. We have not heard about the outcome of the review, so it is premature for us to comment. We have a very good partnership with both Telkom and Telkomsel and continue to be a long-term strategic investor in Indonesia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, and the final question in terms of turnaround in</p>
          <p>Warid &amp; PBTL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roshan, could you repeat your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just some color in terms of turnaround potential at Warid and PBTL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the telecom industry in Pakistan continues to be very challenging with stiff competition amidst the adverse economic and political situation. So this has impacted the performance of all the operators in Pakistan. But PBTL has been EBITDA positive for the past few quarters. While we continue to see a long term potential in the industry over there because of the potential for voice as well for data, resulting from the large youth population, but we are continuing to review the investments in Pakistan, even the possibility of consolidation if the opportunity arises.</p>
          <p>For PBTL, it is challenging for them because they are the only CDMA operator in the country with five others GSM operators operating on the GSM network. But the management has also moved into then in EVDO and they are one of the first few to offer broadband wireless data in conjunction with other operators with WiMAX for the Bangladesh consumers. But the operating environment continues to be challenging. The PBTL is now operating on cash management.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Sachin Gupta, Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thanks very much. Just a few things, firstly for Jeann. Jeann, just wondering with this NetLink Trust that has been established in Singapore, any clarity on how do you guys come up with S$1.9 billion value for the assets that have been transferred? And what does that mean for the rest of the assets which actually haven't been transferred yet? That's one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for Paul, Paul just on the -- for Optus, firstly on the fixed line business, we haven't seen much of a change in the unbundled local loops or the internet subs. I was just wondering is that something that's intentional or perhaps a reflection of the changing industry structure?</p>
          <p>And also for the mobile business, David Thodey in the call just then was mentioning that the market is relatively rational for wireless, whereas your comments in the MD&amp;A suggests that you guys think it's actually more competitive. So I was just wondering why the disconnect or does that mean you guys are not looking to react? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the NetLink Trust, let me just talk about the assets that have been transferred. The assets that have been transferred are the ducts and the manholes as well as seven exchanges that OpenNet requires for the NBN network. So those are the assets. It is actually a significant percentage of our manholes, because these manholes are required to fulfill OpenNet throughout to 95% of Singapore homes.</p>
          <p>Seven exchange buildings have also been transferred to NetLink Trust, and then obviously there is a lease agreement back to SingTel, because SingTel is occupying a significant portion of the space in those seven exchange buildings. But OpenNet will also take up some space there. So those are the assets that have been transferred.</p>
          <p>If you look at &#x2013; your question on valuation, the valuation is actually derived from a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and the valuation of course has taken into account the current estimates as well as projections of future fiber take-up rate in Singapore, amongst other factors.</p>
          <p>You know the initial customers of NetLink Trust would be obviously OpenNet as well as SingTel for use and access of the assets that will be owned by the business trust. And that would be &#x2013; obviously, the future value of the trust assets would depend on the future market conditions and the take up of fiber services vis-&#xE0;-vis our current projection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeann, can I check, does that mean, are you assuming that -- I mean S$1.9 billion sounded a bit low, I would have thought &#x2013; are you assuming that HFC and DSL continues to co-exist?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I missed your second point. Am I assuming what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you assuming that the current infrastructure, the cable or the DSL infrastructure, that that still remains when you are doing this DCF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, these assets only refer to the manholes and the ducts that is required by OpenNet, and obviously this infrastructure &#x2013; some part of these manholes and ducts will also be used by SingTel and possibly to other customers, you know? Whatever OpenNet fiber, whichever ducts and manholes it passes through, we are basically putting under this trust property, together with seven exchange buildings. So there are other assets, you know, passive infrastructure assets, there are other manholes and ducts that OpenNet does not access to, and those assets are retained by SingTel. It's not part of the trust property.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, its Paul here, and I'll just pick up on the second question that you had, which related to Australia. I have to say, and I'm sure you'll agree that there's a tremendous irony in hearing a company that's taken a billion dollars off its bottom line and reduced its margins significantly, to hear them describe market pricing as rational. By having heard that irony, I think if I get down to the market facts, the reality is that it is an extremely competitive market out there right now.</p>
          <p>We would take a little bit of the credit for that. I mean, there is no doubt that when our major competitors said they were going to reduce profitability to try and slow down the erosion of share loss, which is being driven primarily by us, or with our smaller competitor, who have found themselves a short period after aspiring to a significant gain in market structure actually find themselves having to discount heavily in order to try and retain some of the customer base.</p>
          <p>Both of those ingredients create a hyper-competitive market, and there should be no illusion there, no matter how anybody wants to spin it, that we're seeing a dramatic increase in competitive intensity in the marketplace over the last six months. So I might get Mike to talk briefly about what we've seen in the fixed market and then I'll let Murray talk a bit about what we're seeing in the mobile market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Sachin. I mean the fixed business remains similarly competitive. Our focus continues to remain on net and that's yielded improvement in our margin over some time and continuing to strive to a bundled outcome in the market. Now you saw us recently launch 3G Home Zone, which is the femto service.</p>
          <p>That's actually about bringing mobile led bundling into a house, which is important for us going forward, and over the current quarter as well you saw us launch digital services such as Optus Smart Safe, again making sure that we enrich the fixed bar as we move forward with differentiation on our side.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, you know, we've recently re-emerged in the FOXTEL Pay TV business as those margins became more appealing to us off the back of discussions with FOXTEL, and we look forward to the upcoming Fetch IPTV work that we'll do moving forward as well. So a very competitive market, but one where we think we've got the differentiation strategy going forward to make a difference.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, it's Murray. I think also just to Paul's point in respect of facts, if you look at the actual Telstra disclosures with regards to their ARPUs been disclosing for the full year, their postpaid ARPU is around down 2.2%. If we look at that we think that their ARPUs are down around about 3% or just over that for the second half. In their wireless broadband ARPUs, they're down around 24% for the full year and for the second half we think that was close to about 28%.</p>
          <p>So I think that's a reflection, as Paul said, of the market is very competitive with regards to pricing. Postpaid, there's greater inclusion in respect of value within cap plans generally and in respect of wireless broadband it continues to be very competitive with regards to pricing generally in the market place.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to round up, Sachin, I think we would characterize our results today as showing resilience in a market where both of our major competitors are discounting. And where they've been changing their pricing structure and their level of subsidy and sign-on bonuses, we have actually demonstrated that we can grow the revenue line and the EBITDA line. But I wouldn't sugarcoat it. It's a hyper-competitive market place, and clearly our results also show the impact of both competitors discounting aggressively.</p>

          <p>Hi good morning, thanks for the call. I have three questions. First on the priority plans, just wondering when they will be applicable to smartphones and whether you'll change any of the terms and conditions if they are launched on the smartphone? The second question is regarding now that the cross carriage rule is theoretically being implemented, when should we look in the future for when there'll be content that you would desire to compete for in terms of getting exclusive rights? And last question is regarding NetLink. Could you give us the book value of the assets that have been put under NetLink, and in terms of realizing the gain for present book value, the timing of which when will that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me answer the two questions first, and then I'll pass the third question to Jeann. The Priority Pass is &#x2013; basically it's an enhancement we've made to our data service so that our customers that sign up for higher speed plans will get a faster speed and a higher assured speed most of the time compared to people who sign up for lower speed plans. These are available on dongles as well as smartphones.</p>
          <p>So you know if you are a user of a smartphone device and you sign up to one of our high value plans or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:26:35) that have faster speeds, you will get that Priority Pass service. So it's not a question of making it only available to dongles and wireless modems; it is available across the board to all different devices.</p>
          <p>In terms of cross carriage, actually the regime for cross carriage actually started last year. It just happens that most of the content is not affected by cross carriage because they are still under contract on an exclusive basis primarily to my competitor. So as and when this content contract expires, the content providers will be discussing with ourselves and with my competitors to see what sort of value we are willing to pay for this content on a non-exclusive basis.</p>
          <p>I think from SingTel's perspective, we feel that, at least in the short-term with what we have with our sports content we have a significant image and positioning in the market. We will be looking at acquiring content on a very selective basis, even though it's non-exclusive to enhance our existing value proposition.</p>
          <p>We will be acquiring this and making sure that every content that we bring in there is a financial and economic justification for it, and that it incrementally adds value to the customers that we already have. With our sports content, we already have more than 300,000 customers. So you know, for additional content that we get on, we have to make sure that it is bringing incremental revenue and value to our TV business and overall to our consumer business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up on that. In terms of potential content that's under contract, when is the closest time that it will be open for you to compete for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a significant number of them that come up this year. One example that I can give you is the availability of Fox International slew of different channels, which comes up out of contract some time in this current quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the question around NetLink Trust, the asset that's being transferred. The assets, as I said, are the ducts and manholes and the seven exchange buildings. They have been booked in SingTel's historical costs and depreciated over the years, and the net book value is under S$100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of realizing the gain versus the S$1.9 billion, will that only happen after the sell down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because right now the Trust is 100% owned by &#x2013; the assets are 100% owned by SingTel. So from a group perspective, you don't take up the unrealized gain. So only on divestment, then you will take the proportionate gain.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call, several questions for me. Firstly on the domestic front, the labor costs seems to be creeping up with the backup of declining revenue momentum. I was wondering if there is actually any room to temper this in succeeding quarters?</p>
          <p>The second question I had is with Pay TV. If you look at the Pay TV business, I mean, is there really a strong case for further content pushed down the road, looking at the EBITDA margins, it just seems to be pulling it down? I understand that there's difficulty in predicting the timing of the turnaround, but if you could articulate what would actually cause a change in the EBITDA momentum in the succeeding quarters that would be great as well.</p>
          <p>The third question I had is with regard to fiber take up. It seems like it's actually quite slow across the island. I was wondering what management's thoughts are on this, what the bottlenecks are for consumers taking the service. Is it pricing, it is awareness or simply no need for high speed broadband at the moment.</p>
          <p>Lastly on Optus, do you feel that there is room for the competitive environment to actually change for the better or worse in the succeeding quarters? Now Telstra seems to be gaining market share and top line growth. Is there a line in the sand for Optus that it would want to protect going down the road to elicit a more aggressive reaction? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the question on the staff costs, just want to clarify that you know we did have job credits last year, at the tail end of it, so if you exclude that, the increase in staff costs is not really the 9%, but really just about 7%. You know what attributes to that 7% -- you know, we had an increase in head count for NCS, largely in the overseas development centers. So that accounted for some of that 7% increase you saw, plus the typical kind of annual increments that we would have. Actually, there was also an increase in the CPF rate, so that also attributed to that 7% that you saw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the two subsequent questions, one on TV and the other one about the fiber take up. I think the TV content does have a drag on our earnings, especially when you compare it to a previous year when you don't have that TV content. As the TV content cost gets embedded in the base, then when we go into subsequent quarters, it won't be such a drag. I think above and beyond TV content, we expect that certainly our TV revenue to start to kick up further in the subsequent quarters and that would mitigate the impact of these content costs.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, in answering one of the questions, we are also seeing positive signs with regard to our fiber acquisition costs and the trending of that and of course we will continue to optimize our other costs to make sure that we can, at the end of the day, meet the guidance that we've given to the market on EBITDA.</p>
          <p>In terms of the fiber take up, I think whether it's fast or slow is a relative, sort of, perspective. I think at the end of the day, you know, if you look at what has been reported by the IDA the number of fiber customers is still, I think, you know, in the tens of thousands. So it's a new technology. People have to rewire the insides of their homes. I think what's important for us in SingTel here is that our market share is still in excess of 50%.</p>
          <p>So I think we are certainly, even in an open environment, where people get equal access to the network, the marketing skills, the branding, the customer knowledge that SingTel has; the applications that we put out there in addition to broadband Internet access, certainly are gaining traction.</p>
          <p>And despite the fact that our prices are not the lowest in the market and we are able to get 50% certainly validates our thoughts regarding the fact that fiber is not just about faster access to the Internet; it's all about providing entertainment, providing applications that assist our customers improve the quality of their life. It makes it easier for them to do things at home, that as a result is leading to the market-leading position that we are taking in this broadband technology.</p>
          <p>I think for the overall fiber pick up rate to get even higher in Singapore, I think the regulator, I think OpenNet, which is the company that lays the fiber will have to certainly step-up with greater publicity and create an awareness about where fiber is covering.</p>
          <p>I think SingTel can only do its part as a retail service provider to excite people, but before people can take up the fiber they have to be within the coverage. And that is something that certainly is the responsibility of OpenNet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's Paul here. I think it's time to pick up on your other question, Arthur, about Australia. I think if we try to look at the market and what we see happening, the first point I'd like to make and reinforce is, we're about sustainable profitable growth, and what you see in our number this quarter is that despite extreme price aggression and margin compression from our competitors, what we've been able to show is that we can grow both the revenue line and the EBITDA line.</p>
          <p>It's interesting to look at both of our competitors. Certainly if we look at Telstra's guidance what we see is, it would indicate that they're not planning to throw another billion on top of the existing billion into the market. But nonetheless, their guidance does imply they're going to hang out at the same sort of margins that they've closed for the year on. And so therefore in a sense they've rebased their margin. So I would expect that that does mean it's going to be increasing or continue to be competitive in terms of Telstra's pricing and approach.</p>
          <p>In terms of Vodafone, what we've seen is really an infinite plan thrown at the market, which is very hard for me as a business person to understand. I don't think anybody in the industry really wins when they try to win just on discounting or on aggressive pricing without trying to add value to the customer.</p>
          <p>So when I look at us and our strategy, it's all about differentiating and finding ways in which to create value both for the customer and for ourselves. You've seen us in the last quarter launch a market a number of market firsts around Smart Save, around our TV offering, which allows you to record and playback 15 TV channels. You've seen it with femto, which is the unique offering that Mike talked about it. And of course, you've seen it with a lot of work we're putting in on customer experience.</p>
          <p>Moving forward you'll see Optus continue to work in ways in which we can monetize smartphones and data and ways in which we can make more rational the pricing plans that are associated with data and find new business models that make more sense for the industry. That's how we'll aim to differentiate and create value and continue to drive growth.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Foong from BNP. Thanks for the call, I've got three questions. Firstly, for Optus, I notice that the MOU for prepaid and postpaid is actually quite low when compared with the region. Why is this the case? And do you think that there's still quite high price elasticity of demand in the market and whether price cuts can be partially offset by increasing usage? And also for Optus as well, if the current market competition persists at the current levels, do you think there's any downside risk to the revenue and EBITDA guidance for FY '12?</p>
          <p>Number two, for Singapore operations, what did SingTel do during the quarter which led to the significant gains in market share for both pre and postpaid subscribers? And my third question is with regard to the networks both in Singapore and for Optus. Are both networks now fully on a single-RAN architecture and should we be expecting CapEx to trend lower from FY '13 onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Foong, it's Paul here. I think the first question related to the intensity of &#x2013; sorry, the elasticity of pricing in Australia and whether that's an upside. I might get Murray just talk about that but I think you've got to note that one of the big drivers in Australia is the presence of caps and the greater inclusions in caps. And to some extent that's offsetting the attempts to get elasticity to drive revenue. Murray?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think to Paul's point, you've seen us grow by quite a material amount across prepaid and postpaid in recent quarters. So there is definitely fixed to mobile substitution happening in the marketplace. There is definitely increased usage as the cap penetration across the customer base increases. I think if you look at it against fixed, you got to look at it relative to the fact that local calls are untimed in Australia. So, as a consequence, you have very high MOUs around local. But when you start to disaggregate it around fixed and mobile and national calls, you are seeing MOUs increase in mobile relative to fixed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to pick up on your question, Foong, on the market competition, I can't predict the future but if I look at the actual structural issues that are driving the market, what we see is that we have a smaller competitor who has lost a lot of customers and also on revenue. And his response has been to discount very, very aggressively both in plans that are in the market but also in credits that has been given to existing customers.</p>
          <p>We see at a larger competitor, willingness to erode margins and to bring down profitability and to spend that money in the market in terms of greater allowances and plans, in embracing cap, in spending more in handset subsidies and in providing more in sign-on and loyalty bonuses. So it clearly is a very, very competitive environment. I think our results today shows that we are focused in Optus on sustainable growth and on creating value. We are rational and we are therefore in a position to grow both top line and EBITDA. However, we will also have to make sure that we manage our market position and therefore we will have to take account of what happens in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>But in terms of guidance, we're not making any commentary or any statement in terms of our guidance today. And that in itself should speak for itself. So, I'll just pass over to Singapore to answer the second of your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Foong, it's <mark type="ph" /> Yang Fong (0:40:30) here. Just want a point of clarification. On the MOUs, the way that Optus reports its MOUs is just for outgoing whereas for Singapore we actually include both incoming and outgoing in our MOUs, so is that not apple-to-apple comparison?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I can get Allen to answer your question about the market share gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, mobile is our largest source of revenue. So we do forecast a large amount on mobile to make sure that we're continuing not just to gain market share but to track and get positive momentum in terms of ARPU growth as well. And if you look at our results, we're not only gaining share, but if you look at our ARPU &#x2013; less of course the recent effect of the data dongle, data only SIMs, our ARPU overall is growing as well. So, I think the reason why we've been able to achieve some of this you split between postpaid and prepaid.</p>
          <p>Firstly on postpaid, postpaid for us is very much about branding and our value proposition. So the reason why we've been able to achieve the market share that we have with the strong quarter is primarily because we've been in partnership with handset manufacturers with application and development and we've got our channel partners to make sure that we very clearly deliver to the proposition that we've got out there in the market about amazing things happening when you think big.</p>
          <p>So if you just look at what we've disclosed in our MD&amp;A, we went out with two iconic handsets, one for gamers, another one for social network enthusiasts. We enhanced that with our own applications that would make it even easier to connect to social networks. We even make your life, as you're going around Singapore, even easier. And of course, we make sure that at point of presence in our own shops and in our channels, there's a very clear singular focused approach when a customer comes into the shop to identify the type of customer that they are, what are their likely preferences for applications and for content.</p>
          <p>On prepaid, it's a very price sensitive market. Our pricing is a little bit higher than our competitors because we are on per minute whereas the others are per second, but very much the headline rates are the same. But for us in prepaid, our service is primarily through, number one, introducing a very good 3G product which is now starting to get traction with the prepaid market which is mainly foreign workers.</p>
          <p>And the second one is just the hard work that we do with our point of sales and the final presence that we do in hostels where these foreign workers live, in the road shows that we do in all the places that foreign workers congregate on weekends, holidays &#x2013; yeah, weekends and holidays. So I think in short, that's what we've done to achieve the results. There are a few other things that we do behind the scenes which are, at this stage because of the nature of market, I can't share. But obviously the conclusion here is, at the end of the day, mobile is a very important business for not just Singapore but the Group. So, we focus very much on that and focus on execution and on creating innovation and excitement for our customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just wondering whether both the Singapore and also for Optus, whether both mobile networks are now fully on a single-RAN architecture and whether that would lead to CapEx probably trending down onwards from FY '13 onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are looking at...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, go ahead, Yang Fong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Paul, please &#x2013; please go ahead. We are wondering how to answer that question from the Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would &#x2013; I think if I understood the question right, I think first of all in terms of architecture, I mean, we operate on different frequencies but we do work very much to try and get common elements in the network. So although we might be using different frequencies, we typically use the same network controllers, and then we'd also work very hard even to use a single set of antennas for being able to operate the systems.</p>
          <p>But I think there is another separate question which relates to vendors. And certainly in Australia, we've been quite open in following a dual vendor policy over the last few years. So we've introduced some competitive tension as well as some technology tension into who we're using to deploy our radio. And that also allows us to make sure that we're keeping abreast of the latest technology trends and are able to benchmark each operator against one another.</p>
          <p>Actually I'd argue that the dual vendor approach is helpful to us in managing our CapEx and in ensuring that we get the best deals. I think that was the question you were asking about? Maybe you can come back and clarify if I've misunderstood it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm just wondering whether as both the Singapore and Optus networks upgrade to LTE and from there, from LTE to LTE advanced in a few year's time, whether we see any kind of spike in CapEx. Being of course on a single-RAN architecture would help because you would be having exactly the same hardware equipment just doing a software upgrade. So, I was wondering whether the network is already configured in that kind of way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we kind of &#x2013; so obviously we've got quite a large network in deployment, but you're absolutely right. So as we look to upgrade elements, which could be due to age but they're also in several cases where we're swapping out because with the greater functionality. The vendor today will typically allow you to buy equipment that has an upgrade path so that you don't have to replace it as you bring in the new technologies. What you're doing is you might be adding a card, but it's also the case you may just be upgrading the software.</p>
          <p>So absolutely, it is where possible the case that we deploy equipment that has an upgrade path through to, for example, LTE. I'm pretty sure Allen will be in a very similar position. Allen, did you want to comment?</p>

          <p>Okay. Just I wanted to point &#x2013; not just for Singapore and Australia, but also for the emerging markets, for example Globe &#x2013; probably for Globe, they're looking at a network transformation. So for those systems where they upgrading and they all looking to a single-RAN, so the future you can add on the LTE cards. So I think in most of the new networks today offered by the vendors, they're all approaching towards a single RAN architecture.</p>
          <p>Obviously this will happen when you are upgrading your network and this will give you the opportunity that you will stick to upgrading to single RAN.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, thanks for the call. This is Rajesh</p>
          <p>Raman, HSBC. I just have two questions for Singapore. Firstly, for the data-only SIM card holders in Singapore that also have the voice and data plans, I just wanted to understand if these are counted as separate subscriber classes or are they just one? And secondly, are these results reflecting the full impact of the Singapore/Malaysia roaming rate revisions and if not, by when would they be fully reflected? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer the second question first. The Singapore/Malaysia mobile roaming rates took effect towards the end of Q1. So it is already reflected in the Q1 results. The big impact of that is something that we were continuing to evaluate and you will start to see the impact coming in subsequent quarters. I think bearing in mind the size of the Singapore revenue stream, whatever impact this is, I do not expect it to be huge in any case.</p>
          <p>In terms of the first question regarding whether a single customer has a data-only SIM and also has a combined voice and data SIM, whether we count it as two, the numbers that we report are based on SIM card issues. So they have individual SIM cards, one for each, then we will count them as two separate SIM cards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. I have two questions on Singapore. Firstly, can you comment on the outlook for managed services segment? The revenues have been stagnating in the past two quarters here. Secondly on the lease circuit, is an inflection point around the corner for international lease circuit and also can you comment on competitive activities in the domestic lease line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to maintain a positive outlook for our managed services. I think if you look at quarter-on-quarter, you'll always see &#x2013; you won't see the true picture for the service primarily because there are different &#x2013; managed services projects have different pick up rates across the year and it tends to be a little bit lumpy.</p>
          <p>If you look at our MD&amp;A on page 24, our managed services year-on-year has actually been going 13%. It is something that we continue to push very aggressively with our sales force, because our relationship on the network side allows us to speak to the right people within these enterprises and with government. So I think we continue to expect our managed services product to continue on a year-on-year basis to show very strong growth.</p>
          <p>With regard to ILC and international in particular, that's a situation where today you can see from our, again from our MD&amp;A, has been declining north of 20%. And because of the large amount of capacity that's available in our region, we see a lot of competitive activity and because ILC these days is very much a commoditized service and the value added services are more in IVPN et cetera. This is something where, going ahead, we expect to see price declines in the same order of magnitude that you see this year compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of domestic lease circuits, you can see a small decline there. That's an impact not of competitive activity eating into our business, it's more impact of us adjusting our prices and ability was to not just retain our customers but get some expansion circuits from them as well.</p>
          <p>So, I think that is something that, with our local leased circuits, for some of them we have to make some price adjustments because of NBN, but by and large, it's something that we are &#x2013; we would expect to start to commoditize. Not at the same rate of decline that you see with international leased circuits but certainly something that we will be monitoring and we will be continuing to move our customers onto higher value added circuits and also to move our customers onto managed services so that we are not just looking after the commodity part of the network but we're also adding value in terms of some of the other peripheral and server activities that are connected to these circuits.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I can just follow-up on the managed services, are a bulk of the customers Singapore based corporate or do you have users segment driven by customers located outside Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the bulk of customers today are Singapore, but there is still a growing percentage of them who are overseas in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines as well. But you are correct, the bulk of them are still Singapore.</p>

          <p>Sorry, I just have one more question. This is on Singapore regarding the depreciation policy. We have been seeing higher CapEx for the last two or three years in Singapore and we are not seeing a substantial increase in depreciation. Could you just explain the disconnect here? I mean, should we expect depreciation to go, increase creeping forward or are there some items which have depreciated a lot now and that's the reason that depreciation has not been increasing that much?</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, the reason why you don't really see a spike is because there's also assets that will be retired at the end of their useful life. So, you would expect there will be some decline, offset by increase in the CapEx that you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you're saying that despite increase in CapEx, depreciation will not go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean you've got to recognize that there will be assets that will also be retired. So while we're adding on new assets, there will also be the older assets that will be coming off their useful life and therefore that will be fully depreciated. So, on a net-net basis, that's why you see there's not that much of an increase.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Two questions, first one is on mioTV. You've added 300,000 customers one year down from you securing the BPL. Is this within your expectations and what else do you need to do to gain more traction?</p>
          <p>Secondly is that, in some emerging countries, we're seeing some substitution away from voice into data. Could you give us your thoughts on where you're operating for your subsidiaries as well as your associates? What are your thoughts on this and going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the mioTV question and then I'll pass over to Hui, who's our CEO of International to talk about the second question. I think that we've got 300,000 mioTV customers. At the end of the day, TV is a very integral part of our product offerings, especially when you start to move towards higher value fixed and mobile networks. So I think, from our perspective, we see a lot more opportunity to grow that base. It will be &#x2013; at the end of the day, what we are looking at is the revenue that we can get from content.</p>
          <p>This content can be coming from mobile customers, tablet customers or TV customers or even PC customers. So I think, for us, we are always trying to push for greater revenue from the content that we acquire to better justify the cost that we pay for some of this content.</p>
          <p>So I think while we've got a very strong content with sports and we're going to amortize that content across multiple platforms. We will still have a very strong slew of other content which we are starting to build up as well. So, as you can see from our results, we've added a very interesting slew of news and travel content which we believe will also drive, not just take up rate from some people who are interested in those channels but also drive incremental ARPU for us.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to Hui to answer the question of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to voice and data substitution in the emerging markets, we do not see that happening as aggressive as in the developed markets, partially because in the emerging markets there's still a huge market for voice where the penetration is low.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing our associates expanding the overall market, including the voice percentage.</p>
          <p>But having said that, obviously, the high-end data users will also be using some of the data apps to substitute for voice. When you look at, for example, in AIS in this quarter, they have 29% year-on-year growth in data. When we look at the voice itself, this quarter they've also seen about 5% to 6% increase in voice <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:57:21) in both the post paid and prepaid. So, country, in Thailand, although you see both data and voice increase, you do not see a lot of substitution of the voice by data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But over in the developed markets, I suppose for Singapore and for Australia where you are mostly on bucket or commitment plans, how do you see that playing out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of the voice substitution, I think &#x2013; and let me talk about Singapore and then I will hand over to Paul to talk about Australia. In Singapore, there are &#x2013; the number of minutes that we give away as part of your bundle is actually limited in a sense, it's either 100, 200 or 500 minutes. I think at the end of the day, people are buying a package that has voice and now it's got data in it as well.</p>
          <p>So, I think, to that sense, we would ensure that there is reasonable pick up rate of people, and the decline or the cannibalization of voice in that sense is mitigated through the fact that they're taking up a bundled plan and that is something that will hold us in good stead in the short and medium term.</p>
          <p>A bit beyond that, I think we did within the Group, we're looking at some other initiatives which we probably cannot discuss at this time that will help to mitigate the longer term impact that we see for the future of voice and the ability to charge on a per minute basis. That's something that probably we will be sharing at a much later stage once we've finalized what we want to do there. But, I do want to assure all our investors that we are looking at this very carefully across our developed and developing markets as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Allen. It's Paul here; just a couple of points to add to that. First of all, in Australia, most of the plans now include very large SMS allowances, so actually it's difficult to see how some of the new messaging platforms are really going to be hugely cannibalistic for people, because there is already pretty much a giveaway of a lot of SMS. Notwithstanding that, I'm sure the rise of social networks will continue to be a challenge in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The second point I'd make is that we look with great interest at the work going on in North America at the moment with a number of the carriers who are working to bring in some form of greater monetization of data capacity. Things like changing the data allowances that are allocated to plans and pricing separately, things also such as looking to have discussions about applications and content which drive very high consumption of bandwidth needing to create some sort of business model in which the carrier can participate. We think those are very positive trends and we think it makes sense for the industry to try and pursue those.</p>
          <p>So, overall, I think that the greater use of smartphones, the greater use of social networking and the different forms of communication and messaging do present a mixture of trends for us. On the one hand, it will help us in getting greater utility devices into customers' hands and in finding other ways that we can monetize those with our own content and apps. But on the other hand, there is a risk you raise of substitution taking place, but it's up to us to find new pricing and new business models to try and cater for that.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question each for Allen and Paul. Allen, what I've heard from multiple people is even in cases where the cable has been laid to the house, and I'm talking about the NGNBN, none of the RSPs have actually gone in to provide any services at all, perhaps you could just speak to that in terms of what's actually happening there.</p>
          <p>The question for Paul is, from a competitive perspective, what we're seeing is from a pricing perspective, Telstra is still well above both Optus as well as Vodafone Hutch. And while Vodafone Hutch has been aggressive on pricing, competition is unlikely to really bite into your market share until Telstra drops pricing to your level, would that be the right way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the NBN question. I think you need to realize that in NBN, the Government has structured NBN into three tiers. So, sometimes when the fiber is laid into the house, it has been done by OpenNet, but these households are not released to the RSPs until a period of time when they have to incorporate the lists of the households, they have to certify that the fiber has been properly laid and then it becomes available to us in the RSPs.</p>
          <p>I think, for us in SingTel, once these addresses and homes become available to us, we do direct market, we do door-knock and we do drop leaflets to them. For SingTel, we do this very aggressively, because for every customer even if they're an existing DSL customer and migrate to fiber, I get an uplift in my ARPU.</p>
          <p>So I can assure all of you that we are very aggressively doing it. But there are limitations in which I'm not allowed to go into the house until the house is released to all the RSPs and that's probably why your friends are saying that the fiber is in the house, but nobody is marketing to them. Right now, the time it takes once the fiber gets into the house versus when it releases to us could be typically between about one to two months depending on which stage of the cycle OpenNet is in terms of getting the network certified by the IDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Ashwin, just picking up on your question. Actually, no, I would characterize Australia quite differently. Traditionally, Telstra had created a premium, a significant premium, between themselves and the other carriers. But this A$1 billion profit downgrade that Telstra has done has largely been used to allow them to remove most of that premium and to sit with pricing that is broadly comparable to Optus in most of the key volume categories. And so that's created a lot of price pressure. At the same time, Vodafone has further discounted below us. So, for example, today Vodafone has a A$45 all-you-can-eat plan, known as an infinity plan, which effectively caps ARPUs.</p>
          <p>And associated, of course, with that is a reduction in margin by Telstra who are reporting much higher margins previously and who've now rebased their margins to a lower level. So that I think indicates that there has been an increase in the level of competitive intensity. I think you're correct to say that we feel &#x2013; the fact that we've been able to generate strong postpaid net adds, 113,000 in the quarter, the fact that we've been able to hold our market position through the quarter indeed, I think, technically on revenue share we've slightly gained.</p>
          <p>Those are all examples of, we believe, the resilience of what we do, but I wouldn't want to sugarcoat it. It is a very competitive market today, but I would stress that we are very much about value creation through our marketing. We're not about price discounting as our first lever to pull. Clearly we need to remain competitive and we always will focus on that, but we have, through the quarter, launched a lot of products which are all about adding innovation and differentiation through content on smartphones, through clever devices such as femto which provide service in the home at a reasonably cannibalized fix. That will be continuing to be the Optus approach to marketing, but we've recognized we're going to also have to be competitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just if I may have a quick follow-up on that. Would it be fair to say that given the penetration of cap plans in the market, essentially one should look over the medium-term for any uplift in ARPU purely to come from selling in the value added services rather than from actually massive uplift in MOU or any such normal metric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll let Murray talk a little bit to that and give you a bit of a sense as to how the market is, but certainly caps are well penetrated in the market with Vodafone and Optus, but the third player Telstra has only recently brought caps into the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and to your point in relation to value added services, we look at it as the included value, so what you're seeing for higher access or monthly access plan, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:49) included value. So it's not just around the value added services sold in their own right, it's about how you bundle them and how you position them with the customer to drive a greater mix of higher access plans and therefore rate plan mix play into the discussion around ARPU management or yield management generally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again that's why we're adding value added features like Smart Safe, Digital TV are all about us giving people reasons to buy the higher value plans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a question for Paul. Paul, when I look back at your data for mobiles in Australia, obviously it looks like the voice component of the business has started to weaken. So, this appears to be the first quarter where voice revenue has declined almost 5%, it's down 4%, and I've not seen this before. So I wanted to hear from you what's going on here?</p>
          <p>And the second is on the flipside looking at data from mobiles. Again, this is the first time we've seen the business growing and into low teens; in the past it's always been either high teens or in the 20s. So again, I wanted to better understand the dynamic there?</p>
          <p>And on the counter to this is to look at the margins for this &#x2013; for the mobiles business in Australia. If you've got realization coming down, ARPUs coming down because of the competitive intensities you talked of, how do you propose to deal with the cost and when we look forward on a sequential basis, should we also expect the same seasonality we've seen in margins to continue through FY '12, i.e., second quarter being weaker than first quarter, third quarter broadly in line with the second quarter, and both of them below the first quarter and then the fourth quarter being stronger? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Piyush. I think what you're referring to there is, first of all, at the ARPU line where you can see we got minus 4.1% in terms of the ARPU performance year-on-year, you're absolutely correct. That's a great example of what I was describing to Ashwin, because we now have our major competitor putting greater allowances in terms of minutes and SMS and other elements into their plans, <mark type="ph" /> but maybe (1:08:11) that the market has moved and we've had to stay competitive and in that process it means that you've got fewer customers breaking through their caps and you're monetizing a lot less of the value. So that's the price pressure that's been put into the marketplace. It's inevitable that someone chooses to rebase their margins. If one of our competitors rebases their margins, it's inevitable that that feeds into pricing in the market and has that effect.</p>
          <p>I think on the data side, we would see that there is an opportunity for us to actually use data to create more value. So whilst you're correct that we need to manage very carefully around the capital that's associated with data, having said that, we have already deployed data infrastructure and we want to make sure we can monetize it. And o the company is moving not only to provide basic carriage capacity, but here in Australia, we've launched, first of all, a vault which will work across both your mobile but also your fixed broadband, which allows you to store and access and share content easily. That's been quite a public campaign. We've launched a TV product this quarter, which allows you to record and playback free-to-air television on your mobile phone.</p>
          <p>Those are examples of us working to monetize and there's a further suite of products which are coming down the pipeline.</p>
          <p>So we'll continue to work on both fronts, but a big element of our work will be to leverage the functionality that comes out of data and to try and monetize some of the offerings we have in terms of content and apps as well as just in terms of pure carriage.</p>
          <p>I'll pass over to Murray to talk a little bit about the seasonality and some of the questions you raised on that.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we don't provide any guidance with regards to the seasonality of our margins and/or quarterly profile of our margin. We are reaffirming guidance today with regards to have full year results where we have indicated to the marketplace in relation to both revenue and EBITDA. We would look to grow at low single-digit levels. So that's our position as of today.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I'm hearing you Paul, at least this time around, it sounds like you are a little more cautious about how competitive the market has become. And that's begun to show through in at least the ARPUs for the business.</p>
          <p>Now I want to be clear that, is that as all going to impact &#x2013; sorry, you're maintaining your revenue guidance obviously, but is that at all going to impact the way you're going to subsidize or offer a discount i.e., with price discounting, would it mean that the subscriber acquisition cost could come-off in the business to allow you to maintain a level of profitability?</p>

          <p>It's very hard to predict, Piyush. I mean, there's a number of dynamics around in Australia at the moment. We have obviously greater consumer uncertainty in the marketplace. We have competitors who're both discounting fairly heavily and prepared to reduce their margin from where it's been historically and to rebase their prices.</p>
          <p>But on the flipside, there are also some positives, smartphone adoption is up, close to 90% of our postpaid shipments at the moment of device are smartphones. We're seeing growing take up of applications and content on that. And it's a clear push by the company to try and find ways in which to create value through data.</p>
          <p>So, I think you've got to balance the two. And I can't predict what our competitors will do. It really depends on their appetites as well for yield and for profitability. And all I can really say is, our first position is never being to be an aggressive price discounter. We've always looked to create value to our offerings and to encourage people to use device as more and to make ARPU commitments in order to get that flexibility and freedom.</p>
          <p>So we've always tried to encourage people if anything to trade up in terms of what they buy and purchase. That will continue to be our approach, but you are quite correct to say that we will always have to competitive and so we will have to react to whatever our competitors' strategies are. I don't think it's beyond that I can really say too much more without starting to qualify or potentially qualify guidance.</p>
