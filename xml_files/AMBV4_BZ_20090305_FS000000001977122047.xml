          <p>Good morning and thank you for waiting. We'd like to welcome everyone to the AmBev Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Today with us we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for AmBev, and Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer.</p>
          <p>We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After AmBev's remarks are completed there will be a question-and-answer session. At that time further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of the AmBev's management and information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of AmBev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Jamel, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheridan , and good morning, everyone. I am Nelson Jamel, CFO of AmBev. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2008 fourth quarter result. Here with me today is Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, our CEO for AmBev. And as usual, Jo&#xE3;o and I are replacing Luiz Fernando and Graham, who have accepted new challenge in their career.  I'd like to take the opportunity to thank both Luiz and Graham for their contributions to AmBev.</p>
          <p>Beginning this quarter we have decided to simplify the format of our conference call. Bernardo Paiva and M&#xE1;rcio Froes have already started in their new roles as Head of Quinsa and Labatt, respectively. But we believe having the two of us conducting the call will simplify the process.  I'll start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with an overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-ex, Quinsa and North America.  I'll close by providing more specifics regarding the fourth quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I'd just like to remind that all numbers are in Brazilian GAAP and that the percentage changes used in the call are on an organic basis unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results, during the fourth quarter our consolidated EBITDA reached more than R$2.9 billion, which represents a 0.8% decline when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, and was driven by strong results in the Brazilian soft drink and Quinsa business, which were offset by weaker performance in Brazil Beer and HILA-ex.</p>
          <p>Our EBIDTA for the full year was R$9 billion, which represents a 4.6% organic increase.</p>
          <p>Brazil EBITDA declined by 4.6 despite a strong quarter for our soft drink operation. Beer volume during the quarter are down 1.4%, while CSD and NANC declined by 2.2%.  Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with more details of the key drivers in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA margin in Brazil was once again pressured by lower volumes and higher cost of goods sold and SG&amp;A in our Beer business and declined 340 basis points.  Our Quinsa operation continues to deliver very strong results with EBITDA growing 30.8% from Beer volume growth of 8.8% and CSD &amp; NANC volume growth of 5.3%.</p>
          <p>In North America, fourth quarter volume grew by 0.5% driven by market share growth, although EBITDA declined by 4.5% as a result of anticipated commodity cost pressure.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to net income, I would like to highlight that we have adopted certain accounting adjustments as required by changes to applicable Brazilian law.  These adjustments totaled R$348.4 million in expense and were recorded in the fourth quarter to give retroactive effect to January 1, 2008.  A detailed breakdown of these new accounting rules is described on page 21 of our press release and Note 2.1 in our financial statements filed with the Brazilian CVM.</p>
          <p>Net income totaled R$965 million in the quarter and R$3.1 billion for the full year, which was 8.6% higher than last year.  Earnings per share, excluding goodwill, amortization and change in accounting practice, as mentioned above, increased by 10.4% and 18.8% in the quarter and in the full year respect.</p>
          <p>I will comment further on net income at the end of this call.  I will now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o as he starts to look a little bit deeper into the results of each of our operation.  Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good morning, everyone.  Let me start by discussing our performance in Beer Brazil.  Our fourth quarter volumes were impacted by flat industry volume growth as continued pressure on consumer spend and food inflation, and more importantly cold and wet weather in the main region in Brazil continue to negatively impact things.  Market share loss in the fourth quarter explained most of our beer volume decline of 1.4% in the period.</p>
          <p>After maintaining our year-to-date market share flat through the end of September, we started to implement our price increase for summer during the fourth quarter.  As a result, we have lost 40 basis point and 20 basis points of share in November and December, respectively, resulting in our market share for the fourth quarter of 2008 at 67.5%, which is 100 basis points lower than last year.  Our market share for the full year 2008 was also at 67.5%, which 30 basis points lower than our average market share for 2007.</p>
          <p>In January we lost an additional 20 basis points of share, which is explained primarily due to channel and package mix.  January's a month during which we normally lose market share because of single volume shift from returnable glass bottles to cans.  Given the holiday season in December and early January, we do not believe Nielsen has fully captured impact from our price increase to date and we could still lose some share in February.</p>
          <p>Although it's early to determine how competitors will react to our price increases, particularly after their strategy in 2008 to not increase prices again, we believe with the challenging economic scenario for 2009, their lack of price increases in 2008, the negative net impact from currency and commodity prices and more scrutiny from the tax authorities towards some of our competitors, could lead to a more rational pricing power in Brazil.  Needless to say, we remain committed to try to optimize profitability while improving our market share.</p>
          <p>2008 was a year during which we showed our commitment to innovation and continued to find ways to connect to our consumers and enhance our brand presence.  Our innovation in the Skol portfolio, mainly the 630ml water and the one liter proprietary  bottle and now our new 269ml the slim can are performing well and we expect them to be important in improving consumer bonds and maintaining our profitability in the future.  Initiatives such as the launch of Brahma Fresh have shown that there are still opportunities to grow share organically, both regionally and nationally in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Our Beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil grew 3.5% when compared to last year.  This increase partially reflects our price increase, as well as an increase in the scope of our direct distribution network.  Unfortunately, our net revenues per hectoliter were negatively impacted by our mix in the fourth quarter for cans and our price in this package was under pressure for most of the year.</p>
          <p>A growth in our Beer cost of goods sold per hectoliter was 6.7% in the fourth quarter when compared to last year, as continues to benefit from our currency hedges and efficiency projects partly offset higher commodity price and lower fixed cost absorption.  Beer SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization, grew by 24.5% in the period.  This increase is a result of general inflation, increase in direct distribution, investment to support our innovation and lower efficiency of our fixed cost structure.</p>
          <p>Lower comparison from Q4 2007 also reflects our growth in fourth quarter, as evidenced by our full year SG&amp;A growth of 14.9.  Beer EBITDA finished the quarter 7.6 below fourth quarter 2007, with EBITDA margin declining 470 basis points when compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Brazil soft drinks and NANC, we had a strong fourth quarter despite volumes declining 2.2% in this period due to industry softness.  Our market share reached 17.8% for the quarter, 60 basis points higher than last year.  We are pleased with our market share performance throughout the year as we were able to grow market share ahead of our main competitor.  Our successful innovations continue to be the main reason behind this improvement and we continue to see plenty of opportunity in the CSD business, both for our market share and also profitability perspectives.</p>
          <p>CSD and NANC net revenues per hectoliter grew 8.4% in this period as a result of pricing in selected markets.  We'll continue to track and monitor price opportunities very closely.  Soft drinks cost of goods sold per hectoliter fell by 4.2% in this quarter, despite lower fixed cost absorption and our hedge gains in sugar and currency continued to benefit us.  SG&amp;A expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by 2% in the quarter despite easier comparisons from fourth quarter 2007 as we continue to invest behind our brands, innovation, while still finding cost saving opportunities.</p>
          <p>CSD delivered solid EBITDA results, 22.1% higher than last year, with EBITDA margin improving by 630 basis points to 47%.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to HILA-ex.  We continue to face challenges in the region with EBITDA loss of R$47.7 million for the quarter.  Beer volumes declined 20.2% in this period as a result of market chain losses and industry decline, mainly Venezuela during the quarter, while soft drinks and NANC volumes were up 22.9% due to strong performance in Peru and Dominican Republic.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Quinsa and our operations in the south of Latin America, we're very pleased with the outstanding year the region delivered, with solid growth rates in terms of volumes, revenues and EBITDA.   The fourth quarter was not an exception, as Quinsa delivered EBITDA growth of 30.8% and margin expansion of 90 basis points, reaching 48.4% in the period, behind consolidated volume growth of 7.4 in the quarter. Beer volumes grew 8.8% while soft drinks grew 5.3%.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew organically both in beer and soft drinks as a result of prices in line with the inflation throughout the region during the year, focused revenue management and strong performance in our premium brands. We're pleased with the performance of our premium portfolio and our innovations across the region.  Our recently launched Quilmes White malt , Quilmes Chill and <mark type="inaudible" /> in Argentina <mark type="inaudible" /> line extensions in Bolivia, just to name a few of our launches are important examples of our innovation across the region.</p>
          <p>Our soft drinks business has also completed a great year with strong results in the last quarter.  We benefited from higher market shares in growing markets, both in Argentina and Uruguay.  In Argentina, the Pepsi brand grew within the A segment, while the A segment as a whole gained share versus the B segment.</p>
          <p>Our cost in SG&amp;A expenses were negatively affected in 2008 by increases in labor costs, transportation and some raw materials during the year.  Nevertheless, we have been affected at introducing the ZBB process in culture within organization, and we also benefited from currency hedging, which worked as an important shield against devaluation in the last quarter.  I'd like to use this opportunity to congratulate the team in Quinsa for the great results delivered in '08.</p>
          <p>Turning to Labatt, the fourth quarter delivered similar results to what we saw in the third quarter, with great top line performance and market share gains being offset by significant commodity inflation.  EBITDA declined 4.5% in the quarter and was flat for the year.  Top line continues to be a bright spot from the organic net revenue per hectoliter growth of 4.1%, and domestic shipment increased versus last year of 1.6%, well above industry <mark type="inaudible" /> growth of 0.5.  We gained 15 basis points of market share throwing the focus on a few big things combined with discipline in execution to reach improved net revenue per hectoliter and market share gains; the key formula for the long term sustainability of our business.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to say that our brands, Budweiser, Bud Light, Keith, Stella and Lakeport grew market share in the quarter and showed a business growth 7.5% versus last year.  Specifically we are able to increase the market share in critical brewing segments of import and import light by 2.2 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively.  We are also pleased with the performance of our innovation, namely Stella Artois Legere, which has benefited from our world class commercial programs.</p>
          <p>In closing, 2008 was a year in which we were able to maintain our EBITDA while gaining market share for the first time in 11 years despite industry and commodity pressures.  I want to recognize the Labatt team for such an achievement.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the impact of commodity inflation on our cost structure offset the growth in the top line, despite our continued effort in ZBB and production efficiencies.  Cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada increased by 16.3% year-over-year, driven by higher cost of brewing and packaging materials.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation, increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter driven by higher distribution costs.  As a result, we delivered in Canada an organic EBITDA a decline of 4.5% as already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now going back to the overall AmBev business.  2008 was a challenging year in which we grew EBITDA only 4.6%, which is far from the sort of results our management team is used to deliver to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to 2009, the current global financial crisis and economic slowdown effect imposes a challenge for everyone, although I am more optimistic about the resilience of the beverage industry than I am about other industries.  Despite all of the uncertainties for 2009, I have confidence in our management team and our ability to improve performance in 2009.  I believe uncertain times like this will put our brands, our people and our management systems to the test, and I am confident they are well prepared to meet this challenge.  I also have confidence we have the right plans and resources in place to improve the profitability of our business in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to go back to Nelson Jamel.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o.  In this final section I'd like to guide you through the mainline between the reported EBIT of R$816.8 million and the net income of R$964.5 million, as disclosed on page 15 of our release.</p>
          <p>Other operational income and expense was a net income of 961.2 million in the quarter, significantly better than the expense of R$325 million in the same period of last year.  The main reasons for this improvement are the reclassification of goodwill amortization to SG&amp;A totaling R$1.2 billion, and the reverse of our translation gains from foreign investment totaling R$266.2 million, which is now recorded directly as shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Our net financial expense was R$200 million, an improvement of 35% when compared to R$307 million in Q4 last year.  Such gain was mainly related to new accounting rules enacted in Brazil, which resulted in gain of R$434 million.  Without this adjustment, we would have a 9% higher net financial expense mostly driven by higher interest rates in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in the period was 31.9% compared to 30% last year, this decreased our result of non-deductible losses from subsidiaries not subject to tax in Q4 2008 compared to non-taxable gains recorded last year.  Our net debt decreased to R$7.7 billion at the end of December compared to R$8.6 billion at the end of September due to an increase in our cash position by about R$1.3 billion in the period.</p>
          <p>During 2008 we distributed to shareholders R$610 million by way of share buyback and R$2.9 billion in dividend and interest on capital.  We also paid an additional R$250 million of interest on capital beginning January 30, 2009.  We believe at times like this cash is king and our strong cash flow generation, cost and working capital discipline and by vast geographical footprint will prove to be valuable asset in 2009.  The use of cash in 2009 will depend on the changing commodity and financial environment.  We prioritize paying the maximum amount of interest on capital possible and at current interest rates I'll act to retire the debt in 2009. We continue to focus on finding the optimal rate of return to remain at expected level to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand back to Sheridan and open up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  I had a question with respect to the ongoing operations in Brazil and I was hoping perhaps, Jo&#xE3;o, you could comment a little bit more extensively, particularly with respect to your hedges versus the rising input costs and whether or not you'll be able to fully offset those.  And not just in the first quarter, because I think there was an extraordinary malt expense in the first quarter last year, but over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>And then perhaps if you could talk a little more specifically about competitive dynamics.  You said so far I think the suggestion was that it's going fairly well.  I know in the fourth quarter there was an issue with wage inflation you mentioned that in the press release. And I was curious as to whether or not your productivity initiatives this year and perhaps the way you are sizing the business for the outlook will more than offset that. And I know there were some issues with the marketing spent in the fourth quarter. But if you could talk a little bit more about as you will have more of a normalized comparison with the balance of the year, what you expect those investments to be like? And there must be some read with respect to the impact of the flow meters on perhaps some of the smaller brewers that were suspected of evasion, and how that might be playing out with price dynamics.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bob, let me try to address this.  I think I've got like six different points here.  If we start from your first point which is the cost, I think what we've said sometime during the last year, we discussed through the market our hedging level for the U.S. dollar, right. So at a point in time we said that our average for 2009 was something about1.883 compared to something like 1.99 for '08, so there's definitely a gain in terms of hedging the dollar for 2009.  You know that our policy is to do that and at the same time also hedge for the commodities and in the commodity part really the margins and prices were coming down in the later part of the year and we're hedging 12 months rolling.  But the net effect of both is a positive one. So given that we have a net positive on the dollar and on the commodity, then there are the other commodities that are non-hedgeable, such as, for example, PET. In commodities like PET we would have a double gain, because we have the dollar component of PET hedged on a better level.  But PET is down like 20, 25% on the current levels against the average level of 2008.  We will probably have benefits in most of the commodities assuming that the level that is today will continue and as this crisis around the world continues.  So that covers let's say the portion of the dollar hedge and the commodities hedge, and the unhedgeable commodities will probably have a benefit there.</p>
          <p>The next portion is really the inflation piece. You know the inflation has been coming down also in most countries where we operate.  That's also true for Brazil. Although what I've seen so far is Brazil slowing down inflation maybe on a faster pace than in other countries. But still some of the projections we are looking at is inflation of the level of 5.5 in '08 and something like 4.5 in '09.  So again, I think in the case of cost of goods sold per hectoliter, for the most part we should have good news when we look across the macroeconomic plus the hedging policy that we planned.  And then, as always we always have the efficiency projects to continue to have our plants more productive than the year before.</p>
          <p>I think you mentioned something about wage inflation also. So I think wage inflation does affect our cost of goods sold, has also impacted the competitive dynamics.  I will &#x2013; just to finish on the cost piece instead of talking specifically about the wage inflation.  What we've been trying to do is I think during 2008 for the most part of the year, we were always believing that the market will get better, that the weather was going to get better. And maybe we didn't to take maybe a harder approach to some situations in terms of the direct labor.  So this year we've decided to take a tougher approach, because we want to be really strict on the spending. And we already announced last week the closure of one of our plant, and we will take the benefit of the seasonality that is embedded in our business, given that in winter time much less volume than in the summertime.  And you will probably see some productivity gains also in the part of the year where the seasonality part won't help us.</p>
          <p>So we'll take every opportunity we have to become more productive.  So I think this in a way covers three of the points you mentioned.  When I talk about the competitive dynamics, I think Luiz and the team mentioned a lot during 2008 how competitors were not following our price increase, especially in cans, so some of that was pulled back.  We are seeing, so far, a different scenario.  We are seeing the pricing is sticking.  It's early in the year, only two months and Carnaval was just last week.  So it's too early to tell whether this will continue or not.  It's true that we have a couple of things going on for us, such as the different dollar level.  So we know just by reading any other public company here in Brazil that progress in our business how the unhedged portion of dollar does impact our competitors, and by not being hedged, plus the price, plus a more strict government. We believe those three things can work in our favor. Again, too early to tell but the early signs are very positive.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing spending, we took the decision, the right one, last year to build innovation, to fight more in the marketplace.  We always said that we always work for share and profitability.  We have our levels of share that we accept to work with, and for that reason we did have our market share spending especially in the fourth quarter.  But I think &#x2013; and as I said, I'm sure that was the right thing to do and we're seeing some of the benefits now early in '09, given that the innovations that we put out at the end of last year, and some of them now in the beginning of this year are definitely helping the industry, our volumes and et cetera. So that's I think the explanation for '08.</p>
          <p>When I look ahead for marketing spend in '09, again, too early to talk about it.  I already gave you my impression in terms of price.  I think spending will also depend a lot on the competitive behavior.  What I can say is that I will take every opportunity and every cost saving that we have to fund NPV plastic products in the sales and marketing side, right?</p>
          <p>And your last point regarding the flow meters; in '08 the flow meters already mentioned a little bit when I talked about the pricing environment, but definitely the government is much more &#x2013; every year more serious. It's been serious for a long time, but we knew the efforts from the government &#x2013; and I think again these renewed efforts on flow meters will again help to have a more rational competitive environment in Brazil for '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually have two questions.  Could you give us a sense for how much pricing you think you're stuck right now net of the excise taxes in terms of the Beer pricing?  I understand your point that it may or may not be recurring.  And then secondly on the balance sheet, you had a large increase in your payables last year, and I think its equivalent of assuming that you're paying your suppliers over about five months.  And I'm wondering if you could comment on why you've been able to stretch your payables so much, particularly in the kind of environment we're in.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lore.  I'll take the first part and I'll let Nelson take the second part.  In terms of pricing, I think what I can tell you is that we've been able to put on our policy, which is basically to pass on inflation to the consumers, and that's the sort of price increase that is sticking in the marketplace right now for both the beer returnables as well as for the beer cans. Okay. Now, Nelson, if you can take on the second part.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask though, you also have the excise tax increase.  So are you able to put enough through to get inflation on your pricing or just inflation at the consumer level?</p>

          <p>Yes.  We are putting inflation to the consumer level as well.  And I think a good portion, a good portion of the excise tax will also be covered with the product price increase that we have in the marketplace right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lore.  Just regarding the second part of the question about the payables, as I said, cash for us more than ever is king. And we've been committed to continue improving our working capital and our CapEx management in order to get to strong EBITDA and enrich the cash we want to have.  So to put it in perspective, in the last two years in overall working capital and payables was the key driver behind it, we had to adjust more than R$800 million, and we still believe that opportunity should be proven to be captured.  And examples of these are not only to extend payment terms, which would be at five months, like you said, but we are working on extension of payment terms.  But we are also improving inventory levels and stricter control of our account receivables, so that's the focus that we have. It started already two years ago and more than ever we continue to put efforts behind that.</p>
          <p>And the same on CapEx, we had in 2008 an increase in our CapEx and we had as a whole R$2 billion of CapEx in 2008.  But by putting even stricter controls in place and really taking into account NPV of the project, of course we are going to make the investments that are going to help us to go through the future with a profitable growth.  But we see for 2009 our investments probably returning back to the levels of 2007. So in 2008 we had R$2 billion of CapEx, while in 2007 we had R$1.6 billion of CapEx affecting our cash flow.  So we expect for 2007 &#x2013; for 2009, sorry to go back to what it was in 2007 level, pretty much around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But just to go back to the payable point.  Given higher financing costs in the market, you think five months to pay your suppliers without having to incur any financing cost is sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been working, as I said, with our suppliers in extended payment terms without incremental cost.  So the approach we take here is not about to have term or price, we are going for both.  And, of course, the market dynamic is different by &#x2013; particularly different by supplier.  But as I said, this has been already for a while a strong effort and focus of the company.  So we have been succeeding on that.  And I don't know maybe, Jo&#xE3;o, if you want to add something -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as Lore does the math, and the math was not exactly &#x2013; the math from the balance sheet given there are other things there.  It's not that we have exactly this sort of term in terms of five months. I think just to stress one more point some of the things that I saw the team here doing which I think is very good is, we're able to use the same Six Sigma methodology that all that's left data analysis to really look at our suppliers in different ways, of we can say which are the ones that we can go and ask for <mark type="inaudible" /> six months.  Other times we can go for five months.  Other time can go for four months.  So I think we put all that analysis that I think the marketplace has seen us doing for the top line for the theoretical price. I think we're using the same methodology and working with suppliers to advance on this.  I think we did advance a lot. We don't see ourselves at the five month sort of payment terms and that's why we think we can continue to do it even in an environment with the rising interest rate.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, I have a couple of questions; one about the cash back to shareholders and the other one about Canada.  The first one is, I understand you're holding cash because you have a maturity I believe in April of close to R$4 billion.  But once we get through that, I mean, what's the trigger for beginning the share buyback program again? I mean, will we get priority on what the refinancing terms are going to be there for that particular maturity soon or whether it's going to pay it off in cash?  And will that event be the trigger for them beginning the share buyback?</p>
          <p>And then the second question about Canada, your competitor was talking recently about competing in heavy discounting in Quebec, mostly started by the retailers and all that. But you showed some pretty good revenue per hectoliter expansion in Canada anyway.  So if you could talk &#x2013; give us a little more clarity about what's happening there regionally and whether you think this discounting has reached its end or whether it's likely to continue in Quebec.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Nelson here.  Let me start talking about the first point you made.  Again, as I said, use of cash is important, but that will depend on the changing commodity and financial environment. And given the uncertainties, we want to retain some flexibility and therefore are likely to hold more cash than normal going forward.  But I mean we remain committed to continue managing our capital structure in a way to maximize returns to shareholders.  So consistently what we have been doing so far, we have to maintain a little leverage which maximize the benefit of our interest on capital. That's the first thing we always do.  But as I said, it's also important to have <mark type="inaudible" /> debt maturity in '09, especially in the first semester. And assuming the current financing rate that we see in the market, we are likely to retire debt.</p>
          <p>Now the allocation of the remaining excess cash, of course, will be decided by our Board as the year progresses and they have a better view of this amount.  And of course we take into account interest of all shareholders, and it is likely to happen as the year progresses as I said, and have a better view on our real excess cash, given the debt maturity.  And of course then they're going to decide either by resuming the share buyback or paying actual dividends, or a combination of both, like we have been doing so far.  Maybe Jo&#xE3;o could pick up the question of Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well regarding Canada, I think we read some of the same things you read, Jose. But as we look in the marketplace, we're actually feeling good about what we saw in Canada.  We saw some of the new prices put in place also in the last few months in Canada finally sticking.  You know that like in Brazil or like in Argentina, in Canada also they have arrived with a model of gaining share and maintaining or improving profitability.  I think that's a great job they did together with Marcio last year.  And Marcio is fully committed to continue that.  I think they were able to do that in '08, and the first couple months of '09 are really not showing this heavy discounting necessarily that we just talked about.  So it's true that has been back and forth, but our latest view on this is that the pricing is sticking, maybe for different reasons.  Maybe it's that everybody sees pressure from the crisis, pressure from cash. But we're actually seeing a little bit less level of discounting than we're seeing before.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Just first, a quick follow-up on the pricing for this year in Brazil.  It seems like you are pretty confident with respect to putting through pricing.  I was just curious if you feel that there is &#x2013; or there will be further opportunity to take additional pricing as we course through the year.  And also if you could talk a little bit more, I think in your prepared comments you seem a bit more optimistic about consumer trends and the general environment in Brazil for this year.  So I was just curious to get your thoughts about where that optimism is coming from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I didn't know I sounded so optimistic, but &#x2013; no, but seriously.  I think there are a couple of things going on for us and a couple of things not necessarily going on for us.  I think going on for us, we just had &#x2013; I'm talking macro first. But when we look at the minimum wage that was actually anticipated from May to February with a real wage increase of 6%, so the wage increase that just happened here in Brazil about a month ago, it was 12%, so six inflation plus 6%.  This is really good news.  Okay?  This is even more good news when combined with the lower food inflation than from what I saw in 2008. That really didn't help us because the wage growth was smaller and food inflation was higher. So we're actually going to the opposite direction; 12% nominal growth in minimum wage, and a food inflation that most banks are forecasting around five, 6% for 2009.  So I think those two things are going as a positive for us.</p>
          <p>I think as a second point for our main industry so far &#x2013; but this is a big unknown &#x2013; December weather this year started better than last year and also that the Carnaval was at the end of February instead of the end of January that also helped.  I think this kind of creates a good momentum for the beginning of the year. But we're not saying that we think this will continue to go on.  It's very, very hard to predict '09.  I think no one is out there trying to predict that. But again, there are some good signs in terms of minimum wage and for the past couple of months, weather. But in the negative side, we think some sort of deceleration will happen that could be somewhat combined with unemployment which should offset or partially offset the positive aspects that we have.  So that's the macro piece.</p>
          <p>When you look internally, one of the things we want to do is try, of course, to make out of this crisis an opportunity.  I think we have always excelled during crisis.  I think we have a good plan.  I think we've been working in the past few months on innovating, both here and both in some of the other zones like Latin American south and also North America.  We're seeing some innovations in packaging.  They're already out there.  We saw some innovations in liquid, for example, in Latin American south. So I think we will continue to use that effort to also bring new news to our consumers.  So I hope that that combination will try to help offset the sharp decline that may get into Brazil. We're not seeing it as hard as we saw in other markets. But again, it's very hard and I don't want to press on an impression that we think that consumer trends are not changing.  They are changing, but so far they have been compensating for these other things that I just mentioned to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you feel that there's other opportunities for pricing this year or you're pretty well set from your action -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we're pretty well set, given that our policy is to pass on inflation and we don't see any upward pressure from inflation.  If inflation is going anywhere, it's probably going south.  And given that we have pass on inflation in a good portion, like I said, from taxes, I don't see pressure internally, given that we also know the reason for having such a policy like that is that we know that price increase above inflation.  They also hurt our industry and it's not something that we want to work towards.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. That's not what I said.  What I said is that in January and February, we had some good things going for us, such as the minimum wage growth that actually helped everybody.  The Carnaval was at the end of month, which helps everybody.  The weather is a little bit better, which helps everybody.  And we mentioned early in the call that we lost share in December and in January, and we could expect potentially that in February we could lose a little bit more because that is the trend when we increase prices.  We are seeing pricing sticking.  We're seeing our competitors following us. Usually they take some time, which means they take a couple of months to fully adhere to our price.  They are adhering.  If they continue to adhere, we may lose a little bit more in February and then work towards recovering after that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning.  Just a first question about the Brazilian beer market. You have recently launched the new campaign for the Skol brand.  I would like just to have more color about its performance and how did it affect marketing expenses in Brazil because we've seen them going up in the fourth quarter very strongly.  So just to understand what is the dynamics of bringing this new product and how does the marketing expenses behave going forward in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay, Marcel, thank you for the question.  It's really too early to tell. We have just launched this in the beginning of January, so we're talking about six to eight weeks ago.  I would say this is within the umbrella that I just mentioned to bring news to our consumers.  Okay? I don't want to get too much on the different strategies that we have towards that particular package, but I think the first reaction is that people are enjoying it. People are seeing it as a good new news, so we are happy that people are giving us some first good impressions. But it's too early to give you any details in terms of anything, volume, or share anything.</p>
          <p>And then regarding marketing expanding, I think we have enough resources right now to bring this sort of new news to the marketplace.  I think the total level of spending, whether this is above what I call the current resources that we have, will depend more on the competitive dynamics, then I think we'll have a better view as the year progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  And what about the Nielsen market share data? I mean, you have lost, according to Nielsen, 100 bps in the fourth quarter.  But, I think it's mentioned in your explanation in the beginning that these &#x2013; I mean, Nielsen's figures could not be reflecting the recent price increase.  I'm not sure if I understood you correctly.  The Nielsen figures could not be reflecting -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I just said, and I think what we've said lately is that as we've been increasing prices during the fourth quarter &#x2013; during the fourth quarter is really November and December for the most part. We think that December reading captured very little, the January reading captured a little bit more and the February reading should capture most of the impact.  The February reading will come in the next ten days.  So we still think that the next reading will still capture some of the price increase we put up at the very end of last year.  That's why I said that the next reading is the reading that really will give the first full impact of the price increases for the fourth quarter.  That's why we said that would not be abnormal to expect a further share decline on the February reading, given the history of the past five, six years.</p>

          <p>Yes, especially February.  I think January, if you take S&#xE3;o Paulo just as a reference; S&#xE3;o Paulo was one of the wettest months we had in a long time in terms of rain.  The weather, as I said, was not so cold.  It was not so bad; it was just wet.  But then in February it was really nice.  I mean, that was very different from what we had in the fourth quarter.  Good days, hot days, no rain.  So nice weather for Carnaval time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thank you for taking the question.  I had a question regarding the SG&amp;A both in the quarter and for the full year, specifically for beer in Brazil.  It seems that it's been growing double-digit both for the quarter and the full year.  How sustainable &#x2013; what would be the outlook of that SG&amp;A level for 2009?  And most importantly, how can we understand better what happened in 2008, and especially compared to CSD in Brazil?  We see the SG&amp;A growth in CSD, apparently was growing in the low single digits.  If you could explain those differences and give us some sense of the outlook, I'd really appreciate it.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks for the question.  It's a very good one.  I think the first part of the question I think what is to look that as an outlook for '09 and to extend '08.  I think what happened in '08 is not what I expect for '09.  I think the levels are &#x2013; and even if you look at past years, that's not the sort of level that we've seen in the marketplace. But, again, as we saw irrational market and irrational players, we fight back, and that's what we did.  I'll give a little bit more explanation.  But I don't see this going on given the current situation in Brazil, and in our industry in particular, I don't see that going forward.  But again too early to really tell, but that's the first perception for the first couple of months.</p>
          <p>If I try to explain the '08 and the fourth quarter in particular that is outlier, of course we always said that our SG&amp;A first goes up in line with inflation, so around 5.5, 6%.  And then we grew direct distribution more than in other years, so direct distribution did have an impact in our SG&amp;A.  We don't open up exactly how many points, but definitely above the average in previous years, as the year progressed between one or two points.  But this year it was more than that.  And finally, in the fourth quarter as we were progressing part of our marketing budget also some of it was brought from CSD to Beer, which also increases the Beer side.  So it's really a combination of those three things; inflation, direct distribution and higher marketing spending in the fourth quarter to fight the situation in the marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that we expect much less than what we had in the previous years.  We have already reached higher levels than were expected.  I think the strategy for '09 is much more opportunistic rather than the ones we took in the last year &#x2013; in the last two years.  So we should see less growth of SG&amp;A coming from that.  I think what &#x2013; I think the extra dollars or reais that we will spend will get to further back the sort of innovation that a little bit also impacted the fourth quarter, but should impact more the '09 numbers.</p>

          <p>Hi. How are you?  Just to follow-up on the SG&amp;A point. Should we be using that algorithm then, normalized algorithm back for 2009?  And second one to see if you could maybe tell a little bit about information on the new that slim can that you launched with the temperature gauge. I haven't actually seen it yet, but it's my understanding.  And finally, I want to confirm on the Beer Brazil <mark type="inaudible" />. The price increases that you guys put through in the fourth quarter, the understanding was that that was really to offset pressures and keep up with inflation as opposed to thinking about the tax increase yet and that we should look for something in 2009 to help offset the tax increase.  But I think I understood from today's call that that was not the case. That fourth quarter price increase was also taken in consideration of tax increases.  So if you could just confirm for me that would be great.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, Sean, exactly.  Starting from your last point, what we just said a few minutes ago is exactly what we just said is what we did in the fourth quarter already took in consideration.  We already knew exactly how much was going to be the extra increase.  So the price considered the inflation in the extra increase.  In terms of cans, we also got an earlier question on this and what we said is the idea is really to bring new news to consumers. And the feedback we're getting from the market again too early to talk about any figures, but very good impression from consumers regarding the cans.</p>
          <p>And in terms of SG&amp;A, if I understood what you said in the beginning of your question is if you could go back to the algorithm of the SG&amp;A that we used before, yes.  That's what we are using.  That's what I referred to using that SG&amp;A in '09 will probably look more like the '07 and '06 figures, where we explained to the market based on what we're in that we just mentioned. That's what we think today the SG&amp;A will be like for '09</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alex Robarts with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks.  I wanted just to clarify one thing you were talking earlier on the SG&amp;A.  Looking at the Beer Brazil SG&amp;A, the cash component, so basically what you're saying on an organic basis is that it shouldn't grow in the double-digit way that I guess I see from this 14.2%, which seems to me the Beer cash SG&amp;A for the full year.  So I want to clarify that.  And the question first relates to Canada. The competition has said that it really is keen and expects next month to raise prices in Quebec after really having moved up on its whole portfolio over the last three or four months.  Can we assume that Labatt or AmBev Canada has done that as well?  In other words, moved up on a majority of the portfolio in terms of pricing, and it tends to follow this price increase in Quebec.</p>
          <p>And the final question is really, in the fourth quarter your parent company clearly acquiring Anheuser-Busch, ABI being established and you being part of this much larger global player.  I know it's early days, but can you give us a sense of from an AmBev perspective, what could be some of the opportunities on the cost side or revenue side in terms of synergies or things that maybe have opened up for you as you look to work inside this larger global beer company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alex, thanks for the question.  Yes, let me try to address each of them.  I think first on the SG&amp;A front, what I'm saying is totally in line what you said. You should not expect the sort of increase that you saw in '08.  That's not what we expect. I mean, this is well above the sort of SG&amp;A growth that the company has been delivering.  The way we see the trend and the way we see the world, we don't think the world will move towards that sort of competitive environment and also that sort of investment level that also impacts the SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I think also we mentioned that we'll be looking for every single opportunity to reduce costs.  We showed you &#x2013; we showed and we just mentioned in the beginning that we just closed a plant last week, and of course our plant had to do it.  We'll look for every opportunity to simplify our processes where we think they could be redundant.  I think also being part of a larger group and having access to different sort of new benchmarks also that bring &#x2013; we're always on a healthy way competing against each other in the sense of looking and learning with the colleagues. And I can try to give you some examples.</p>
          <p>But just to finalize before the SG&amp;A that's in line with the last question we had is we will work in '09 to go back to the sort of SG&amp;A increase that we had in the past relative to inflation, relative to volume growth if there is volume growth. We said that the direct distribution growth will be smaller than the '08.  I mean, of course, you will have the carryover from '08, but you should not have much growth from new direct distribution coming in.  So I believe that we'll be at the moment definitely below the sort of number that you saw in '08.</p>
          <p>Regarding Canada, what I was saying is that we did found in the past few weeks some new price increases in the marketplace, next few weeks, next few months.  And we see the whole industry, including ourselves, again, moving prices up.  So that's the sort of thing that we see going on right now.  In terms of further synergies, with the new enlarged corporation or parent company, like you said, referring to ABI as both. We see brands as a potential. But gain, I would not say that in the beginning this is our focus. I think as we are in different markets, I mean we're talking about AmBev operating in 13 markets.  We have already launched Budweiser, for example in Dominican Republic, okay, in the last few months. We know that some of the countries that Bernardo had for Quinsa also, Bud's there. So there are opportunities also to try to take on the brands there and further grow them. So I think there is opportunities for sure with the Budweiser brand, it's a great brand.  I think for Brazil, in particular, it's not a priority for the short term or for '09, but definitely it is for some other Latin American markets where we participate.  So I think Bud for Brazil, we're talking more about the 2010 type of product than about 2009. But again, we'll see that as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>But in the meantime, it terms of procurement, there &#x2013; for sure there's a lot of opportunities.  We buy a lot of the same things from different suppliers, so we have the scale.  That's involves a learning process.  Anheuser-Busch has a very important business in terms of cans.  Cans are very important in Brazil, so anything we can learn from the procurement side in cans, anything is a lot of money.  So we've been working very closely with some colleagues in the Budweiser world, for example, in terms of cans. This is the sort of opportunity that is arriving, is appearing. It's not just appearing, we go after them because we know where costs are pressuring us. So we'll be looking for scale and for synergy as we speak, and having Luiz Fernando there is also a great help given that he was here and knows the business here as well.  So we've been working very closely to continue to benchmark.  As we did when I was in Argentina and he was here, and we also continue to do as Bernardo is there in Argentina and together with Marcio I think we've been able to gain from this very specific things. And I'm sure we'll continue to benefit from that as we go forward.  And as for example in cans, as for example in brands.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Trevor Stirling, Stanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Two questions, gentlemen.  First one, in Canada, we've seen some fairly stiff increases in cost of goods sold because of raw materials, I guess particularly in quarter three and quarter four.  As you look forward into 2009, is that likely to continue for the first two quarters, or will it slow down and possibly even will it turn around at the end of the year?  And the second question is maybe a more strategic question in Brazil. Do you think you may have actually set in place a price umbrella for your competitors?  Your margins are very, very strong, but presumably leave space for smaller competitors to make less money and still make reasonable money. And is there a temptation for them that when you take the prices up, they say, you know what, I could take my prices up and get the margin or keep them down and go for volume. I'll just keep them down and go for volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Very good, Trevor.  Let me start by the second part. Every time you move prices up, we are fully conscious that we could be creating an umbrella for competitors. So this is something that we work on every time, and that's why always having the objective of growing share and profitability is a hard one. It's not simple. I think we've shown for the most part of our history that's possible. I still think that's possible in '09. I think although we have big margins and we're working to grow them, and I think we'll continue to grow them. We know that competitors also have their growth objectives, and we also know that competitors, particularly in '09, are under pressure also. I think leaving from a dollar at 1.5 and going through a dollar of 2.4 in Brazilian reais is quite a hefty increase, and definitely it will pressure the margins of competitors. So particularly in this year, I think the combination of dollar going against for people that are not hedged and our capability of really delivering price increase in '08 that we tried to minimize market share loss because we do a market share increase differently by region, differently by pack, and different by brand, I think that combination will for '09 offset the risk of the price umbrella. The risk's there and it's something that, again, we work every day to offset it. But it's the only way to really grow share and profitability at the same time. And I think in '09 that equation will work. So it should work, and we are optimistic about it.</p>
          <p>Regarding the second part of the question, as you know, I think there are two things there in terms of costs. I think we do not expect for Canada in '09 the sort of cost per hectoliter growth that we saw in the third and fourth quarter. Actually, that's true not just for Canada, but for most zones because, again, a good portion of the commodities are not hedged and commodities have come down substantially between 10 and 45%, depending on which commodity you are taking. Of course, sometimes you do have some contracts that are medium term. It could be six months, ten months. So you should see a downward trend from costs per hectoliter in Canada from the current cost level. Usually most start the second, third, or fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and thanks for taking the follow-up.  I just wondered, Jo&#xE3;o, if I could ask you a little bit about Quinsa and HILA in terms of your perspectives for 2009.  Clearly you left Quinsa in fantastic shape and we can see it in the numbers for 2008.  But can you comment on what you think the franchise can grow this year?  And if you're seeing a change in environment as you're into 2009 now.  Of And then on HILA-ex, I mean, clearly this has been the sort of tough spot for AmBev for the last couple years.  If you take a sort of a new look at HILA-ex, do you see any easy opportunities to improve the losses? They keep widening from what we're seeing in the fourth quarter results. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lore. Thank you. I think from Latin America as a whole again, as we look at AmBev as a whole, and we don't want to get into the details on a country by country basis, we're seeing, again, prices overall sticking everywhere. I mentioned Canada. I mentioned Brazil. It's also true for Argentina. We are putting prices up, and pricing is sticking in terms of competition.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook or volume, it's very different. The resilience of the different markets are different. I think we have both in Canada and in HILA or in Quinsa, where I was &#x2013; Bernardo is a fantastic guy. I think if I could, together with the team, leave a good thing for him, it's true, but I think he's a very complete guy. I think there's still a lot of opportunity that he can capture both in sales, both in costs, both in expenses. There's still a lot of room to improve things in ex. And I'm sure and confident that Bernardo will deliver on them. I think the challenge for us there, for Bernardo there is that it's very difficult to expect the sort of growth that we have there. I think Brazil, different from the rest of Latin America, has really pulled growth in '08. And, therefore, the comps are much easier. So it's different there.</p>
          <p>So I think Brazil's further resilience &#x2013; may be showing resilience now, but it didn't show that much growth anyway. I think theirs is the opposite. So I think we're going to have a tough job in terms of volume. But as we mentioned, I think the hedging policy will help us a lot. So we're very confident that the sort of EBITDA growth story that will be there is still consistent. I think there's a lot of things going on. Therefore, I think what will be the thing to watch there is the quarter and how we're going to look for ways. And we're going to look for ways to compensate any downside in the volumes that we're going to have given the tough comps. So this is my comment to Quinsa. I hope they touch on your question.</p>
          <p>Regarding HILA-ex, it's a little bit more difficult, given that in Quinsa, as I said, we showed the results. We know where the surprises could come from. And in HILA, it has been more volatile than Quinsa in the past. I think the big issue in '08, which we still don't have a great answer for in '09, is Venezuela. Venezuela had a very tough year. We actually had a good year in the other countries. But given the size and the importance of Venezuela, it took away the gains and the good results we had in the other four countries. So I am personally taking some of my time to work with the Venezuela team, because I think, if we can find a way to fix Venezuela, we'll have a much better result of HILA-ex. So in terms of priority, my priority will be in HILA-ex really to focus on Venezuela, given the size in volume and given the size of <mark type="inaudible" /> and also given the fact that I think we found a good path for growth in terms of volume for stability in the other four countries. So I am working and confident that I think we will find a way to change the results of '08. But, again, it's going to be &#x2013; it's still a tough spot for us and even tougher within Venezuela.</p>
