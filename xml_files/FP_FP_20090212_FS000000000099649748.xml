        <plist>
          <p>So, let's say good evening or good afternoon &#x2013; evening, okay.  Good evening.  Now, we are flexible in Total up to a point.  Well, welcome in this new place as far as I am concerned.  It looks great; I've heard that it was convenient for a lot of you, so if that's the first result I'm happy with it.</p>
          <p>You've been hearing about our results this morning through, I mean, different documents and our relation in France, so if you don't mind that we'll just go through the presentation directly.  With that, we're starting on the beautiful result we've had in 2008, and definitely I would come back still on what are the plus and minus and why after such big results definitely even if the future looks great, we definitely -- we have to live in a different environment.</p>
          <p>So, I start directly with what is the reason of the success of our strategy and why we believe that this strategy is a right one.  Coming back to what has been one of our favorite subject is not the Peak Oil, but the potential production capacities especially for oil.  Remember we have said that we consider 95 million barrels per day as probably a good target, even if I was already saying it will be challenging, definitely today we consider, especially because of the -- today's crisis, the lack of investment, not Total, probably not Big Oil, but others that this target of 95 million barrels per day will be difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p>And as far as we like to say things not only by words or with words, but in using figures, we want to say that at this time we consider that we have to reduce this amount by probably something which is at least 4 million barrels per day.  It's coming from what?  It's coming from the delay in the production of heavy oil in Canada, also the heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela.  That's roughly 1.5 and could be more in the future if we are not capable to develop this part of the world in a more convenient and efficient way.</p>
          <p>Definitely the growth in Iraq and in Iran will be also delayed but probably also not as I had expected.  We use for this roughly 1.3 million barrels per day and the base decline of our fields, not Total but globally, is probably going to be accelerated by 1%, which is an additional 1.2 million barrels per day.  So the message is probably not going to be for, but definitely in the medium term if we want to reach an additional level, thanks to the demand recovery we have to be faced with potential, which will be not enough to face the demand.  And that's why we consider still that it will be the demand constrained by supply and not the opposite, even if at the present time it's definitely the opposite, and I come back to that.  The present is probably based on very, very deep declining demand.  That is first message.</p>
          <p>Second is, well, the oil is still in the hands of the same group of countries, definitely those countries have a huge potential but it will more and more depend from OPEC countries and that's another signal but can at the same time increase production capacities but they can also reduce capacities.  And today, that something which didn't see in the past when we were considering that oil-producing countries were still investing even during a period of deflation, of crisis.</p>
          <p>Nowadays, as far as they also are short of cash, they are starting to reduce their investment also in the oil segments, which mean that the famous theory of when you reduce production you still keep and increase the gap between potential capacities and demand, that is going to be different those days. They will also have a declining capacity level and that's why quickly we might be faced with not enough production to satisfy the demand and our role is, as far as we can, continue to invest to get the benefit of higher prices in the near-term.</p>
          <p>So, I have been taking you by definition all of the presentation but I've been using just 20 slides out of 39, 50%, so I am on the slide 5.  That's why we have decided to continue to develop our activities, especially in the Upstream, we need to keep the priority on the safety and environment for obvious reason.  We need also to take the benefit of the existing environment, which is lower cost, definitely inflation being very weak those days, to reduce our investments, not in terms of volumes, but in terms of global demand.</p>
          <p>And that means also probably potential slots for a new partnership, for eventually acquisition. We've been doing some recently, small ones.  There is no rush.  The crisis is probably to last a little bit longer than we expected it to be last year.  So there is a time to see what could be the opportunities for developing our activities with our partners.</p>
          <p>So you have here a list of different, I would say, strategies.  Keep in mind that we will continue to give priority to safety and environment, not only the environment in our installation but environment in terms of global warming.  Our commitments have to be staying valid including during those period of problem of cash.  We don't have cash problem.  It will be even more expensive if we don't do it, because we believe in it, to have a stop-and-go investment policy in these areas.</p>
          <p>Second, R&amp;D.  We have a very strong, I would say, desire to not only keep our program intact but to increase it.  We announced $7.5 billion on five years, which means 1 billion euro per year on five years and that's definitely to be maintained.  On the top of it, we are thinking and I will come back to it again because it's not definitely the core business of the company, but we are thinking in developing even more some activities, which are on the side of our core business, such as solar and maybe one day nuclear, but that's not to be politically correct, even if it helps.  It's because we believe that at the end of the day, there will be not enough energy and on the long-term view thinking that the company like Total should be involved in those activities makes sense.</p>
          <p>Slide number 8, to come back on figures, but those figures are important to give you a view of what is not only the results of -- what are the result of 2008, but definitely that they have been different different quarters.  The best one has been the third one; definitely the lowest one the fourth, with prices of oil going from 115 during the third quarter to 55 during the fourth.</p>
          <p>What is interesting to see on that slide is that Total is resisting far better than our competitors in this environment.  We always have this in mind; that's something we've sometime discuss with some of you.  We have had difficulties, for instance, during the third quarter to get the last, what I call, dollars per barrel.  It's true that during the third quarter, our partners have been more, I would say, efficient in getting the full value of the price of oil.</p>
          <p>It's absolutely true, at the same time, that when the price of oil declines, Total is resisting better for probably the same reasons: production sharing contracts, a good portfolio, and definitely what we see here is this result.  So the reduction in profits is more important than quarter-to-quarter, I mean fourth versus the fourth of 2007.  But we have minus 58 when Exxon minus 42, Chevron 46, Shell 52, and BP 71.</p>
          <p>So two messages. You have here the real tendency in what will be our results.  But second, which is also important, we have in low price of oil a good capacity not only to resist -- I will come back to it -- but to invest with additional profit for the company, even for projects which have still to be launched.</p>
          <p>Moving to Upstream, slide number 12, well definitely 2008 has been the proof of the success of our strategy in Upstream.  We have had an increase in our net operating result of 30%, $16 billion.  Definitely that's going to be the reference to be beaten, but certainly not in 2009 or 2010.  But it has been part of the beauty of getting the benefit of a long-term strategy.  It's also bringing some good things for a healthy financial situation, a good balance sheet, even if our production have been not exactly what we would have like it to be, but still bringing cash and added value.</p>
          <p>If you forget the price effect, we have production underlying growth of plus 1% with a lot of new production.  We will have another, I would say, to use a word that my friend Jean-Jacques likes, a bundle of new projects to come, which means nothing more than new projects like Yemen LNG, but I'll come back to it.  But we also have to face, and that's a message which is even more important here in the North Sea, especially when I see my friend Alain Festeau in front of me who is in charge of our operation in the UK, thanks, we have been able to deliver new production. Jura is one of the best example, on time, within budget, coming at a time where price were so high that it's really beautiful success; congratulation.</p>
          <p>At the same time we have aging fields, mature fields, which are difficult to operate and definitely we need to spend more efforts in that area so that we can continue to fully benefit of our new projects.  The good thing is also that the access to new resources is still at less than $2 per barrel.  Of course it's access to resources.  Then you need to develop. The cost of development are still very high, but should get the benefit of the reduction in cost "thanks" to this crisis.  So, productions are there to be delivered with new projects, using the crisis to reduce cost and getting opportunities as we have been doing with Synenco, like UTS in the future or Madagascar in the heavy oil segments.</p>
          <p>Reserve replacement, next slide, slide number 13.  Well, that's where the company has really its value, even if it's not only on proved reserves.  Proved reserves, we'll increase it at the rate of 112, which is not knowing yet what our partners, competitors will be doing.  It's better than definitely next year.  It give us a chance to continue to grow in good conditions.</p>
          <p>But to be very clear, I'm not choosing the figures only to please.  If you take the price effect, this 112 becomes 99 and when you take the acquisitions, the 112 becomes 101 and the equivalence without the price effect, 88.  But, it means reserve life of more than 12 years and even if it's not on this slide, still having to 2P, i.e., probable reserves above 20 years and resources above 40, close to 45 years.  So definitely we are in a position to maintain the launching of our new projects.</p>
          <p>Upstream production costs, slide 15, which is definitely something important in this new environment.  The cost structure of the company, I mean definitely the cost per barrel is still at levels which give us all chances to deliver added value even with low price of oil.  That's very important for the near-to-long-term.  It covers almost all of our, I would say geographical zone.  Definitely it means that at the end of the day, it will go in really new long-term plateau developments that will be a little bit more different.</p>
          <p>In the middle, words again are not sufficient, if we want to reduce our cost, not only CapEx, but OpEx, we have decided to have a figure for this of $0.8 billion per year through renegotiations, optimization, and if necessary delayed operation.  What I mean by delayed operations is, clearly we send the message to all of those working with us and for us that at that period of time, if necessary, we will take the time needed to make sure that we get the benefit of what we call lower cost.</p>
          <p>Commodities have been falling.  Commodities are a large part of our cost.  There is no reason that we find those reductions in our new investments.  And this message is not unfriendly.  It's just to make sure that everybody understand that we have to share the burden of the crisis.  I think the message has been heard, especially on the exploration side.  It's true that on exploration, people are scared that we might stop it if price of oil decrease.  It's not our intent, but if that's what contractors want to believe, that's good news.</p>
          <p>And I can tell you they already understood this and we have a reduction for instance in the right --  on the rig prices that we have not yet in the rigs we are using for development. On exploration, it's moving along.  I hope you're seeing it, but it's definitely the case in Africa.</p>
          <p>The technical costs, as you can see, have been increasing significantly.  But I mean that's a mix of different things and including accounting.  If you want more explanation on this topic, we'll be able to answer to it afterwards.  Definitely we're seeing that those technical costs will remain below the one of our competitors.  It's important, but it's also important that we try to cap them at this level for the next months and years to come.  And that's doable, in particular thanks to the real way we have to manage our operations, i.e., we have to be adamant on keeping costs under control, development being developed on time, within budget, and I would say I will come back to it when we talk about investment, within the new budget, which are including, I would say, a decided reduction in cost without waiting to see the result of the bids.  So definitely it should help at the end of the day to reduce our break-even and definitely also to still get good return in a lower prices environment.</p>
          <p>So as I was saying this morning and you've heard, we have decided to keep our strong policy of investment, especially in the Upstream.  Globally you will see our investment are globally the same than in 2008.  But they are continuing to increase in the Upstream and almost in all the same traditional sectors when Total proved to be successful.</p>
          <p>If you take the last column of the CapEx, you will see that it's 8% for exploration, so it's $1.7 billion, but that's only 8%.  You have heavy oil at 5%, which is still small, which mean that our developments are taking more time than what we expected.  Energy still in the upper range with 13%.  And we continue to have our globally very successful story in the offshore, deep offshore 23%, traditional offshore 41, and onshore 9%.  That is definitely what we need to achieve to keep the potential added value of the company, which will come from our Upstream activities.</p>
          <p>And to take the example of what has been inflation and what we could get from I would say 2009, you have the year 2007 versus 2006, the combination of all of those different column, of different levels, gives you roughly an inflation of 18% in 2008 versus 2007 only 2%, but still an increase.  And for 2009, we have an empty box.  But this empty box is below zero, which means definitely we are absolutely certain that we will get lower prices, thanks to the different components of what are our investment.</p>
          <p>Definitely the most difficult part will be the sub sea equipment, especially in the deep offshore, for everything which is linked with UFL.  Definitely the technology is still high, demand important.  It will be more difficult, but it's also a message for our project developers, is just to be careful, not to invent things which are not too easy to develop.  You know perfectly well because when you talk with our contractors they say one of the problems is if you would be asking us easier things to do, thanks, it will be probably cheaper.</p>
          <p>Going to the Arctic Sea and elsewhere, I don't think it's easy, but certainly at the same time we could have in Total a better way to, for instance, do carbon copies of what has been done if it proved to be workable.  I know it's not always easy because we ask at the same time to our engineers to be at the upper range of the highest technologies.  But, there is a time for everything and today certainly one way to help contractors to reduce their cost.</p>
          <p>Next wave of major projects, it's the next slide -- slide 17.  Well, you have on the first part of the slide, which is the representation of what are the levels of the price of oil we need to make our new projects profitable; and just be careful here -- in those slides, which are always very interesting, they have to be looked at in details. Here we're talking about pending, i.e., new projects to be launched.  So, it doesn't take into account the existing one where we have definitely old cost and higher return.</p>
          <p>Here it mean that for deep and ultra-deep offshore, we are still capable to develop project on an economical basis at $40 per barrel.  Of course at 40, the return is not enough to cover all of what we want to develop in the long term, but it means that even on $40, even if we don't believe that this level will remain, we can still find projects which are economical at that level.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's more difficult for projects, what we call with long plateau, just like for instance LNG or the heavy oil, wherever, where we need higher prices, and where the range is much more between 60 and 100, and that's where we have more than ever to continue to fight against cost, and definitely to think also that return is important, but enrichment is important too, so a good mix in our portfolio of those project being successful at 40 and one who are deserving higher prices are both necessary for our long-term, which mean that we will not wait to see higher prices to develop those long-term plateau projects.</p>
          <p>We need to have this continuity in the portfolio of our development.  So, you have on the top all the projects which are going to be launched. You have the list of the one which had been decided in 2008, the one which will be decided in 2009, 2010.  There is a long list of projects.  Those projects will be done one after one.  You will see that on another slide.  Definitely, the only risk is if we don't find the appropriate cost, we might have to delay them until we find what we think is normal.</p>
          <p>On the last part, just keep in mind, when we are asked what is your flexibility on your investment?  Well, first, the intent is to do all of this investment.  If necessary, there is one part which we could definitely delay is everything which has not been yet decided and you have this as what we call the FIDs. You have the different colors, especially for 2009 and 2010, i.e., the orange and brown &#x2013; it is orange and brown, or yellow and brown here, and those two parts are the FIDs not decided.  So, it represents 15% in 2009 and 29% in 2010.  So, that is definitely a flexibility, if needed.  For the time being, it's no change.</p>
          <p>Exploration, the next slide, slide 18.  Exploration, which is still the main driver of our success, of our profits.  $1.7 billion of budget.  It's in fact roughly the equivalent amount of what has been spent in 2008.  It's a little bit less than the budget of 2008.  We have already all the potential rigs and wells, i.e., targets to be drilled.  But first, just remember the figures.  In 2008, we have been able to bring an additional 800 million barrels of resources -- a little bit less than the average, which is more around 900 million, but still a good year.  And we definitely intend to continue on that basis.</p>
          <p>The cost per barrel discovered has a little bit increased from what you've been used to in the old days, i.e., nine years ago where we were closer to $1 per barrel, definitely it's now much more, $2, $3, it's not far of the $2 for the acquisition of new resources.  It's still definitely an extremely sound basis for getting access to additional profit through the development of those project.  And, we have on the right part of the slide, we've been using the last discovery we've been doing and giving you the kind of rate of return it has been delivering to the company, depending of course on the price of oil.  What is important, again, is most of those project are still bringing an acceptable return even at $40, which mean that everything on the top of it is bringing additional rate of return, additional profit, additional cash for the company.</p>
          <p>Then, we've made it clear that it's different between Europe, Africa and Central Asia &#x2013; well I mean, just to help you, but you are all experts.  Usually, it's better in Europe because we are using existing importation hubs to develop those new discoveries. The best example, again, being Jura or some new ones to come in the portfolio of the UK.</p>
          <p>Life continues on page 20, the next major project to come on-stream. You know all of them, they have been discussed at different period of their life, it's good to see them coming on-stream: Akpo in Nigeria; Yemen LNG, in Yemen, of course; Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico; Tombua Landana in Angola; and Qatargas II in Qatar.  All of those projects will be starting in 2009 and will be part of the additional production of the company.</p>
          <p>Again, three messages. Those projects will represent by 2010, including the increasing plateau, almost 400,000 barrel per day in 2010, which is an important amount.  It means technical cost still remaining under control even with the deep offshore which you see on that part here at $16 per barrel and all of them again bringing additional cash.  But, the important thing is, on the IRR, all of those projects are starting to have a good return at $40. Some are even higher than the expected minimum return, and definitely we're catching an important part of the additional price when it comes up to, as you can see, $100 per barrel and above.</p>
          <p>The traditional one which we usually give you and don't comment, because we usually have to comment on them one-by-one, it's our day-to-day program just making sure that all those project are living their life, which means going from the study to the feed and then to the FID which mean the decision to develop.  As you can see, you have all the list until 2009 with the project I've just been presenting to you and then the list for all the one to come until 2016. Of course some of them are still not yet approved, by definition.  But they are sufficiently advanced so that we can consider them as already being part of our medium-term portfolio.</p>
          <p>What is important is we have to fight against a decline rate of roughly 4% per year; that's typical of all companies.  At 4%, we are probably below our competitors, but it's a challenging figure.  And, definitely, the other message is what we are seeing in terms of delay in our Canadian operation will not hurt this list.  But in any case, that was something to come around the year 2016.  But, it means that globally for all of the industry you might suspect that most of the heavy oil projects in Canada will be delayed for a mix of logistic reasons, costs, and probably too environmental concerns.</p>
          <p>If you see the beautiful diagram which has been done and signed by Jerome, Jerome signed -- each time you see this foot A, that's Jerome.  We will see with Bertrand if he keeps the same thing, but I think it's a good idea.  It gives you dependency.  And then, you have to discuss with him and all of his colleagues what are behind the  Foot A . Foot A means we know it will increase, but we don't know by how much.</p>
          <p>On -- on LNG, I think it's important that we continue to highlight what is a success story of the company.  I decided to use only one slide because today the concern of the industry is not only what is the future of LNG; the future of LNG is obvious.  But it's much more today what will be the problem of the bubble, the bubble which we have been talking about last year here.  This bubble was much more expected for 2010, 2011.  But with the crisis and lower demand, the bubble will come earlier.  Our first concern as being a big producer of LNG has been to make sure that we will have outlets for our productions which are coming from Qatar, but also Yemen, et cetera.</p>
          <p>The good news is, we don't have any problem.  The bad news mean that, it's thanks to lower gas prices.  Those lower gas prices have been having a very clear impact on the production of what we call those unconventional gases in the U.S.  We were not quite sure when we discussed with some of you of where and at what price would be the limit.  Definitely when the price of the hub area went below 6 and it's now below 5, it has had the impact of just stopping most of those rigs which will definitely let room for gas coming from LNG.  That is a good news.</p>
          <p>The bad news, it mean that the bubble will remain for a period of time, even if we see a continuity in a request for more gas in the U.S. That's not the case for oil, but it's still the case for gas.  And especially with a price of that level, it gives all the good reasons for the industry to switch from definitely oil to gas, but also from coal to gas at those levels.  It becomes extremely interesting.  And at the top much cleaner than what you could get from coal. Even if the intent was to talk about the short-term, we still have a good long-term.</p>
          <p>We are still working on a new project in Nigeria, in Australia, and why not one day in Iran.  We don't intend only to keep our existing project.  I see your eyes moving when I talk about Iran.  You're right.  But that has been always a success of the company is to believe, even if it takes time.  I know that Yemen is not Iran, but Yemen will be producing soon when it was considered not so long ago as totally irrealistic, a dream, and impossible.  So, I would not be surprised to see one day an energy project in Iran.  What I wouldn't like is to see that this project is developed by somebody else.  But again, we will have more time to discuss about it.</p>
          <p>Downstream, we are an integrated company.  We intend to remain an integrated company even if, I will come back on it, we have all of our priorities on Upstream.  Well, the -- it's more than a challenging medium-term environment.  It's a really not good at all environment for refining, and to a lesser extent marketing.</p>
          <p>By the way, marketing has been a very strong support of our profit in the downstream in 2008.  I know it's not always easy to say this at time where we talk about consumers and everything.  But I mean, we have solid worldwide outlets and that is part of the success of the company.  But on the side of this, definitely the refining will be suffering, even if for the time being the result are far higher than expected.  I'm talking about January and February.  But at the same time, we don't think it can last like this for too long.</p>
          <p>We still have this problem of excess of gasoline versus diesel and definitely Total will have to restructure in a way its portfolio to make sure that we have capacities which are aligned with the demand of our consumers and that we will not be forced because of an excess of gasoline to stop the production of our refinery. It's probably much easier to adapt them to develop more DHS, i.e., desulphurization units.  And at the same time probably reconsidering the size of certain of our units to be more in line with what is requested demand from our customers.  We have being using here, we have to take risk in our industry.</p>
          <p>In terms of demand, we think that the demand for the first semester of the year will be probably of minus 2 million barrels per day on six month &#x2013; on a six-month basis.  You know that the IEA is still using, even if they change their figure every month, they move from minus 0.8 to minus 1, but it's on an annual basis.  Annual, I don't know yet what it is. Definitely today in terms of demand, it's much more minus 2, and we have this very clear when we see the OPEC reducing its production by 4 million, even if it's a little bit less.</p>
          <p>You have demand minus 2, we have definitely to swallow what have been all the barrels that have been, let's say, stock, being onshore or in ships. But that's probably why you see the price of oil remaining at a relatively now stable price is we are, and we think we are in a period where I would say one by one we are recapturing all of those stocks.  And when we will be really rebalanced, then we will see what it is.  Question mark in my opinion is not OPEC, it's still what will be the real demand reduction in the months to come.  That's why we have to remain extremely conservative in the way we operate our global operations.</p>
          <p>So more than ever, we need to strengthen the performance of our Downstream.  We have on this slide two different images; one which is just to please ourselves, is to say that as far as the Downstream adjusted net operating income per refined barrel is concerned we are as good as Exxon. I like it would be the same for all of our activities.  But sometimes we are challenging ourselves on, cannot we do far better in refining? The answer is yes.  At the same time it prove that at a time being it is sound.</p>
          <p>Now, it's sound because we are since many years doing lot of work to reduce our cost and increase our productivity. It's what you see on the right part of the slide.  We are capable to beat inflation.  We have to do even more and definitely, even if it isn't small, we will have one day to go to more restructuring. That will be the only way to get an efficient, sustainable Downstream investment, which will profit to the company as a whole at its own level and also has been part of our strategy to bring to our partners all of our skills from Upstream to Downstream.</p>
          <p>Chemicals, it's probably even worse as far as we've already seen the impact of the crisis on our results.  The demand for polymer, for ethylene has been declining for the first time since I was not there, but I'm sure it's true, 30 years. I was there, but not in this part of the activities.  That's very unusual.  And what's even more concern, even with the big drop in the naphtha prices, well unfortunately the price of PE has been declining even more.  So not only we have a problem of demand, but we have a problem of feed and definitely the mix of the two is not giving us good results.</p>
          <p>On the top of it, we have a concern with now the utilization rates of our crackers; that's part of the reason.  You know that below certain level, it becomes difficult to keep the cracker in activity.  It's probably something below 80%.  Our concern is who is going to be the first to stop.  We know that there are three of our big competitors which are really at stake those days.  Those are Dow Chemical, ENEOS, and Basel.  Definitely I don't know which of the one will be the first to have to make a jump in this.  I hope it will not be through bankruptcy, but definitely for the time being there are too many crackers in operation to be facing the decreasing demand.</p>
          <p>So more than ever, on slide 33, we have to continue to be extremely aggressive in the way we handle our petrochemicals activities.  We are concentrating now most of those activities in a few numbers of platforms which are and will be more and more first-class.  First decile, as we say in French; I don't say how you say first decile in English? Okay, one of the best in the industry. And keeping our activities outside of Europe where you will one day see a big access to additional demand.</p>
          <p>On the right part of the slide, you have all of our CapEx.  You see that we still are spending a lot of money for maintenance, keeping our investment in good shape.  The good thing is we can now take the benefit of reducing the investment program.  We have been spending quite a lot of money to get all of those investment as first-class investment.  Now we can definitely reduce the investment base for a period of time, except in places where, like in Qatar and Nigeria, we will be able to have access to good feedstock like ethane and get the benefit of higher price of oil when it returns to better conditions.</p>
          <p>But definitely for the time being, the results of the petrochemicals and the specialty chemicals are far below our expectations.  As you've seen, we said that we want to keep, and that's what will be done, in the Downstream ratchet above double-digit, which is above 12%.  That's definitely not the case in the petrochemical activities those days.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; now prospective, you go to slide 34. So I repeat it.  First is maintaining our CapEx program, $18 billion.  It's one for Chemicals, three for Downstream and 14 for Upstream.  As I said earlier, definitely it's more Upstream than ever.  It's the same amount than in 2008.  2008 has been a little bit below what has been budgeted.  The 18 is taking into account the fact that we have already consider that we could reduce our investment program by what I called decision taken by the top, i.e., we told to our people that they have to reduce it and that's now part of their commitment.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we hope that we will be able in keeping those investment, we will be also able to reduce the size thanks to, let's say, far reduced cost, and on the top definitely still taking the opportunities when they come of having operations just like the one we have been doing when we launched this bid on UTS Energy in Canada.  So it means 75% of our capital expenditure is dedicated to Upstream.</p>
          <p>Slide 18.  It shows you even more the result of this strategy, i.e., more and more Upstream.  And if you take the 2004-2009 period, it's a decline of our capital employed in the refi &#x2013; in the Chemical, sorry, from 24 to 12, divided by 2.  Then you have of course in this the drop linked with the spin-off of Arkema, but definitely still important research, and it will continue.  Downstream from 28 to 24, and you have by definition the rest in Upstream climbing from 48 to 64, 64 in 2009 capital employed.  If you invest 75, it mean that it will year-after-year be even more Upstream-oriented, which is definitely our strategy.</p>
          <p>Royalty on our different activities. I said in jokingly this morning, but I think it's less and less jokingly, that next time we would have probably to get Exxon out of the slide because it's always difficult to explain, even if we think we know why, but we are having a very good profit in 2008, close to 28%. It's one of the best of the industry.  It's good.  Definitely that will be different next year, but I mean still at rates which mean that each time we concentrate more to the Upstream, it will give a better royalty for the group as a whole and that will be definitely the strategy which will continue in the future.</p>
          <p>Slide 36, on the balance sheet -- I've been a little bit too long, so I will read quickly on this.  Just keep the right part of the slide and see what is the capability of the company for being flexible faced to an unknown environment for the short-term.  Well, you have here all the elements to see what will be the sensitivities for a change in the brand price or refining margin. Even more important, you see what could be coming from divesting more of Sanofi-Aventis and what is impact of an additional 5% in gearing, i.e., we have all of what we need on the side of the profit coming from our operations to be able to commit ourselves on this strategy of maintaining our investment and maintaining our dividend policy, and that is the strongest message.</p>
          <p>We have said that we will be keeping a 25, 30% gearing for the year 2009.  Remember it was 20, 30.  The 20 is probably over for a period of time, but it mean that we have all of the opportunities in the market, and Patrick will be certainly more than delighted to tell you of our recent beautiful emissions, i.e., far better than others.  But definitely it mean that we will not wait to be needing of additional debts to raise fund just to make sure that we don't are, I would say, relying on banks for the time where we will be needing to increase our gearing.</p>
          <p>So strong potential for value creation.  That will be my last slide, the slide that usually our shareholders like; that's why we end with it, and that's also pleasing Jerome.  So as far as going to be one of the last presentation of Jerome and that was in fact the reason to say this, but I say last word afterwards.</p>
          <p>So you have on this slide that we're seeing, you know now already we have asked our Board yesterday to ask the Annual General Meeting an increase of 10% of our dividend at &#x20AC;2.28 per share.  I know that some, I would say, pessimistic people are telling me that it is a same amount that the amount we have paid in November, but I mean, take it the way you want.  It's 10% more than last year and that give us a payout ratio of 37%, which is also very close to the one of last year.</p>
          <p>The good thing, it give us all the good willing to keep this for the year to come and even more definitely we, to give priority to dividend, to return the money which is due to our shareholders, we have decided to stop our buyback program and to keep on this policy dividend or dividend policy on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p>I will not comment what I've been commenting last time, is that I still consider that it's strange that with such big dividends and such reserve the share is not higher.  But definitely that's not part of my presentation, it's part of your job.  And I will be looking at it carefully in the years to come.  But definitely it's a consistent strategy and we will maintain it.  It's based on investment discipline and very centralized, and we will maintain it.  We will reduce our cost and we will ask our employees to be more than ever dedicated to the job.</p>
          <p>We will definitely continue to have this diversified policy. We think that, more than ever, being in different countries of the world helps you to get access to new business.  We will continue to be one of the best in profitability.  We don't intend to change our targets because of lower prices.  And definitely with a strong balance sheet starting from the end of 2008 we have, thanks to Patrick, everything in hands for still what looks for me a very good future, because we believe in higher price in the longer term.  And we have everything in hands to go through this probably difficult period in which there is no reason that we cannot continue to find very good opportunities.</p>
          <p>Thank you.  I just wanted to say for Jerome because it's probably his last appearance as being in charge of the &#x2013; of the what? Of this beautiful job.  He &#x2013; I can tell you that that's my thought.  I hope you share it.  That has been done with a great talent by Jerome and all of his team.  And I just wanted to take this opportunity -- not to thank the team, it's too early.  I still need you -- but Jerome, thank you on behalf of the management of Total and then you will discuss this with your colleagues of this room.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="inaudible" />. You put 500 million in your pension funds in 2008, all of it in the fourth quarter I think. How much higher is that number likely to be in 2009? And the second question, given the lack of visibility on the micro situation, if in a year's time we meet here in London and oil is 35 to $40 and your gearing has gone up to 30%, you've reduced your costs, what changes, how does Total's short-term strategy then adapt in a period of prolonged weakness in the external environment?

          <p>Okay.  On the pension fund we, this year what we said, externalized, so transferred to third parties the liabilities of some French system up to 500 million and that's it.  To give a number of figures, we have about 7.5 billion of liabilities for pension in our balance sheet and about 6 billion -- in euro -- of assets.  So the difference is already provided by 600 million, if I will remember.  So which is &#x2013; what is not provided yet is about 1 billion &#x2013; less than one billion, about &#x20AC;800 million.  And this now, you know the mechanism with the collar. So we have about 5, 10 years to provide for, if necessary, in the forthcoming years.  But the transfer of the liability was a one-off this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question?  No, sorry.  I think probably the best way will be to answer in, remembering what I told you last year, which was definitely not what happened, i.e., we had the same view on the macro, which was probably better because I don't think that this reduction in production capacities are good news -- the opposite.  But at the same time it proved that you can be wrong in terms of short-term, but for a company having a long-term view and when we decide today to have a project being developed, it's for 2014, 2015.  So what counts is the price in 2014.</p>
          <p>Now, it's true that we need the cash today to be able to sustain those investments.  So it's not a question of what will be the price in 2014, 2015.  Then I can tell you, I can come back in London or wherever you want, can tell you the price will be high, especially the crisis, as you say, as I say, might be I would say more drastic that what we expected it to be only three or four months ago.  So our only chance today is we have a strong balance sheet, as I told you, I show you all the flexibility we have with Sanofi, with our gearing, with reducing our costs to facing difficult days being 2009, 2010.</p>
          <p>Now, of course if it goes to more, then we will have probably to restart thinking.  That will be in my view the worst case, which mean that we will have to cut investments.  And I assure you that we have the potential for this.  But for me it should be the last thing to do because definitely that's where you start losing money.  So it's very important that we make sure. That's why we need to be very cautious, that's why the company will be more than ever, I would say centralized for all the decision-making process, to make sure that we control all of our criteria for investing, for divesting, et cetera.  But for the time being, and especially as far as next year is concerned, I can tell you, I'll be pleased to meet you again in London, with probably the same scenario.</p>
          <p>If the price of oil goes lower, doesn't change, it means that it will go higher.  My concern will be much more for the time being.  To be very honest, the black scenario is the economy remains gloomy, but because of this lack of production capacity, we start to see an increasing price of oil at a time where the economy is still not ready to swallow it.  Because that's something I didn't say, but which makes sense.  Today we don't like $40 or 44, but our customers like it.  The world likes it.  And today we would be at 100, I don't know what will be my problem, and our problem, but will be extremely difficult.</p>
          <p>So don't think it will be good news, it will mean taxes, it will mean problems of what are you doing to help the others, everything we don't like.  So today to a certain extent to have a price at this level for a period of time is probably not too bad.  If it lasts too long, that's another problem and we will re-discuss it in two years' time in London.</p>

          <p>Hi, Paul Spedding from HSBC.  Not all of your partners in the Upstream around the world are as financially strong as you. Have you come across circumstances where you want to spend and they either can't or don't need to, and if that happens what do you do about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks God all of our partners don't have the same strength. By the way, certain of our partners have disappeared.  I was talking about those who were, let's say, doing a lot of bad for the industry and not being serious, but they were there and it was part of our concern.  But we're not hearing anymore, are you still scared about Chinese, about Russians, about those P.O. boxes which were effectively being a strong concern to the energy companies.</p>
          <p>Now yes, there will be a lack of investment and that's the reason why we are embarrassed, because it's not the big companies or big oil which will be able to cover all of this.  We don't want to carry the share of others; that's important because I mean at the same time, we have to face our own investment.  We don't want to face the investment of others.  Give it &#x2013; is it giving opportunities for Total in terms of doing a bigger operation than UTS, the answer is probably yes, but it's too early. I don't want to restart what has been done yesterday which means six months ago, where after my say that we will need more reserves not only through exploration, but through acquisitions. The result has been Total is going to buy I don't know what.</p>
          <p>That's not the case for the time being.  We need to be cautious about the medium short-term.  At the same time, and that's the way to answer to the last question, if this crisis lasts longer, the opportunities will be bigger.  At the same time, even if I know we never buy at the lowest and we never sell at the highest, there is still a potential for lower prices.  So at the same time, to keep our freedom in terms of liquidity and to make sure that we can do things when we want and when we see a brighter future for the oil price, I think we have time.</p>

          <p>Mark Lanotti, Merrill Lynch.  Over the years, your investment policy's been clearly oriented to growing your Upstream exposure, but you have shown with Jubail and with Port Arthur that you are prepared to make growth investment in refining and in the Downstream businesses when you think you can make money.  It seems to me that -- and in your own comments -- that there's possibly more opportunities to buy distressed companies or assets in the Downstream area over the coming months. Would you consider Downstream M&amp;A as some other part of your inorganic growth strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely no.  But Jubail is a good project.  Blah blah blah.  If it is distress it's because it's not good.  The one who are good are still not distress and we consider Jubail as a very good opportunity for the growth of Total for all the reasons we have already said, but frankly it's not because it's cheap, that it's good to buy. And I have an old experience, which is also I can say it, we've been acquiring power plants in Argentina which were 50% less than the price of six months before.  Unfortunately it was 50% more than the three months after, so in fact the bad idea was to be in the electricity business in Argentina, whatever the price.</p>

          <p>Tim Whittaker, Barclays Capital.  In the last few years unit costs capital in operating the Upstream doubled or even more than doubled. You say you're targeting 0.8 billion cost reduction in the Upstream, but how much of that doubling of cost of the last few years do you think you could reclaim as costs come down in the service industry and raw materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will have to go on the step-by-step basis.  Today, for instance, if you take steel, steel represent roughly 14% of our cost. If you are capable to reduce this by 50% we have already 6 to 7% decrease, which is tremendous.  The problem then that we start seeing that steel is steel but it's not the same steel.  You will ask one of us after this conference, he will tell you our contractors are good to tell you that it's steel, but not steel.  This quality of steel is not at all to be considered as to be reduced.</p>
          <p>But I mean essentially, this is obvious that all the commodity prices have to be in our new cost.  At the same time, the target normally we have is to say, in 2006 we were roughly at $70.  So being today at 40, we should have prices below this.  It's not true, because in between we have been asking our contractors, we have asked for ourselves to be more efficient to increase HSC regulations, to be more concerned about the environment, to be more efficient, and that has a cost.  So you cannot go back to the time where the price of oil were the same.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I consider that step-by-step, especially the price of oil remain low, for the time being contractors, they are doing what we're doing.  To say, ah! Because, I mean, what I'm presenting, they have it.  And since I believe in higher price of oil in the three, four years to come.  So why should we rush? That's where they have a problem, because we will not wait, and we will tell them you decrease or we delay.  But at the same time, how long will it take? I don't know.  I would say 20% to start with is a minimum and we might have to go to a further decrease.</p>
          <p>But I mean, I would prefer to do it through negotiations than through arm twisting. Remember the period of arm twisting in the '90s? The result has been a disaster.  We have been killing so many contractors that part of the reasons of inflation we faced recently is the fact that we don't have enough competition, we don't have enough skills, and we have to be careful not to restart this.  But at the same time, we know that they have room for reducing their cost, they have to share it with us.</p>
          <p>And definitely it's going to be one of our first priority for this first half of 2009, i.e., not only delaying projects, but opening discussions as we've already started and telling them, okay, what can we get from this part, what can we do to help you to decrease your cost, that's where I said let's maybe be a little bit less intelligent, try to do to have some more carbon-copies projects even if I know it's not as easy than this, but definitely there is room for win-win.</p>
          <p>Because today, as I said last year and it's more valid than ever, there have been a lot of money lost which was not been for the benefit of contractors and not for the benefit of companies. It's now time to find a solution, and again it's probably more than &#x20AC;800 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. Two questions, just following on from your CapEx comments, you seem to mention in the presentation about FPSO trends and steel trends. You didn't mention much about drilling costs which are obviously a significant part of your profile going forward given your deep water developments. Maybe some comments on where you see drilling rates moving over the next few years in the deep water.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on diesel, if you look at your demand profiles for this year, they look reasonably drastic, and yet the diesel cracks are holding up pretty well.  How much of a concern is it to you in 2009 that if the diesel crack fails and drops dramatically that your Downstream business and the earnings from that will drop dramatically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you go back to slide number 16 -- okay, you have a split in the operated CapEx between the drilling cost, supervision and engineering.  And so to help you, the construction and other, it's 20%; drilling, 29; supervision and engineering, 14; and the equipment, 37, out of which 14 or 13 for steel.  So, it's obvious that we will not get the same reduction in all those areas.</p>
          <p>And we start by steel, because it's easy to say what is the cost. By the way, they're using a lot of oil and gas.  It's also easy to say, it has been dropping.  So, that's where we can probably make the quicker benefit.</p>
          <p>Definitely, drilling is the next.  Why?  Because, I mean there have been a lot of rigs already stopped.  The problem depends where.  And if you go to the ultra deep, where there is still strong demand -- and recently one of our competitors, we know exactly at which price he has been acquiring a long-term contract for a rig &#x2013; it's still very high.  And I've been discussing with the owner.  They are considering to reduce the cost, but they will doing in a way just like most people are doing now, seeing what is the real impact on reduced demand.  So if they see the demand reducing, they will do it, otherwise, being a high-tech, they will try to keep on.</p>
          <p>For all the rigs being onshore or very conventional, there will be a huge drop and it's already starting.  And there you can find reduction up to 50% already.  Now it's not those who are having the most impact in our books; the one which are important is when we drill in Angola, in Nigeria, and those are still very high.  On exploration, as I told you, the rigs for exploration, these are getting lower and lower and quickly.  So that they are worried that companies will start reducing their exploration program.</p>
          <p>So again, it's to be taken one by one and to see one by one how we can make it.  But for the rigs, it's definitely clear that today for a rig of first-class ultra deep water, it's above 700,000 barrel &#x2013; barrel? &#x2013; dollars per day, which is definitely too high.  If I can take risk, I hope we could reduce it to 500; afterwards it's going to be probably difficult.  But it's really to answer into details.  And I should say for contractors, 200. It's better in terms of message.</p>
          <p>But the same times, it's stupid to say things which we know cannot happen. I mean, the technology in those new rigs is unbelievable and we need 50.  We need also to have rigs which can be moved quickly.  We also &#x2013; rigs who  can drill quickly.  And we have to remember, the cost of a rig is not only the per-day fee, it's also the numbers of day you need to drill.  And if you can reduce by one month, well, I can tell you it has more impact than reducing the fees.</p>
          <p>On the diesel crack, that's really a crack, because today, as you know it's exactly what is making the profit of refiners and especially and by definition in Europe.  When we see what has been done recently in terms of lower demand, there's still such a lack in diesel that we cannot say at least with the foreseeable future how we could go to a point where this demand will be lower and be a problem for doing what we have today, a good margin.  The risk, again, is much more on the outlet for gasoline.  And if we cannot find ways to reduce the gasoline portion, then the only chance is to reduce the production of the refinery.  And then, then we have a problem with the diesel too.</p>
          <p>So that's why we are fighting on finding outlets for gasoline and that's where our trading division -- people are always thinking of traders as being just trying to make money on short-term and taking the benefit of the contango. Even if we can continue on this, we like it.  But they also are quite good, for instance our desk in Geneva, they are extremely active on finding outlets for our extra gasoline surpluses.</p>
          <p>And it's also the benefit of having a large marketing outlet. Total by itself has its own capacity for using gasoline, for instance in Africa where diesel is not a real trend, at least for the time being.  So I'm not so &#x2013; I'm concerned about still the fact that the U.S. might go even lower in the demand.  But I'm not so scared since I see that we have the capacity for the time being to find outlets for this gasoline outside of the United States.  So, for the diesel crack, it's not a problem.  For reforming, that's still a big concern.</p>
          <p>Topping by the way at the present time is very good -- surprise, surprise -- short-term.</p>

          <p>Hi. it's Henry, Macquarie.  You said earlier that OPEC cuts have obviously come into effect. Now, can you say what you've actually seen in terms of reduction in your own production in OPEC countries, how much you built into your expectations for 2009 in terms of OPEC reductions?  And secondly, you mentioned partners in terms of a potential issue. Can you talk about what you're seeing with the NOCs in terms of their ability to fund projects where they have a share, and I'm thinking perhaps particularly of Gazprom with Shtokman?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>Those meetings are always too long, Jerome.  That's why it's called Jerome style.  You have the answer:  We don't know today. I mean, definitely what is important to keep in mind is most of our OPEC productions are fixed margin, which means, very small, especially in the Emirates.  And they are the best to respect the OPEC quotas.  So, it has an impact on our production.  But it will have a little impact on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>The others are Nigeria and Venezuela. Fortunately they find other ways to reduce their production without using the quotas.  That's not good news, but it's part of the problem we faced in 2008 and we still consider has to be faced in 2009, i.e., linked with the unsecurity in the Delta.</p>
          <p>The questions will be much more on Libya, Angola, where it's a little bit more than a fixed margin and where definitely it's going to have an impact on our profits.  For the time being, it's not quite clear of what exactly what will be their cut and what will be the impact on our production.  But I can tell you as far as when we will know, we will make it official. There is no reason to keep this secrets, it's to be known by everybody.</p>
          <p>At the same time, even if it was not your question, as part of the answer, it's good news that they are committed to their reduction. Because at the end of the day, as we try to prove it here, it's a main reason why the price of oil is still at 44 and not below was that OPEC can tell you it will be far below. So that's for those who still have this concern about the existence of OPEC.</p>
          <p>You had another one? Yeah.  Yeah.  I know you would be even more specific.  Well, for the time being, very clearly, Gazprom has said that they will and want to keep Shtokman on the priority list and they've insisted and made a statement recently -- I didn't ask for it -- that Shtokman will not be delayed for questions of financing.  It's good news as far as exactly the views of Total and Statoil, they've announced that the FID date will be delayed to early 2010 which was not a scoop, especially for those who have been traveling with us recently.  That was already our internal forecast, but afterwards I cannot tell you more.</p>
          <p>Russia, they don't have money, but if they want they have money, i.e., Shtokman is a priority not because it's Shtokman, it's because they need additional oil and new gas to be developed and produced.  So, until further notice, we don't stop anything, we have voted on the budget, we are starting to spend quite a lot of money for the pre-studies, basic engineering, the logistic, the place where the LNG plant is going to be installed.  So, there is no sign of anything linked with shortage of financing.  Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  It's Jon Rigby from UBS.  Two questions.  The first actually is on the balance sheet and it's about debt.  Do you carry most of your debt in U.S. Dollars? If you don't or do, has that changed over the last year or so?  It wasn't apparent to me looking at the accounts there was a great deal of impact of FX differences this quarter although dollar-euro's clearly moved a lot.  And, also, related to the Sanofi stake, I'd always worked under the assumption that your kind of debt levels or target debt levels would actually start to fall as Sanofi was sold, as you regarded Sanofi as quasi-debt &#x2013; quasi-financing or quasi-cash, I should say.</p>
          <p>The second question &#x2013; that was a two-part first question.  The second question is to do with the FID process, actually.  You've got quite a few very large projects, Shtokman being one of them I guess, coming up at the end of the year, and I think we've already explored the fact that oil prices potentially could be still low at the end of the year. Within Total, what happens if you're forced to rethink or to delay? Do you sort of warm-stack that project, do you send it back? If you stop it, is there a period of time you essentially knock it back a year or two years because you've got to take people off the project and then bring it back on again?</p>
          <p>So, what I am saying is, if you say no, not right now, is it automatically delayed by let's say a year or 18 months or two years just simply because you de-mobilize people and then have to bring them back on the project later, if that's clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very clear.  I will leave you &#x2013; first, can you start with the dollar/euro issue?</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Our debt is today denominated in Euro in floating rates. The last issue we have made in January was a $1 billion fixed-rate, ten years, 4.25%. We will try and do more dollar-dominated fixed-rate bond issue and we will tap the market when the market will be open for that.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea, another AA  French company, which I won't give you the name, tapped the market roughly at the same time than us and issue at 6.5% when we issue at 4.25.  So, we had rather to survey.  So we try to do it opportunistically, I would say, and we will do it over this year.  This year, we will issue about 5 to 6 billion maybe half dollar, half euro.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; that's OK, Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And about the Sanofi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sanofi? I will answer because &#x2013; I mean, he's a Board member.  So, might be embarrassed.  I'm not sure he will be embarrassed.  I hope not.</p>
          <p>Well, I mean, as you know, we've not only said we have sold already large numbers of shares in 2008, roughly &#x20AC;1.1 billion, and our strategy is to sell the remaining part in roughly three time -- in three years.  So, to help you, it's at the today's stock price it's almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion per year.  So, our intent is keep it like this and no intention to speed up the process.  We don't want as I told you last time to impact the market.  We still want to do this smoothly without hurting the share value.</p>
          <p>Apparently we has been successful.  Please take it as a joke, it is one, but -- I mean, when we sell, the stock price is increasing.  So, I don't -- this &#x2013; but, we will continue and we are continuing.  And, as you've seen in our 2009 target, is &#x20AC;2.5 billion sale. Now, part of our flexibilities could be effectively to increase the sale of our Sanofi shares, then we will see how we do it because definitely as far as we don't want to hurt the share value, if we go at that level it will be difficult to do it in a way which is not hurting.  So, we might have to consider other ways.  But it's not at all something which we have in mind for the time being.</p>
          <p>On your other question, which is as usual very sensitive but professional, of course we cannot just delay and delay and we cannot keep teams forever even if we are quite good to wait if it's needed. So we've been doing it in -- for different project, for instance Dalia, even if we were forced to delay, but it proved that when it's necessary, it can be done.</p>
          <p>So, if we take the example of a project where the FID is to be decided, two reasons. First one is there is a big shock in the oil price where we see that the reason to be optimistic for the medium-term is not there.  Frankly, as far as Shtokman is concerned, with the production being in 2014 plus, that's not our concern.  The concern would be if at that time we arrive with incapacity to have a project, the cost of project, which is sustainable with our long-term plan, which is as you know still around $80 per barrel. And that could be the reason to delay is to say this project is not economical, not because of the price of oil being $40 but because of the price of oil is &#x2013; sorry, the cost of the project is too high even with 80.  And then it's part of life.  I mean if it's not economical, we will not do it.  In that case, it'd be more than a delay.  Might be just to say that doesn't work, and that's very rare but it can happen.</p>
          <p>The third option would be that still because of very low price of oil, we don't have sufficient cash.  Frankly that's not at all today something we foresee as a concern.  So the risk is the project not being economical based on normal conditions, which are not $40 but much more around 80.  And as far as the project is not at the level of being sufficiently studied, I cannot give you the answer, but it's much more the reason would be this project is not economical and we have to delay it to restructure it, to rethink it, to make it smaller, I don't know.</p>
          <p>But definitely that will not be based on the fact that the price of oil is at this present time too low.  That will not be the reason for delaying a project like this.  And it's true, project as the cost if you delay it in keeping all the teams in place, so we will do certainly our best efforts to make sure that before all the teams are in place we are sure that we can move, otherwise we will not do it.  As you know, the FID is taken before the teams are in place.  We have to make sure that we have the teams available, but they are not in place before we start to launch a project.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you for taking my question.  Do we get to follow-up on that about project cost. Back in September you said that tar sands wouldn't work below $90 a barrel.  In the slide today, you show a broken line with downward arrows.  You've been talking about attacking potential cost deflation across the industry.  And given the fact that cost inflation was almost certainly the highest in tar sands projects in recent years, I think it's perhaps fair to assume that the costs are going to fall the quickest the furthest in tar sands.  So, I just wondered if you could perhaps give us your best estimate of where that break even oil price could go to once the system reaches equilibrium? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On this slide, as you know, we have signals to say that the break even has to decrease with costs, but I mean to what level, it's frankly too early to say.  But, what I can tell you is we have totally and dramatically to change the way of operating in this part of the world.  This &#x2013; and that's sometimes good thing with crisis, it helps people to become intelligent before being clever, i.e., just to think that you can be in this part of the world doing things by yourself, having your own upgrader, doing things just like if it was a small field in Arizona, that was stupid.  We tried to make it clear for everybody.</p>
          <p>Apparently, we had to face problem, like Shell decided to stop the phase of its big project, that ourselves we're facing concerns as you know with Chermont which is not developed as quickly as we expected it to be in the past and that will be the same with Rosslyn.  So, the intent clearly nowadays is to think differently, is to see how we can have operators to be operated for different projects, how we can, in respecting the laws, right? Nothing in the laws would say that you have to be stupid to be so-called in competition if the result of competition is higher prices. I refuse this notion.</p>
          <p>I think we have now to build between partners the best way to see how we can develop those fields in a way which is not hurting all of us and at the end of the day destroying the economy.  I don't know if you've heard about what's going on in Fort McMurray, but you see now people leaving, et cetera.  That is the opposite of six months ago where we were short of skills.  So we go from too much to not enough.  I think we can do things and that's what we are doing.  That's part of our strategy with UTS and Petro-Canada is to think differently.  That's what we're doing with ConocoPhillips too, and that's going to be certainly the best way to reduce cost.</p>
          <p>And thank you, I mean for this question.  I mean, it was good to take it at the end because when we said that we want to see different ways of working between partners, that was not only partners in terms of producing countries, it was also partners in terms of classical partners and Canada is probably the example where the Big Oil has to prove that they can do it in different way.  Because otherwise it will be even more delayed than the 89 or whatever will be even less, because remember that in those figures we have in capacities we have the heavy oil of Athabasca, and today we don't see them coming.  So we need to definitely do it in different way and that's already underway.</p>
          <p>So for Total, one of the reason we go to this UTS project is to see how we can today not swap but emphasize the capacity to develop a field which is probably easier to develop in a relatively short term versus our other projects, which will probably take more time to be developed.  So at the same time, it's not only delaying, it's finding solutions like the Foothills development, not as a substitution but as a way to come quicker on production than with the traditional big mine reserves.</p>

          <p>I don't know if you have read the Canadian authorities begin to be frightened by what's going on, and they are rethinking of the full regime of royalties right now. Because it went too far and all the projects are stopped for them and so they are rethinking of the full regime of royalties which has been hitting very hardly the economics of the projects.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We remember when we were talking in this place on those projects, they were four times cheaper that what we've seen last year.  So that's not only inflation.  So definitely we need to cut here the cost not by 20% or by 30, it's much more than this.</p>
