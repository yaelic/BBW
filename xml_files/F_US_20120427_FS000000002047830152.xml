          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter Ford Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is Deanna and I'll be the operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Sean Ryan, Manager, Fixed Income Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Deanna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. With me this morning are Michael Seneski, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer, and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including Stuart Rowley, who recently took over for Bob Shanks as Ford Vice President and Controller; Marion Harris, Assistant Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting; and George Sharp, Executive Director Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a few items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slide we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's investor and media websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean. As mentioned in the call last quarter, we've made some changes to the fixed income presentation. The most significant change we made was removing the first several Automotive-related slides. These slides are still available in the earnings presentation and as Sean mentioned, Stuart Rowley is here to assist with the Q&amp;A session after the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the updated presentation, we'll cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss performance, funding and liquidity highlights, Automotive cash debt and liquidity, and we'll wrap things up with a summary of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's start off with Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide 2. Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $452 million and net income of $295 million. Managed receivables were $86 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $1 billion from year end 2011, primarily driven by higher Ford and Lincoln receivables, and favorable exchange rates.</p>
          <p>When it comes to credit losses, we've had several consecutive quarters at or near historic lows. First quarter charge-offs were $35 million, down from $55 million in 2011. And the lost receivables ratio was 17 basis points. At March 31, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $479 million or 55 basis points of receivables. We continued our strong support of Ford, paying distributions of $200 million. Managed leverage was 8.1 to 1 at March 31, compared to 8.3 to 1 at December 31. At the end of the first quarter, our equity was $9.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 3 shows the $261 million decrease in first quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. In line with our expectations, the results are explained primarily by fewer lease terminations, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, as well as lower financing margin and lower credit loss reserve reductions. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit decreased by $54 million compared with the fourth quarter, more than explained by lower financing margin.</p>
          <p>Consistent with prior guidance, Ford Credit expects to be solidly profitable for full year 2012, but at a lower level in 2011, reflecting primarily the same factors impacting our quarterly results. We project full year pre-tax profits of about $1.5 billion. Ford Credit expects to pay total distributions in 2012 of between $500 million and $1 billion. And at year end 2012, we anticipate managed receivables to be in the range of $85 billion to $95 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 4 shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss-to-receivables ratios, and credit loss reserve. Our first quarter credit losses continued to be at historically low levels. Charge-offs were $35 million, down $20 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting lower repossessions in the United States. Charge-offs were down $17 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting the same factor just mentioned. The credit loss reserve was $479 million, down $265 million from a year ago, and down $55 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting the same decrease in charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. retail and lease business, which comprises about 70% of our global consumer portfolio. Over 60-day delinquencies were 12 basis points in the first quarter, down four basis points from the same period a year ago. Repossessions in the first quarter were 9,000 units or 1.54% of average accounts outstanding. Severity, at $6,700 in the first quarter, was $200 higher than the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting a change to include certain repossession expenses and charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Excluding this change, severity was actually down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by improvements in the used car auction values. As discussed on the prior slide, charge-offs and LTRs have declined on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis due to lower repossessions.</p>
          <p>Slide 6 shows the U.S. lease residual performance. You'll note that we have added auction value data for our 24-month contracts returned in the first quarter, as we are starting to see more relevant return volume. As we've been highlighting for the past several quarters, lease return volumes in the first quarter were 37% lower than the same period last year, reflecting primarily the lower lease placements in 2009.</p>
          <p>The first quarter lease return rate was 66%, up four points compared with the same period last year and up eight points compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase reflects a higher mix of 24-month contracts, which typically have higher return rates than longer-term contracts.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our strong auction values for 36-month vehicles continued, up $75 a unit from the same period last year and up $250 a unit from the fourth quarter. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $11.1 billion at year end 2011.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 7, we are on track to achieve our 2012 funding plan. In the first quarter, we completed $8 billion of funding in the public markets and an additional $2 billion has been done in April. Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification. We continue to develop new products and platforms and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and investors.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we launched an unsecured commercial paper program in the U.S. and at quarter end, we had over $200 million outstanding. This program is unrated and is not supported directly by bank lines. We ended the quarter with about $33 billion of committed capacity, renewing about $2 billion during the first quarter. Our liquidity remains strong and we will maintain cash balances in committed capacity that meet our business and funding requirements in all our global markets.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased with Fitch's decision this week to upgrade us to BBB minus, which is one notch into the investment grade territory. It is an important proof point of the continued progress that we have made on our One Ford plan. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on achieving strong investment-grade ratings and maintaining investment grade throughout in economic cycle.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 shows our trends and funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the first quarter, managed receivables were $86 billion. We ended the quarter with $12 billion in cash and securitized funding was 54% of managed receivables. We are projecting 2012 year end managed receivables in the range of $85 billion to $95 billion and securitized funding is expected to represent 49% to 54% of total managed receivables. The lower end of this range reflects in part the FUEL Notes converting to unsecured debt. It is our expectation that securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables will decline as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 shows our 2012 public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs. Year-to-date, we've completed $10 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including over $3 billion of unsecured debt. This reflects about half of our public term funding needs for the year.</p>
          <p>We project full year public term funding in the range of $18 billion to $23 billion, consisting of $8 billion to $11 billion of unsecured debt and $10 billion to $12 billion of public securitization, and both of these are consistent with our prior quarter's guidance. Compared to previous fixed-income presentations, we have removed references to our private issuances. Details of our private conduit utilization are now shown as part of the next slide.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, our liquidity remains strong at $18 billion, up $1 billion from year end. You'll see that we have revised this slide to more clearly display our sources and utilization of liquidity which now includes references to our prior quarter. Ford Credit sources of liquidity include cash, unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and other asset-backed bank capacity.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, we had $44.8 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, which are diversified across a variety of markets and asset platforms. During the quarter, the increase in conduits and bank ABS capacity largely offset the reduction in our FCAR bank lines.</p>
          <p>The utilization of our liquidity totaled $22.3 billion at quarter end. The reduction utilization during the quarter was primarily attributable to higher public funding. We ended the quarter with gross liquidity of $22.5 billion which includes about $4.5 billion of capacity in excess of eligible receivables.</p>
          <p>Providing a funding source for future origination and flexibility to transfer capacity among markets and asset classes where most needed. And as we have mentioned previously, our liquidity remains strong and we are focused on maintaining these levels that meet our business and funding requirements in all market conditions.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Automotive sector, slide 11 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt positions at the end of the first quarter. Automotive debt was $13.7 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $13.1 billion at year end 2011. The change reflects primarily the continued draw-down of the Department of Energy loans which will continue through the third quarter as well as our inaugurate issue of our renminbi debt issuance done in Hong Kong to support our operations in China. This is consistent with our plan to achieve debt levels of approximately $10 billion by mid decade.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.3 billion and strong Automotive liquidity of $32.9 billion. Our liquidity includes the recently completed amend and extend of our revolving credit facility, which resulted in $9 billion of commitments being extended to November 2015 and $300 million remaining until November of 2013.</p>
          <p>And now let's conclude with a summary of the first quarter. As detailed in the earnings presentation earlier this morning, Ford delivered our 11th consecutive quarterly pre-tax operating profit, a total of $2.3 billion, and generated $1.4 billion of net income. We successful amended and extended our revolving credit facility by two years to 2015, and we ended the quarter with Automotive net cash of $9.3 billion and Automotive liquidity of $32.9 billion.</p>
          <p>With regards to Ford Credit, Ford Credit had a strong first quarter, with pre-tax operating profit of $452 million. Managed receivables grew slightly since year end with a total of $86 billion. Credit losses continued at historically low levels and used car auction values remained strong. Ford Credit successfully launched an unrated, unsecured commercial paper program in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, Ford Credit has completed $10 billion of funding, making significant progress on this year's funding plan. The credit company continued to support Ford's business with a $200 million in distributions during the first quarter. The total distributions this year are still expected to be in the $500 million to $1 billion level. Ford Credit's liquidity was $18 billion at the end of the year which is in addition to Ford's liquidity at $33 billion. And as I mentioned before, we are very pleased with the rating action this week by Fitch.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn it to Sean who will begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil. With that, we'll start the question and answer session. Deanna, can we please have the first question?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Doug Karson, Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, guys. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question on the overall earnings of $452 million. It's a little bit higher than the run rate that I had modeled based on kind of some of the discussions kind of towards the end of last year that we were going to have some challenges with lease residual or credit losses that we were not going to be able to like run through again. Could you just kind of give us a little bit of a map for the rest of the year, if possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, it's Mike. Well, as we've indicated, last year we made about $2.4 billion in total. And in that $2.4 billion, there was about $800 million related to credit and lease factors that we said weren't really going to be that material this year. And in addition, we said that we'd see a little bit of margin pressure that wouldn't be offset by volume. This quarter we've actually clarified that to say that we expect to see in total about a profit level of about $1.5 billion this year.</p>
          <p>I think the key thing that's going to show the calendarization as we go through the next couple of quarters will be the lease terminations. We were down 20-some-odd thousand terminations this year versus last year, and you'll see that continue again into the next quarter before it really starts to level off. So I think if you take the first quarter and we've said where we're going to be at year end, you can probably figure out math to get the rest of the way there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Question on slide 4, the loss-to-receivables ratio of 0.17%, I think that's the lowest that I've maybe ever seen it. What's driving that? And are you potentially almost running the portfolio too conservatively, maybe missing some opportunities to have such a low loss-to-receivable ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's been a few quarters in a row now where I keep saying geez, isn't this a low number and it keeps getting lower. Let me start off by saying Ford Credit has not changed any of its underwriting practices, and we are continuing to buy a full spread of business. In fact if you look at the data, three out of every four customers who buy a Ford product are financed by Ford Credit.</p>
          <p>And so as Ford is growing and as you're seeing more lower FICO people coming in, we're buying three out of every four of them. So we believe that we have a very good spread of the business. That said, customers are paying their bills and I've said it before, the analogy I use is that you can sleep in your car, but you can't drive your house to work, and now we're seeing that backed up with actual data.</p>
          <p>One of the credit agencies actually published an article last week where they looked at consumer behavior. And whereas a couple years ago, it was between mortgages and credit cards that were ranked as the most important bills to pay off, now it's very clear that cars and autos are the most important bills to pay off. So we've seen this fundamental sea change in the way the customer is behaving and the portfolio's continuing to perform well, not just in the United States but around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess some of the cap structure's funding on slide 9, it looks like the unsecured forecast of $8 billion to $11 billion is a tick up from 2011. If we get Moody's to move here and we get a IG rating, right now like your five-year bonds are trading around 3.5%. Could we see the unsecured portion of that funding plan go higher relative to securitization? Just trying to get the balance sheet kind of less securitized if we get spreads of let's say, through 200?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, this is Neil. And I think from the standpoint of the range we have, from $8 billion to $11 billion really covers the range I think from the standpoint of depending on where spreads are and when we get that second rating. So I think we've got it covered within the range we've got here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that $3 billion there, okay. And then finally, I may have missed this on the earlier call with Ford, but it looks like you made a $200 million distribution up to Ford. Does &#x2013; is there any way to triangulate like what we're looking for for a year for distributions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we said, Doug, is that we'd expect somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay, that's great. Thanks, guys. That's it for me.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple things, first off, can I clarify a few things from the call this morning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at your North American pre-tax merchant target of 8% to 10% in mid decade, is that a target or a benchmark? And the difference being a target you expect to reach, a benchmark you expect to exceed. Or in other words, is your compensation &#x2013; is that related to your compensation, that target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Stuart Rowley. That &#x2013; we characterize that as our outlook or our mid decade guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it your intention to say that margins have peaked and you expect them to go down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as Bob Shanks commented this morning, on a quarterly basis, our results move around, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I know that &#x2013; no, I know on a quarterly base they do. But if you're looking at mid decade, I think the Street is interpreting that your margins right now have peaked and they're going to go down. And I don't think that's what you're trying to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; our guidance for this year is that our North American margins will be significantly higher than 2011, which was at 8.3%. And we &#x2013; that guidance remains, as does our mid decade guidance for North America of 8% to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is that mid decade guidance of 8% to 10%, is that part of your long-term compensation formula?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second thing, is there anything unusual as you &#x2013; one of the other hang ups on the call earlier was that, it was just unusual for the year to see the second half stronger than the first half. Is there anything unusual from a structural standpoint that changes the movement throughout the course of the year from Q1 to Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as I think we discussed this morning, particularly the cadence of our product launches, which can be different year to year, this year leads us towards a stronger second half than the first half, which is not normal on an historic basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

          <p>We don't believe that that's something that necessarily repeats into forward years. They will be driven by calendarization factors within the year that in play in those forward years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But there's nothing structural that shifts the historical pattern from Q1 to Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't believe so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the last question as it relates to cash priorities, is there anything in your debt covenants or anything else that prevents the board from either increasing the dividend or doing anything else with the dividend as you go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, this is Neil. The only thing we have that's in a secured facility is limitations from a standpoint of the size and the amount of dividends, but it's an analytically derived based on the cash generation. So there's lots of room in that covenant, and that covenant goes away once we go unsecured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it does, okay. Thank you. I really appreciate it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby, Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys, and congrats on Fitch upgrade. Just two quick questions. You got a lot of them on the earnings call, but one with the news that you did this $200 million in unsecured commercial paper. Did I hear correctly, it's not back-stopped, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Again, it doesn't have specific lines dedicated to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is the goal &#x2013; obviously full IG and then hopefully more upgrades down the road, but is the goal to grow the CP program and presumably at that point, you would probably have to back-stop it or at some point back-stop it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we would clearly want to continue to develop all our sources and with higher ratings, it gives us more flexibility to grow the CP program as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'll try in a second question, I know you guys don't give guidance on cash flow, other than you do expect it to be strong. But I do appreciate the fact that you gave more specific guidance on Ford Credit but I'm going to shoot for it on cash flow. But can you &#x2013; I mean you've given us what CapEx will be, you're giving us just overall where Automotive in total pre-tax profits for the company will be.</p>
          <p>Can you kind of give us a framework for how to think about what are the major puts and takes on cash flow? Because it appears you're going to be spending more on pension contributions, it looks like cash flow will be down. But what is I guess the biggest push and take on cash flow, away from the numbers you've already given us? I mean is it &#x2013; do you think you'll be a user of working capital this year?</p>
          <p>Or any type of maybe a little bit more specifics on the cash flow because you're going to be paying down debt I presume at the end of this year, some of that DOE loans, so I'm trying to get a framework for how much free cash you'll have after pension, after CapEx, before dividends from Ford Credit? So any type of color you can give there would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; and, Brian, I think you've got the bulk of the individual items when you think about Automotive after-tax and then you've got CapEx less depreciation. Working capital, I wouldn't expect a whole lot of change to it. It is volume dependent though, as you've seen, you tend to &#x2013; as volume goes up versus down you get different changes there. Pension, we've given you the amount of pension contributions we're going to have full year at $3.8 billion, $3.5 billion on the funded programs.</p>
          <p>Debt from the standpoint of the DOE loans will continue to draw through the third quarter and then in September, it starts to pay down over a 10-year period. So I think you've got the bulk of the major items. Mike has given you the guidance on what kind of cash you should expect from Ford Credit coming over. So I think you've got the bulk of the items to get pretty close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So working capital you &#x2013; I mean about this &#x2013; I mean, you did $300 million as a source. So you're saying roughly kind of in that range or give or take $100 million type of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think what I meant to say was essentially there wouldn't be a whole lot of change in working capital during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is &#x2013; it'll go month to month and quarter to quarter depending on the volume in that quarter, because obviously the payables have some impact accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. That's it for me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Eric Selle, JPMorgan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, I like that intonation. Hey, Mike, how's the clavicle? You all healed up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, not only a broken clavicle, but then rotator cuff on the other side. Both arms are...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Geez, I'm sorry to hear that. Hey, just to clarify one of Brian's questions. The dividend, you said $0.5 billion to $1 billion. The tax reconciliation, should we assume that's about the same as last year? Meaning the capital transfers from Ford Credit are going to be about $2 billion for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. On taxes, Eric, what we guided is that we'll be about 33% or so in our total tax rate for Ford Credit. And you've seen the last couple of years' tax payments from Ford Credit of about $1.4 billion in the last couple of years. This year, we paid $100 million in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect tax payments to be material going out. As our lease portfolio grows, obviously there's a different tax treatment for lease depreciation, so I wouldn't count on many tax payments going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So then half to full is probably good for the year. And then just going around the globe just to get some color, obviously everybody is trying to dust off their crystal ball but &#x2013; and if you don't mind, just go to every region. Europe, how do you guys characterize Europe? Is it still getting worse? Have we found a bottom? Do you guys foresee a bottom this year? I know you got austerity on the horizon. But when you look at your dealer traffic, the price environment, how do you characterize that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, you're speaking specifically about Auto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, Eric, this is Stuart. As we commented earlier, the first quarter SAAR at 14.1 was a 17-year low and significantly below any of the quarters of last year. So the industry has dropped significantly and you saw that come through in our results in terms of wholesales and as we took stocks lower. Going forward, we don't expect a rapid recovery from this level. We expect about this level for the year.</p>
          <p>We've guided to a 14 million SAAR for this year and then slower recovery thereafter. And within that environment, as Bob Shanks commented, we have seen &#x2013; or we have been able to manage relatively well our net pricing. We only saw a small deterioration year-on-year in net pricing in the first quarter and we're encouraged by our ability to do that and that is supported by the strong product lineup we have in Europe.</p>
          <p>And going forward, we're going to manage all elements of the business. In Europe, we continue to invest in the product and to improve our mix of products in Europe, to improve our brand, and of course work on our cost structure in what we think is a different environment than we've experienced over recent years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. That was very good. And then on South America, you sound optimistic on the back half. Three new products coming in, is that all higher transaction pricing? Because the capacity numbers you gave on the first call were somewhat scary. I think it's 2 million capacity, over 50% addition over the next three years. Is it all just getting <mark type="inaudible" /> (30:39) and rising prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the new products we have coming in South America are &#x2013; the first and important point is they're all off our global platform. So we've historically had legacy products in the market in South America and, going forward, we are integrating to our global platform. So we're &#x2013; we'll be launching the new EcoSport and the new Ranger, our two key contributors, going forward. So we expect to see better pricing off those vehicles.</p>
          <p>At the same time, you are right that we've commented that there is significant additional capacity going into the market from competitors and that will make it a more competitive environment. But, we continue to believe we will be able to get pricing for our improved product offering going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in Asia Pacific, it looked like in the first quarter you guys lagged on a volume basis. Is that a production or a distribution issue? And how long do you think it'll take to fix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we've commented that as we invest heavily in the Asia Pacific region and we launch the eight new manufacturing facilities that we're putting in place, cost growth will precede revenue growth as we launch those facilities and those products. In the first quarter that was exacerbated by some launch issues we experienced on the new Ranger that we're launching in Thailand and South Africa. We had impacts in quarter four related to the flooding in Thailand and some of the repercussions of that through the supply base continued to impact the launch in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So going to the second half of the year, we expect to be running at rate in those two facilities on Ranger and we expect that to contribute to profits. Also the new Focus that we've launched in the first quarter in our CFMA joint venture will also be on stream, and our Thai vehicle facility will also launch in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was a first quarter volume impact as a result of the Focus because of the wind-down &#x2013; or the ramp-down of the old and just starting up with the new.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And then finally just moving to North America, we have one competitor that either has a new product that's not doing as well, from Japan, a couple of other competitors with stale products. When you look at the cash incentive data, but I know that's not the complete story, are you guys seeing anything on the dealer or finance incentives that aren't being picked up in that cash incentive data that are worth mentioning? Is anybody breaking the price discipline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the data that you see accurately reflects what folks are doing. And we clearly cut back a lot in the month of April, which has increased our transaction prices at the expense, probably, of some share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Well, hey, I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Josh Lipchin, Eaton Vance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. Back to Ford Motor Credit, on &#x2013; you mentioned year end, the management portfolio could be $85 billion to $95 billion. What's going to drive that? Does managed leverage play into that at all or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's all going to be driven by asset growth consistent with the global industry increase that Bob talked about earlier. What we have said &#x2013; and we've held the range all year &#x2013; the top end of the range may be a little tough to hit with the reduction in our industry call in Europe down to about 14 million. But we think the overall range is pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where can we expect managed leverage at yearend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you'll see a significant move from where we are today. I think given what's going on in Europe we're going to slow down a little bit for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with the $1.5 billion guidance we've given on pre-tax the distributions of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in receivables of 85 to 95, you can get pretty close to our yearend leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, probably. And then last, what's going to drive that &#x2013; whether it's $1 billion or $500 million of distributions this year to the parent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are a function of our profits, of the global currency, of exchange, a number of things. And we expect to manage our business based on the asset level and the appropriate leverage there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we have a question on the line from Brian Johnson, Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I want to talk a bit about the Credit Co.'s supportive automotive company. Really two questions, one U.S. and one Europe. I'll start with Europe because it's less commonly discussed. Can you give us just a quick snapshot of your lending business in Europe? The penetration rates you have on the Ford Credit business &#x2013; on the Ford Europe sales?</p>
          <p>And then just what, given the challenging conditions in Europe, you're seeing? Are you &#x2013; both in terms of your own credit standards and credit acceptance and are you actually able to pick up sales from European players who are more dependent on their banking system and banking partners to finance their sales? And the second just U.S. kind of blind deeply and where is that going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, as it relates to Europe, our retail penetration, we have a &#x2013; we're well represented throughout Europe. We have a joint venture in the Nordic countries, but we're obviously well represented in the big five. We have about 27% retail penetration and our wholesale penetration is virtually 100%, it's like at about 98%. So we have a very strong working relationship with the Motor Company. We've been very consistent and we've actually seen a bit of a tick up in retail penetration over the last couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>As it relates to credit availability, I think the ECB just published their latest survey of lenders, which shows that credit availability still appears stable. Only 9% of 131 Eurozone banks have tightened lending conditions. Probably the weak Eurozone has subdued loan demand, and the ECB loans, it appears, have staved off some type of curtailment of lending. So overall, we're seeing kind of a stable credit availability view in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it hasn't &#x2013; but have you been &#x2013; but it sounds like captive share is up a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Captive share, if you look over time, is up a bit. And that says we work closer and closer with the Motor Company to get more people back into Ford cars and trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, Brian, from the funding side in Europe, we are continuing to continue to roll our capacity. It is also securitization market for us, as well as the unsecured side. But the securitization market is more private than it is public and we're continuing to be able to roll our capacity there, although at a little higher cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the U.S. side, any notable quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year trends in terms of the willingness or the attractiveness of buying deeper into the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned, our underwriting standards have stayed very consistent. Three out of every four subprime customers who buy a Ford are financed by Ford Credit. And it is true that we have seen an uptick in overall subprime purchases of the total automotive industry, and we participated in that because we have stayed consistent in three out of every four.</p>
          <p>Our share of Ford business in total is about 39% for retail, 79% on wholesale. And we work remarkably well together. Again, going back to what Ford Credit does, and our whole goal is to get people back into Ford cars and trucks. The Motor Company recognizes that, and we work very well together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
