          <p>Yes, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am Johan Ekwall, Head of Investor Relations. In the room here today I have our CEO, Christian Clausen; our Chief Financial Officer, Fredrik Rystedt; and our Chief Risk Officer, Carl-Johan Granvik.</p>
          <p>We will start with a short sum up of the highlights of &#x2013; in the report and the announced capital measures made by Christian Clausen, then followed by a more detailed presentations on number, and then we will have time for questions and answers. And we expect this call to be no longer than one hour or slightly less than one hour actually. Christian, please?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome to this call. I can say I'm really proud today to be able to present a very strong result for Nordea despite a difficult economic environment. I would say with a 15% ROE, Nordea is absolutely producing one of the best bank results in Europe for 2008.</p>
          <p>I'll move into the highlights if you have your presentation and say that exactly what happens in 2008 is actually that we quarter-by-quarter keep delivering on our strategies and our promises. Income is up 4%, mainly net interest income, and very much our very strong customer-driven capital market operations where a lot of activity is going on. Lending growth is up 17% in local currency, deposit volume 12%, we also saw strong increases in fourth quarter, expenses up 7%, nearly 7%, including some restructuring costs, and then the loan losses, which are increasing. It's clear that the macroeconomic slowdown is giving higher loan losses. They are coming more or less as we expect, number of small and medium-sized exposures divided between all the countries, divided between all the segments, and divided between all the sectors.</p>
          <p>Risk-adjusted profit is up 2%. Actually, it's up 3.5% excluding the Danish Guarantee Scheme from last autumn. And 3.5% is actually very close to our target set in December 2007 of 5%. I think it's worth noting that we nearly met the target we set such a long time ago without really knowing that 2008 would be one of the worst years in our history in financial terms. We've adjusted organic growth strategy, I can picture to that, and then we have the capital issue &#x2013; the capital strengthening, I will also come back to that.</p>
          <p>So for the full year, financial result is a strong one. Net interest income is extremely strong, 19%, and we have total operating income up 4%. This gives profit before loan losses of one. Operating profit went down 13, and we see risk-adjusted profit is up two. This means when compared to our target that in terms of TSR, total shareholder return, we get out at number two, and while our European peer group, last year, we went up a three. Actually, in the year before, again in '06, we were also number three. So now, we have three years in a row in top three, which I think is not that bad a performance.</p>
          <p>Risk-adjusted profit is up 60% and then, this is of course clearly lower than our target. I'll come back to that. RoE, 15, as I mentioned. And then the payout-ratio of dividends is lower to approximately half. We have the policies about 40. We give close to 20, which indicates that we like to keep our dividend policy, but still increase our capital. And then the Tier -1 ratio, which Fredrik very much will come back to.</p>
          <p>The risk-adjusted profit as I said has not reached the red line. We are &#x2013; we were above last year. Now, we are below, and we do not get quite up to the line. That is not surprising. This was meant as a long-term target, a seven-year target as we said. And the 10% yearly growth there is of course not something we can expect to reach every year. So if we in one of the worst year's in history and may be also this year get somewhat below the line, I think we're quite comfortable. And especially we have demonstrated, I think, with the result and the business momentum we have, that we think the underlying business is capable of generating growth for the magnitude needed for this target to come back when the worst part of the turmoil is over.</p>
          <p>We have an outlook statement. Some banks are coming out these days without outlook statements. We have one. The disclaimer is very big. The outlook is extremely uncertain, so we have to note that. But we are saying that we prepare for a challenging year and a negative GDP growth. The lending growth will be lower, but we also see a potential to grow more than the market. Cost growth is expected to be lower as we've managed the cost growth down and then based on the macroeconomic outlook as we have it right now, with the knowledge we see today, we anticipate that loan loss could be broadly in line with the annualized rate into the fourth quarter, and disclaimer uncertainty regarding future loan loss is of course very difficult as this macroeconomic outlook can easily change. Risk-adjusted profit is expected to be approximately at the same level as in '08.</p>
          <p>I'd like to tell a little about the strategy as I have done on all these meetings, the update. And what we are saying is that we will keep our strategy. We will not change it. It has produced a strong business momentum and strong results that we will adjust it. And we call the approach we do "middle of the road", and this is in order to say that we don't want to grow, on the left side of the page where we have inappropriate expansion and not reacting to the downturn by unchanged lending growth, unchanged growth, costs and so on, and just raise Tier 1 hybrid capital only. And on the right side of the road, we don't want to overreact in a negative sense to the situation where we lose momentum and withdraw from customers, close down initiatives, cost cutting, and no dividend and so on.</p>
          <p>We don't want to overreact in either area. We want actually to stay in the middle of the road, which will be a balancing issue. There we will focus on core customers and selected new business opportunities, proactively risk management, manage cost gradually down through the year, and significantly reduce growth investment. And we will also increase the Tier 1 capital to 10% as we are saying. By this we mean we think will actually be balanced between opportunities and challenges.</p>
          <p>And the reason for that approach is the next slide is that we have these top priorities, which we also mentioned today. We will &#x2013; we have worked so hard for so many years to get to a position where we are regarded as a strong bank in Europe, and we want to keep that position, in particular, we want to maintain our strong AA rating. We want to support our customers and we want to look at the possibilities arising, and this in the Great Nordea context which you probably recognize from previously before profit, means that the first one, cost, risk, and capital management will take the lead, in not only this year may be also next year. We will keep our strategy. We will adjust the speed clearly, and in terms of strong customer values and cultures, that is more important than ever and that is actually part of our momentum and part of the reason why we are delivering our results.</p>
          <p>On the next slide means more specific on cost. We will accelerate ongoing efficiency programs not least in the branch offices, our future branch program, the right-size, the area of staff which means a reduction of approximately 2% during 2009. In risk management, we'll step on &#x2013; step up the risk management all over. It's been in progress always. Now, it is even more. We will be proactive on risk, and not reactive. In addition, the credit reviews will be there done. And we will have work-out teams in all countries where they are already established. And, capital we get back to.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, which says that we will increase capital by three billion and this will be the 2.5 billion rights offering, and 0.5 billion from dividend. And it is exactly the same as proactive, maintain the strong position, as we are one of the strong banks in Europe, proactively establish a cushion to handle the reduced visibility and the macroeconomic outlook and the fact that the markets have increased demands for Tier 1 capital, and have the flexibility to take advantage of our strong position and our momentum.</p>
          <p>And this has been on page 13, according to our strategy slide, just to be very clear about what we are doing. Of course, we are reducing speed in some of the high risk areas, but also on average where we think that we have actually done the investments so we have chance to learn from those.</p>
          <p>Page 14, I always like, it shows over the last four years that we have increased our quarterly income by &#x20AC;500 million approximately. That of course equalizes &#x20AC;2 billion per year. And I think it's evident that organic growth strategy is creating very significant shareholder value. There is no way to create that kind of value without the growth strategy. But we will adjust, as I said, we will take down speed, we will progress more on the risk part and the credit side to make sure we get through the downturn and keep our value evaluating and we will be able to accelerate again when we see that forklifts.</p>
          <p>That was my presentation, and then Fredrik, I think is next on the &#x2013; very much on some of the numbers and also the capital part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. I will continue with the quarter results. Since as you have seen from our numbers, the strong momentum in the first three quarters also continued in quarter four with an income growth of 13%. So the highest we have ever had. Our operating expenses were in line with our expectations and also on thereby generating a profit before loan losses at 18% growth in comparison to Q3, also again generating the highest growth.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see that the volume development that we've seen throughout the year, also continued in quarter four, although in some segments at slightly slower level. So you can clearly see, excluding FX effects, that the total lending growth was 4% and deposit 3%. But you clearly see that the household mortgage loans in the Nordic region increased somewhat less than previously and you can also see a similar effect for new European markets.</p>
          <p>If you turn to the summary, net interest income, we increased for the year of course 19%, but we continued to also increase by 7% in the quarter, on the back of among others good corporate lending up 11%, and not &#x2013; 19% for the full year, but also strong in Q4 and the corporate lending margins continue to increase.</p>
          <p>If you look at the next slide, you can clearly see the results of that trend that was the first six months of 2008 was very much driven by lending and deposit growth with Q3 and Q4 has much been driven by increased margins on particularly the lending. Those margin improvement continues.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you will see the SII Risk at the end of Q4 '08 and you can clearly see that we have positioned ourselves for lower interest rates. We have reduced the exposure on the up 100 basis points or remain approximately the same on down 100 basis points. Net fees and commission income was reduced by 12% year-on-year and thus weak development continue also throughout Q4, partly as a consequence of the commission or the commission expenses that we paid under the Danish State Guarantee Program of &#x20AC;51 million. A big or major reason of course for the decline in net fees and commission relates to assets under management you can see on the next slide.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; had a reduction throughout the year of roughly about 20%, and also in the last quarter and also about &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Much has been the case in the previous quarters; the main driver behind that decrease is mainly the retail investors continue to be risk averse in taking out the money from the fund. Just like to highlight the fact that this has been, in terms of flows, more than concentrated by a much, much, bigger inflow on the savings account of the Bank.</p>
          <p>Turning to next slide, net gains and losses, that we have the strongest result ever in the history of Nordea, up 47% in the quarter, and our customers continued to do a lot of risk mitigating business on both the fixed income and the FX side. And the result would have been in fact even better had we not have to reverse a shareholder fee in our Life &amp; Pension business in Denmark that we had to reverse due to decline in the financial buffers, very, very strong results.</p>
          <p>And in summary, if we look at the next slide, the year-on-year development really suggest that the momentum of the business, the momentum that we have in our customer units continued to prevail with very strong growth in all of those areas. We have clearly had issues relating to post-market operations, which we have reported previously, and also license international private banking, but mostly our customer operations are doing very well.</p>
          <p>If we look at our cost, we have an increase of roughly about 7%, which is very much in line with the target and that development has been as expected also in Q4, which you can see on &#x2013; also in the summary. And if you look at the next page, you can see the expense growth in Nordea, it is clear that again the investments in the growth area is roughly equal to half or significant portion of the cost expense.</p>
          <p>In this particular quarter, in Q4, there are restructuring and one-off expenses to the amount of 59 million. So a very big number and that relates to restructuring efforts of roughly 30 billion &#x2013; 30 million, sorry, and then one-off cost relating to the rest. Part of that restructuring effort relates to the acquisition of the Roskilde Bank that we completed during Q4.</p>
          <p>If we look at the number of FTEs, up 7% in line with our plans, significant portion of course coming from new European markets and Nordic markets. That increased rate, but the growth rate is clearly decreased then you can see that the number of FTEs in the quarter four has been increasing much less. The overall increase for the year has been of course impacted by the growth plan in Sweden, some <mark type="inaudible" /> and we have also during Q4 as I said acquired Roskilde, which has also impacted the specific numbers for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, net profit is down because of the loan losses, that Carl-Johan will come back to and describe some more, we have a decrease of net profit of 15%. But the profitability, as Christian alluded to is very high still for the full year of 15.3, but it's also close to 15% for Q4. So we do have a very strong Q4 also in the return of equity viewpoint. And, the risk-adjusted return on capital at risk 20.8% that's clearly above the 20%, which is very high level. And then I will shift gear a little bit and talk about our funding operation and even more on the capital, the rights issue, and the dividend cut that Christian talked about before.</p>
          <p>In the Q3 report, there was a lot of focus put on the funding operation and of course the liquidity squeeze in the market and we could report to you at that point of time that our funding operations worked well also in very, very tough times. And that has been the case throughout Q4, and clearly the situation has reached, quite, well towards the end of the quarter. In total, we issued 31 billion of long-term funding and we continued to do that also in Q4, as you can see on slide 30. Total wholesale funding is 128 billion, out of which still 66% is in long-term, but clearly we see higher prices than we did a year ago, I think that's fairly evident.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the rights issue, the rationale we have described, I will provide you with some of the details. As Christian alluded to, we have two parts of it, of the capital strengthening efforts. The first one relates to the rights offering and rights issue of a total of 2.5 billion approximately, which is equal to just over 20% of our market capitalization at this point.</p>
          <p>The second part is a proposal to have a payout ratio and dividend of just over 19%, 19.4%, which is about half of our payout ratio &#x2013; dividend payout ratio of 40% that we have in the policy and that will strengthen the core Tier 1 with approximately 0.5 billion. The rights issue will be subscribed by the Swedish Government, Sampo and Nordea Fonden and they together hold the 36.1% of the shares outstanding in Nordea, but for the time they will subscribe their pro rata share.</p>
          <p>Just as a side remark, the Swedish Government has expressed a wish to participate in the rights issue through the newly launched capital package, which was fully launched yesterday and Nordea has no objections to that as it does not contain any other restriction than remuneration and as you are aware of Nordea has previously consented to that or we've taken upon that restriction before.</p>
          <p>In addition to the 36.1%, Sampo has &#x2013; will underwrite 13% in addition to its pro rata share and JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch will underwrite the remaining portion, so thereby making the rights issue fully underwritten. We will expose or we will get back to you with the exact terms of the rights offering on the 11th of March.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see that one of the explicit reasons behind the rights issue and the dividend cut is to maintain Nordea as one of the strongest bank in Europe and you can clearly see that is the case in the next slide, but we will see among the absolute top on both core Tier 1 and the Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>I'll jump to the next slide, related to the proposal to reduce dividend. As I said, we are not changing the dividend policy, this is to be seen as one-time effort and we pay out roughly about 19%. It's worth noting that the newly issued shares in the rights issue will not be entitled to dividend for 2008.</p>
          <p>If I then quickly turn to risk weighted assets on the next slide, you can see that we started and ended the year practically on the same level in terms of risk weighted assets. However, there are a number of things that have happened since then. We've had some migration that Carl-Johan will talk some more about, that has impacted, it was six million. We have grown considerably and that has had an impact of roughly about 22 billion. We have announced in December that we received our IRB approval for the retail portfolio <mark type="inaudible" /> down by 28. And then we've had some FX impact and other risks, so that is the bridge between those two area.</p>
          <p>The capital strengthening efforts will take us to very strong levels or high levels, both in terms of core Tier 1 with 10%, Tier 1 with 10.8 and 13.5 on the capital ratio, which is clearly above the targets that we have just launched this morning. And if you look at slide 36, you will see that &#x2013; as of this morning, we have launched the new capital targets, which stipulates that Tier 1, over the cycle should reach 9% and the capital ratio should, over the cycle, reach 11.5.</p>
          <p>Now, over the cycle that means that typically, going into weaker times, we would expect that Tier 1 ratio to be much higher, or at least higher than the target, and of course going out into better times, we would expect it to be clearly lower, and you can see the difference there after the capital strengthening efforts, where we expect the Tier 1 ratios to be 10.8 versus the target of 9%. The reason why we have launched these targets is that our old targets was related to the Basel I framework, whereas this now is as we enter the Basel II framework, we need to redefine, and that's what we have done.</p>
          <p>And by that, I will turn over to Carl-Johan. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. I will briefly comment on the credit portfolio situation. We all know that during the autumn, the whole global economy suddenly came to more <mark type="inaudible" /> stop, and we saw growth rate forecast for this year and next year being down-rated, that also holds for the Nordic economies, which we have seen already, and Danish economy, to be in recession for a couple of quarters and our other economies are following.</p>
          <p>We believe, although, we have a strong starting point in having a well-diversified portfolio between the Nordic countries, a smaller part in the European market and others, but also through the fact that we have a corporate portfolio, balanced up with a low-risk household portfolio, of which the majority is mortgage loans. Out of our total portfolio, we can say that roughly one-third are mortgage loans, which we consider to be low risk. Also in recession as our gross expenses are very low relating to that portfolio, but losses increased in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>We recorded, for the full year, 466 million out of which 320 in the last quarter, for the full year that is a loss ratio of 19 basis points. If you exclude the Danish Guarantee Scheme, it's 17 basis points and for the quarter, we have talked about 52 basis points versus -- correspondingly 45 if we exclude Danish scheme. No major individual losses, we saw a broad deterioration in the portfolio without any surprises, and if we divide it between the countries, Denmark was slightly over exempted, of course also helped by this additional 44 million from the guarantee schemes, while the other Nordic countries are more or less equally hard hit.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans increased from a low level. We still see that the majority overweight bad loans, also the increase now this quarter come from still performing loans, indicating that we recognize problems early in the process and reclassify them to be impaired, meaning that we also then make provision on those when necessary, and to the extent that we foresee that we might have a possible loan loss coming forward.</p>
          <p>And also our total allowances, we have more than 400 million in more general insurance, collective impairment, and some 762 million for individual, in addition some 100 million provisions which are not recorded in this table, of course they are relating to balance sheet items and are actually therefore provisions in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>If you look at the composition of other corporate portfolio on slide 43, we have rearranged the groupings to better reflect the actual underlying industry in which they operate are indifferent from what you have seen before, still the same holds that it's a well-diversified. We have some industries obviously, bigger than others, real estate being the biggest one, even if it's down in the quarter, but it is very much related to the FX coming from particular distributional region portfolio development, while you've seen it moving into other direction into shipping portfolio where the dollars strengthened in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>And, if we make some comments on those portfolios that have been in focus during the last half year, the real estate portfolio to start with being the biggest one. We have this division between countries where Sweden is by far the biggest, but also through the division between commercial and residential where residential actually accounts 44% of the full portfolio and we account that approximately one-third of the portfolio is the class at very low risk counter parties i.e., tenant-owner associations, social housing associations, municipality-owned housing companies and so on. And, also, the commercial portfolio, we still see a very acceptable vacancy rate. They will increase obviously, when the layoffs that we have seen in the industry takes place. But it is well supported this time with very low interest rates, which means that the debt service capacity should remain at a &#x2013; on a good level and we don't foresee big problems out of this portfolio.</p>
          <p>In shipping, we have seen a varied effect on the different segments. Dry bulk and container exposure is the one that we are watching carefully for the time being. Both are affected by the decrease in foreign trade and the need for long-haul transportation. We are underweight in both of these portfolios or this segment, but we are anyway of course following it very closely and can foresee that we see slightly higher loan losses going forward. That is seen in the past we have very good track record in terms of handling our shipping portfolio based on our very strong position and thereby the possibility to choose our customers to pick the long-term winner.</p>
          <p>We have a very structured exposure towards companies, which are owned by private equity funds. We have a portfolio roughly 100 portfolio companies, all of them you can say in the Nordic markets and mix between very high quality and some higher leverage companies. We will see restructurings going on this portfolio. They are governed by very very tight financial covenants, which means that the early <mark type="inaudible" /> of these will lead to negotiations with the owners about the compensation where the bank, as well have to contribute somehow. At least, price them into maturities maybe by converting some of the loans to non-interest paying for a time that we balance the cash flow.</p>
          <p>So we see yet we have &#x2013; we just have a lot of work, but we don't see that we will have a situation where we will not be able to manage through these difficult times. And, what is of course is very important here that 99% of the portfolio is senior loans i.e., we have very low risk portions to the mezzanine market.</p>
          <p>Looking at what has actually happened in the portfolio in terms of migration which Fredrik mentioned is an issue of course that the measure of the overall quality of the book but it's also reflected in the Basel II as you know directly into the capital to match the changes in the migration and we saw more downgrading things than operating now in the last year. Why we are seeing this is other way round upto them, we have not seen drastic movements, basically it's too much or too in movements of ratings, but it all will have an effect also on the capital funding for next year. And, while we had migration of a little over 4% in terms of risk weighted assets effects in 2008, it's fair to expect that we will see a big migration during 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, a word on the new European market that was already last year affected by the downturn, the Baltic states particularly in recession now for more than a year, we're seeing increased provisions from that market but individualize they are still on a fairly low level, they talk about the same overall level in the European market, we see in the rest of the bank around 50 basis points and we still maintain as well our collective allowance for the Baltic countries. So more than &#x20AC;100 million which <mark type="inaudible" /> more than 130 basis points of lending and covering all the net impaired loans.</p>
          <p>We did this reserve early on in anticipation of a declining economy and we are gladly we did it and we are maintaining it on the same level in order to meet future challenges. We have taken down the growth rate in the Baltics and the schedule here on the right hand corner indicates that we have a stronger portfolio than the market as such with our positive loans at the end of 2008 are clearly below the market in all three countries, still on a level that is higher than we see in the Nordics market, but anyway.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions here. First, on the credit loss guidance that you've given us, could you tell us about what kind of assumptions you have made when you give us this credit loss outlook for 2009? You are saying that you analyzed the Q4 number and take it throughout 2009 and clearly 2009 looks a lot more stressful than the quarter four would have been.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the rights issue. Just wanted to go on the thinking of the rights issue. Was the decision more strategic as in &#x2013; were you thinking about the right issue for the last month, two months or was it more tactical because STD had a rights issue &#x2013; you thought you should be with your peers in raising capital? Just wanted to get some idea about that. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the credit loss assumption for this year, as we say, it is extremely difficult to be precise on that because nobody really knows exactly how the economic environment will develop. It is very much based on our belief that come and also come the last quarter of the year if you see it turn for the better and therefore we see that the best estimate that we can make is that if you see here during, which we will have higher losses than we have seen before and the level we saw in the Q4 is the level that we feel at this stage comfortable with.</p>
          <p>It's also based on the fact that we have been out early making provisions on companies that are still very well performing, but where we see potential weaknesses and therefore we are not also just waiting for the harder times to come. We are actually taking hike for them by already we providing for weak situations. So without any guarantee because nobody can give that this is our best estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other question relating to the rights issue, was it a tactical thing, we have been working with these capital strengthening efforts for a couple of months and of course it's a very extensive process going through due diligence on the raising banks, etcetera. So we have funded for a long period of time. And, of course therefore has nothing to do with STD announced previously last week.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from the line of Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Per L&#xF6;fgren with Morgan Stanley in London. Excuse me. I have a couple of questions on capital and I need to go back to the rights issue again. First of all, what did you base the 2.5 billion that you are raising off? It's very clear the different reasons that you gave, but is this &#x2013; number one, is it opportunities that you see in the market is this international bank leaving your region, is that why you need the money? Or you say that you want to create capital cushion, but based on the guidance that you have given today, and I clearly appreciate that you say there's a lot of uncertainty in this, but it looks to me that you are looking for a 1.5 billion net profit, something in a range like that for next year based on your guidance. But, the question is, where do you see the stress? It sounds pretty all right. How do you come up with the 2.5 billion?</p>
          <p>My second question is, by how much do you see that capital ratios can decrease from growth <mark type="inaudible" /> migration effects in 2009 in a really bad scenario? Are we talking about a couple of percentage points up from the 4% '08 level or is it twice or three times that level? And, my final question would be also on capital and it goes back to your elaboration of the target, how far down &#x2013; how low would you allow your capital ratios to go at the bottom of the cycle? Those are my three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, why did we pick the &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Well, I think I need to return to the rationale &#x2013; of the underlying rationale for why we have done that. Of course, the first one being that we want to maintain our position as one of the absolute stronger times in Europe and of course also protect our AA rating. And if you see that table that I showed you, the absolute strongest times are in the infinity of 10% in core Tier 1 ratios. So that is one of the reasons.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, the other two &#x2013; no, you're right in the sense that the stress test that we do in all our portfolios wouldn't suggest that a capital of this size is in any way required to have a big cushion. But again, as we clearly said, this is a cushion for what we just don't expect, just for a very weak development that we cannot envision at this point of time. So we do share your view that with the profit generation platform that we stand upon, there should be no need for that cushion.</p>
          <p>But again, it's included in insurance or something that we cannot debate it at this time. And as far as clear objective, or rationale, is of course that there are potential opportunities, now as far also coming out of these very weak times. So with our capital position, we will at some point have the possibility to grow our balance sheet and have that capacity, which most other banks will not have. So it's been a balance of many different things that has led us to this level. Then I thought &#x2013; take maybe the last question, and then you can &#x2013; we'll come back to the migration part to Carl-Johan.</p>
          <p>You have seen now that just from doing these two measures in capital strengthening, we will deviate with roughly about 1.8 from that target, so a fairly significant deviation. And of course that gap, so to speak ,could increase further should we decide to do further capital strengthening through hybrid, for instance. And of course that also reflects the very uncertain times that we live in, and the weak economy that we currently see. Fluctuations on the downside are unlikely to be so big, or will not be so big below the target. So of course, we feel that we have this need for that high level at this point in time, but it will not go as low below the target as you will see it now above. Carl-Johan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the migration, obviously it is equally difficult to actually come forward <mark type="inaudible" />, but in our capital planning and basis for the capital coverage that we see going forward, we see an increase, as I said, during 2009. It could be a doubling of the 4% you saw in last year and that is still capital, we easily can manage within our capital target, but -- yeah, nobody knows, but that is the base scenario.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I'm Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken Capital Markets. Going back to the capital once more, on slide number nine, I wonder if you could a bit talk us through more that, what was the decision to use the rights issue scenario in the "middle of the road" scenario instead of a hybrid Tier 1 capital raising? And the other aspect of the "middle of the road" scenario and also the costs and benefits of these to the shareholders?</p>
          <p>The second question would be regarding your portfolio in Denmark. If we compare yourself to the one large competitor there, what would you say are the big differences? Are there major structural differences between your portfolio and, let's say, example Danske Bank? And the third question is regarding the balance sheet. There is a fairly big increase in derivatives in the fourth quarter on the foreign exchange side. Is this the technical factor, or what's the explanation? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I try and answer the first question, then Carl-Johan will take the second, and I will be back on the third one. The first question, why we chose core instead of hybrid, there is a bit of reason, I think it's been quite clear that in the last couple of months or three or four months, a investor preference to core equity instead of hybrid has become very clear, that hybrid does not really count as sufficiently strong instead of capital as core. So we think that's a much stronger signal. That doesn't preempt the usage of hybrid.</p>
          <p>If one has a sufficiently strong core Tier 1 ratio, it is absolutely possible to increase Tier 1 further with hybrid, and we have not ruled that possibility out. There are many options open to us, not least market solutions, we believe we can do that, and of course having done the rights issue, that possibility is even potentially more &#x2013; even more attractive. So that's one of the main reason we think that core from investor perspective, and also for some raising perspective, is superior to hybrid at this point of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say investor preference, do you mean debt investors or equity investors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our perception, having had numerous discussions with investors of all sorts, I would tend to say both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could say something here as well. I think that &#x2013; this decision comes from a number of conversations, and we think with investors have had a number of bigger investments resonating during the last few months. But I always got this question about Tier 1, it's nine, is it high enough, and I always turn the question around and say that you should answer me, because our stress testing shows it is high enough. Everything we do in our requirement it is high enough, but on <mark type="inaudible" /> you should raise more capital and must be core equity.</p>
          <p>And the reason, I think, is that you are probably also better to answer that question than I am, is that &#x2013; the reason why the market has put off these demands with the run rate here is that they have a stress test out there, which is just one level higher, where everything is really bad and loan losses get extremely high, and you can say it's only core equity that counts, if that is what you are covering up for. So I think the reason why the market situation of core equity, is that it's the only thing that will really count in a very stressed situation <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And then I also think it's important that we actually like &#x2013; we really like to make the right issue, we think it's a fair way to do things. We offer all our shareholders the right to subscribe shares, and if they don't want they can sell. So all the shareholders who have joined &#x2013; has been on board on the way down, they will also be able now to subscribe more shares and <mark type="inaudible" /> again. It's a fair way to do it, and those who don't want to do it, they can sell the rights. So that is also having influence. And then finally, we can come back to the possibility of taking hybrids up with the economic development or other factors, that could be an idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question about the difference between the portfolios is of course difficult to answer. So I don't know the portfolio in detail on Danske Bank. But I think you made a couple of comments. I think they had more of a clear in Denmark than we had, with some old traditional customer they did &#x2013; than we had.</p>
          <p>We have been the challenger in the Danish market. We have attracted more customers in the new industries, in high-tech, in pharma, extremely important in Denmark. And we also are, because of the root, maybe slightly stronger in the agriculture sector, which has its problems, but where over time the losses have been very low, but there is volatility in that portfolio.</p>
          <p>And I also think that we have a lower exposure to the construction industry, and that is particular to maybe compare ourselves to the smaller bank. So we can only talk really for our own portfolio, but we feel that we have a well-diversified portfolio. But obviously, with what has happened in Denmark, there are challenges there, but we can see that we'll be able to handle them. And Denmark is, as we said, the country that went first into recession and has a good chance to also come first out of such a situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question was the increase in derivatives. That has to do with the significant change in the FX rates of primarily set in Swedish krona and Norwegian krona, and also the decline in the interest rates. Our capital market business, in their operations do customer businesses, and then they hedge it on the other side, and of course when there are big movements, the value of both the hedge and the position starts to expand, and what you see is the result of that on the balance sheet.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. Coming back to the discussion we had in Stockholm about your level III assets, I just want to clarify the increase on the share portion, or equity portion, now to roughly 2.1 billion.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on the same page, you have this big increase in your special purpose entities <mark type="inaudible" /> I guess that's the Finish mortgage shares set up of roughly 8.1 billion. Could you tell us, does that impact your risk rate in any way? Why have you done it in such a structure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason is that we have utilized our Finish mortgage portfolio to create additional collateralized assets. So we can use that for collateral in profounding in each division.

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This Geoff Dawes from Fox-Pitt, Kelton. I've got a couple of questions, hopefully both pretty brief. The first one is, across the markets in the Nordic region we've had quite a lot of coverage on the need to increase lending. In each of the different markets, which do you see as the greatest degree of pressure, both from the political and regulatory standpoint, and also from your corporate customers, in order to increase customer lending?</p>
          <p>Second question is part of the rationale of the capital increase, which you detailed in the report, is to take advantage of your funding, you had funding advantage to grow it in each market. Is it possible to quantify what level of advantage you have because, obviously, various funding schemes in the different markets start to eat into that advantage? And also, confirm that some of the organic opportunities only that you are looking at in those markets? Those were two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that general lending side, I think there is the same situation, more or less, in all the markets and also I would say that in all countries there is also this political aspect of claiming that banks cannot stand up for their customers and lend the money they need. We haven't even experienced that. Every customer, as I said, good business days and thereby fulfils our criteria for lending.</p>
          <p>They have been served &#x2013; the shortfall in the market following the exit of the international banks and the lack of liquid bond and CP market, obviously have influenced the need for other funding sources with the existing House Banks' relations. And then you could say that you could take on more than we have done so far, because we have had this balancing of making sure that we utilized our capital in an effective, efficient way. And it is also &#x2013; even if we now feel &#x2013; fill our capital with the new issue, we still will be cautious about just throwing out the money. But we have the possibility to take advantage of the best opportunities, and that is very important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's customer-driven demand rather than political. And where is that customer-driven demand strongest within the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to say it is in all the companies. Finland and Sweden have more big companies, which are affected by these, while particularly Denmark and Norway have smaller companies and therefore, it is &#x2013; if you have to classify, more a Finnish, Swedish issue than Danish, Norwegian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relating to the funding advantage, that relates of course to the AA rating that we have, and that &#x2013; the benefit of that is two-fold. Of course, one is to actually access liquidity in the marketplace, and we have clearly benefited from that in the last several months as times have been tough. We have not had that short as I explained before. And of course, the other benefit is lower cost on our funding. The quantification of that is very difficult to do. It'll depend, but it's generally a positive thing, and that is something that we are very much wanting to protect as part of the rationale for the rights issue. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the organic growth as well, whether that funding advantage is going to be capitalized only in the form of organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. <mark type="inaudible" /> organic growth both with the existing and some new customers, but of course we would not exclude that <mark type="inaudible" /> assets out there with reasonable quality and good return, which we could be looking at. We already looked at one in Denmark, which was two-thirds of the branches in Roskilde Bank and there might be other opportunities coming up. But that's a third priority and you can look upon it as a closed organic because it would be in all core markets, we are talking about close to organic. It's sort of adding in customers or branches or maybe some assets, which cannot be backed by capital by us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of accounting numbers questions. On NII, the Corporate Centre saw most of the increase, if I look at the Group NII increase and the Corporate Centre increase, I'm just wondering how sustainable you expect this NII jump in the group Corporate Center to be?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the shareholder equity number, quarter-on-quarter despite your profit, shareholder equity is flat, just could have been for the direct mark-to-market hits to the balance sheet. Just wondering if you could give us some more color on that. And lastly, a forward-looking question, looking at your sort of comments on the outlook for credit quality, I didn't quite catch what NPL expectations you had for the Baltic and Russian exposures you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the first question on the Corporate Centre that's very much relates to the treasury operation and of course, an improvement to previously a weak result. It has to do with the fact that we have &#x2013; and I mentioned that when I had my frustration on the series, we have geared ourselves to lower interest rates and clearly benefiting from that. Treasury also of course maintains our equity so to speak and gains benefits of that. Whether it's sustainable or not, I think that the future will tell, but of course we do expect our return on the capital that we maintain in treasury. So hopefully, we'll be able to maintain good results in the future. When you look at shareholder equity and the reason why that has been flat is absolutely &#x2013; the majority of the reason relates to currency exchange rate fluctuation. So that's why that has been decreasing and maintained flat throughout the quarters. And the third question...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Russia, Baltics, and NPLs. So I mean, we don't make particular focus for NPL as such. I think we rather look at the losses that we might have to book or provisions that we need to book and that is included in the overall statement. We are seeing a slow, but increasing amount than of the performing loans in the Baltics. But, it's not in anyway exploded in our face and we don't expect that to happen now either. It will go with the economic development. And therefore we are following that of course closely. While in Russia, where we are basically involved in the large corporate segment, we have not really seen any non-performing loans to talk about so far, and provisions needed <mark type="inaudible" /> very low, even if you expect that to increase slightly this year.</p>

          <p>Just a follow-up, on the shareholder equity, so, when I look at the breakdown, which says other reserves, which is where the change took place, do you think that line, other reserves, is affected by FX fluctuations, basically euro appreciation?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The final question comes from the line of Derek De Vries from Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Last question, I have got some detailed questions, I'm afraid. Going back to the notes, note five on page 50 of your release, where you show the classification of financial instruments, you show 15.2 billion of interest-bearing securities at fair value and that number was 16.6 billion coming into the fourth quarter. You are running 15 to 16 billion of interest-bearing securities at fair value in the quarter. And yet, the impact to the AFS was only negative one million in Q4. So, I was wondering if you could kind of give us some color there. I mean, I think probably your asset management people would be quite envious of that return. What kind of assets you have that didn't fall in value in the fourth quarter? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And then I am going to the next page, note six and I have to confess this is something that I have never really understood. You show us the CDOs here, and you show the bought protection, the sold protection. The bought protection, if I guess CDOs net, fell from 1.9 to 1.5. So there was a pretty significant fall there. And the sold protection went from 1.1 at the beginning of the quarter to 1.6. So again, with the caveat I don't really understand this. It sounds to me like you have less bought protection and you've sold more protection and then you go down to the corresponding CDS exposure, and you have footnotes there. And again your net position bought protection amounts to 1.3, down from 1.7 at the beginning of the quarter and your sold protection is essentially unchanged. So, maybe you can help me understand what this stuff is and why it's there, and how it's changed in the quarter, it could be very helpful?</p>

          <p>Derek, I actually I think this question is a little bit too detailed to take in this call. We may need to get back to you on the specifics on these various numbers and how they relate. Probably, we can do that tomorrow morning if needed.</p>

          <p>May be we can answer the first question. We build up the division very late, that increases the liquidity, but we can get back to you on the details of the question.</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot. Sorry for being rough a bit here, because that's simply because we need to catch a flight for our upcoming breakfast meeting in London tomorrow. You are all invited to the Sofitel, London, at St. James. We start at 8 o'clock with a short summary of the results and then further question and answers. Thanks a lot for listening into this call and speak to you later on. Thank you.</p>
