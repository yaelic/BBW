          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to TOTAL second quarter 2008 results conference call. I now hand over to Mr. Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re, CFO. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And because it is my first conference call, let me introduce myself. So, I'm Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re and don't worry, you can call me Patrick and you can call <mark type="inaudible" /> if you need help to spell my name. I became the CFO of TOTAL on June 1, following Robert Castaigne's resignment (sic) [resignation] the day before. This move I think was prepared in &#x2013; far in advance, for almost two years. And during that a period I had the opportunity, indeed the pleasure, to meet with many of you. In any case, as you probably know, I have been with TOTAL for more than 25 years. I have been the Deputy CFO for Robert for the past five years.</p>
          <p>Before we get to the results, I thought that some of you may be wondering how things will change at TOTAL with the new CFO. So let me take a minute to address this point. We at TOTAL have maintained a very consistent strategy, one that is based on financial discipline and this will not change. For my part, I will focus on keeping the balance sheet strong and maintaining financial flexibility for the company, using strict investment criteria to determine the right balance between risks reward on our projects, funding our very competitive dividend growth and maintaining transparent and efficient communication with the markets.</p>
          <p>We will continue to demand returns on capital employed and project management deferments, including cost control that is at the level of the best of the industry. TOTAL has been doing this for many years and I fully expect that we will be able to do this in the years to come.</p>
          <p>So that was a brief introduction. Now I will get on the business at hand which is the second quarter results. Our results are straightforward. In the second quarter, TOTAL rose to historic new high and we're reporting another new record level of earnings. For the second quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, we have adjusted net income of $5.8 billion versus 4.2 billion, an increase of 39%; earnings per share of $2.58 per share versus 1.83, a 41% increase; and ROACE of the business segment of 29%.</p>
          <p>We are again among the best performing super majors, thanks to very good upstream performance and to those segments that did better than most of our peers, mainly thanks to good distillate margins this quarter and also resilience marketing.</p>
          <p>Looking at cash flow again versus second quarter '07; adjusted cash flow from operations which is based on replacement costs before changing working capital was $7.5 billion compared to 6.2 billion in the second quarter '07. CapEx was 4.5 billion compared to $3.6 billion last year. So we're in line with our 2008 budget of $19 billion. And our gearing at the end of June was 25%, well within our target range despite the slight increase in the working capital.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we bought back 7 million shares for about $0.6 billion. In term of returns to shareholders, the most important point is that we paid out about $4 billion for the semi-annual dividend in May.</p>
          <p>I think our second quarter results demonstrate that we are well leveraged to this high price environment and our track record on dividend shows that we are confident about the success of our strategy and committed to returning value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I will comment now briefly on the segments and go to the Q&amp;A thereafter.</p>
          <p>First, the Upstream segment. In terms of adjusted net operating income, which is the indicator we focus on, the Upstream segment earned $4.8 billion in the second quarter. This represents 82% of our adjusted net operating income from the business segment compared to 69% a year ago. You can see how geared to Upstream we are becoming. And even at this price level, the sharp increase  in the Upstream results shows that our sensitivities are working.</p>
          <p>Our reported production volume was 2.35 million barrel per day. Because of seasonal maintenance, the best comparison is with the second quarter of last year. In this figure, we show an increase of 1.3%. Excluding the price effect and portfolio changes, the underlying growth was 4%.</p>
          <p>The key elements affecting production in the second quarter were the following: on the plus side, the ramp up to plateau production on '07 startups such as Dalia, Rosa, Shah Deniz and Dolphin; the startup of Moho Bilondo in July and April and May, respectively; and scheduled maintenance that was down slightly versus a year ago. On the minus side, the price effects related to the $52 per barrel increase in Brent since a year ago, the natural decline and the unscheduled shutdown on Al Jurf in mid-April that accounted for about 10,000 barrels per day on average this quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Jura produced about 10,000 barrels per day on average in the second quarter, and the plateau of 50,000 barrels per day should be reached by end of the summer. Moho Bilondo will continue to ramp-up and should reach its plateau in '09. Scheduled maintenance in the third quarter should be comparable to last year and will affect mainly Tor in Norway and Alwyn in the U.K. North Sea. And Al Jurf should start in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, comparing to first quarter '08, the profit volume showed decrease, mainly because of maintenance and price effect. In terms of oil and gas prices, the second quarter '08 benchmark Brent price increased by 76% from a year ago. Our average realized liquids price was $115 per barrel in the second quarter, and this represents an increase of 75%. So we move in line with Brent. On average, including gas, our realized hydrocarbon price was $87 per barrel, an increase of 66%. And this correlates well with the 69% increase in net operating income per barrel.</p>
          <p>At the same time, costs also continue to increase at the pace close to last year, mainly because of FX, the impact of new project, and inflation, which was limited by our ongoing cost control efforts. The Upstream ROACE was 41% for the past 12 months and 47% on an annualized quarter basis, compared to a 33% a year ago. This continues to be among the best in the peer group.</p>
          <p>And looking ahead, it seems clear, despite recent hopes and the current volatility of the market, that we have moved into the structurally ideal price environment. Operationally our projects, mainly Yemen LNG and Akpo, are moving forward well, and we are confident of our ability to continue to deliver solid results.</p>
          <p>Let's move into Downstream now. Our results were very good compared to our peers. Our second quarter European refining margin indicator averaged $40 per ton. This was a little bit lower than the $43 per ton we averaged in the second quarter '07, but well above the $25 per ton we averaged in first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Refinery throughput was 2.3 million barrel per day, second quarter '08, compared to 2.4 million barrel per day, first quarter '08, a drop of 4% linked mainly to the full 50-day shutdown of Leuna for scheduled maintenance in second quarter '08. Most of you know that this is one of our most sophisticated and profitable refinery.</p>
          <p>The environments of the marketing business was generally good, but it continued to reflect the impact of higher refined product price, particularly in June, and the lag effect on various products. Adjusted net operating income for the Downstream was $0.9 billion. This represents a limited decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter '07, mainly linked to a weaker contribution from equity affiliates namely from CEPSA in Spain and Wepec in China. Compared to the first quarter '08, the Downstream results have doubled. The Downstream ROACE was 16% for the trailing 12 months and 19% on an annualized quarter, so really this is quite robust.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our TRCV European indicator of refining was a little above $30 in July, comparable to the average of last year but lower than in the second quarter. Gasoline margin are rich but distillate margin are still good driven by robust demand.</p>
          <p>Leuna has been back in production since the end of the June. Maintenance activity in the third quarter should be limited to partial maintenance in Provence and <mark type="inaudible" /> starting in September. Marketing, mainly for volumes, is under some pressure but resilient, again in part due to cost control.</p>
          <p>Construction is underway for modernization of Port Arthur refinery. This project was approved in February of this year. And we are also moving forward on the Jubail refinery project in Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>A few words about Chemicals; adjusted net operating income for the Chemicals was $109 million. The specialties continue to perform generally quite well, despite some sign of slowdown in demand. The adjusted net operating income of the Chemicals segment in the second quarter was essentially generated by the specialties. The Base Chemical, on the over hand, basically broke even in the second quarter. The sharp increase in the points of NAFTA combined with generally weak demand in the Atlantic Basin market created a difficult environment for this sector. So, the ROACE for the trailing 12 months was limited to 8%, which is disappointing, but this reflects the cyclical nature of this business.</p>
          <p>In terms of strategy, we are developing new low-cost capacity that is more leveraged to the oil price in the Middle East and Algeria that together with the Samsung JV should represent more than 50% of our Chemical net operating income by the middle of the next decade.</p>
          <p>And, finally, the corporate side; as I've said at the beginning of the call, we paid about $4 billion in dividend in May. Our next dividend payment, the interim dividend, is set for November and as was the case last year, it will be approved by our September board meeting.</p>
          <p>As we have said before, we have a preference for using the dividend of our buybacks to return value to our shareholders. I should point out that we plan to adopt a bolder target range for our gearing by moving the lower end of the range down to 20%, but keeping the high-end of the range at 30%. This will give us more room to maneuver in this environment. We will manage our gearing by continuing to buy back our share with some of our free cash flow. So far this year we've bought 18 million shares for $1.4 billion. And I can confirm that we consider Sanofi to be non-core and that we will be selling it.</p>
          <p>TOTAL is really well-positioned to profit from the current environment. Our portfolio of producing assets is performing very well and we are generally satisfied with the progress we are making on the development of our new projects in the Upstream and also in the Downstream and Chemicals.</p>
          <p>So now let's start with the Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have our first question from <mark type="inaudible" />. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question about Block 32 developments. BP announced last Monday the development of Block 31 in Angola. And originally you had agreements to develop all of these blocks in several stages. Do you already have something in mind for the development of Block 32 and could it be similar to BP's in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="inaudible" /> on Block 32, we, TOTAL- we are the operator with 30%. We made four discoveries in '07. All development studies are underway currently for development of a pool, which I think his name is <mark type="inaudible" /> to develop the discoveries of Gengibre, Gindungo, Canela, Louro, Mostarda and Salsa. And Louro is not yet finalized- the appraisal of Louro is not yet finalized. And I think is too premature to say when we will be ready to launch this project at that stage. And there are other development studies, or other pools to follow, I'm sure of that.</p>

          <p>The following question comes from Mr. Alan (sic) [Colin] Smith from Dresdner Kleinwort.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. It's Colin Smith actually from Dresdner Kleinwort. I am sure you're aware that Gas Natural has &#x2013; is proposing to buy UNION FENOSA and it's apparently planning to sell it's 5% stake in CEPSA. I wonder if you could comment on whether you would be interested in acquiring that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always say about CEPSA that we are happy with our 49% stake and that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a straight forward answer, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. I just have few questions. First of all just on your comments on Sanofi and also on your cash position and outlook for the shareholder returns for the rest of this year, maybe it was just lost a bit in translation. Have you made a change in Sanofi? You said you wanted to sell it historically but doing it at your own pace being flexible given the market conditions. Your final statement there seems to lot more blunt and firm suggesting something might happen more eminently with the entire stake. And secondly, maybe you could just walk through, if conditions in the commodity markets stay roughly where they are for this year, will you be using more of your cash as a distribution going forward either in buy backs or dividends than you had originally planned? Then I've got a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your first question was on Sanofi. I repeat, and this is the position of the management of the company, Sanofi is not a core asset and we will sell it.</p>
          <p>The second question was about shareholder returns and the use of cash. If you will remember, and there is no change &#x2013; and on Sanofi, by the way, this is not a change, we will sell it. On the cash issue, we address our <mark type="inaudible" /> by the share buyback. So, we blend all the cash flow from operation, we first pay for &#x2013; in CapEx, we pay for dividend and then we address giving share buyback. There is no change in that policy with respect in the books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe a different question looking at your gas assets going forward; obviously in the last three to six months, you've undertaken some high profile LNG sales into China. Of your future of LNG business in terms of Yemen and maybe looking forward on your other businesses that are currently producing, what proportion of future LNG have you still got to sell through a contract? So, I'm wondering if we're going to see more contracts like the ones you've written with a Chinese coming up. And also, if you could gives us an update on the Ichthys development as well. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. New &#x2013; there are several new project where we will be off-taking &#x2013; Sn&#xF8;hvit, Yemen LNG, Qatargas II Train &#x2013; and all those off-take will be used to supply customers. The current market provides arbitrage opportunities to divert cargo from the Atlantic Basin to Asia basically. And by building up our portfolio of, say, of purchase of LNG, we will be able to capture part of this additional margin.</p>
          <p>On Ichthys, we are currently in the process of choosing the place where we will have the LNG plant itself. I think it &#x2013; that &#x2013; I think I'm right, I think there are three potential locations; we are working on it. One is the Maret Islands, the second one is Darwin, and there is another possibility with the joint hub in Kimberley. This process of selecting the location of the LNG plant will be completed, I think, late this year. That's the progress we &#x2013; that's progress we have on Ichthys. And I think the FID is somewhere by end of 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Can I come back to the comment you made in your prepared remarks about cost inflation in the E&amp;P business being similar to 2007 levels? Just looking at what you reported in 2007, that implies unit cost inflation of about 30%. Is that what you're saying?  It's quite a big number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is not what I said.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect an inflation for this year, double-digit inflation. This is basically what we said. And we have seen OpEx inflation and CapEx inflation in the same range as we have seen last year but altogether we see an inflation of about the 10%, roughly. But I never said 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay. I'm still a bit lost. I mean 30% is double digit &#x2013; I mean...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes you're right. 39% also is a double-digit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't mean to be flippant, but I mean the cash cost inflation last year was quite big. You think it will be close to that sort of level?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick, it's Irene Himona. And I had a number of questions. A lot of your competitors have reported this quarter material non-cash effects from market-to-market of derivatives under IFRS. Is that not an issue for TOTAL? I had a subsequent question, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to answer the question <mark type="inaudible" /> U.S. operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. And my other question was on Nigeria. If you could clarify for us the impact on Q2 volumes and what should we assume for the rest of the year? And my final question was on Sanofi, just to clarify, does TOTAL legally have to disclose transactions in Sanofi's stock or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the first question was about derivative and non-cash item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We apply IFRS rules. So we review our position on a mark-to-market basis. The effect in our P&amp;L is extremely limited as of today. Both hedges we are implementing are very strict and we apply very cautiously meeting the rules about it, as the risk are very limited and the profits and loss associated to that are not significant in respect of our size. So that's it for the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question was about Nigeria impact on Q2 volume. Could you elaborate a little bit more on your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was wondering what the amount of &#x2013; how many barrels basically you are losing in Nigeria due to the disturbances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mainly we are affected by the Nigeria unrest on the SPDC joint venture we're sharing with the operator. Basically, this SPDC joint venture has the capacity to produce 1 billion barrels per day and is currently producing 400,000 barrel per day. So we basically are losing, currently 60,000 barrels a day.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>

          <p>Thanks. Patrick, good afternoon. I have two questions, if I could. The first one just on Synenco, could you just tell me when you expect that deal to close and is there any indication at this stage of what CapEx will need to go into develop those assets? And then secondly just a kind of clarification; on the move to the 20 to 30% gearing range, why has that moved from the 25 to 30% previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Synenco, the offer close on 5th of August. And honestly, I don't have any figures in respect of the potential CapEx; it's several billion dollars, but I don't know exactly how much. And you may think of Synenco developments being altogether &#x2013; be part of the overall development of our portfolio in this area.</p>
          <p>On the gearing which, in the past, we use the 25 to 30% target; we enlarged this target from 25, 30 to 20 to 30. We've changed that basically because the environment is so volatile that it was just extremely difficult to monitor the gearing by a few points. Second, is that it might not be stupid to be in the lower range of this line &#x2013; the lower part of this range if the interest price climbs up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. You mentioned you're making progress on the Jubail refinery in Saudi. I think the Middle East is overheated in all senses of the word, but I think with regard to skilled labor, how concerned are you that Aramco seems to pursuing the construction of both Jubail and the Conoco at Yanbu virtually simultaneously? I appreciate you're a minority partner; do you simply have to go along with their wishes or do you have sort of a particular influence in the matter? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, this project is under the <mark type="inaudible" /> projects. Basically, we do it if we like it. And we like it. And we discussed this matter with Saudi Aramco and honestly we believe that both projects can be under &#x2013; in this framework established currently. And we have no specific concern about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given what's happened in Qatar with the simultaneous mega projects, one of which of course you're involved in, do you not see sort of similar risk &#x2013; construction risks and delays, cost over, etcetera, in Saudi? And if not, why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Saudi Arabia is already a very big oil country. They have reliability and they know how to handle projects as better as we do. Qatar, they are very good people also, but they concentrate all their assets in a very limited space and I think this is part of the issue they have.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Jason from ING, and congratulations on another set of solid results. This maybe a bit off the beaten track, but if you could give some assurances on North Sea taxation, for example, could you be interested in British Energy?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In what? British Energy? I see no reason for us to be interested in it, no. At the stage I can't foresee an interest for us.</p>
