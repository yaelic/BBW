        <plist>
          <p>Good, so many thanks to all of you for being connected with us for the presentation of the second quarter results.</p>
          <p>Shall we start immediately? Group second quarter results, net income is at &#x20AC;1.866 billion, growing by 3.8% year-on-year on a comparable base, pre-PPA basis. The capital is growing. We are in terms of core Tier I in Basel I at 555, Basel I up 4 basis points quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>You will see later on all the other elements.  As you know the procedure for managing Basel II is slightly longer since we have comprised dramatically the timeframe for these activities with the model and they're going, so this is the number. The difference is in the range of the 20 basis points we have seen in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The Tier I ratio is at 6.3% under Basel.  That means 11 basis points higher than the previous quarter. Organic growth, we have a fantastic growth in Central Eastern Europe, the revenues went up by 24% year-on-year and MAV is back to a positive contribution with &#x20AC;800 million of revenues in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>You remember that previously we had a negative contribution in terms of revenue starting at the marker down of the ABS portfolio. Quite a good risk control, we have an on loss provisions below the first quarter '08 and the second quarter and also the ABS portfolio has been reduced by another 1.1 billion, down to 11.6 billion at the end of the semester.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost management on a comparable basis, you remember that in the second quarter last year we had two exceptional one-off in terms of TFR in Italy and in terms of pension fund in Austria. We are not considering these two one-off, down by 1.1% at the group level and 3.7% in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>The EVA is up by 944 million in &#x2013; sorry, it's up to 944 million in the second quarter, it was 30 million in the first quarter. This is a short summary of our second quarter results and now shall we go across different numbers.</p>
          <p>Starting from the capital, we took the commitment of being at 6.2% in Basel II, 6% in Basel I at the year-end.  We are perfectly on track on our objectives.  You can see that we had 18 basis point of organic capital generation in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We have an absorption by 14 basis point from this completion, mainly on one side as they squeeze out BA-CA, plus minorities of ATF and Ukrsotsbank and absorbing capital clearly and the disposal of Bank BPH in terms of positive effect from the deal completion.</p>
          <p>So we are at 555 at the end of June. As I said, the Basel II effect is in the range of the 20 basis point we have seen before, so we're perfectly aligned with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Talking of EVA creation, we have quite a good contribution from all the divisions. As you can see, the marginal RARORAC is quite good across the board commercial banking with 12.5% of positive RARORAC.</p>
          <p>Corporate improved price significantly, is up to 7.4%. What was in our 4% target when we had the presentation of the three-year plan, that means the reduction of negative EVA risk weighted asset is already in the process of being realized, so we have quite a good contribution also in the Corporate division. Asset manager in the private banking continued to have a very good marginal RARORAC, you have to consider that this is on top of the cost of equity.</p>
          <p>What about the normalized net profit that, as we said, is stable year-on-year despite the completely different market environment?  You remember that the second quarter '07 has been quite an exceptional quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues we are down by 2.8% on the stated, down by 4% on a normalized. But if you consider the quarter-on-quarter change is 17.8 and normalized is 19.2, what does it mean normalized?  Is constant Forex and parameter, you have considered the acquisition of ATF, Ukrsotsbank and the dismissal of Bank BPH. And in 2007 the 351 million of positive one-off we had in terms of staff expenses line for again, the TFR, plus the pension fund in Austria.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, sorry, the costs are up by 8.4% on the stated, down on a normalized by 1.1%. The quarter-on-quarter change is, respectively, 2.1 and 3.2. Operating profit is down by 14% and 7.4%, is up quarter-on-quarter by 46% and 48%, respectively.</p>
          <p>So the net income for the Group pre-PPA is down by 6.4% on the stated and up by 2.8% on normalized.  Quarter-on-quarter is 78 and 81% without the &#x2013; sorry, with the PPA is slightly different.</p>
          <p>The PPA, as you know, dwell the negative impact on the profit and loss, but it is releasing capital. I think that is quite important as a change we had on the EVA creation, we have 944 million of EVA.</p>
          <p>Revenues on risk weighted asset is slightly down year-on-year, both on stated and normalized, but it's significantly up in terms of quarter-on-quarter.  Their cost/income ratio is at 55.6%, also is up year-on-year, but is significantly down quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk is slightly decreasing, is stable. None of the status is decreasing on all the other elements. Return on equity, we are at 14% in a quite positive range.</p>
          <p>So talking of the different contributors to the profit and loss, we have quite a good growth in net interest income. We have to combine net interest income partially with the fee side because, as you know, we had a switch of assets from assets under management to deposits.</p>
          <p>So clearly you have to consider partially together these two numbers.  The decrease in quarter-on-quarter is also related to the fact that in the first quarter we had an exceptional interest margin in the MIB area.</p>
          <p>If we consider the growth rate of commercial banking, as you can see, we're arriving at fantastic growth in Central Eastern Europe.  14.5% is considering the delta of Ukrsotsbank, ATF and BPH. Without this difference, so at cost and Forex and perimeter, the gross rate of the loan in Central Eastern Europe is 27%, so in line with the plan. It's also pretty good in the Corporate area, mainly in Germany.</p>
          <p>On the deposit side, we have as well quite a good growth in Central Eastern Europe, but also in the Corporate sector. Before, when I was talking of the capital, I haven't stressed the fact that risk weighted assets are stable.</p>
          <p>So this is quite an important element because we are growing in terms of loans, but we are stable in terms of risk weighted asset because we are using all the non-effective loan or we are using better and better the models and we are reducing the portfolio. So the special credit portfolio and the other portfolios, which are at the Corporate Center level.</p>
          <p>Net commissions, net commissions down. Clearly, the main impact of this, so the main difference is related to the lower fees from investment services, is the range of &#x20AC;330 million. This difference in other fees impacted by sales of zero fee current account and lower contribution for Corporate area, this is just one number. The difference in the current account fees is close to 90 million.</p>
          <p>So it's explaining a whole more or less than the 2 numbers, but are explaining also differences that we have.  This is quite important for us because the current account without any cost, current account also without any branches, so branch material activity, so allow us to have the reduction in terms of people we are having in the Retail division.</p>
          <p>Quarter-on-quarter we are down by 3.8%.  As I said, there is also an affect by BPH and also the asset management services have fallen clearly down, you've seen the numbers, so falling in terms of revenues. Having managed integration of the two banks now we started to grow quite well in the country.</p>
          <p>Trading income, we are back in the positive territory with 484 million of positive contribution, 220 are coming from MIB, 264 are coming from the Corporate Center, partially from CEE region and partially also from the mark-to-market on the Generali option, that having a decrease in price had a positive effect in terms of trading income.</p>
          <p>So the revenues across the different divisions are the one we are seeing here.  This is on the Group the different revenues with year-on-year growth Payroll division.  As you can see, we have quite a good growth in Central Eastern Europe, a good growth in Retail and Corporate, Private is slightly down mainly due to the actual market condition.  Then we have a negative impact on asset management in MIB. MIB, as we said, with a change in the sign which is quite important for us.</p>
          <p>Contribution of the different countries in Central Eastern Europe. First of all, the key element for us of the significant diversification is quite important. As you can see, we have a reduction of the Polish contribution, which is a due.</p>
          <p>Later on there will be a chat on Poland that Bank Pekao has also presented its own results today and Pekao is really doing quite well having managed the integration now of BPH. But you can see that the other countries are more than offsetting the difference of Pekao.</p>
          <p>We have quite a good contribution from Turkey.  I would like to stress as the positive decision of two days ago of the court &#x2013; or yesterday or two days ago, I don't remember.  It was two days ago in Turkey of the Constitutional Court, which really confirm the positive view we have of the country.</p>
          <p>Russia is growing fantastically well, but I have to say that also the new acquired banks, Ukraine and ATF are starting to work really well. We had a fantastic June, but also total the second quarter has been a really good.</p>
          <p>We are growing in all the different lines based on net customer's loans, so customer's deposits and in terms of branches. In terms of branches is also interesting what you see at the bottom. We went up by 142 branches despite of the fact that we have 99 branches, more branches in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>This is a quite an important element because we are not only opening branches, but we are also re-qualifying our network. So is the quality of the network is improving significantly in all the different countries. This is something that is going on everywhere, I would say. It's also quite good the growth we are having in terms of deposits, both in Russia and in Turkey.</p>
          <p>I was talking of Poland, I think that this chart is quite important.  As you remember, we had a very painful integration process with BPH. Our colleagues managed this integration fantastically well and today we are already seeing a change, significant change in the base of the bank, the commercial base. You'll see that in the second quarter we are growing by 2% in terms of revenues, so we started again to grow and we are sure that the capability of Pekao to exploit all the value coming from this integration is significantly applicable.</p>
          <p>Talking of MIB, I have said that we had 800 million of positive revenues in the quarter.  We have a positive contribution from the structured credit business by 194 million with a negligible impact form the ABS portfolio, minus 23 million.  And a positive impact from the other credit related activities, 217 million positive.</p>
          <p>So at the end we are quite satisfied with these numbers, which are also showing the quality of the portfolio. We will see some further information on the ABS... <mark type="audio gap" /> And so the total revenues are at 302 million with a growth of 14% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe is growing by 19%. Why I'm stressing this <mark type="audio gap" /> with again what we declare in the three-year plan presentation that MIB is great value adder to our franchise, potential.</p>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe and Corporate customer across also the other three Western European countries. ABS portfolio went down by 1.1 billion. As I said, we had 100 million of amortization, 600 million of selective selling, 400 million of Forex and other effects, so we are down at 11.6 billion. We had no significant inherent losses and continued good performance of the underlying assets.</p>
          <p>The portfolio do have an average life of four years. At the end of '010 we'll have 44% of the remaining portfolio, so we are continuously going down from today.  We do expect to have a 17% reduction before the year end.</p>
          <p>And then they file the reduction by 21% of the following year and now they're 18% '010. So clearly, this reduction is without considering any further dismissal. So we do expect to be even lower than that during the time.</p>
          <p>Cost, also on the cost side we are delivering the promise we made. We have planned operating expenses, normalized, are down by 1.1%. In Western Europe, in Central Eastern Europe we are investing significantly.</p>
          <p>So as you can see at the Group level, we have a year-on-year growth by 8.4% stated and the reduction normalized by 1.1%.Clearly the main driver of this cost containment is the personnel cost, the HR cost.</p>
          <p>We are down by 3.8% in Western Europe.  Thanks to full time equivalents are down by 1,950 people net of perimeter changes, which is more than compensating the contract renewals and balancing the growth in Central Eastern Europe, where we are going up year-on-year by 12.9%. The other costs have normalized, is we think quite remarkable, to minus 2.4% as a normalized cost growth in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Full time equivalent, there has been quarter-on-quarter on a growth by 387 people. This is a combination of reduction in Western Europe and growth in Central Eastern Europe, which is in line with what we declared during the three-year plan presentation.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk, I think that also this chart is quite important. Without a cost in Forex and perimeter we would be at 682, while one year ago we were at 659. With these changes we are at 713.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk is in line with the previous year, 1 basis point higher, slightly lower than the first quarter.  We had quite a positive number in MIB.  Clearly Corporate is performing quite well.</p>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe is going down due to the changes in perimeter.  Clearly ATF and Ukrsotsbank had a higher cost of risk than the other countries. So at the end at the Group level we are stable.</p>
          <p>I will show something of Retail, here we are seeing we are going up from 75 basis points to 113 year-on-year. This is due to the change in the coverage ratio in the watchlist in former Capitalia.  So we are aligned to the only credit standard. We have a deterioration in mortgages, which we have talked very clearly during the presentation of the three-year plan that we have already intervened on that with a review of the risk appetite and delinquency management for this third party distributed mortgages and tighter selection of dealers.</p>
          <p>We continue to have a very good trend in Germany and Austria. We have an exceptionally low provision on loans in MIB and the major LBO position are maintaining a very good credit standing. We had, despite of the new lease we had done in the first half of this year, a reduction in the LBO position, you will see later on a chart.</p>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe, we have a very limited retail Forex lending, which is continuously monitored by the Divisional Risk Officer.  We don't have Forex lending in Pekao, new Forex lending in Pekao and really a negligible Retail Forex lending in Turkey.</p>
          <p>The provisioning trend in the first half are in line or slightly better than expected. When we talk of 19 per loans, we are at 16.5 billion, so we have a stable number, we are down by 2.5% on the year end. The percentage on total loans is down by 20 basis points from the year end and the coverage ratio is also 1.1% higher than what we had at the year end.</p>
          <p>Talking of non-operating items, you can see we have a 77 million provision for risk and charges, 67 million of integration cost, net write-downs is another 13, we have the disposal of BHP, MasterCard and FIMIT with positive income from investment.</p>
          <p>Taxes, the tax rate is down 2 to 22.6%.  On the year basis it's likely higher, the expected tax rate.  Minorities 142 million, 77 million of PPA, so we go down to 1.8, &#x20AC;66 million of net profit by the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>It's quite important to say that since you have seen the official announcement also, the segment we have done with Parmalat is completely included in the these numbers.</p>
          <p>So summing up, quarter one at 555 in Basel I, about 5.7 in Basel II, so is completely in line with the target we have by the year end up of being at 6.2 in terms of quarter one for the year end.  The second quarter is also reflecting our trends in terms of franchises.</p>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe remain a powerful growth engine. We have a very resilient Commercial bank in Western Europe and MIB is back to positive revenues despite of this difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>There are no further changes on MAV for regular activities and a solid asset quality, which is again confirmed, of we have a good risk profile and risk management. Clearly, the market conditions remain challenging.</p>
          <p>The cost containment in Western Europe are offsetting the investments we are doing in Central Eastern Europe. Now with Ranieri and with all the colleagues we are more than happy in answering to all your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Fabrizio Bernardi, Deutsche Bank. Can you tell us a why we have growing conduits on Slide Page 47? And second, if this is nothing &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; related to the results of the second quarter, but could you share with us and your thoughts regarding what is happening on Mediobanca, which is having a big shareholding of UniCredit? It seems that there a bit of problems concerning the governance and maybe you can help us in finding, not a solution but a better idea on this strange issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the conduits are customer-driven conduits, as you can see from the presentation, are fully consolidated. So I'm not changing the capital positions. This is a way of factorizing credit of our customers. So our vehicle in which we have credits of our customers that we package it exactly as factoring, and we use this vehicle, which is the most efficient one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> sorry. There are also some droves of existing on-use commitments. But one thing is clear also at the same time we have been amortizing as Bavaria Universal Funding, the arbitrage one. So by year-end we expect to have only client-related activity in those conduits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The bank pays off all in the customer conduit. Okay? Mediobanca, I think that quite a lot has been already said. There are talks in the Corporate Governance Committee and in the Supervisory Board in order to analyze what is the best solution, in terms of corporate governance &#x2013; as you know, I'm nor in one, nor in the other. Clearly, from our perspective what is important is to find the solution which is the best in terms of value creation for the shareholders. We are a shareholder we are interested only in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question from the conference call is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Profumo and everybody else. It's Marcello Zanardo of KBW. The first question is really a detailed question. If I look at the number from your loans, there is a 22% increase at the gross level and 18% at the net level. And if I look at the doubtful loans there is a 8% increase. Now looking at the slide on Page 17, you said that the deterioration from the retail, mainly Italy, is also driven by Capitalia. Then you had an issue with mainly some third-party on the mortgage side. Can you tell us today, how is &#x2013; are we seeing, basically, the peak of these? Are you halfway through the problems on the retail side? Should we expect a continuation of increasing in provision to cover Capitalia? And is it just the Capitalia issue or a part from the third-party?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>ARPUs in Generali?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Generali's handed out 40 million for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as retail provisioning is concerned, the provisions have increased by approximately 27 basis point on risk-weighted assets in the quarter. So in the half year, half-year-on-half-year, of this increase 11 basis point relates to the alignment of the Capitalia provisioning practice &#x2013; Capitalia or the provision is much, much less than we paid last year. Three is a part of mix affect over the last two years, the growth of consumer loans as more business has been markedly higher than mortgage, while 13 basis point is a deterioration in the overall credit scenario. That is mainly coming from mortgage, mortgage associated to dealers' origination and to SOPA to the origination into variable rate especially of 2006 and 2007 vintage. A number of actions have been taken on both the underwriting as well as the management of the portfolio, so that we don't expect further deterioration in the provisioning level for the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In any case, back on corporates, I think that as we stated in July or the end of June at our capital market days, we are not seeing any &#x2013; actually we see the economy &#x2013; the performance of our corporate clients being quiet resilient. We, on the MIB side for sure as we are basically marking to market all the exposure you wouldn't see in that line. The LBO portfolio, as mentioned before, is going through impairment tests every month and every quarter, so there is no sign of deterioration. So that's a reflection of actual results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a final question on the retail. Is the deterioration <mark type="audio gap" /> on the mortgages?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Hi. <mark type="inaudible" /> Eugenio Cicconetti from Dresdner Kleinwort. Only one question so I have to ask the question on capital. In your 6.2% Core Tier 1 Ratio, have you already target &#x2013; have you already factoring in an eventual write-down in your LBO portfolio? And a second question <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, no, there are no write-downs in the LBO portfolio because we do not respect to have any write-downs. The credit quality is quite good. As we said, we went through, we go through a continuous impairment test. If you go to Page 48 on the annex, you can see also that there have been a reduction down to 4.3 billion of the portfolio despite of the fact that we had also new generation of these that are sold on the market. So we do not see any reason for having any write-downs in this portfolio. As we always said, this is valued on a cost basis. There are no recognition fees. So again, we can't have a loss if we don't tell a loss. Sorry for that but this is the case.</p>
          <p>Talking of disposal, clearly, we are working on different activities, part of them &#x2013; a very small portion &#x2013; will be finalized in the third quarter but mainly in the fourth quarter. As I said before, we are perfectly on track on our target and we have different activities undergoing. When the deal will be finalized, we will communicate the different deals. We fully confirm the 6.2 target.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start from the real estate initiatives. This is one of the potential options for having the famous 49 basket &#x2013; 49 basis point basket, so it's one of them. And to say very openly that the counterpart of the SGA are better; it's not yet decided. So this is just to clarify the elements. So is a correct only the information on the lid, but I spoke of that during the presentation of the three-year plan. I said that on a question, are you considering a real estate disposal as has been done by other players? And the answer has been, yes. So is one of the option, we will see if this will be one of the activities we will realize.</p>
          <p>In order to have an answer to the question of Cicconetti, the famous missing 12 basis point. But as we said, there are different options. Retail costs, we have to consider that a significant portion of the TFR of which I was talking is related to retail, so this is not normalized. If I remember correctly, it's 125 million; the HR cost for the TFR in retail. So if you take out the 125, the gross is completely different. The asset, sorry, the interbank exposure, I will leave the floor to Ranieri.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we look at the balance sheet, obviously, we need to look at the deposit for banks, but you'd also need to look at loans and receivables. We think, as you can see, there is also a significant increase of the loans to banks. So the net amount vis-&#xE0;-vis, the year-end 2007, in reality, it's only 5 billion on the interbank market. So I think it's not appropriate to look at completely separate in this part of the funding activity in terms of what type of sources do we access in the market. We are very fortunate that we are considering a very good counterpart. In that sense, we do have a significant amount of activity also with the other banks.</p>

          <p>As far as the Picar is concerned, let me say that while the overall performance on total deposits has not been as strong, interesting enough is the result of an opposite performance of retail deposits growing pretty well and corporate deposits. In fact, corporate deposits went down by 5.5%, mainly impacted by a decrease in the deposits over financial, non-banking and public institutions. While on the contrary, the retail deposits went up. This is from December to June, by 5.7%, being positive both in the retail slot, and in retail Forex growth. So as not an elits more an element, let me say, of volatility typical with institutional deposits, but not at all a problem with the core deposit performance.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well basically I think as you remember in the first quarter we had a quite severe dislocation between the performance of cash bonds versus CDS and something that has normalized a lot in the second quarter and actually a big chunk of this is due to a recovery of the mark-to-market of the basis risk; the rest &#x2013; the ABS portfolio &#x2013; lost 23 million. Then also we had some day-to-day activity, but I would say that the good half of what has been performed is the write-back of the famous 300 million of that we lost in the first quarter in terms of mark-to-market on basis risk.</p>

      <speaker id="4">

          <p>The next question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capitalia we talk &#x2013;  Roberto, but clearly it's not a matter of the tax &#x2013; it's a matter of the new lease, so you are aligning the provision on the new generated <mark type="inaudible" /> you can't align the tax. But anyway &#x2013; Roberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. In fact what we've been doing has been to implement fully automated monitoring system, but clearly have been quite strict and precise, can generate the type of alignments that we are seeing. When it comes to Italian mortgage, mainly it is fair positive even, but not entirely. Let's say that the deterioration is approximately 70% dealer driven,  25% from own mortgage origination.</p>
          <p>Before I forgot to answer the question about the asset quality in CEE. In CEE, we saw an increase in the provisioning level of the CEE division, which is mainly due to &#x2013; on one side, the two new countries out there &#x2013; the perimeter being Kazakhstan and Ukraine. On the other side to the fact that in the first quarter, we had a significant exceptional release of provisions that is not being repeated in the second quarter. While we have in the context of Poland quite a positive performance, here the provisioning level is now down to 31 basis points, which means the 26 bps are less that the comparable quarter of 2007.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening, it's Jernej here from Goldman. Given that we have to limit our questions, I'm going to ask a question on the MIB division. Given the number of moving parts, can you just remind us what the nominal value of the portfolio is? Although you might have said it's 11.6 billion once the nominal value ends. Within that, I'm just trying to figure out what the current mark is on the portfolio as of Poland. Are you able to tell us also on the remaining I think it's &#x2013; I calculated it as 1 billion euros, roughly of US ABS is &#x2013; what the nominal and market value of that proportion is?</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-on question also relating to MIB. There is a statement in the presentation that says that market conditions remain challenging. Should we be using the result in Q2 of MIB as a run rate for the rest of the year? Or from where you stand today, I am assuming you have the end July mark-to-market from your ABS Group already, whether we should be expecting another negative mark in Q3, or is that all behind us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the 11.6 billion of the ABS portfolio market value translating to an outstanding notional value of 12.8 billion. So &#x2013; which is pretty much in line with what we had been communicated in the past. I would say that's growing into making forecast on the rest of the year, I think we pointed out clearly that the situation remained challenging. I think I cannot really add anything more than some of my fellow competitors already stated very clearly. The situation in the marketplace continues to be very challenging, very volatile and very difficult to predict the outcome for any months, not to talk about quarters. So I will refrain to make a forecast on this.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening. A simple question on tax rate, which was it seems to me an unusually low in the second quarter '08. I wonder if there was something peculiar to highlight on that especially because it seems to me there was increasing taxation in Italy in recent months. The second question, rapidly on retail provisions, I wonder if the guidance of saying that it would not be factored into consideration is excluding the alignment on Capitalia was leased or it is not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the taxation, indeed, the taxation is low compared to the regular tax, although we do expect always a lower tax rate in the second quarter driven also by the dividends, which obviously carry a different taxation than the rest. By the way, we did include, obviously, the new taxation law that's been enacted in June. However, you can consider that there are probably 100 million of one-offs or positive one-offs in this case. You know that in July, we actually make the tax return for the previous year and actually had a couple of positive surprises. In terms of the tax rate, however, for the outlook and for the average of the year, we would expect, in any case, a relatively low tax rate although higher than the one in the second quarter. But we will be running at around 23, may be slightly worse than 23, but around that number for the total year.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have three questions. The first two are related to net fees. One is just a clarification. I have seen that the negative <mark type="audio gap" /> quarter. The second question is on the addition of net fees, if possible, if we can consider the minus 15% that we have seen in the second quarter has the worst decrease for this year? Or if you believe that a negative impact will go ahead in the third quarter? And finally, if you just can clarify your position on the stake in Atlantia, because we have seen many rumors, so I would like to have a better idea what is the strategy there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The negative fees are related to bonds. When we sell bonds, we have a negative fees set class with an EPH effect. Minus 15% in terms of fees year-on-year. The second quarter last year has been quite good, mainly in Germany, in terms of fees. So I would expect that this is the peak in terms of negative. We have to consider asset management, which is already affected by the outflows and partially we are recovering in interest margin in the retail network. Atlantia, as we said, we are considering any potential option for varying our participation. Clearly, we do also see the research made by, not only by our people but also by many other analysts that are considering the Atlantia price as significant. The actual Atlantia price significantly low in relation to the real value of the company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is on the EPS guidance for this year. I wonder whether after $0.21 bookings first half, you were able to confirm your guidance of 52 &#x2013; $0.56 and if this is the case, if you can help us out in understanding what portion of &#x2013; let's say &#x2013; non-recurring items are you including this estimate?. Because from the known element, I can calculate approximately 1.4, 1.5 billion; in this case, if we take into consideration the $0.52 it will be a clean base of $0.42. So I was wondering if you can let us know if this $0.42 is a clean base, which you have in mind for this year? And if I may, two clarifications on capital; what is the dividend later, which are accruing in the capital evolution? And if it possible, I'd like to understand why risk-weighted assets are going down on Basel I and flat on Basel II? Thank you.</p>

          <p>The question on the risk-weighted asset Basel I or Basel II? Obviously, Basel I numbers are final numbers; as we said, Basel II numbers are not yet final numbers. Basel II will be the final calculation would be actually finalized in September. There is a time lag between the calculation, unfortunately, in the reporting season in this case. With regard of the capital; yes, indeed, the capital does take into account and, of course, is a payment of dividend. As we said last time the recent policies of very modest growth on dividend per share. <mark type="inaudible" /> On the guidance?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and I have three questions. Sorry that may be one of them have been already been answered. The first one is on Parmalat because it seems impossible that you fully provision this 270 million in the second quarter. So was it already partially provisioned before? And if this is the case, how much has been the remaining provision in the second quarter? Second question is on the overdraft commission, whereas on the newspaper that starting from second half, you should be ready to eliminate overdraft commissions. Is this correct? And if this is the case, what is going to be the impact in the third quarter? Just to have an idea of how much it will impact and it's a thing that is going to be recovered by other items? And third question is, again, on Generali. If I understood properly, you had a positive 140 million of one-off on Generali relating to the convertible, but I'm not sure I got your answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the Generali, indeed, we are the &#x2013; it's not a one-off; it's the mark-to-market of the Generali, as we always have, is for 140 million that are or in the trading profit line. With the regard to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, of course. On the changeable effect, is mark-to-market on the exchangeable with Generali. With regard to Parmalat, yes, indeed; there were provisions before made in anticipation of potential settlements. And therefore, I can confirm that the second half &#x2013; the numbers through June do include the full amount of the settlement announced today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

Existing customers will be allowed to switch into these products if they want from year end. But in any case, products with overdraft commission will absolutely remain in the shelf or vase. This means that in the next two quarters, we don't see any meaningful impact in the profitability.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Before you said that you had a positive impact from the mark-to-market over the structure of credit portfolio of around 300 million, which is offsetting the valuation loss that you had in Q1. I don't know if you can give us an idea of the evolution that you expect in terms of mark-to-market for the remaining part of the year? And the second question, I think you already partially answered. On the Generali, you have a 140 million positive effect in Q2. Could you remind us what is the overall positive effect on the first half of the Generali exchangeable? And also, I don't know if you can give us an idea on the positive effect in terms of basis point on Core Tier 1 once you come to the expiration of the convertible? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, there is a misunderstanding. The first quarter, we had a loss of 300 millions on credit-related activities outside the ABS book. In the second quarter, this segment reported a profit of 217; so that's what I was referring to. So this is where we had mainly driven by the basis risk that we had on the first quarter that translated into losses and now we've got the right base. Right. Is it clear? And in terms of outlook for mark-to-markets, obviously, as I said before, is a quite challenging environment. It's very difficult to have a clear picture on mark-to-market outlook. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the Generali, actually, we had a very similar amount &#x2013; almost identical in the first quarter &#x2013; so the total is about 280 million of positive mark-to-market of the Generali exchangeable. With regard of the effect in terms of the Core Tier 1, clearly, it will depend on the price of the Generali at the moment of the expiration of the exchangeable; assuming that the exchangeable is at the money at the moment of the expiration, which is about end of November, beginning of December. That will have an impact on Core Tier 1 to a tune of four to five basis points.</p>
