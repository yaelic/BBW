        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Welcome to the results of the Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic Interim for 2011. As I think most of you know, I am James Riley, the Group Finance Director, and I will be providing you with an overview of the 2011 performance for the Group for the first six months.</p>
          <p>Firstly, as usual, I might just remind you of the structure of the Jardine Matheson, although, I am quite sure most of you are all familiar with it. Jardine Pacific, Jardine Motors, Jardine Lloyd Thompson and Jardine Strategic are directly held by Jardine Matheson.</p>
          <p>Jardine Strategic itself then holds interest in Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage and Rothschild. Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage holds a 50% interest in Astra and then in addition to these holdings, Jardine Strategic holds a 54.7% interest in its parent, Jardine Matheson, which has increased from 15.3% since the end of last year.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you can see the immediate interest held in each of the Group companies. The effective economic interests that that represents the JMH from an accounting perspective. And the share of profit, which we derive from each of the main Group companies in the first half of 2011. When we met in March, Anthony Nightingale mentioned that 2011 was off to a good start, but the following a strong performance in 2010, it would be difficult to achieve similar levels of growth in 2011.</p>
          <p>In particular, we knew that there would a lower underlying profit contribution from Hongkong Land due to the reduced profit coming from residential property project completions during the year. With this in mind, I'm very pleased to say that the results for the first half are ahead of what we had been expecting at that point, with Astra and Dairy Farm delivering particularly strong performances. A couple of definitional points before I get into the results. The Group uses underlying profit attributable to shareholders as its key earnings performance measure, and to keep things simple, I'll be referring to this as underlying profit.</p>
          <p>This measure excludes non-trading items, which we identified and explained separately in order to provide a clear understanding of the ongoing business performance of the Group. You should also note that all dollar figures mentioned will be U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Jardine Matheson's underlying profit for the first six months of 2011 was $725 million, an increase of 9% over the same period in 2010. Underlying earnings per share were also 9% higher at $2.01. The Group's profit before tax increased by 14% to $2.4 billion, and revenue including 100% of the revenue from associates and joint ventures was $27.4 billion, compared to $22.8 billion in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>The Group's share of increases in investment property values in Hongkong Land and Jardine Pacific at the end of June gave rise to a net profit of $1.4 billion, which has to be taken through the profit and loss account. Including this and other non-trading items, the Group's profit attributable to shareholders was $2.2 billion for the first six months, compared with $1.1 billion for the same period in 2010. As a point of detail, the comparative figures for non-trading items have been restated as of this stage last year, we were still having to provide deferred tax on the revaluation of investment properties. The board has declared an interim dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10%.</p>
          <p>Before discussing the results in more detail, I would like to highlight some of the key developments within the Group during the first half. Hongkong Land has expanded its presence in Southeast Asia with the conditional acquisition of four sites in Phnom Penh in Cambodia. In Macau the marketing of the residences and apartments at Mandarin Oriental is progressing well, an 89% of units are now sold.</p>
          <p>On the Mainland, Hongkong Land remains very active with three residential projects underway in Shenyang, three in Chongqing and another in Chengdu. In Hong Kong, the Group is to redevelop a retail building at Exchange Square, currently known as The Forum, into 4000 square meters of new office space. And in Singapore, MCL land had a successful launch of a new 400-unit residential development, Terrasse, and acquired a new 600-unit development site in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:03).</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm continues its expansion efforts on the Mainland, where Mannings now has over 170 stores. Maxim's disposed of its minority interest in Starbucks operations in Southern China, but has increased its interest in the Hong Kong and Macau franchises, which are now wholly-owned by the Group. Maxim's also continues to open new restaurants in Guangdong. The license for the Group's first hypermarket in Vietnam has been secured and the targeted opening date is set for early next year.</p>
          <p>Jardine Pacific has taken full ownership of the Pizza Hut operation in Vietnam and has also purchased a 25% interest in KFC, Vietnam. Also in Jardine Pacific, JOS has acquired the SiS IT distribution business, which has strongly contributed to its earnings in the first half.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental opened its much-heralded new hotel in Paris last month, bringing the total number of hotels in operation 27 with the further 14 under development. In London, the residences at Mandarin Oriental at Hyde Park are now complete and this project has produced additional income from branding rights.</p>
          <p>Jardine Lloyd Thompson's start to the year was better than expected with particularly strong contributions coming from Asia and Latin America. Agreement has been reached to acquire one of the leading insurance broking companies in Chile with the closing targeted for September.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, Jardine Motors recently bought the Wayside Group, which holds 22 dealerships, representing Volkswagen, Audi, BMW and Toyota. This reaffirms, I think, the Group's long-term confidence in this business despite challenging market conditions in the near-term. Elsewhere in the Group's Motors portfolio, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang has expanded its network with the acquisition of the authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer in Penang.</p>
          <p>At United Tractors, a rights issue was completed in May, which raised over $700 million, which will be used to fund its operational requirements and the purchase of new investments including coal mines and coal mine infrastructure.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to discussing the financial results in more detail.</p>
          <p>The Group's revenue, including associates, over the period increased by 20% year-on-year to $27.4 billion. As with last year, the largest revenue contribution was from Dairy Farm and Astra, although, the biggest increase came from Jardine Pacific, because of the acquisition of the SiS business by Jardine OneSolution. Hongkong Land's revenues were lower due to the reduction in residential completions.</p>
          <p>Now to underlying profit. The picture across the broad &#x2013; the board was somewhat mixed. The key to the Group's increased earnings in the first half were the strong growth coming both Astra and Dairy Farm. Jardine Pacific's performance is probably best characterized as steady with the increased earnings being primarily attributable to the acquisition of a large shareholding in HACTL and the acquisition of the SiS business by JOS.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, the lower contribution from Jardine Motors reflects the fact that the 2010 first half figures included a property profit from the United Kingdom business. This aside, however, both the U.K. Motor business and the China business generated somewhat lower profits during the period.</p>
          <p>The JLT contribution here is shown as being down, when in fact the published JLT results indicate an encouraging 9% rise in earnings. This is due to our treatment of the write-back in 2010 of a material tax provision taken at the underlying level. JLT took the view that this was non-recurring in nature, whereas we took the view that when a provision is made against trading or non-trading, if released, it should be treated in the same way.</p>
          <p>Hongkong Land's contribution was well down as we warned it would be at the time of the 2010 results presentation. In fact, the outcome so far this year has been rather better than we had envisaged for Hongkong Land with a strong uptick in rental reversion levels and sales of completed residential units at somewhat higher prices.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I should mention the corporate line, which includes the central costs and financing income and charges that Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic and Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, and income from the Group's smaller investments. The net cost in this line continued to fall largely due to the lower financing costs. Overall, therefore the individual results, I have mentioned very little mix, but the total underlying results showed an encouraging 9% increase on the prior period.</p>
          <p>Non-trading items for the half produced a profit of $1.5 billion. The major components of this aroused from an upward revaluation of Hongkong Land's investment property portfolio, with the rise in property values averaging some 17%, driven by increasing rental levels rather than any change in the cap rates being used by the valuers. There was also a $31 million revaluation gain on Hong Kong residential properties owned on the Jardine Pacific.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to take you through the individual operating businesses before returning to the balance sheet and the outlook for the second half. First the businesses, we Group, as Jardine Pacific. Hong Kong Air Cargo terminals the largest of Jardine Pacific's interests produced a 13% increase in its contribution due to the fact that Jardine Pacific increased its stake in this business from 25% to 42% in May last year.</p>
          <p>HACTL as a whole, actually saw its earnings full by 19% in the first half with Cargo throughput falling by 5%. The year began with positive year-on-year volume comparisons, but these turn negative in April and remain negative in May and June.</p>
          <p>Jardine Schindler generated higher profits from new installations and continues to grow its maintenance portfolios across the region. There have been two notable changes, I think in the way this business makes its profits in the last few years. Five years ago, it made all of its profits on maintenance, whereas now it achieves an excellent contribution from both new installation and maintenance.</p>
          <p>And secondly five years ago, more than 80% of its profit came from Hong Kong, whereas now that percentage has fallen to 53% and it makes a profit in all of the 12 territories where it operates in the region.</p>
          <p>Jardine Restaurant's Pizza Hut operations in Hong Kong and Taiwan achieved like-for-like sales growth. Same-store profits were up in Hong Kong, but slightly down in Taiwan. The KFC franchise in Taiwan, which was acquired in 2010 produced a stable year-on-year earnings performance despite the increase in the franchise fee payable from 1% to 2%.</p>
          <p>Over the next two years, this will continue to rise, until it reaches the normal YUM! franchise level of 6%. JOS recorded significantly higher turnover, hence following its recent acquisition of the SiS business. And the combined business has benefited in particular from strong demand for smartphone products in the region.</p>

          <p>The acquisition has more than met our pre-acquisition expectations to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>JEC's earnings were flat, but it should be noted that the 2010 comparative figure benefited from one-off items at $1.1 million, which were noted at the time, JEC continues to secure new projects across the region, including building systems contract in Thailand and small infrastructure projects in the Philippines.</p>
          <p>Gammon's first half earnings were a considerable disappointment.. In the last 18 months, two difficult projects have plagued Gammon's results, these being the <mark type="ph" /> Tama (14:11) project in Hong Kong and the Woodlands Interchange in Singapore. The first half saw further provisions on Woodlands, but was also held back by the timing of profit recognition. We would expect to see a considerable improvement in the earnings performance in the second half absence any further problems arising on major projects.</p>
          <p>The first half also saw some important project wins including a significant contract on the high speed rail link in Hong Kong. Jardine Aviation Services results improved with the help of greater flight frequencies, but Jardine Shipping Services was hit by declines both in rates and cargo volumes in its main areas of operation.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Jardine Motors, which recorded an underlying profit of $39 million for the period, a decrease of 31% from the $57 million earned in 2010. The higher 2010 figure included a one-off gain of $6 million in property disposals in the U.K. Zung Fu in Hong Kong and Macau produced a satisfactory performance with higher deliveries of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars. In China, Zung Fu has grown its unit sales strongly on the back of an expanding network and continuing healthy demand. Unfortunately, although margins on imported cars remain satisfactory, margins on CKD units adversely affected the overall performance of the operation.</p>
          <p>Despite this, the Mainland continued to produce more than 50% of Zung Fu's profit and it now has 18 outlets in Southern China with a further six under development. In the United Kingdom, the Group's dealerships faced challenging condition with declining new vehicle sales and reduced margins. The recent acquisition of the Wayside business for &#xA3;46 million in May should benefit the full year result.</p>
          <p>Jardine Lloyd Thompson delivered a strong trading performance for the first half. Notwithstanding a continued weak insurance market rating environment and subdued GDP growth of the more mature economies in which you trade. Underlying earnings in pounds increased by 9%, reflecting continued investments in the business, particularly through the recruitment of leading industry professionals in a number of its business areas, where it sees opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>The first half earnings included useful contributions from the Asian and Latin American operations, as I've said, both of which are being expanded. A cost rationalization program implemented over the last two years moving back office jobs to India and reorganizing processes is expected to have cut almost &#xA3;20 million in annual costs from the overall operation by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>It is also worth noting that the earnings growth of the last few years has been achieved despite the impact of the low interest rate environment on investment income, which represented some 20% trading profit in 2007 and is now down to less than 5%.</p>
          <p>That completes my review of the businesses held directly under Jardine Matheson.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Jardine Strategic, which achieved underlying profits of $766 million, an increase of 10% from the same period in 2010. The board has improved &#x2013; has approved an interim dividend of $0.065 per share, an increase of 8% from last year. The net asset value per share, we show for Jardine Strategic is calculated by reference to the market value of the underlying investments held by the entity.</p>
          <p>As at the 30th June, this was $54.58, up 15% from the 31st of December 2010. Hongkong Land's commercial property portfolio continued to benefit from favorable markets, but reduced residential completions led to the underlying profit for the period declining by 23% to $365 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>This together with Hongkong Land's $3.4 billion revaluation gain led to a profit attributable to shareholders of $3.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Commercial segment, rental reversions were generally positive in the office portfolio, as strong demand continued. At the end of June, total office vacancy in Hong Kong was 2.5%, and the retail portfolio was fully occupied.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, there was no significant vacancy in the existing portfolio and the Group is now benefiting from the addition of the first two towers of Marina Bay Financial Centre, which were completed in 2010. The third tower, which is already some 60% pre-let, will complete next year.</p>
          <p>In the residential sector, there were further sales of units at The Serenade in Hong Kong and The Residences and Apartments at Mandarin Oriental in Macau. In Singapore, MCL Land has handed over to buyers units in the Peak@Balmeg, which is the only project that it expects to complete during 2011. It also launched a new development, Terrasse, in May, which will be completed in 2014. Sales of 60% have been achieved to-date. An additional residential development site was acquired in Singapore on which some 600 high-rise apartments will be built. In Mainland China, sales continued at Maple Place in Beijing and Bamboo Grove in Chongqing.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm enjoyed stable trading conditions in its principal months across markets &#x2013; across Asia in the first half. Sales including 100% of associates increased by 16% to $5 billion, while underlying net profit rose 18% to $216 million.</p>
          <p>Exchange rate movements enhanced both sales and earnings by some 5%. Overall, margins remained steady with growth being achieved through like-for-like sales growth. Inflation was clearly a contributor to this, and whilst cost increases have been passed on to consumers in part, cost efficiencies have also been important in maintaining margins.</p>
          <p>The number of Dairy Farms outlets actually declined in the period due in part to the sale of its Starbucks Southern China interest by Maxim's and also to the rationalization of underperforming outlets by a number of banners.</p>
          <p>The Group's Hong Kong operations produced a good result, particularly the Mannings business. In Taiwan, Wellcome's business stabilized, whilst IKEA performed well.</p>
          <p>7-Eleven has achieved excellent like-for-like sales growth in South China and the Mannings chain there continues to be expanded in focused hubs. Maxim's probably saw more cost inflation in its business than the rest of Dairy Farm, yet was still able to achieve excellent profit growth.</p>
          <p>Good performances were seen across the Group's Malaysian operations and there was further expansion in all store formats in Indonesia. The Singapore businesses also achieved steady growth.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental's underlying profit for the period rose from $13 million to $33 million. The underlying profit figure includes the $16 million in branding fees received from the One Hyde Park complex adjacent to its London hotel and the pre-opening expenses of $11 million incurred on the new Paris hotel, which opened at the end of June. The Paris hotel won't have its full room inventory until the fourth quarter. In fact, rates and occupancy improved materially across most of Mandarin's portfolio. From an earnings perspective, the most material contributors to the profit improvement were its two wholly-owned Hong Kong hotels, London, New York and Singapore.</p>
          <p>Offsetting these improvements though were losses recorded from the Tokyo hotel, where occupancy declined sharply following the earthquake and tsunami. Even now, occupancy in Tokyo remains well below the norm and it may be a few months before it returns to its formal levels.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage reported underlying profit up by 37% to $485 million. As ever, the principal contribution for this came from Astra, which I'll come on to in a moment. You'll recall that we report Astra under a separate line in our segment analysis, and include Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's corporate costs under the Group's corporate line. Hence it is only the non-Astra Motor segment that gets included within our JC&amp;C disclosure line, which is reported here as other motor interests.</p>
          <p>This showed earnings down slightly over the six-month period. Profit from the Singapore Motor's operations fell following a sharp reduction in the government quota for new vehicle sales. In Vietnam, Truong Hai Auto Corporation made a lower contribution, despite higher unit sales, due primarily to increased finance costs and the weaker dong.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, the contribution from Tunas Ridean was flat as a higher profit from its automotive activities was offset by lower earnings in its finance and rental businesses. And in Malaysia, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang saw some earnings improvement due to higher sales.</p>
          <p>Astra reported a net profit of $985 million under Indonesian accounting standards for the first half of 2011, 33% up on the previous year. This resulted in the contribution to Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage increasing to $491 million in IFRS terms, the greater percentage increase of 41% being mainly due to the strengthening of the rupiah over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>During the period, the Indonesian economy continued to grow, supported by stable inflation, high commodity prices, and the availability of consumer financing at affordable interest rates. As a result, the contribution from Astra's automotive operations benefited from robust demand both for two wheelers and four wheelers, with the market for both growing by some 13%.</p>
          <p>Astra's market share for four wheelers slipped marginally from 56% to 55%, whilst for motorcycles, it increased from 46% to 51%.</p>
          <p>The increased contribution from Astra's consumer finance operations reflected loan book growth, reduced offshore funding costs and stable credit experience. The amount financed in the first half grew by 15%, including balances financed through joint financing without recourse.</p>
          <p>Group insurance company, Asuransi Astra Buana, generated a modest improvement in earnings and Astra's 45%-held joint venture, Bank Permata, reported a 33% increase in net income for the first half as 36% growth in its loan book more than compensated for lower net interest margins.</p>
          <p>Astra Agro Lestari, Astra's listed agribusiness saw its earnings double in rupiah terms and increased by even more in U.S. dollar terms as it benefited from a 22% increase in crude palm prices and 26% increase in its CPA production.</p>
          <p>United Tractors, which is Astra's listed heavy equipment and mining subsidiary and 60% owned also produced strong results. In UT itself, Komatsu heavy equipment sales rose 59% to 4,333 units and this was the principal factor in earnings growth. There was only a modest improvement in the contribution from <mark type="ph" /> Parma, though (27:46) with increases in mining volumes being offset by the effect of unfavorable weather conditions and a weak U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I should mention our other investments held under Jardine Strategic. There has been no change in these holdings during the period. The earnings contribution from Rothschild, which is equity accounted was similar to 2010. Together with the income from the other investments, which were dividend accounted, these contributed $10 million to earnings in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now to the balance sheet and cash position of the Group. The Group's total equity has increased by 17% to $37 billion. Shareholders' funds increased by 15% to $16 billion, the increase in shareholders' funds was primarily attributable to the Group's retained net profit over the period, this contributed to a 14% increase in net asset value per share, which stood at $43.40 at the of June 2011.</p>
          <p>At the 30 of June, the Group's net debt excluding financial services companies was $1.7 billion, representing gearing of 5%. This is down from a reported net debt of $2.3 billion at the 31 of December.</p>
          <p>As this slide illustrates, the biggest net borrow within the Group is Hongkong Land with both Jardine Pacific and Mandarin Oriental also net borrowers. Dairy Farm and Astra had substantial net cash balances at the end of the period. The net debt relating to Astra's financial services companies increased during the period, reflecting the strong trading performance of Astra's Motor operations and the opportunity for financing both two wheeler and four wheeler sales.</p>
          <p>At the Jardine Matheson Corporate level, we had net debt of $64 million at 30 of June, down from a net cash position of $160 million at the end of December. With the dividends paid exceeding those received in the first half and CapEx of $86 million, primarily on purchase of Jardine Strategic shares.</p>
          <p>Jardine Strategic itself generated a strong net dividend inflow for the period, creating a net cash position at the end of June of $439 million, up from $297 million at the end of December. Both Jardine Strategic and Jardine Matheson continue to take their dividends from each other in script.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's corporate net debt was $23 million, compared to a net cash position of $7 million at the end of December. As we look to prospects for the second half, trading conditions for the Group's businesses in Asia remain relatively resilient, although concerns exist that the global economic climate is showing signs of fragility. We've highlighted previously that we expect earnings from residential developments to be well done for the year, despite this and the reduced first half profit in Jardine Motors, we do expect the Group to perform satisfactorily in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The Group, as I hope you will agree remains well financed with the sound balance sheet and is in a strong position to continue to make good headway.</p>
          <p>That concludes the formal part of this presentation.</p>
