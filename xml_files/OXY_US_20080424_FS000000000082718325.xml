          <p>Good morning, my name is Sandra and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Christopher Stavros. Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Thank you Sandra and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Occidental's First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Los Angeles this morning are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO, and Steve Chazen, our President and CFO. In a moment, I'll turn over the call to Steve, who will review the details of our first quarter results to be followed by a question and answer session. Our earnings press release, Investor Relations supplemental schedules and the conference call presentation slides, which refer to Steve's remarks can be downloaded off of our website www.oxy.com. I'll now pass the call over to Steve. Steve, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Chris. Our net income for the quarter was a record $1.846 billion, or $2.23 per diluted share, compared to 1.212 billion, or $1.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Core results for first quarter of 2008 were 1.819 billion or $2.20 per diluted share compared to 788 million, or $0.93 per diluted share for the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Here's the breakdown for the first quarter. Oil and gas first quarter 2008 segment earnings were 2.888 billion compared to 1.883 billion for the first quarter of 2007. Oil and gas core results for the first quarter of 2007: 1.362 billion after excluding a $412 million gain from the sale of our Russian joint venture and $109 million gain from the resolution of certain legal disputes.</p>
          <p>The following account of the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters. Higher worldwide oil and gas price realizations resulted in an increase of 1.6 billion of earnings over the comparable period last year. Oxy's average realized crude oil price in the 2008 first quarter was $86.75 per barrel, an increase of $35.08 over the comparable period in 2007. Oxy's domestic average realized gas price for the quarter was $8.15 per Mcf, compared with $6.38 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas production for the first quarter of 2008 averaged 607,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 8.4%, compared with the 560,000 BOE production in the first quarter of last year. The bulk of the production improvement was a result of 55,000 Boe per day from the Dolphin project, which began production in the third quarter of last year, partially offset by lower volumes from production sharing contracts due to higher prices. Our guidance for the first quarter production was in the range of 600 to 615,000 Boe a day based on $90 oil and our results were in the middle of the range.</p>
          <p>Dolphin contributed $102 million to after tax income during the first quarter, which was ahead of our guidance. The sales volume to 55,000 Boe per day slightly ahead of our guidance of 53,000 per day. Dolphin reached full operations in February, and is currently producing approximately 2 Bcf a day of natural gas, and 200,000 barrels a day of liquids. Exploration expense was $74 million in the quarter, which is in line with our guidance of 70 to $90 million.</p>
          <p>The first quarter 2008 production costs per barrel are approximately $0.39 less than the fourth quarter of last year.  Oil and gas production costs for the first three months of 2008 were $12.94 a barrel compared to last year's costs of $12.36 for the whole year. These numbers were adjusted to remove the midstream costs. The increases year-over-year reflected higher production ad valorem taxes and somewhat higher field operating costs.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $179 million, which was higher than our guidance of 100 to $125 million. Chemicals earned $137 million in last year's first quarter. The improvement in earnings was due to higher prices and margin in caustic soda along with higher PBC and BCM margins exported to non-U.S. dollar denominated economies.</p>
          <p>We have reclassified our midstream assets out of the oil and gas segment. Our midstream assets are comprised of the following businesses:  marketing, Occidental's marketing group markets our equity production and manages third party transactions. The primary drivers of these earnings are marketing and trading margins in oil and gas, transportation and storage programs. This element is probably the largest portion of the total.</p>
          <p>Gas processing plants, our domestic wet gas production -- third party production is processed through 13 Permian and two other gas plants to extract NGLs to deliver dry gas to the pipelines. Primary drivers for margins and cash flow are the differences between inlet costs of natural gas and market prices for NGLs and inlet volumes processed.</p>
          <p>Pipelines, in the Permian Basin we own an oil-gathering common carrier pipeline company with approximately 2750 miles of pipeline and storage systems with 5 million barrels of active storage.  The main margin and cash flow drivers are volume shift. We also own a 24.5% equity interest of Dolphin pipeline project, which carries gas to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
          <p>Power generation, Oxy owns two co-generation plants, one in Texas and one in Louisiana, and equity investment in a gas fired power plant at our Elk Hills site. The three plants have a combined electricity capacity produced 1760 megawatts per hour.</p>
          <p>The final element is the CO2 source fields and facilities. In the Permian Basin, we process and transport CO2 for the use of the company's enhanced oil recovery program and the earnings represent the small volume sold to third parties.</p>
          <p>The net book value of the midstream properties was approximately 1.8 billion at the end of last year. As we disclosed earlier we earned 123 million for the first quarter of 2008 from these assets.  Midstream capital spending and property acquisition costs were approximately $430 million last year and expected to be about the same this year. These funds is what we spend enhancing our CO2 productions at Permian expanding our pipeline capacity.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was 42% for the first quarter of 2008 compared with our guidance of 43%. Capital spending was $868 million for the quarter. We currently expect total capital spending for 2008 to be about $4 billion, increased from prior estimates, which involved capital for the Rockies, California and Midstream assets.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the three months was approximately $2.7 billion.  We used 870 million of the company's cash flow to fund the capital expenditures, 1.6 billion for acquisitions, 210 million to pay for dividends. We spent 435 million to repurchase 6.3 million common shares at an average price of $69.68 a share. These and our other net cash outflows decreased our $2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by 500 million to about 1.5 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>The first quarter U.S. income tax payments reflect true-ups of 2007 amounts due. The second quarter payments will increase since two quarterly estimated payments will be due. That was 1.8 billion at the end of March, which was unchanged from the year-end numbers.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the three months were 823.6 million shares and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 828.2 million. At March 31st, there were 821.5 million basic shares outstanding. The diluted share amount was approximately 126.1 million. Our annualized return on equity for the quarter was 32% with annualized return on capital employed of 29%.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect oil and gas production to be in the range of 610,000 and 620,000 BOE a day during the second quarter at $100 oil prices. We expect second quarter production increases in Argentina, Columbia the Rocky Mountains, Permian and Oman partially offset by decreases to the high cost recovery levels in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With regard to prices, a $1 change in oil price impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. This $39 million sensitivity includes the impact of Dolphin. Also included in the production sharing contract price impact were approximately 500 barrels a day per $1. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $25 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. Additionally, we expect exploration expenses to be about 80 to $100 million for seismic and drilling for exploration programs.</p>
          <p>As we've shown you, it is difficult to predict chemical results in the current environment, however, we reasonably expect chemical segment to earnings to be in the range of 120 to $140 million compared to $179 million in the first quarter. Higher feedstock cost is the primary driver of the reduced forecast. This outlook also was less in the second quarter of 2007 earnings, $158 million due to weakness in domestic construction, which impacts industry demand, although the continued weakness of dollar is likely to push these numbers to the higher end. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to remain about 42%. Copies of the release as Chris has pointed out are available on our website or the EDGAR.</p>
          <p>Now I think we are ready to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Your first question is coming from Doug Douglas Terreson of Morgan Stanley. Doug, your line is live.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you guys hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Doug, we can hear you fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Steve, you talked about your prices for crude oil and natural gas and the leverage that the company has and obviously if they remain anywhere near current levels then free cash flow's going to be a lot greater than most envision both for the current period and full year 2008.  And so, in light of  these circumstances I want to see if we can get an update on the prioritization for such funds that is if they do materialize, meaning how might such surplus capital be allocated between investments, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases, et cetera. I mean which way are you leaning as it relates to this outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course this is a slightly larger number than we were anticipating. So, if we can't put the money to work, add attractive returns, then we'll return to shareholders one way or another.</p>
          <p>'</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Annually the Board reviews the dividend, the ongoing dividend policy and given the current environment I would expect that they would be favorable to an increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Share repurchases, we purchased 6 million, a little over 6 million shares in the first quarter. We would expect the share repurchase program to continue and depending on the exact product price. But if we look at it over the whole year there is plenty of volatility in the stock and plenty of opportunity to buy the shares that we would view attractive prices during the course of the year. So, we'll just see where the stock price goes, but we are not going to build cash if that's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. Okay and also in the Middle East, obviously execution on the Dolphin project has been very positive, and then you mentioned earlier that there was progress in Oman too. And so, I just want to get an update on Oman and specifically whether that development is following your expectation or is it really too early to know?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our projects in Oman specific specifically are moving along okay and we expect to get a guest contract there. Timing is difficult to predict especially as you approach the summer months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we are positive about that and other projects in the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry Ray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael LaMotte of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, if I could follow on the CapEx comment California and the Rockies and particular, are we seeing actual number of planned wells this year going up and maybe you could talk about the cost per well and, through the mix of inflation, deflation versus volumes on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're talking about really physical increases &#x2013; in the number of wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see much in the way of inflation. Remember that our operating cost which are the easiest way to compare inflation were flat on an absolute basis even with higher production from the fourth to the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you know that's sort of a -- on the immediate measure of oil, fuel service inflation. So, we don't see a lot of signs of inflation for the kind of things that we do. So, we are talking about a physical increase in the activity especially in the Rockies and California this year. And if we get with a little bit luck and we might spend a little more than that even.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The domestic volume should be a little higher than perhaps we are looking at...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we go forward in the year as domestic volumes, I think if I were looking for a surprise and praying for one, that would be where I would hope and pray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And quickly on Argentina, the exit rate in December was 40,000 barrels a day, with actual Latin American volumes overall ended up a little lower than what I was looking for in the quarter. What is the latest there, I know there were some strikes in October-November, any...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's actually 40,000, it produced about 40,000, Argentina in the first quarter. We expect to see more improvement in the second quarter in volumes. Columbia, some of the issues were in Columbia I think also, but then we expect to see improvement for that. You know I shouldn't &#x2013; we shouldn't spend too much time too much time looking at small changes there. The trend for Argentina especially will be up sharply all year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, even with the winter season encroaching that does deliver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the sensitivity on PSA impact last quarter, you said it was for every $5 change in oil 4000 barrels a day. As oil prices go higher, does that ratio change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're down, I think we're 500 barrels a day per dollar now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The contracts weren't exactly designed for this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I wouldn't extend any of those numbers too far and then that's really the problem when you try to do this that you know it works just fine for $5 change maybe, but when you have 10 and $15 changes, our ability to figure out what's exactly going to happen is kind of difficult, because again the contracts weren't designed for this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the PDC exports what's the mix between domestic and export sales? I mean that was clearly a positive surprise here in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Well, we don't really break out the mix like that, but clearly what's happening if you want to think about it intellectually is that we're buying or the main feedstock is electricity which is really natural gas. We're buying gas with U.S. dollars and exporting product into countries that have stronger currencies. And so we are able to move a lot of our chlorine that way and some other people don't have that flexibility. It costs a lot to build that flexibility, but in environments like this is probably worth it. And so we were able to export a lot of our chlorine and caustic prices have been extraordinarily strong for a while and continue to be strong. So it's hard to predict the number for any one quarter. So I wouldn't take my number as that I gave for the next quarter as anything, but the best guess we have now we weren't very good last quarter, we missed it by 50% the wrong, the right way. But we still missed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well.  If I think about it just in terms of PVC is being construction oriented and as you said feedstock basically being natural gas you are looking for a much &#x2013; worse Q1, but there is definitely an outlet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what's changed. We didn't anticipate how strong the outlet would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we gave you last quarter's guidance. The outlet is still very strong in the South America and Asia, and so, there's other factors too, competitors might have a downtime in their plant. There's a lot of other things that effect it, but right now it's, given how weak the U.S. construction business is, we are doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good. That's helpful Steve, thanks. And my last one can be for Dr. Irani. It seems that, maybe a follow on to Doug's question, it's seems like oil ministers in the Gulf today are spending more time talking about spiraling E&amp;P costs than they are about project identification or sanctioning. How dependent is your outlook on project sanctions not yet disclosed to the Street? Are you concerned by the slowdown in sanctioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, I mean it is a competitive world; indeed with $100 oil &#x2013; oil exporting countries are looking more about how to spend their money than for new sources of energy, queer enough. But we are coming along fine, and as you know we have the Mukhaizna project, which is coming along extremely well. And we are looking at a Bahrain project with the decision on whom to select amongst three companies, we are one of them, by the end of the summer and we have other programs.

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on Dolphin. Obviously, Total, Suez and Areva submitted plans to build a nuke in the UAE.  Does that change the supply-demand outlook for the UAE and if so, does that put sort of an expansion of Dolphin further back in the queue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The demand for energy is enormous and I wouldn't think so. I wouldn't think that would have anything to do with it at all.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then there's been comments I understand from the Qataris that the price they are obviously selling the gas at is significantly lower than they'd really like in today's world.  Do you have a feel for what sort of price they'd be looking for to do another &#x2013; to do an expansion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you know, these are depending on negotiations. All I can tell you is our Dolphin project is doing extremely well. As Steve said earlier, that in the first quarter we made $102 million after tax, plus what we made in the pipeline. Our investment is slightly over $1 billion and expansion in Dolphin, are possible; to predict timing on them is difficult. The exact conditions depend on negotiations among us and two sovereign states. So, I can't predict what happens.</p>

          <p>Yes. SG&amp;A for the oil and gas division is down because we said at an earlier meeting that we were cutting SG&amp;A in the oil and gas division. Steve is looking at numbers right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Steve, you recently made a comment regarding consolidation opportunities in Argentina. Would you talk about how you see the investment environment there and whether you'd be comfortable increasing activity there in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I think what I said was that we wouldn't want to be the largest producer in Argentina under any circumstances, and there might be some smaller opportunities but I don't think we want to raise our profile enormously there. In Argentina you know, there's been a slight increase in the realized oil price and we are hopeful that with time there will be more increases. It's not a, they have about $10 a barrel finding cost and about $10 lifting cost. So, we're in the high 30s on our oil price. So we're still a little below what we'd like to have, but progress is being made and production is coming up. The production will solve a lot of the problems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Latin America realization, the liquid realization was below where we expected; what was behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably just a differential change in Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right, it's differential change in Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on another topic I appreciate the segregation of the midstream unit. I am just curious as to how we should read into this. Is this the unit that might see some growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The unit might see some growth for sure. We're putting a lot of capital into it, and to expand the CO2 capability into the Permian and to bring the pipelines to more efficient standards, and we didn't want to bury that in oil and gas capital. And when we were looking at our cost structure last year, some of the so-called lifting cost was really purchased gas for the gas plants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so that's really -- it adds a lot of clarity to both the lifting costs and our future capital plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I hope you noticed also that the return on the midstream portion is excellent. As Steve mentioned, in the first quarter profits were over $100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>After tax, I think it was 123 and assets were 1.8 billion. So if you annualize it and we don't expect much change for the remainder of the year in midstream, so it's a good part of our business new investments we expect to make excellent returns as we've said repeatedly in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have figures on expenditures in the unit historically and what you might be expecting to spend this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We spent a little over 400 million last year. And we expect to spend about 400 million this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's fairly capital intensive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think some of it was distorting some of our capital numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final one, specifically on DD&amp;A, the number was lower than we had expected, I guess that we were basing our number on the full-year guidance that you gave. I just wanted to make sure that the full-year guidance remained around 2.7 billion for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looks that way.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Production dropped off a little bit. Is there any other reason why that might have been the case just under lifting products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's lifting.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our actual production was slightly above the, say we report sales not production actually. So the production for the company was slightly above the sales number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So assuming that contract gets enacted sometime this quarter, would you take the incremental earnings back dated to December 1st in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you can't back date earnings, basically it's an adjustment to the bonus or something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. So it won't flow through the P&amp;L in general.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>It helps the cash flow, but you are not allowed to &#x2013; think an opportunity for management if you will.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Okay, but it will &#x2013; the cash flow will be realized though?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll spend less.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  The only other one I have is kind of, I guess backing into Nikki's question a little bit on the midstream, you've mentioned you stripped this thing out, you are now showing us how this thing is going to perhaps grow over the longer term.  How does that dovetail with your plans to perhaps pump in to South Texas CO2 and maybe if you could give us some idea as to what we could expect in terms of what the cost impact and likely production impact longer term out of your Permian assets if, indeed you are able to make that happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've built in a notion of the South Texas into the capital plan that we, the 400 million we talked about. So we would expect to spend a fair amount of money taking high CO2 methane to work and stripping out the CO2 over the next couple years. A typical, a good reservoir will run maybe 7 Mcf per &#x2013; of CO2 to produce a barrel of oil and so if you assume if we put any excess into not the premier reservoirs, but less premier ones, and we've got lots of those.  You are talking 10 or 12 maybe Mcf to produce a barrel of oil, we ought to be able to get 500 million at least, maybe 600 million a day as more CO2 in the next few years. So you could divide by 10, 12 whatever you want to get some idea of the production increases over the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. These are ready fields where CO2 assets that you have ownership of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have if you &#x2013; were to able to look at our long-term backlog. We flood with the available CO2 obviously the best reservoirs. There are other reservoirs that are smaller that we had cheap CO2 or a lot of it of a surplus, we could flood those and produce more oil.  Right now CO2's tight in the Basin. If we could loosen up that tightness with a project where we can get some more CO2 where we can boost our oil production, periodically boost our oil production early and nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one final one &#x2013; if it's not too much detail, what size of reserves do you have CO2 in South Texas area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really know. We don't think of CO2 as reserves sort of a.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I don't know what you want to call it. It's hard to burn. So, it's a sizable number, but you know, this 5, 600 million a day as the deliverability is probably a good guess.</p>

And to the extent that you can, could you outline where the growth will come from? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have a good year next year. You know, to predict the exact number, I just don't know. But if you looked at the projects that are there to do it, we ought to exit Argentina at 50,000 and are obviously going to average that this year. Mukhaizna will be much higher next year. Permian ought to be a little higher, California ought to be higher, and so I can't tell you exactly what the number is, but it's certainly not going to be flat.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess the point I was making was whether or not the above range growth this year would lead you to have a kind of flat spot next year, but you're telling me that's not the case.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We just don't, our ability to predict isn't all that great. So we, but we do know it will be up, and I can't tell you whether it's going to be up 4% or 8%.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-on on the midstream segment, and you &#x2013; whether you see opportunities in the Middle East or you've been asked to do projects in the Middle East, and if that will be part of the midstream sort of going forward. And if so, if those projects would meet your return requirements on a standalone basis or it should be seen as part of a broader upstream plus midstream approach for the Middle East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes and yes. We see the projects and &#x2013; they'll meet our hurdle rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a standalone basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that an additional reason for having split out the midstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a growth area and we didn't want to obscure it, bury the oil and gas numbers. And so we think over a five-year period you'll see some nice earnings growth there, cash flow growth and we just didn't want to bury it in the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's to bring additional management attention to the segment and to focus the oil and gas E&amp;P people on producing more oil and gas at attractive costs. It's to get management attention across our projects and product lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  Additional question for you on acquisition of assets or asset deals in the North American market, given where prices have moved in the last three to four months and your general intention to make small add on deals, is the impact of the strong commodity price environment, is that causing people to ask for unrealistic prices or are you still able to do the small add on deals that has been an important part of your strategy thus far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't seen any increase in acquisition costs. The product prices have not flown -- flowed through the, into the acquisition costs. The things we're looking at, remember it's a narrow scope and just two areas really, maybe three,and so we have, really haven't seen that yet, but you know if it gets out of hand we can stop.</p>

          <p>To the competitors for buying the small properties have to borrow the money, so to continue Wall Street great depression is probably helpful and that &#x2013; I think I mentioned earlier, the people views, the changed in tax law and a couple of years or year whatever it is, is motivating buyers &#x2013; sellers, I mean.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your next question comes from Bernie Picchi of Wall Street Access.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Stephen your discussion of the investment opportunities in the midstream you didn't discuss CO2 opportunities at Elk Hills and I am just wondering if that's part of your longer range investment opportunity set that you see within this midstream sector. And am I right also in summarizing from your comments that of all the, are the five different areas you list within the midstream and marketing that the CO2 source fields facilities is your big growth area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a big growth area, because we can make a lot more oil and gas. So we're not going additional volume of CO2 to be a marketer, major marketer of CO2, we do buy and sell CO2.  However, it can give us additional growth in both the Permian and potentially in Elk Hills.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the segment is &#x2013; in the segment the CO2 plants are focused on the third party business, not the, not our own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what you are seeing is the third party piece. But the segment itself is currently constructed as a small amount of CO2 relatively in it. And has large amounts of gas storage activities and natural gas liquids plants. So the CO2 in the Permian will grow because there's perhaps more third party business there, but Elk Hills would not be a third party business, we would use all the CO2 ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just so that it would remain within the E&amp;P segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would stay in the E&amp;P, if the CO2 is dedicated to our facilities; it stays in the E&amp;P segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the part that's related to what we sell to other people.  For example, if we operate a field, we have a 50% interest, we may sell gas and the other 50%, so they have it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, that's sort of the nature of it, but it's -- if it's embedded as part of our production, our own production, it should remain in this segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got you, so merchant sales, basically as we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, merchant sales, and plants, parts of plants, that are dedicated to merchant sales.  If you look at it, it's fairly traditional at this point, mainstream business with natural gas liquids and gas storage activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, just another question on the fourth quarter, you made a passing comment about your emphasis on cost reductions, particularly from your contractors and it looks as if we are beginning to see that here in the first quarter results.  Can you talk about what we might expect to see in a way of benefits from that cost reduction program for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know its already lay it out exactly as to quarter-to-quarter, but we are seeing real effects, we are focusing the organization on costs, so we would expect over the year, the exit or sort of $3 million cost run rate savings, what exactly you'll see in the second or third quarter I &#x2013; hard to say, and it's also secured by some other things that go on. So I can't tell you exactly what this quarter, but as Ray pointed out earlier, we're focusing the E&amp;P business on increasing margins even in this incredible environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've had manpower reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To improve efficiency and reduce G&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think we're focused on that, our G&amp;A per barrel has declined this quarter and in the oil segment. So, I think we are doing the right things here and you will see more progress, but it's probably lumpy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And of the half a dozen you've mentioned, do you know the roughly the split between offshore and onshore?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, great. And then just a separate topic. Would you in addition to boosting the dividend, which as you mentioned the Board should be supportive of, would you consider a special dividend under this commodity environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just hard to say.  It depends on the stock price.  You know it depends on our view of our stock price. If the stock price review is, buying in the shares is better for the long-term investors we would do that. If the stock ever got the fair value that's when the special dividend will be considered.</p>
