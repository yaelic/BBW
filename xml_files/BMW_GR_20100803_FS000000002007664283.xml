          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to our Half Year Telephone Conference at BMW AG in 2010. With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management, and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Reithofer will give you all an update on the business performance, then Dr. Eichiner will take you through our financial results. Afterwards, we will have time for a Q&amp;A session. Mr. Reithofer, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Over the first six months of 2010, our business performance has improved to show a positive dynamic development. This is why we raised our forecast for 2010 on July the 13th. We plan to sell over 1.4 million cars, 10% more than in 2009. We aim at improving our pre-tax profit significantly above the 2009 level. In the Automobiles segment, we expect to post an EBIT margin of over 5%.</p>
          <p>Where do we stand following the first six months of the current business year? We have generated a positive profit before tax of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. This result is considerably above the same period in 2008 and about on par with the result achieved in the first two quarters of 2007. Group net profit stood at &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>EBIT in the Automobiles segment was clearly positive at &#x20AC;1.6 billion. We also generated an adjusted free cash flow in the Automobiles segment of around &#x20AC;1.2 billion. This year offers a threefold benefit that comes from the following. First, the economic recovery in some markets; second, the new attractive products that are in great demand; and third, the substance and efficiency enhancements that our company has achieved by continuing to focus on implementing strategy Number ONE.</p>
          <p>To the first point, some key markets like China and North America are growing. The same is true of India, Brazil, and several markets in Europe. We have benefited from the economic upswing in these markets. At present, this applies mainly to China. In the first six months of the current business year, we managed to double our sales volume as the overall Chinese automobile market improved by 50%. China remains a market with potential. It is presently the third most important market for our company in terms of retail.</p>
          <p>We are currently building a new plant in Tiexi; the start of production is scheduled for 2012. We are expanding our dealership network and we will give about 50 MINI E cars to Chinese customers for test purposes this year.</p>
          <p>With regard to the BMW Group's business, it is nevertheless important to me to emphasize we are not solely relying on China. We are a company that acts and operates globally. We are active in all relevant markets and we want to be successful in all these markets. As the world's leading premium car manufacturer in terms of sales, we are aiming at a balanced business performance between Europe, Asia and the Americas.</p>
          <p>In other words, we want to grow on all continents in large and small markets alike. Naturally, we are pleased about the addition of tailwind the economic upswing in some countries is providing us. However, as we aim to achieve sound and sustainable growth in an uncertain environment, success will primarily depend on our own performance and our own strength as a driver of innovation, as a company with an obtainable vision for the future, as a company that offers attractive products.</p>
          <p>On to the second point, our models are attractive more than ever. This applies to all models irrespective of the segment. Let me give you some examples for the first half of the year. Over 30,700 BMW 7 Series were delivered to customers making the 7 Series a clear segment leader. The new BMW 5 Series Sedan sold 25,000 units in the three-and-a-half months since its market launch. Over 68,600 customers order BMW X5 or X6. More than 46,700 customers choose a new BMW X1. We delivered 199,000 BMW 3 Series and more than 103,000 BMW 1 Series. And we have never sold more Rolls-Royce motor cars in a six-month period than in 2010.</p>
          <p>All in all, worldwide sales of BMW MINI and Rolls-Royce in the first six months of the current business year stood at over 696,000 cars and exceeded last year's period by 13%. At the same time, BMW Motorrad improved significantly. Sales of the BMW brand rose by 21% to about 57,000 units since the first half of the year backing the trend in the motorcycle market because most motorcycle markets are still in decline.</p>
          <p>Our Financial Services segment is growing as well. As you know, we have restructured and realigned our Financial Services division.</p>
          <p>Now, a few more highlights about what's to come. In the second half of 2010, we are launching attractive new models. The Chinese market entry of the new 5 Series Sedan long version is scheduled for September. The 5 Series with all-wheel drive will be launched shortly. The 5 Series model range will soon be complemented by the 5 Series Touring. The second generation of the BMW X3 will be available starting this fall.</p>
          <p>MINI's new highlight is the Countryman that has just been presented to the international media in Hamburg and has received positive feedback. With the model update of the MINI, the Clubman and the MINI Convertible, our customers can choose from a newly revised MINI portfolio.</p>
          <p>There is one thing we never lose sight of. Irrespective of a particular drive system or number of cylinders, we will always offer our customers the best performance with the best engine efficiency. This is what sheer driving pleasure is all about, this is the promise that every customer has with our premium brands.</p>
          <p>And finally, my third point. With the implementation of our strategy Number ONE, we have set the foundation to ensure for successful development of our company over the long-term. This is primarily due to our innovative strength. Let me give you two examples. The increased application of modules is bearing fruit, initial effects have been achieved with the new BMW 5 Series model range and each new model series will increase the economies of scale.</p>
          <p>Our three brands demonstrate our ability to develop and launch premium brands from the small car to the ultra-luxury segment and at the same time to strengthen their respective brand value. You can be sure that we will pursue the same approach with our new sub-brand. And as a new label, we will gradually offer full range of low emission cars starting with the Megacity Vehicle. This is in our DNA as the world's most sustainable car company.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our key figures for the first six months of the year demonstrate that we have taken a major step towards reaching our profitability targets for the year 2012. However, we are definitely aware of the fact that this is not the time to sit back and relax. We have not yet achieved our target, neither for the business year 2010 nor for the following years. But be assured, the Board of Management as well as the managers employees and employees will stay on track to make our vision for 2020 become a reality. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer. And now Friedrich Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from my side as well. We've had an exceptionally strong second quarter. The BMW Group has greatly improved its profitability. In the first half year, we achieved an EBT margin of 6.5% and an EBIT margin of 6.6% in the Auto segment. That puts us on the right track to reach the target range set by strategy Number ONE for 2012.</p>
          <p>We generated an extremely robust group profit before tax of &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the second quarter. Besides a very significant improvement in the Auto segment profit, we reported a clear increase in our Financial Services earnings. Both resulted from the positive effects of our strategic measures to boost profitability as well as our attractive new models.</p>
          <p>Let us start by taking a look at the individual segments. The Auto segment in the second quarter posted an EBIT of &#x20AC;1.3 billion. EBIT for the first half year totaled &#x20AC;1.6 billion. The very situation has continued to improve. We benefited overall from the global economic recovery with double-digit sales growth in many of our markets. And with the launch of a new 5 Series in Europe, we saw a strong model mix in the second quarter. Our attractive portfolio also allowed us to maintain a better price position on the markets. As expected, sales incentive levels decreased, thanks to our younger product portfolio and changes in sales management processes.</p>
          <p>Our effort to reduce material costs over recent years also had a positive impact. And we also expect sales to perform well in the second half of the year. We invested around &#x20AC;410 million in capital markets to fund a further share for our pension obligations in Germany. Adjusted for this amount, free cash flow in the Auto segment totaled &#x20AC;1.2 billion for the year through June 30.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;9.7 billion, our group liquidity for the year to the end of June remained high. Ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Services segment generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;379 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2010 as a whole, EBT totaled &#x20AC;601 million. In a highly profitable second quarter, Financial Services benefited from much better conditions for short and long-term funding. Globally, central bank interest rates are at a historic low.</p>
          <p>The used car market in North America and Continental Europe continued to develop heterogeneously in the first half of 2010. Most European markets stabilized at a low-level. In Southern Europe, used car prices failed to recover. The US and UK used car prices showed greater stability.</p>
          <p>Due to this, our end of lease business improved. This had an additional impact on the earnings for the end of June of around &#x20AC;100 million. The initiated measures to optimize process efficiency had a further positive effect. Almost 284,000 new contracts were signed with retail customers in the second quarter, 9.5% more than the same period last year. In the first half of the year, more than 527,000 new contracts were signed worldwide.</p>
          <p>New business accounted for &#x20AC;13.1 billion, 9% more than the same period last year. The percentage of new vehicle leases, leased or financed by Financial Services, dropped slightly to 46.6%, of which the leasing business made up 23.8% and financing 22.8%. The service portfolio comprised &#x20AC;76.468 billion.</p>
          <p>The risk situation in the leasing and loan financing business has continued to improve throughout the economic recovery. The credit loss ratio for the first half of 2010 dropped to 0.59% from 0.74% in the same period last year. We expect our financing business to face lower default risk from retail customers and dealers in the second half of the year. But any slowdown of the economic recovery could potentially weaken this positive trend again.</p>
          <p>The Motorcycle segment performed exceptionally well in a difficult market environment. We were able to improve our competitive position significantly as we posted an EBIT of &#x20AC;54 million in the Motorcycle segment in the second quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, our much stronger performance is reflected in higher earnings and our excellent key profitability ratios. Cost improvements and our efforts to push efficiency are yielding results.</p>
          <p>Our key ratios are fully in line with targets set out in our strategy. We are continuing to work our strategic initiatives and programs and we'll further optimize both the cost and performance side. We will not rely on the economy continuing to recover at this pace.</p>
          <p>As far as the second half of the year is concerned, we are planning overall for a good earning situation. However, it would be a mistake to project the strong second quarter earnings on to the full year. On the one hand, we expect smaller increases in sales worldwide in the third quarter, partly as a result of seasonal factors. On the other hand, the launch of new models, the 5-Series Touring and the 5 Series four-wheel driven sedan, the X3 and the MINI Countryman will create additional space momentum in the United States and Europe. These market share of sales will increase slightly at the expense of China and other emerging markets. This will dampen earnings in the third quarter in particular.</p>
          <p>Our forecast cannot generally predict potential fluctuations in a global economy. However, we are aware that the efforts of many countries to consolidate their over-extended budgets could put a brake on global consumption. This could hinder a further global economic recovery and also impact our business performance.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we want to increase our company's earnings power sustainably over the long-term. We aim to grow all of our brands in the markets worldwide. We announced an EBIT margin of more than 5% in the auto segment for the full 2010 financial year. We are also spending by our target range of an 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Auto segment in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the Financial Services segment, we are aiming for a return on equity of more than 18% for 2010. The BMW Group is on the right track. With our attractive portfolio, we are profiting from the current growth phase. Our increased earnings power will have a potential positive impact on our result for the full financial year.</p>
          <p>Although we are currently satisfied, there is no intention of resting on our laurels. We will continue to optimize our efficiency and structures in order to maintain our course for success moving forward into the future. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Dr. Eichiner. Ladies and gentlemen, now the line will shortly be opened for questions. Please wait for some technical advice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Okay. So the first question comes from Mr. Ellinghorst of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks a lot and good afternoon, everyone. It's Arndt Ellinghorst of Credit Suisse. First question is on China, can you give us some flavor on how your profitability will develop in China with more cars being locally produced and what that also means for your pricing power in China because we understand that the Chinese really want to buy your cars that are produced in Germany and not so much the cars that are produced in China?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on currency, I estimate you might have a $9 billion in renminbi exposure by the end of this year. Could you give us some color on your transaction rates next year if the currencies stay where they are right now? We've heard from Daimler that they see them pretty much flat. It would be interesting to hear how you see your exposure next year.</p>
          <p>And then also just briefly on the second quarter, how much of the second quarter performance was already related to the 5 Series and how much was simply currency, raw materials and so on? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Ellinghorst, the questions will be answered by Friedrich Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think we don't see any burden coming from a higher share of locally produced cars in China. The reason is that we're still delivering many components to China. And the second reason is that the more we produce locally the more we are able to import. So this is for me a kind of a win-win situation. Pricing is still very strong in China. The sales in Chinese level is not comparable to other markets. And of course, overall, there is a trend of price reductions in the country, but starting at a significantly higher level than in many other markets.</p>
          <p>Then currency, in weeks behind us where we had a very favorable exchange rate, for example, in the dollar, we've taken opportunity to build up a very solid position for 2011 and also for 2012. So we are &#x2013; so kind of a flat position, I would say. That is what we achieved. And the idea is we really want to make sure that currency doesn't have a big influence on our 2012 targets. So that's the reason behind that.</p>
          <p>Talking about the second quarter and the influence of 5 Series, the effect is not coming from the exchange rate because the exchange rate was still a small burden for us in the first half. It's not related to the favorable dollar, it's more related to the pound. That over-compensated the positive effect from number. So it was a headwind of two digit million number. So that's more coming out of mix.</p>
          <p>And as we always said, 5 Series makes a big difference as well as a high volume of 7 Series and X5 and X6s. So this is really now the secret behind the strong quarter that the new cars have really almost no discount, a good margin and help us to really achieve our profitability target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would agree that the 5 is sequentially building up in terms of profit contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, yes. That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Christian of Macquarie. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have two questions, one related to the other financial result. We had a significant negative swing in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Maybe you can explain a bit what's behind that and what we should expect for the coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And then, again, please, on the currency impact, could you be a bit more precise on the numbers, please? Was there in the second quarter still a negative currency impact or only in the first half? And then, also, with regard to the transaction rates going forward, did I understand correctly that the transaction rates for you in the dollar in 2011 are going to be unchanged versus 2010 or should we expect a significant positive currency impact to come through in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the other financial result was mainly influenced by fair values in relation to FX and commodity hedging. So that is the major reason and it has to do with the development, for example, on the dollar side. That was the influence there.</p>
          <p>Now, the effect I mentioned was a first half year effect overall, so we had a certain headwind in the first half and we are expecting now some tailwind in the second half because we will get a better transaction rate. So that means we're expecting now improving transaction rates for the second half. And the result would be, as I said, a tailwind of a low-three digit million profit number. And this will then lead us over into 2011 where we see also in comparison to the actual situation in the first half of '10 a slight improvement, more or less on the level of the second half, maybe a bit better, right? That's the situation there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up question, in the second quarter, was there still a headwind from currencies or was it already a tailwind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the second quarter, yeah, it was a small headwind in the second quarter as well, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Max Warburton of Bernstein. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, everybody, or good afternoon rather. It's very corny for analysts to say this on conference calls, but just congratulations on this quarter from my side and I think many of us in the market.</p>
          <p>The two questions, revenue per unit, I know many of us obsessed about this, but the mix definitely improved, you talk about the mix. Dr. Eichiner talking about 5, 6, 7 Series, et cetera. Why doesn't the revenue per unit go up? Is there something in the accounting that means the lower incentive, the lower marketing spend appears further down the P&amp;L? Just from an analyst point of view, could you help us think about why this improved mix doesn't drive the top line as much as one might assume as an outsider?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly on currency, you say currency was a negative effect in the first half. Could you just clarify &#x2013; do you hedge the Chinese sales? Your friends over at Mercedes made it clear they've been surprised by Chinese sales and have not been able to hedge them. I assume implicitly there's a big currency <mark type="inaudible" /> the Chinese sales. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Max. This question will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just first of all, referring to your last question, yes, we are hedging the Chinese currency. But of course, you can only hedge for one year in advance. That's all the possibility you have, you cannot do much more.</p>
          <p>Now, your question about the revenue per car, the difference is, based on the retail number we are reporting, it's a different picture compared to the wholesale number. We took advantage in the second quarter to strengthen our pipeline and to come to a more healthier situation at dealer level, so we cleared dealers' stocks further. And that's the reason why we have a difference between the wholesale number and the retail number.</p>
          <p>The wholesale number was slightly below, but slightly &#x2013; significantly below, sorry, below the retail number. And that makes a big difference on the revenue per car. The number I can give you is that the revenue per car increased compared to the fourth quarter of '09 and the first quarter of '10, roughly around 8 to 9% that is due to better pricing, due to lower incentive levels, due to a better mix as explained.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Schwarz of Commerzbank. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Can you quantify how much the modular strategy contributed in the second quarter, i.e., the positive effects on the 5 Series is that rather on the price side because it's new model or rather on the cost side?</p>
          <p>And second question, you mentioned in the press conference at Q4, profitability may be impacted by a significant launch cost, but should that be more or less than, for example, in the first quarter with the important launch of the 5 Series?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, the savings coming from a modular strategy of course, that is very relevant for the cost side because we have economies of scale on modules, we are able to use them in more than one model line and that gives us a better cost position. Now, your question about launch cost, we have now to consider them in the fourth quarter that we have in peril &#x2013; more launches that we have the 5 Series Touring, we have the X3. And on the MINI side, we have the Countryman, so there is a lot coming, more than only 5 Series. That means we have to carry a higher burden on the launch cost side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from John Buckland of MF Global. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just coming back to the revenue per car question. I guess my model is wrong, I got a 12% rise in revenue per car, but anyway perhaps you could correct me on that.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; my main question is concerning again the third quarter, when you compare the costs and the production pricing, et cetera. Can you give us a clue perhaps &#x2013; in perhaps some quarter in the past, which is similar to &#x2013; I guess that you're going to produce a better margin in the first quarter because while there are costs, there are obviously the new models and better pricing, et cetera, et cetera. And you've got the currency benefiting coming through as well. So I wonder if you can give some clue on exactly how much down you're going to go in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>On the Financial Services, and you talked about some used car market being much better. That 100 million, that is the gain on used car sales, I presume, as being 100 million. So that &#x2013; there's no suggestion that you actually have been reversing provisions on residual values, is there?</p>
          <p>And then just again looking at the foreign exchange, presumably you are &#x2013; although you are hedging and taking advantage of exchange rates fluctuate. We are quite clear that in 2012, there will be still a much better transaction rate coming through because if there isn't, it seems very odd how you are hedging forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John. Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting with your last question, the transaction rates, as you said, already we are expecting better rates in the second half of the year and this will be the result before the &#x2013; at a same level as we're expecting the exchange rate to land in the first quarter of 2011. So we see some improvement compared to the quarter one and two and this is already hedged.</p>
          <p>Now, on your question about revenue, it depends on what you refer to. Now, looking at the first quarter of 2010, if you compare the numbers to the first quarter, as I said, based on the figures, the wholesale figures that are really relevant for the revenue, it will be around 9%. That's the number I can give you. And it is due, as I said, to the improvement especially on the mix side with the new models in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I just say on that &#x2013; that figure of 8, 9% is a quarter-on-quarter figure, not a year-on-year figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a quarter-on-quarter figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said to you already in our talks about the first quarter, we said for first quarter still under pressure and in the second quarter with the new cars coming to the markets, we should see a better position when it comes down to pricing, revenues per car, and things like that, right. And that's the referring number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then looking at the cost, we're not expecting our cost of production per unit to decrease quarter-by-quarter. That is nothing we can really expect. We're working on profitability. That's clear. And this is something where year-by-year we achieve improvements of around 5, 6, 7%. It depends on a particular year. That is the rate going forward.</p>
          <p>Currency, I already touched. Now, coming to your question about Financial Services, now from today's perspective, we have recognized an adequate level of risk provisions in both segments. So to cover foreseeable residual value risk on the entire contract portfolio, I think we generated a better result on the end of lease business, which reflected &#x2013; it reflects the stabilization and recovery of used car prices. And we've shown &#x2013; disclosed one-off effect of 100 million from a better used car price realization. But given the diverging developments of used cars markets, we did not make any fundamental adjustments to the level of risk provisions. We're keeping a close look on changes in Financial Services related risks and we'll adjust our risk position as appropriate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Philippe Barrier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Few questions, if I may. Just to come back to the &#x20AC;100 million adjustment in provision in the second quarter, assuming that the price of used car will be stable on the coming quarters going forward, do you think that actually each quarter could see some adjustment in the level of provision regarding the book value of leased car?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the fleet business, one of your <mark type="inaudible" /> of Financial Service saw some decrease in the revenues on the fleet business. Just can you tell us what is the trend today on the fleet business or corporate cars business in Germany and in the rest of the world?</p>
          <p>And the last question is regarding the behavior of &#x2013; on the premium car market. This morning, you mentioned that the prices in China is much higher due to lower discount applied to new cars. Can you give the trend in the other markets? Can we have a ranking of price per continent or, say, Europe or China or U.S. and what is the key trend today in among the premium car markets? Or you mean you'd see some change in the behavior of the main players in this market?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have a ranking now available, but in order to help you, you have access to all the retail pricing we have in all markets. It's easy to get it. And if you look at the different retail prices, I think you can find the truth behind it.</p>
          <p>Fleet business, man, it's a stable &#x2013; upwards trend with positive effect because we suffered during the crisis from residual value losses on this side of our business as well, and this is now going out, and so this is developing.</p>
          <p>And now your question about positive effects in the quarters to come out of the Financial Services portfolio. Basically, we cannot rule it out, it depends how much the used car prices will improve in quarters to come, but you have to see actually we've not yet reached the level of used car pricing we had before the crisis. We are still not higher than this. We have some promising markets like the UK, where we got the positive effect, but other markets like Germany and many other European markets who are far below our level of used car pricing we had before the crisis.</p>

The car financing assets increased by the same absolute amount as group sales, and this translates into a 100% incremental car financing penetration.

          <p>Next question comes from Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two very quick follow-ups. First of all, to your outlook, Dr. Eichiner, I appreciate the conservativeness. The first half is characterized by a first quarter that by historical standards is very low and a second quarter that by historical standards is at the peak. Now you're saying we shouldn't extrapolate H1. Why is that? And why should we not look at Q2 and just take a touch off but think that Q3, Q4 by historical standards are still going to come in as very high quarters?</p>
          <p>And then the second question. Related to your wholesale, you alluded already quite a lot about revenue per unit development. Had there been anything like over-production of the wholesale in Q2? And on that point, what was the fixed cost absorption effect in case there was over-production in the second quarter that might not recur in Q3, Q4? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Mr. Gehrke. These questions will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, your question about the revenue per unit over-production of the whole sale, clearly the block production figure was much higher than the wholesale figure in the second quarter. And the reason is that we are still building up the pipeline for our overseas business with new cars like as the new 5. So there is significant difference between the two numbers. And this has an influence on the fixed cost absorption as well.</p>
          <p>Now the question why should you not project the result of the second quarter to the third, we had the same discussion in the first quarter and asked you not to project this result. And we had good reasons to do that. Now, the same year, just to mention by effect we paid a special bonus in this third quarter already that has an effect of close to 100 million.</p>
          <p>Then, as I said, the retail number would be lower because there was also &#x2013; here are seasonal effects like a weak August, we have been in the car business over years and so we are not expecting same amount of sales in the third quarter as we had in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And then there is a mix effect as well because we now are shifting more from the emerging markets to the more mature markets in Europe and in the US in order to support our sales targets and market share targets there. And this has a temporary effect in Q3 as well. But those are reasons why I'd say please don't project the results.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>The second one, in relation to the cost savings you're planning until 2012, could you give us an update how you're progressing against plan in 2010? And do you have an idea of what kind of cost savings do you want to achieve on material costs, specifically in 2010?</p>
          <p>And the third one. Could you give us please the split between the cars being imported into China and locally assembled and do you think you can actually sustain this very high level in 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, thank you very much. We start again with Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the inventory increase clearly is in line with our planning to support strong sales for the fourth quarter where we have all the new cars available in the markets and all the pipeline for the new 5 Series then will be filled up and other cars &#x2013; new cars coming like for example face-lifted MINIs like the Touring, 5 Series Touring, like the X3 and the MINI Countryman. There is a lot of stuff, new stuff coming to the market. We have to build up the pipeline in order to have a strong momentum then in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2011. That's the reason, but this is exactly in line with our production and retail plans.</p>
          <p>Now, the next question was about cost savings. We expect progress especially on the material cost side, and we expect that the fixed cost will grow, but not at the same pace as revenue and profit. So, this is the target and we are well on track with those results, looking forward to our 2012 promises. And we had last year in fact around six to 700 million and this year we are expecting a bit more than this overall. That is what we see today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, locally produced cars in China. Our plan is to even increase the number of locally produced cars. That is the reason behind our decision to increase capacities there and to build up a new greenfield plant. You have to keep the balance in China. If you're not a local player, you will not be allowed to import cars. So, we have to look at this balance. And as I said, it is advantage for us on both sides. The more locally produced, the more we are able to import.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But a lot of EBIT contribution comes from the vehicles that you're actually managing to import, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's coming from both. Because as I said, we have so many components that we are supplying to China for this production and that is something that helps us. And of course, we have a good mix in the imported cars.</p>

          <p>My first question relates to efficiency savings and a follow-on from Jose's question. I know you've now talked about 2010 efficiency savings but I was just wondering what your thinking is at the moment for further savings into '11 and 2012. Are you still thinking about the savings being very back-end loaded for modularity or are you seeing a lot more coming through and expecting more in 2011?</p>
          <p>And then I've got a couple of questions. I know everyone's focusing on China, but I just wanted to ask a little bit about Germany and if you could explain a little bit about the 9% decline in unit sales in Germany. Was that in any way scrappage related or was there a boost last year in Germany in the same period? And then also your forecast for the US market. Do you expect luxury car sales to grow faster than the overall market in the U.S.? And what are you expecting from the U.S. market? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about efficiency savings on the way forward, I already explained our position on fixed cost, now talking about the variable cost, especially the cost for the material cost, we are expecting a further improvement with every and each new model to be launched, especially next year with the new 1 Series to come and later on whole fleet of 3 Series cars, we know we have a better cost position compared to the predecessor, and this will support our efficiency gains on a way forward to our 2012 target.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Eichiner. So Mr. Reithofer, you have a chance to work now and give us the answer of the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the United States of America. In 2010, in my opinion, as we all know, we will have approximately a 10% increase in the total market from 2009 levels to approximately 11.8 million cars, but still well below the average volume before the financial crisis. And in my opinion, the premium car segment will increase faster than the mass market in the United States.</p>
          <p>And Germany, in the year 2009, as we all know, we had the scrappage bonus, and because of the scrappage bonus, we have a total market decrease of approximately 25% to approximately 2.8 million units in the year 2010 in Germany.</p>
          <p>And, if I see premium, the premium segment will be around 860,000 units, and if I see BMW during the first six months of the year, BMW sold more than 120,000 vehicles in Germany in the first half of 2010, and therefore about 1,300 more units than the previous year. That is our situation and this represents an increase of 1.1%. That is the situation in Germany and in the United States of America.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from John Lawson of Citi. Go ahead sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Mr. Eichiner, if we move away from this 100 million gain in financial services in the second quarter, it does look as though you still achieved something like a 24% return on equity in that business. And I know that you mentioned much cheaper short-term and long-term funding as one of the reasons for that. But it does seem that those rich contracts could only be quite a small part of the portfolio at this point.</p>
          <p>And given that you're also looking at risk falling over the next half-year, doesn't this imply that you're actually going to see a period of very substantially above 18% return on equity results in financial services for a while? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly I'd just like to add my piece on China. It does sound as though you're deliberately starving the market or at least prioritizing U.S. and Europe in the second half if you're going to remain below 12% of units in China. This is what you're implying I suppose. And perhaps you could just tell us, is there an inflection point on these joint venture profits coming any time soon. I see your report says that JV profits actually fell in the second quarter? Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You're absolutely right that we have actually a very strong financial services business. Risks seem to be under control so far, and so we don't have to provision any further, so that is extraordinary provisioning is not necessary. And credit default rates are declining, so that is also a very good sign. On our way forward, we have to see two effects.</p>
          <p>First of all, we are at absolutely low interest rates and this is a seasonal effect and I think we cannot really project this effect into the future of the forthcoming years.</p>
          <p>The first thing I want to say on the other hand, if you look at equity, as we already announced we will increase equity as well because we are on a way to build up our European bank and this will absorb some equity at the same point in time coming from regulatory requirements. So that's the reason why I think there are so much estimates to be made. But after all, for this period of the next one to two years, we should see a very strong financial services result and a high level of profitability possibly better than 18%; that is definitely possible.</p>
          <p>Now China profits, the drop in BBA result is due to an intra-group profit elimination as a part of a kind of a reorganization measure in China, and this effect impacts the quarter one result already. So that's just the reason behind the joint venture profit.</p>
          <p>Chinese sales, we benefit from the launch of the 5 Series long wheelbase now. I think that's a great car, expectation is high. So, we see the car in a very favorable position compared to the competition in China, and we are awaiting a strong market performance for this car and this will of course generate profits in the in the joint venture.</p>
