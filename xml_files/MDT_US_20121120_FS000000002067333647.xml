          <p>Good morning. My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. It is now my pleasure to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Christy. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2013 second quarter, which ended October 26, 2012. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. And finally unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. And all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today.</p>
          <p>This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $4.1 billion, which represents growth of 5%. Q2 non-GAAP earnings of $902 million were flat and diluted earnings per share of $0.88 increased 5%. Our GAAP earnings include a noncash charge related to our ongoing litigation in our TAVI business and Gary will discuss this item in a little more detail later.</p>
          <p>Building on the last couple of quarters, Q2 represented another positive step toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth on both the top and bottom line. In fact, we believe our organic revenue growth outperformed the Med Tech market by 200 basis points. We had a number of businesses and geographies that delivered outstanding performances but at the same time there were businesses and geographies that faced some pressures and we're watching these very carefully. Overall, we are focusing on effectively managing headwinds and tailwinds to deliver a balanced and consistent performance.</p>
          <p>This quarter two of our larger end markets, U.S. ICD and U.S. Spine, continued to show signs of stabilization. Growth in both these markets were relatively stable sequentially and we also executed well and took share in both of these important markets.</p>
          <p>Let's first discuss U.S. ICDs more detail. Similar to last quarter, we estimate the market declined in the mid-single digits. Our business was down 3%, enabling us to gain approximately a point of share year-over-year and 2.5 points sequentially. Pricing declined 3%, a slight improvement to last quarter's rate. Concurrently, our implant volumes improved sequentially and were up over 5%. While hospitals continued to reduce their bulk purchases on a year-over-year basis, they were relatively stable sequentially. These positive implant trends suggest that the U.S. market stabilization will continue.</p>
          <p>Turning now to U.S. Core Spine. We estimate that the overall market saw modest year-over-year decline without any fundamental shifts sequentially in the underlying dynamics. Market procedures declined in the low single digits and positive mix offset pricing declines.</p>
          <p>Looking at our own results, our U.S. Core Spine business was down 4% with Q2 being the most difficult comparison to last year. Our year-over-year and sequential growth was also affected by the timing of the NASS [North American Spine Society] annual meeting, which occurred during the last week of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite these headwinds, it is worth noting that our U.S. Core Spine business was sequentially flat and delivered modest share gains. Our business continues to stabilize, driven by the increasing broad surge in acceptance of our new products and procedures. We're also differentiating our Spine business through enabling technologies such as O-Arm Imaging, StealthStation navigation and POWEREASE powered surgical instruments. This is also evidenced by the strong growth in our U.S. Navigation business, which grew over 35%.</p>
          <p>Hospitals continued to invest in our capital equipment for spine surgery as they see clear value from better outcomes and more efficient procedures. This is also resulting in significant pull through for navigation and power enabled spinal implants. We're pleased with this progress but we are still only on the leading edge of this large opportunity and we need to continue to drive navigation to become the standard of care in spine procedures.</p>
          <p>The other part of our U.S. Spine business, BMP, declined 20% in Q2. Pressure will continue to exist in this portion of the business until the questions around INFUSE are better clarified. Yale continues to work on finalizing its report and while the timing is controlled by them, we are now expecting the systematic review to be published in early 2013.</p>
          <p>Looking at the remainder our businesses. We had a number of standout performances where the new products were making a difference. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, our Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent continues to perform well. Our U.S. DES share is still improving and in Japan our share has more than doubled since we launched the Resolute Integrity stent early in the quarter. Across the balance of our CVG portfolio, we are seeing double-digit growth in AF, TAVI, aortic stent grafts, and our peripheral vascular product lines.</p>
          <p>In our Restorative Therapies Group, our Neuromodulation business continued its strong performance with double-digit growth in Pain Stim, DBS, and InterStim. In Pain Stim, our Restore Sensor Spinal Cord Stimulator gained share again this quarter. Our DBS business also had a strong quarter with our referral development efforts enabling more patients to receive our pioneering Activa therapy.</p>
          <p>Our uro/gastro business is performing well with its expanded indications for InterStim therapy.</p>
          <p>Surgical Technologies had a stellar quarter growing 17% with double-digit growth across all three businesses: ENT, neurosurgery and advanced energy. Even after excluding the impact of our acquisitions last year, which we have now anniversaried, Surgical Technologies grew 13%.</p>
          <p>In diabetes our CGM business also grew double-digits.</p>
          <p>While we are executing on our product launches we're also making progress in advancing our industry leading product pipeline. Before the end of the fiscal year we expect to receive U.S. approval for our MiniMed 530G insulin pump and sensor system in diabetes and CE Mark in CRDM for our Viva and Evera high power family.</p>
          <p>In FY2014 we are targeting the launch of our Advisa MRI pacemaker in the U.S. and our next generation multi-electrode renal denervation system in Europe. We are also planning the European launch of our next-generation insulin pump the MiniMed 640G system early next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to execute on bringing our transcatheter valve and renal denervation products to the U.S. market expecting to launch both CoreValve and Symplicity in FY 2015.</p>
          <p>Turning to international, our revenue grew 8%, an improvement over the growth rate last quarter with relative stability in Western Europe and improving growth both in Japan and in emerging markets. Western Europe grew 3% but the market conditions varied significantly country by country. Growth was stronger in the U.K., Germany, France and the Nordics all delivering mid-single digit growth or better partially offset by softness in Southern Europe. In fact, Italy, Spain and Portugal combined negatively affected our Western Europe growth rate by two percentage points. Italy was particularly soft this quarter declining 3% as we started to see significant pricing and volume pressure in October. These pressures in Southern Europe are affecting the overall market and we continue to monitor the situation very closely as we manage this headwind going forward.</p>
          <p>Japan had a strong quarter with growth of 12% more than absorbing the unfavorable impact of R-Zone pricing that went into effect in April. In addition to Resolute Integrity's strong performance that I mentioned earlier several new products are making a difference in Japan. We're seeing great acceptance for Endurant, which has quickly become the leading AAA stent graft in Japan.</p>
          <p>In CRDM the launch of our Advisa MRI pacemaker late in the quarter helped drive mid-single digit pacing growth.</p>
          <p>Our Pain Stim business is also experiencing strong growth in Japan with RestoreSensor gaining 10 points of share year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Turning to emerging markets. Our Q2 growth rate was 18%, a 400 basis point improvement from our growth rate last quarter. Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa and India all grew above 20%. And although China's growth of 11% was below our long-term target it is worth noting that results were significantly affected by the decreased revenue from our Weigao joint venture following our announcement to acquire China Kanghui Holdings.</p>
          <p>We're in active discussions with Weigao about the future and we are working to minimize disruptions to our business as we position ourselves for long-term success in the broader China orthopedics market. We're putting plans in place in all our China businesses to achieve our long-term growth goals and we expect steady improvement going forward.</p>
          <p>While emerging markets in total have not quite met our 20% growth goal the last couple of quarters I strongly believe that as we execute on our strategies we will achieve this level of performance consistently over the long-term. We feel that continued emerging market growth combined with market stabilization as well as our broad portfolio and strong pipeline of future products provides the foundation to deliver dependable top and bottom-line growth over the midterm.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are executing on our long-term strategies of creating economic value and further accelerating globalization in order to achieve the upside to our baseline expectations. In support of our globalization strategy we took steps this quarter in both of our groups to become a long-term leader in the emerging markets value segment. In CVG we announced our intent to purchase an equity interest in LifeTech Scientific Corporation, a leading China-based developer of minimally invasive cardio and peripheral vascular devices.</p>
          <p>Our agreement will allow us to distribute certain LifeTech products as well as the option to acquire additional ownership of the company. In addition to their current structural heart product lines, LifeTech also has a robust development pipeline including surgical heart valves, LAA closure devices and peripheral vascular products. With this alliance we intend to bring together the resources of Medtronic with the local market expertise, brand recognition and growth potential of LifeTech.</p>
          <p>In September we also announced our acquisition Kanghui, a leading Chinese orthopedics company. Kanghui has a broad portfolio of trauma and spine products focused on the growing value segment and they are just beginning to expand into large joint reconstruction. The company has a strong local R&amp;D, manufacturing, distribution and emerging market export capabilities. We recently closed the transaction and we welcome the Kanghui employees to the Medtronic family.</p>
          <p>Both Kanghui and LifeTech are significant investments in China fully aligned with our globalization strategy. They immediately give us critical mass of knowledge and expertise in the specific needs of the Chinese market and patients. It is also important to note that both deals exceeded our high financial return hurdles, which is my expectation with any investment or acquisition that we make.</p>
          <p>In addition, to executing on our globalization strategy we also continue to make progress in our economic value initiative. As I meet with payers and healthcare system administrators I remain convinced that our breadth and scale combined with economic value with differentiate our company in the changing healthcare environment. We're making economic value more granular across all of our businesses and geographies. We are implementing the science that will help us translate economic value principles into a real advantage not only for us but also for our customers.</p>
          <p>Improving our operating rigor remains key to fully capitalizing on our long-term strategies. We are making progress on reducing our product costs by $1.2 billion over the next five years. This is important not only to maintain our gross margins but it also fuels the development of tiered products, which are essential to creating new value segment opportunities. In addition, our strategies to improve working capital by increasing our inventory turns are beginning to gain traction. Not only does this instill good fiscal discipline but it will strengthen our already robust levels of free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&amp;P dividend aristocrat, Medtronic has a long track record of consistently increasing our dividend. We believe the level of our shareholder return commitment is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make investments for sustainable growth and we are and will continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy this capital with a particular focus on returns. We expect any M&amp;A transactions to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate and we do not intend to pass along EPS dilution to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our belief is that our strong capital allocation policies combined with consistent and dependable growth which we will deliver by executing in our near, mid- and long-term growth drivers, will create sustainable shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take any questions. Gary?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Omar.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue of $4.095 billion increased 2% as reported and 5% on the constant currency basis after adjusting for a $118 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Q2 revenue results by region were as follows. Growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 26%. Latin America grew 23%. Growth in Middle East and Africa was 22%. South Asia grew 21%. Growth in greater China was 11%. Asia Pacific grew 10% including 12% growth in Japan. Growth in Western Europe and Canada was 3% while the U.S. grew 2%. Emerging markets grew a combined 18% in Q2 and represented 11% of our total sales mix.</p>
          <p>Q2 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $646 million and $0.63, a decrease of 26% and 23%, respectively. These declines were due to a litigation charge resulting from the recent Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmation of the April 2010 jury verdict in the Federal District Court of Delaware related to our Structural Heart business. Based on this ruling, we believe the one-time non-cash $245 million pre-tax charge represents our best estimate of the exposure at this time.</p>
          <p>After adjusting for this certain litigation charge as well as certain acquisition-related items and the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, second quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $902 million and $0.88, flat and an increase of 5% respectively. Adjusting for the net gains related to the Advanced Energy acquisitions of PEAK and Salient in Q2 last year, non-GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share increased 4% and 9% respectively.</p>
          <p>In our Cardiac and Vascular Group revenue of $2.137 billion grew 6%. Results were driven by solid growth in Coronary, Endovascular, Structural Heart and AF solutions partially offset by declines in Pacing. CRDM revenue of $1.227 billion was flat. Worldwide ICD revenue of $689 million was flat. Our Protecta ICD with its shock reduction and lead Integrity alert technologies combined with the proven long-term performance of our Sprint Quattro leads continues to receive strong market acceptance. We gained over 200 basis points of global ICD share sequentially and our share is now at the highest level in 10 quarters. We were also pleased to see our lead to port ratios continue to increase and our replacement market share is up nearly 400 basis points.</p>
          <p>Pacing revenue of $480 million declined 2%, slightly better than our estimate of the global market. Our U.S. Pacing revenue declined 8%, in line with the market. These declines were driven primarily by pricing, which was down in the mid-single digits, and to a lesser extent, hospital inventory reductions and fewer industry replacement procedures. We captured share in international markets on both a sequential and year-over-year basis driven in part by the launch of our Advisa MRI pacemaker in Japan, a device that we expect to launch in the U.S. market at the beginning of next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Our AF Solutions business grew 20% globally, with U.S. growth in excess of 30%. Growth was driven by the strong global performance of our next-generation Arctic Front Advance balloon with EvenCool Cryo Technology as we continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Coronary revenue of $429 million grew 19% as our Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent continued to capture global share. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $258 million including $99 million in the U.S. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, unique FDA labeling for Diabetes and long-term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally. As Omar mentioned, we more than doubled our DES share in Japan to 16% with the late August launch of Resolute Integrity and exited the quarter with good momentum.</p>
          <p>In renal denervation we continued to lay the groundwork for this important opportunity. On the clinical front 18-month data from HTN-2 was announced at ESC [European Society of Cardiology] and while still on a limited number of patients, the data showed Symplicity continues to provide superior and sustained blood pressure reduction in patients with treatment resistant hypertension while maintaining safety.</p>
          <p>We are also advancing our renal denervation pipeline, completing the first phase of our first in man study for our next generation multi-electrode system. As we discussed at our analyst meeting in June, this system is expected to reduce average total ablation times from 16 to 24 minutes today to 2 minutes total and all through a 6-French catheter. We believe this product will further strengthen our leadership position in this important Med Tech growth market.</p>
          <p>Commercially while Symplicity is available in many international markets, we lack broad reimbursement for the therapy, which is affecting the uptake and will likely remain that way until we get additional clinical data. While Symplicity revenue is ramping somewhat slower than expected, we still believe our technology, strong clinical data and robust intellectual property represents a large multi-billion dollar opportunity.</p>
          <p>Turning to Structural Heart, revenue of $271 million increased 6% driven by double-digit growth in TAVI. While market growth slowed in Europe, we continued to leverage our innovative portfolio for global expansion and are leading in the introduction of new valves, sizes and indications that are driving growth and serving more patients. We are continuing to roll out our CoreValve Evolut 23-millimeter valve, which promotes better sealing and provides future recapturability. With Evolut we are now able to serve the broadest range of TAVI patients on a common 18-French delivery system.</p>
          <p>In Q2 positive data on direct aortic implantation was presented at London Valves and we continue to see increased adoption of this innovative implant technique by cardiac surgeons.</p>
          <p>We also completed enrollment in the high-risk arm of our U.S. pivotal trial as we continue to make progress in bringing CoreValve to the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>In transapical, the first results from the Engager European Pivotal Trial were presented in October, which showed positive clinical outcomes including exceptional hemodynamic performance.</p>
          <p>Finally, we were honored that our Melody pulmonary transcatheter valve received the prestigious Prix Galien USA 2012 award for the best medical technology, which is our industry's highest accolade.</p>
          <p>Turning to Endovascular. Revenue of $210 million grew 17% with strong balanced growth across our aortic and peripheral businesses. In aortic we gained global Triple-A share on both a sequential and year-over-year basis driven in part by the launch of Endurant in Japan as well as the continued acceptance of Endurant 2 in our other global markets.</p>
          <p>Thoracic sales grew double digits on the strength of Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and China.</p>
          <p>In peripheral our global share also continues to climb with double-digit growth in our peripheral stent business. We completed enrollment in our IN.PACT DEEP drug-eluting balloon trial for our below the knee indication in international markets.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1.958 billion grew 4%. Results were driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and Diabetes partially offset by declines in Spine. Spine revenue of $782 million declined 5% globally and 8% in the U.S. primarily driven by declines in BMP. Core Spine revenue of $649 million declined 2% globally and 4% in the U.S. While the Spine market declined, we are not seeing any significant changes sequentially in the underlying market conditions including procedure trends, pricing pressure or competitive dynamics. Is worth noting that our Core Spine business grew on a sequential basis. We are seeing signs of improvement in our business as new products and procedures continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>In thoracolumbar, our SOLERA system rollout is now at full capability and we are now at 70% of set capacity. SOLERA, with its advanced biomechanics and new capabilities, including its attractive combination of navigation and powered instruments, is generating strong surgeon interest.</p>
          <p>In cervical we launched our BRYAN ACD and based on its acceptance in other countries we believe this disc will allow us to capture significant share in the growing $100 million plus U.S. market.</p>
          <p>In interbody we launched our AMT implants, as well as the CAPSTONE CONTROL and we believe that in addition to improving our interbody growth these innovative implants will generate pull through revenue for the rest of our thoracolumbar portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our other Biologics products had double-digit growth with continued adoption of our Grafton and MagniFuse DBMs.</p>
          <p>In BMP revenue of $133 million declined 19% including a 20% decline in the U.S. It is important to note that BMP is one of our lower margin products muting its impacts on the bottom line. We expect the Yale systematic reviews on INFUSE to be published in the first calendar quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Surgical Technologies revenue of $344 million grew 17%, which included $35 million of revenue from Advanced Energy. Organic revenue growth was 13% driven by double-digit growth in ENT and neurosurgery. Neurosurgery in particular had a very solid quarter led by strong U.S. sales of our high-value O-Arm imaging and StealthStation S7 navigation capital equipment. Our capital equipment is driving solid results and we believe we continue to gain share. Our strong performance also reflects increased surgeon demand for our differentiated navigated spine procedural solutions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Neuromodulation. Revenue of $454 million increased 10%. Our Pain Stim business continued its recent track record of double-digit growth driven by sales of our RestoreSensor Spinal Cord Stimulator with AdaptiveStim technology.</p>
          <p>In DBS we had another strong quarter of double-digit growth as our referral channel development efforts have led to strong new implant growth. Also growing double digits this quarter was our uro/gastro business driven by the adoption of our InterStim therapy. Across Neuromodulation our investments in markets outside the United States spanning Western Europe are starting to show results. Our Q2 growth of over 25% in these geographies.</p>
          <p>Diabetes revenue of $378 million grew 6% driven by double-digit growth in CGM. In the U.S. we're anticipating FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump and Enlite sensor to occur in late FY 2013, which we expect to reaccelerate growth in the U.S. We also continue to make progress in our next generation MiniMed 640G pump which we expect to launch in Western Europe early next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the rest of the income statement. The Q2-gross margin was 75.1%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency our gross margin was 75.6%. The gross margin was also unfavorably affected this quarter by approximately 30 basis points related to one-time items including obsolescence charges from new product launches and one-time integration related activities. We continue to offset pricing pressures through our five-year $1.2 billion cost of goods reduction program. For the remainder of FY 2013 we expect gross margins to be approximately 75.5% excluding the expected negative impact of foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Second quarter R&amp;D spending of $387 million was 9.5% of revenue which was driven by higher clinical spending in transcatheter calves and renal denervation. We remain committed to investing in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth and for the remainder of FY 2013, we expect R&amp;D spending to be in the range of 9% to 9.5%.</p>
          <p>Second quarter SG&amp;A expenditures of $1.417 billion represented 34.6% of sales versus 35% in the second quarter last year. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses while at the same time investing in new product launches and adding to our sales force in faster growing businesses and geographies. In FY 2013 we continue to expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement.</p>
          <p>Amortization expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the remainder of FY 2013 we would expect amortization expense in the range of approximately $90 million per quarter, an increase due to the timing of acquisitions. However, as we have previously stated, we intend to offset this dilution.</p>
          <p>Net other expense for the quarter was $63 million. Net losses from our hedging programs were $27 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge much of our operating results to reduce the volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. In Q2 our hedging losses were greater than expected due to a one-time hedging issue related to our balance sheet exposure during a period of significant change in euro exchange rates. We have taken steps to prevent this from occurring in the future and we were able to cover the impact to earnings through realized gains in our minority investment and debt security portfolios.</p>
          <p>Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY 2013 net other expense will be in the range of $215 million to $235 million. This includes the expected impact from the U.S. Medical Device Tax that will begin in January and higher royalty expense due to increased sales of Resolute Integrity. For Q3 we expect net other expense to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense for the quarter was $24 million. Excluding the $23 million non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $1 million. Interest expense was lighter than expected in Q2 due to the one-time gains that helped offset the previously mentioned increased hedging expense. At the end of Q2 we had approximately $11.5 billion in cash and cash investments and $11.5 billion of debt. For the remainder of FY 2013 we expect non-GAAP net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million per quarter which excludes the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.4%. Excluding the impact of one-time items our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q2 was 20%. For FY 2013 we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19.5% to 20.5%. This does not include any benefit for the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit which has not yet been extended by Congress. Historically the R&amp;D tax credit has an annual benefit in the range of $30 million to $35 million or approximately one penny per quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first half of FY 2013 we generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. During Q2 we repurchased $614 million of our common stock or approximately 1% of our outstanding shares. As of the end of Q2 we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 31 million shares. Second quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.028 billion shares.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We are tightening our constant currency revenue growth outlook to 3% to 4% for FY 2013. This implies a continued outlook of 2% to 4% constant currency revenue growth for the second half of FY 2013, which we believe remains reasonable and conservative. Although we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year then our FY 2013 revenue would be unfavorably affected by approximately $305 million to $345 million, including an unfavorable $40 million to $60 million impact in Q3.</p>
          <p>Turning to guidance on the bottom line, given the uncertainty surrounding final IRS implementation guidelines of the U.S. Medical Device Tax as well as the uncertain renewal of the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit, we continue to remain conservative and expect FY 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.62 to $3.70, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.</p>
          <p>As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year nor do they include the impact of the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it back over to Omar who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Gary.</p>
          <p>Before opening the lines for Q&amp;A, let me conclude by reiterating that we were encouraged by our Q2 results. But we recognize that it was only another step toward achieving our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth. While we continue to manage a number of headwinds we believe that our leading portfolio and pipeline combined with stabilization in our larger markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets position us well to deliver on our baseline expectations over the midterm. And these baseline expectations are: consistent mid-single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're also preparing to be a leader in the transformation of global healthcare by implementing our long-term strategy of economic value and globalization. We're only at the beginning of our journey but we believe that crisp execution of both our baseline and long-term growth strategies combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long-term value in healthcare.</p>
          <p>With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&amp;A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group to join us again for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, I just wanted to come back to one of your comments on gross margins. You mentioned some of the one-time effects in this quarter, but if we go back, it was one of the strongest revenue quarters in two plus years, but the margins were one of the weaker ones in the last two years even though kind of in line with where you had margins in the third quarter of 2011 when you also had some one-time impacts. So I guess adjusted for the one-time impacts, are we seeing the beginning of your strong performance in emerging markets beginning to weigh somewhat on gross margins</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a lot, David. Overall, obviously we're fighting headwinds here as we do see growth in some of the emerging markets. And we continue to see pricing pressure across a lot of our businesses, which again, for the most part, we've been able to offset with product cost reduction.</p>
          <p>So the way we look at it, our standard gross margins, which gets prior to some of the other product costs which are more one-time in nature, the standard gross margins are relatively &#x2013; holding relatively firm and we haven't seen a big change in that over the last several quarters. And we didn't see that in this quarter either.</p>
          <p>So that's why it was primarily one-time issues. We had some obsolescence obviously related to the fact that Resolute Integrity is doing much, much better than we expected and obviously have more obsolescence with Endeavor as a result of that. We had some other integration costs as we do some of these acquisitions that are more one-time in nature that are affecting the gross margin. So overall I don't want to make light of it because I think there are pressures on the gross margin that we've seen for the last several years but we've managed that relatively well. It was more the one-time items that had an impact on us in the quarter, plus FX, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also I think if I can add. Gary, correct me, but the emerging markets themselves, the sorts of products we are selling, the pricing environment is not that different...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...from certainly Western Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe just a follow-up question related to growth. So as we think about the growth in the first half of the year, 5% constant currency, the strongest growth we've seen the last two years. You have got multiple product lines where &#x2013; like Neuromod &#x2013; where growth is the strongest we've seen in three years. Maybe if you could just talk to us about your view that the second half of the year will slow incrementally off the first half of the year? What are some of the driving factors of that or does that simply reflect conservatism given the environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is some conservatism regarding the environment. We obviously intend to drive growth as aggressively as we can. And &#x2013; but look, there is all kinds of headwinds. Western Europe, for example, has a lot of uncertainty built around it &#x2013; Southern Europe. And there's a fair amount of pricing pressure in some of these markets.</p>
          <p>So overall there's still enough uncertainty out there in the marketplace that it's best for us to give the guidance that we just did. In the U.S. we're going to get through the end of the year and there's a policy implications that will be put into place and again there's uncertainty there.</p>
          <p>So I think we have to take into account that headwinds will come our way and we'll do our very best to manage them and we certainly will drive growth as aggressively as we can but I think the guidance that we put out is probably maybe somewhat conservative but we want to be realistic about this.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This might cut across a few of you but following up on Dave's question on the growth second half of the year, if you look at this quarter the one market that really jumped is Japan and that's your biggest international market and it was driven by a bunch of different products. You had the Resolute Integrity, Endurant. You highlighted Advisa MRI, RestoreSensor. Why couldn't that market continue to be strong the next say two to four quarters and more than offset some of the issues in Western Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it could. We expect Japan to be strong. We were very excited about what we've seen in Japan. In fact the Resolute Integrity will have its first full quarter of launch this coming quarter. So I think there is certainly in the next 12 months or so, Japan is definitely going to be one of our premier growth engines.</p>
          <p>We are just balancing everything here, Matt. There is no concrete headwinds and tailwinds that we can lay our hands on, we just know that there's still enough uncertainty out there that you just can't tell. And certainly if you just look at the overall economic environment there are pressures across the world and we just need one of them to fall into a crisis level and it could take a lot of tailwinds from a market like Japan away. And we just have to be careful with that and that's really all I can say around that. But certainly we have high expectations from the Japan market and those I think we'll realize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, Matt, I can't say much more to what Omar said. Obviously we don't expect Japan &#x2013; we expect Japan to continue be very, very strong. We saw increased growth in the emerging markets &#x2013; most of our markets even Europe obviously had very strong growth compared to <mark type="ph" /> lesser markets (41:03) this quarter. So our team has continued to do very, very well and we feel good about that, but as Omar said, there's just so much uncertainty in the marketplace right now. We're still being &#x2013; maybe we're being viewed as somewhat cautious but we feel that's the appropriate thing right now and we'll continue to execute but you're absolutely right there was a lot of strong points in this quarter that if those things continue we should expect to see strong growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we don't get surprises &#x2013; negative surprises. I think the tailwinds that we have by and large we think will continue. We've seen pretty good momentum there but you just never know what headwinds come our way and we just need to be cautious about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one real quick one because that was a lot of answers. Gary, on the FX on the other income versus expectations, was it right to think about that as a $0.02 to $0.03 hit &#x2013; the difference between what should've been and what you ended up losing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was a couple cents impact for what we had there in the quarter. And as we said and I said in my comments, we saw that early in the quarter, it happened in August. We saw it and we took steps to offset it in taking some gains out of the debt and the minority investment portfolio but it was couple cents, Matt.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>

          <p>Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me &#x2013; Omar, let me get you just to comment a little bit about Europe. We saw with a lot of other companies reporting through their September quarters, commentary about Europe. I know you guys commented about Italy. Could you just talk about how you feel about the health of those markets going particularly into a lot of these countries fiscal year-ends and whether you're seeing any slowdown in procedure volumes or purchasing in particular geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, first of all, look, the underlying demand is going to be there for the sorts of products that we sell. So that's going to be there in the long term. Now given that, there's clearly pressure from a volume perspective in Italy which we've already seen going towards the end of the fiscal year certainly and then also not only in volume but also we anticipate some level of pricing pressure in Italy. Now with the lower pricing that might increase some volume at some point in the future, we haven't seen that yet.</p>
          <p>Now Greece also although there's &#x2013; the business is reasonably okay there, I'd say, we still have to watch collections which are out there and see how the market performs in terms of our receivables and that might put constraints on how fast we can grow there. Spain too actually we have been collecting there and although we had a tougher quarter, the outlook is improving a little bit but in all of these Southern European markets at any time policies could come into place which could simply ration the volume, primarily because of budgetary reasons with no other consideration, a short-term move by the governments to just stop volume to save money. It's just as simple as that. That could easily happen and that's essentially what we're seeing in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now we're working the best we can to manage that in that environment and we're also trying to structure our product lines so that even in that environment we can show that we provide economic value, but that's not the traditional way of doing business and over a quarter or two we'll just have to face that volume pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as we said in the comments, Mike, France, Germany, the U.K., the Nordics &#x2013; they're still seeing strong growth in both &#x2013; especially in volume in those markets. So we're not &#x2013; we could see a little bit of a slowdown as we get to the end of the calendar year that we normally see but then we'll see it pick up again for ourselves in January as the new budgets come into effect. So as Omar said, we're very cautious, especially about some of the Southern European countries and we're watching Europe in general just overall but some of the countries are continuing to see very strong growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You touched on it briefly. Could you just comment a little but more on the Edwards litigation and a, what you're doing to shift your manufacturing relative to your existing business outside of the U.S. and b, how you think about this impact in your timing or plans for U.S. launch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, we're making good progress in shifting our manufacturing and most of it is already complete and we intend to complete that very, very shortly. So by and large we think we'll get our volume outside the U.S. very shortly. At this stage we're planning a U.S. launch as driven by clinical trials and I think it's by FY 2014 were planning the &#x2013; FY 2015 we're planning the U.S. launch and that is what we're planning for and we don't expect this litigation to have any material impact on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning. So quick question on the pipeline, especially TAVI in Europe. I think in the last couple quarters you guys have said that you're comfortable that you think the TAVI market in Europe could be growing 15% to 18%. I assume that outlook has changed now but I'd just love to get some comments from you on what you think of the outlook for TAVI in Europe going forward given current market conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; look, procedures &#x2013; I was just in Europe recently and there is strong demand there and we're extending the patient base there but there are some pressures in Europe. I'll let Mike comment on it. We just introduced a new product there as well, which we expect to help. But Mike, why don't you fill us in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. At the start of the fiscal year, we were thinking it was a reasonable expectation to look for 15% kind of growth in the market. That has contracted somewhat, I think we're looking now at high single-digit growth based on the numbers that have been reported so far this year. This is one of the procedures that I think is getting a lot of scrutiny from the reimbursement perspective and there are drags being put on procedure volumes as a result of that.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we are in a very robust product introduction cycle there with the Evolut 23-millimeter product that's been released. We obviously released our Engager data and are expecting to get CE Mark for that in the near term and that's going to give us an opportunity to continue to drive share. We actually think we took market share in the addressable market in Europe here during the last quarter. So we think we are looking at a slowdown versus what we had expected at start of the fiscal year, but it does still look like high single-digit kind of growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Mike, two other quick things. One, can you comment on what you're seeing from a pricing perspective on TAVI in Europe? Is there any incremental pressure there from your perspective? And then any update you could provide on the U.S. trial for renal denervation? Are we still on track there for completion in the timelines that you provided previously? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On pricing for TAVI, that's holding up very well. We've not seen any real pricing pressure there; it's been more of the procedure volume pressure that we've seen there that has resulted in this bit of a slowdown from what we had thought at the start of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>On the TAVI &#x2013; or on the renal denervation activities in the U.S., we continue to aggressively pursue enrollment in the Symplicity HTN-3 trial. As we've said in the past, this is a challenging trial to enroll. It's turning out that we have to enroll more patients than we had expected to get to the number we want randomized and that at the moment with enrollment rates is looking like it's going to be a challenge to get that completely enrolled by the end of the fiscal year. So this could spill into next year.</p>
          <p>However, we have a number of plans that we are putting in place to try to accelerate that. Some of those we can implement unilaterally; other ones we'd have to work with FDA to get the modifications to the protocol. We're pushing on those fronts and we're going to do everything we can to get that enrolled as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we think we can actually accelerate some of the commercialization aspects in the U.S. from the standpoint that we had originally expected there'd be a gap in time between FDA approval and then getting CMS reimbursement approval. We're now trying to pursue a parallel path for those two, which we think would allow us to accelerate the ramp once we get approval in the U.S. So those things are balancing sort of against each other.</p>

I know that you had mentioned reimbursement was a constraint, but what are you also seeing from a competitive perspective given that there's several other renal denervation systems approved for use as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see the competitive pressures being the issue; it is more the ability to &#x2013; the fact we don't have separate reimbursement in many countries for this technology. So our overall coronary renal denervation revenue numbers are very much in line. In fact, they are tracking ahead of what we had provided as guidance at the Analyst Meeting. There is more in the coronary and slightly less in the renal denervation side than we had been talking about, but on balance we are in good shape in terms of the growth of that business.</p>
          <p>I would point out that because there is no separate reimbursement for renal denervation in a lot of these countries, what we're seeing is a very high desire to do the cases but no budgets to do it. We are using the breadth of our cardiovascular product line to basically provide opportunities for incremental growth in other parts of our business in exchange for credits that can be applied to these non-reimbursed market segments and that is giving us an opportunity to grow revenues broadly across the group based on our ability to offer renal denervation as a therapy option.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, two questions for you, Omar. First 5% constant currency growth in the first half and 2% to 4% is the guidance in the second half and the conservatism is certainly appreciated, but on the call you also mentioned your mid-single digit target near-term growth expectation. At the Analyst Meeting you were very clear that you would expect to be there in fiscal 2014, I believe. Could you help us reconcile the conservatism in the second half and how you get back to mid-single digit in fiscal 2014? And then I just have one follow up for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we expect to be in the high end of the range given our momentum, and then we'll see, as the quarter plays out, what kind of ranges are applicable for next year. But we're close enough at this point that we think that, that outlook for the midterm is still valid, that's all I can add. The tailwinds that we have will get further reinforced as we go through the next six months or so we'll get a better feeling for it. I think lots of markets probably will &#x2013; some of the uncertainties they will be removed as you go through the end of the year and different policy areas may be more concrete and we think some of our tailwinds will get firmer. That's what we are expecting and that will take us into next year along the same lines. So we have every expectation to be at least in the high end of this range and that will provide a good continuity in growth as we go into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that's all I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously &#x2013; this is Gary. I mean given the 2% to 4% guidance <mark type="ph" /> all year (54:59), we're consistent with that because there are some uncertainties as we've talked about, we've highlighted. We don't want to play those up too much because the reality is we have been performing better than that. We've been performing better than our guidance and again we have every expectation and our hope that we can do better than our guidance even in the back half of the year but it's just with the uncertainties in the marketplace we're just continuing to try to say, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's keep the 2% to 4% growth expectations out there at least for the rest of this year, and as things firm up and we get a little bit better certainty on where some of these things are playing out, then obviously we'll determine what our guidance for FY 2014 is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful and then, Omar, you talked about expanding into large joints earlier on the call. Can you talk about your strategy in that area? And does Kanghui give you what you need? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Kanghui is a starting point. I mean that's all I'll say. We're excited about Kanghui, but the large reconstruction and the large joint reconstruction is actually at this stage a pretty small element of what we are going to get with Kanghui, and we're more focused on their spine and trauma business, and primarily their success in China. I mean into the orthopedics market in general, that capability will help us but you've got to remember that we've got a series of other products that do address the orthopedics market and we have a good sales channel into that market.</p>
          <p>So when these types of products do come along and they have reached the appropriate critical mass and breadth as well as quality, we'll have an opportunity but it's really very early for us to either depend on it or even comment on it in too much detail. Chris, do you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you said it well. It's relatively early. We're new to this business, as you know. Our primary focus is on China. We do have multiple product lines in large joint reconstruction for China, more of a premium line as well as more of a value line. We're just getting some of those products or Kanghui is just getting some of those products into the marketplace right now and it's going to be a learning opportunity for us starting in China.</p>

          <p>Great. Just wanted to ask one on CRM and Spine. Those markets continue to struggle. You've actually performed a little bit better there the last couple of quarters but maybe that's the area that &#x2013; could you really accelerate your growth year-over-year? So you provided some comments on stability but I was just curious to get some more feedback on your implants volumes growing versus the bulk ordering in CRM and how that could lead to better growth going forward?</p>
          <p>And then in Spine it seems like the pricing pressure is overarching some of the new product launches but could you maybe talk about how we might see growth improve sequentially in the Spine market for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's take those one at a time. First of all, you're right. In CRM the implant rates do give us a line of sight to what the future will look like and also the reduction in the bulk end of quarter purchases will anniversary to some degree as we go forward. So the implant rate growth gives us some confidence in the future. And I'll let Mike comment on that a little bit here.</p>
          <p>But on the Spinal area they too &#x2013; our Core Spine business actually is showing some pretty good traction primarily based on our new products and procedures. Remember in these numbers we've got our Kyphon product line as well, which is actually a negative drag to the overall numbers. So if you really look at the Core Spine, which is the bulk of the market, our performance is quite encouraging and the market dynamics certainly have not changed.</p>
          <p>Some of the pressures relating to pricing as well as payer pushback, they're still there, but they haven't worsened and we're certainly I think beginning to demonstrate that some of our new products and procedures are of real value and are getting customer acceptance. I think both of these markets are important and deserve a little more color so I'm going to ask Mike first to talk a bit about share and then I'll ask Chris to comment on Spine.</p>
          <p>So, Mike you want to say something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is encouraging to see the ICD implant rates stabilizing. We still have the pricing pressures that we've referenced obviously looking at that 3%-ish U.S. pricing pressure that we referenced in the call, continues to be an issue for us. On the other hand we were very encouraged to be a position of taking market share there. That's primarily been in the replacement arena and we also obviously have seen our lead to port ratios increasing. We are encouraged that we're heading into a product cycle in the CRM space with obviously the Viva/Brava CRT families in Europe with CE Mark in the third quarter, the Evera product line in Q4.</p>
          <p>We showed data at the recent AHA meeting that pointed to the value of lead Integrity alert on identifying issues with competitive leads. That's something that will help us immediately in Europe. That's something that we will take to U.S. FDA to attempt to get labeling. And then of course as we head into next year we'll have the U.S. Viva/Brava and Evera product lines as well as the Advisa MRI product line.</p>
          <p>And then we're obviously we're encouraged with the AHA data on block HF which showed the benefits of CRT Pacing in patients with AV block which been traditional been standard pacer applications. This would give us a pricing opportunity in that space. So there are a number positive trends there and we are hoping to drive market share further and that we think we have the catalysts to do that but we also want to be cautious given the pricing pressures that we've seen in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, you want to say a few...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just on Spine. The pricing pressure in Spine has been pretty consistent over the last number of quarters and we're managing that through really two or three major strategies. Number one is to continue to introduce new technology and we do get better pricing when we introduce new technology. The Solera system for example is really hitting on all cylinders now with critical mass not just in the smaller rod diameters but the larger rod diameters. We now have 400 sets of the 5560 and we have also fully rolled out the minimally invasive package with Solera. And when that technology comes into the market we're able to offset some of the bigger declines in the legacy type systems.</p>
          <p>But also trying to bring new procedures to the market. We've talked in the past about MAST MIDLF, for example, which is a mini open procedure enabling more surgeons to do less invasive procedures and now at NASS this year we just launched the OLIF procedure which is another example of procedural innovation that's setting us apart and also firming up our pricing.</p>
          <p>So we don't expect pricing pressure to go away, to answer your question, but we expect that we'll have more and more tools to combat that and to position Medtronic well. And as Omar said, we feel really good about the direction of our Core Spine business.</p>

          <p>Yup. Sorry, I was on mute there. I had &#x2013; thanks for taking the question. I had two follow-ups on Spine; one, some of the smaller players have reported in the last month and have commented that they're anticipating or currently seeing greater push-back from payers on the commercial side. I'm wondering if you can give us your color on what's happening on the commercial side with respect to payer pushback, if you're seeing any? And then I had a follow up on PODs. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, let me first comment on this and then I'll let Chris talk to this as well. From everything we can see, the underlying dynamics have not changed. It's just basically what has been for the last 12, 24 months. And so we are not seeing that, so I don't know if Chris, you're closer to this, any comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's been a consistent theme, it's really no worse now than it was a year ago or six months ago. And I think what's happening is that the overall medical system is anticipating this, is experiencing this and is finding ways to work through it. Additionally I'm encouraged by a more concerted effort on the part of some of the medical societies in pushing for more guidelines for a range of different types of Spinal procedures which are helping with the commercial payers. So I don't think we expect this trend to change one way or another but I think we're finding ways to manage it better.</p>

          <p>And just a follow-up on PODs, while we were down at NASS it seemed like the emergence or the growth of PODs at least was increasing a bit in that surgeons were moving towards PODs.

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We started seeing the effect of PODs several years ago and it tends to follow somewhat of a regional pattern when you see these things develop. But right now we don't believe that the PODs are gaining share. We believe they are somewhere around 10% in the market. It has been a headwind for a period of time but it seems relatively stable. We are encouraged by some of the pushback that the PODs are getting by states as well as the federal government, in fact, the fact that the OIG is now surveying hospitals on PODs is a very encouraging step in our direction. We are very concerned about the PODs and the conflicts of interest that they represent and so we have an active position against PODs. We do not participate in that business model and it is a little bit of a way of life right now but it's not directionally worse right now than it was say a year ago.</p>

          <p>A couple things, I was thinking before the quarter that we might see some color on &#x2013; initial color on the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast but then I realized your quarter ends on the 26th. Are &#x2013; was there much impact? And will we see some impact at all on procedures or volumes in the next quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there was obviously short-term impact because hospitals were shut down and so on. And we've had some ripple impact at the end of that. I think over time these will recover. To the extent that they will impact Q3 we'll have to see, but it's one of the headwinds we're going to manage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; Rick, we obviously saw something the first couple of weeks after with some of the hospitals but it seems to be getting back to kind of normal as we go forward, and so we don't expect this to be too impactful here in the quarter overall. Hurricane Sandy really had no impact on our distribution capability. We were able to, with all of our offices and things, be able to manage that aspect of it. Obviously as Omar said, hospitals were shut down there for a period of time but we're start &#x2013; so we saw a small impact in the first week or two of this quarter but the reality is it's relatively minor.</p>

          <p>Okay. And two other quick ones. Omar, a bunch of Med Tech industry folks are in Washington lobbying for rollback of the Med Tech tax. Are you hopeful at all that we could see that changed? And maybe a last quick one for Chris. Chris, there's some new approvals in the cervical space, new products getting approved. Maybe any updated perspective on how that market's likely to evolve with some new and changing, evolving technology? Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the Med Tech tax, previously we've stated our position that it's something that we would like repealed if it's possible and we've worked with AdvaMed through their leadership and supporting them. However we really like to focus on things that we can control.</p>
          <p>Right now that's what the law is. That's what the projection is going to be and we can assume that that's going to come into place, and therefore, we've got to build our business to deal with it. And hence we've built our plan assuming that the Medical Device Tax will come into play in January. We've potentially got $50 million or so that we've got to manage through the balance of the year &#x2013; of the fiscal year for us and like we've stated before, it's something between $125 million to $175 million a year that we've got to manage and we're focused on building our business model to deal with it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On cervical, thanks for asking about cervical, Rick, and yes there have been a number of new entrants in the U.S. cervical disc market. We're very, very excited about the BRYAN ACD which we've launched now. We've done more than 100 procedures, all of them competitive. We've trained more than 300 surgeons and obviously there are more options on the market right now. I think that's going to be good for patients because heretofore patients have had limited options for cervical discs in the U.S. but it's also important to note our overall cervical portfolio is really getting stronger. Our cervical team is doing a great job with the ATLANTIS VISION ELITE as well as the VERTEX SELECT so now BRYAN ACD kind of completes the circuit for us in that important segment and it's going to be good for the market.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Mike, my first question is to you. As you know, there was a pretty inflammatory paper published this week on the Optim coating, which suggested the potential for high mass loss six years out even at body temperature. I guess the question is, what were the origins of that? Was the FDA involved in it, the decision to urging you to publish it, which we've heard? And I guess the final question is what you think the long-term implications of that for your share position in the market?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think Mike has got thoughts on that. Yeah go ahead, Mike.</p>

          <p>Bruce, we've been studying the silicone polyurethane copolymer materials for about 10 years here at Medtronic for numerous applications in multiple businesses both chronic lead applications as well as the more acute device uses, and the lead project for that was the <mark type="ph" /> Seventa project (1:10:44) which is our seven French ICD lead where we were considering using this material as the primary lead insulation material.</p>
          <p>Now given the experiences that we've had with Fidelis, we were intent on characterizing the performance of this material over the entire expected life of its use in a patient, 10 plus years, and so we engaged in a very thorough analysis of the materials looking at all of the potential mechanisms for failure that we thought could come into play. During the course of that work we determined, quite to our surprise, that there was a failure mode called hydrolysis which basically is a chemical reaction that is occurring within the material that is causing over the useful life of the material, the molecular weight of that polymer to degrade.</p>
          <p>So we shared that information with the suppliers and found that not only had it not been reported but in fact, it was, from our perspective, unknown and that this was the first time it had been identified as a potential failure mode. So both our internal advisors and we ourselves determined that it was important that this information get into the scientific literature through the peer review process so that this performance characteristic of the material could be considered by scientists and engineers at companies who are considering using this material as well as global regulatory authorities so they would understand how this plays out in the course of the use of a device. So we chose the vehicle of the Macromolecules journal, which is the journal of the American Chemical Society and that was published last week.</p>
          <p>I'm kind of surprised to hear you use the term inflammatory, this &#x2013; anyone who's read the paper would say this is a very thorough technical paper, I myself am a chemical engineer and I found it difficult reading just in terms of the complexity of the information that was being relayed, but this was purely a technical journal that we're putting it out so that individuals can consider this in their evaluation of this material for use in future products.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Omar, a follow up to you. In your prepared comments if I heard it correctly, you said that U.S. Spine procedure growth was negative mid-single-digits but encouragingly, ASPs across price and mix were flat. I guess the question is, is on a strategic basis, where do you see case growth over time? And do you feel &#x2013; how long will this readjustment period last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, let me just clarify. The procedures were low-single-digits not mid, so that does make a little difference. But beyond that, we continue to believe that the &#x2013; and I've kind of heard this from all my visits to customers and hospitals around the U.S. and around the world, that the Spinal procedures, long-term, will continue to grow because of demographic reasons. Low back pain is an issue, certainly trauma and deformities and so on are clearly needs, but as the population ages, the back pain problems will only increase. And so we are betting and are quite sure that long-term, these procedures will come back.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, there is a level of certainty that has to be put in the market through guidelines, better guidelines, good coordination with healthcare delivery systems as well as payers and we intend to work with both of them to firm up these guidelines so that we can work in a more certain environment, and that's what's driving some of the volatility in this marketplace. And that's going to take a little time to resolve but we are in the middle of that effort working, because of our leadership position, working very closely with societies and with our customers to put these guidelines in place so that things are more stable as we go forward and we learn about the clinical procedure more effectively.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on a worldwide basis I guess you expect this to kind of match the overall corporate profile in the midterm, is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a global basis, yes. We've certainly seen significant opportunity for growth in the emerging markets in this area because they're very under-penetrated. And again, with the right awareness levels, the right training of physicians, and again putting in place the right guidelines, we think that the emerging markets at some point will reach an inflection point and will provide growth. But in the midterm you're right, we expect this segment of our business to get close to our overall corporate profile.</p>

          <p>All right. So with that, let's close the call here. Thank you very much for your questions and on behalf of the entire management team I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. For those of you in the U.S. I want to wish you and your families all a very happy Thanksgiving and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 call in February. Thank you.</p>
