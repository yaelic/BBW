          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the TransCanada Corporation 2008 Second Quarter Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. David Moneta, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, Mr. Moneta.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you today. We're pleased to provide the investment community, the media, and other interested parties with an opportunity to discuss our 2008 second quarter financial results and other general issues concerning TransCanada.</p>
          <p>With me today are Hal Kvisle, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Lohnes, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer; Russ Girling, President of Pipelines, Alex Pourbaix, President of Energy and our Vice-President and Controller, Glenn Menuz.</p>
          <p>Hal, Russ and Greg will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and other general issues pertaining to TransCanada. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks. A copy of that presentation is available on our website at transcanada.com. You can be found it in the Investor section under the heading Conference Calls &amp; Presentations.</p>
          <p>Following our remarks, we will turn the call over to the conference coordinator for your questions. During the question-and-answer period, we'll take questions from the investment community first, followed by the media. In order to provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue.</p>
          <p>Also, we ask that you focus your questions on our industry, our corporate strategy, recent developments and key elements of our financial performance. If you have detailed questions relating to some of our smaller operations for your detailed financial models, Myles, Terry and I would be pleased to discuss them with you following the call.</p>
          <p>Before Hal begins, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please see the reports filed by TransCanada with Canadian securities regulators and with the US Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd also like to point out during this presentation, we'll refer to measures, such as comparable earnings, comparable earnings per share, and funds generated from operations. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and are therefore, considered to be non-GAAP measures. As a result, these measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures have been used to provide interested parties with additional information on the company's operating performance, liquidity, and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Hal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our second quarter results and recent developments in our business. Following that, Russ Girling, President of Pipelines, will provide more information on the significant developments recently announced on Keystone crude oil system. Our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lohnes, will then review our second quarter results in more detail.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, I have often referred the three key value creation themes at TransCanada. Our first theme, maximizing and sustaining the long-term cash flow and value of our growing asset base; secondly, completing greenfield projects on time and on budget; thirdly, creating and cultivating a high quality portfolio of future growth opportunities. During the second quarter of 2008, I'm pleased to report we have made significant progress in each of these three strategic areas.</p>
          <p>The first value creation theme is about maximizing and sustaining both earnings and cash flow from what we consider to be an exceptional suite of blue chip assets. On that front, I'm pleased to report strong second quarter results. For the second quarter of 2008, TransCanada's net income was $324 million or $0.58 per share, an increase of 21% on a per share basis, compared to the same period of 2007. Comparable earnings for the second quarter of 2008, up 316 million or $0.57 per share, increased by approximately 27% on a per share basis, compared to the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Funds generated from operations for second quarter 2008, up $676 million, increased by $80 million, or 13%, compared to the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share for the quarter-ended September 30th, 2008, on the outstanding common shares. Shareholders that reinvest their dividends in additional common shares of the company, through our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, will continue to receive common shares from treasury at a 2% discount to the average market price.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our second theme. Our second theme is about securing and executing on greenfield projects and selected acquisition opportunities in the short to medium-term. Once again, we continued to make significant progress during the second quarter, by advancing our Keystone Gulf Coast expansion project, as well as the Coolidge and Kibby power generation projects.</p>
          <p>Today, we are in the midst of executing on a $17 billion capital program that is expected to deliver significant value for our shareholders over the next five years. The slide showcases our extensive list of secured pipeline and Energy opportunities that will be completed over the 2008 to 2012 timeframe. These are real projects, most of which are underway today. In addition to our active projects, we continue to expand and enhance our portfolio of large-scale Energy infrastructure projects, including oil and gas Pipelines, power generating facilities, and natural gas storage facilities.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to expand on a few of the key initiatives. Firstly, Keystone. As you know, there were significant developments on Keystone during the second quarter, the largest of which was the announcement of our expansion to the Gulf Coast. Our decision to proceed with the Keystone expansion followed successful negotiations with prospective shippers who have agreed to make significant shipping commitments to Keystone during a binding open season, which commenced in mid-July.</p>
          <p>Today, Keystone has secured total commitments of 830,000 barrels per day, for an average term of 18 years. These binding contractual commitments represent approximately 75% of the commercial design of the expanded Keystone system. When completed, Keystone will be capable of moving approximately 1.1 million barrels per day of Canadian crude oil to key markets in the US Midwest and to the US Gulf Coast, making Keystone one of the largest crude oil delivery systems in North America.</p>
          <p>Russ Girling, President of Pipelines, will talk more about the exciting developments on Keystone in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now comment on our Rockies gas pipeline proposals. We continue to work on opportunities to move an increasing supply of natural gas from the US Rocky Mountains to growing markets through proposals like Sunstone, Pathfinder and the northern Border's proposed Bison project. Each of these projects would connect to our existing pipeline network and provide customers with access to diverse markets.</p>
          <p>Turning now to other recent developments in the north, on the Alaska front, the Alaska House of Representatives voted in favor of granting TransCanada a license to build the Alaska pipeline. While this is an important step, we still require a positive decision from the Alaska Senate on our proposal in order to move forward.</p>
          <p>The Alaska Senate discussion is anticipated by August 2nd. If approved, it would be an important step in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project, which would connect stranded US natural gas reserves in Alaska to markets in both Alaska and the lower 48.</p>
          <p>In another move to address customer needs, we recently held a non-binding open season to gauge interest for a new natural gas transportation service connecting the very promising Horn River and Montney/Groundbirch areas of northeastern BC to TransCanada's Alberta System. In those non-binding open seasons, TransCanada received requests for gas transmission service exceeding 1 bcf a day from each area by 2012. Based on these expressions of interest, we expect to complete a binding open season in the next several months.</p>
          <p>We believe TransCanada is very well positioned to move new gas supply from these regions to premium North American markets. As highlighted on the map, our existing pipeline network can move this incremental supply to markets in California, the US Midwest, eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. And we can do that more cost effectively than the competition.</p>
          <p>In order to further position ourselves to serve customer needs, TransCanada filed an application with the NEB, to establish federal jurisdiction over the Alberta System. This would enable the Alberta System to extent across provincial boundaries, providing integrated natural gas service to Alberta and British Columbia customers, and eventually to northern gas producers.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Energy portfolio, we recently announced that the Salt River Project signed a 20-year power purchase agreement to secure 100% of the output from TransCanada's planned 575-megawatt Coolidge Generating Station in Coolidge, Arizona. Pending appropriate permits, construction is scheduled to begin in late 2009. The simple-cycle natural gas-fired peaking power facility is expected to be in service in May of 2011.</p>
          <p>On the wind front the 132-megawatt Kibby Wind power project received unanimous final development plan approval from the State of Maine's Land Use Regulatory Commission. Pending all remaining approvals, construction is expected to begin in third quarter of this year, and the project is expected to be fully commissioned in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>The Portlands Energy Centre in Toronto went into simple-cycle service on time and on budget. It is currently able to provide 340 megawatts of electricity to the Toronto market. It's anticipated that the Portlands Energy Centre will be fully commissioned in second quarter 2009, and will be capable of providing 550 megawatts of power at that time.</p>
          <p>And finally, an update on Ravenswood. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has issued an order authorizing our acquisition of the 2480-megawatt Ravenswood facility in New York City. This acquisition remains subject to New York Public Service Commission approval, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Russ Girling, our President of Pipelines, who will provide you with more details on Keystone developments. Russ?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hal. And good afternoon, everyone. As Hal mentioned, in mid-July, we were very pleased to announce that we had sufficient shipper commitments to move forward with the 500,000 barrels per day expansion of Keystone to be US Gulf Coast. With that expansion, the commercial design of Keystone will increase from 590,000 barrels per day, to approximately 1.1 million barrels per day.</p>
          <p>The $7 billion expansion will run from Hardisty, Alberta to northern Nebraska, and then south to the Gulf Coast, just east of Houston. The proposed routing, shown as the yellow line on the map &#x2013; this is not a modest expansion, as you can see, in fact, it's larger than the initial phase. Targeted completion is in 2012 and expansion will provide a direct bullet line connection to the largest and most complex crude oil refining center in North America, representing the largest untapped market for Western Canadian crude oil for Western Canadian producers.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, US refiners have depended upon supply primarily from the US Gulf Coast, as well as Mexican and Venezuelan supplies. US refiners are looking to diversify the crude oil supply, and Keystone will provide a link to connect growing Alberta oil sands production with markets on the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>Following successful negotiations with prospective shippers to the Gulf Coast, Keystone has now secured long-term commitments for approximately 830,000 barrels per day, representing about 75% of the commercial design of the total system. As evidenced by these commitments, at an average term of 18 years, we have received strong support from producers and refiners. We expect support to continue to grow during our binding open season, which runs through to September 4th of this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, construction began on the initial $5.2 billion phase of the Keystone project, including facilities in Canada and the United States, which will transport as I said, 590,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Hardisty, Alberta to US Midwest markets. Deliveries to Wood River and Patoka, Illinois are expected to commence in late 2009, and deliveries to Cushing, Oklahoma will begin in late 2010.</p>
          <p>The Keystone Pipeline will be constructed and operated as one integrated system. Full cycle returns for the entire $12.2 billion estimated cost of the project are expected to provide a target unlevered after-tax IRR in the range 7.5 to 9%.</p>
          <p>The competitive advantage of the Keystone extension are extensive, and provide potential shippers with a number of important and very unique offerings. First of all, we have a competitive toll resulting from Keystone's direct route, which is about 25% shorter than other routes to Chicago &#x2013; through Chicago and on to the Gulf Coast. In addition, we also utilize a 480-kilometer section of the initial phase of the Keystone pipeline from a place called Steele City to Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>
          <p>Second, there's toll certainty, with a fixed variable toll design that we've put in place. There is no increase in the fixed portion for the term of the contract, and the smaller variable portion is strictly on a flow-through on an actual cost basis.</p>
          <p>Third, Keystone's physical advantages are also unique. Its direct route and single bolt line configuration result in short transit time of about 20 days, and significantly reduced batch contamination and degradation. There is no breakout tankage, and the volumes will be shipped in large batches, or batch trains, with a minimum size of about 100,000 barrels. This results in fewer and smaller interfaces between products and therefore, better product quality.</p>
          <p>And last, subject to regulatory approvals, Keystone will provide firm transportation service, using capacity that is reserved for, and committed to, term shippers for the priority transportation of their committed volumes.</p>
          <p>Next, I'd like to review with you our cost mitigation strategies for the procurement and construction of the full $12 billion Keystone project. As one, large integrated project, we are able to offer up to the construction marketplace a continuous build that will last four to five years, and similarly, for steel, we will keep mill space busy for about four to five years. These longer term arrangements are very attractive for these suppliers and at the same time, helps in mitigating our costs and supply risks.</p>
          <p>We've tried to lock down as much of our construction cost as possible at this stage in the project. On the initial phase of the Keystone project, approximately 60%, or $3 billion of the $5.2 billion are currently fixed and locked in. This includes about 80% of the line pipe, and 95% of the valves and pump costs.</p>
          <p>All the pipe mill space has been secured for the pipe, and Keystone construction cost risks &#x2013; cost risk sharing is in place between Keystone and its shippers and on the initial system, any cost variances are shared on an average of about 50% to TransCanada and 50% to the shippers.</p>
          <p>On the Keystone expansion, we have good visibility of cost based on our experience with the initial phase of Keystone, we have positioned ourselves well by leveraging off existing contracts and suppliers to obtain execution and cost synergies. We are well advanced in locking up pipe mill space and pricing for the higher costs items such pipe, pumps and construction costs.</p>
          <p>Having secured commitments from shippers, we anticipate locking in approximately 40% of the capital costs by the end of this year. Any costs variances on the Keystone expansions are shared 75% to the shippers and 25% to TransCanada. Keystone will assume a level of construction risk to achieve greater toll certainty for the shippers, and as well, to align with the shipper's interest in minimizing those construction costs. For the purpose of providing sensitivity on the magnitude of cost overrun on the entire project, a 1 billion cost escalation, after cost sharing, reduces the IIR by approximately one-third of a percent over the life of the project.</p>
          <p>I want to take a moment to review the key dates for the Keystone expansion. The binding open season, which began on July 16th runs through September 4th of 2008. Following that open season, we will proceed expeditiously with obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both Canada and United States starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Final approvals are expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2010, with construction activities commencing shortly thereafter. The target in-service date is in 2012.</p>
          <p>Over the longer term, the Keystone pipeline system could be further expanded from 1.1 million barrels a day to 1.5 million barrels per day at a very relatively low cost. Through the addition of pumping facilities, the capacity of the system could be increased in 25,000 barrel per day increments up to 200,000 barrels a day. We estimate the total costs to expand system by 200,000 barrels a day, with additional pumps, to be about $300 million in today's dollars. We did add a further 200,000 barrels per day of expansion to the US Gulf Coast through the looping of the section of pipe from Steele City to Cushing.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have made significant progress and advancing the Keystone crude oil pipeline project. When complete, Keystone will become one of the largest crude oil pipeline systems in North America, taking crude oil production from Western Canada to important refining markets in the US Midwest and the Gulf Coast regions.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to Greg Lohnes, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide some additional details on our second quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Russ. And good afternoon, everyone. As Hal mentioned, earlier today, we released our second quarter results. Net income for the second quarter was $324 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $257 million, or $0.48 per share for the same period last year. Second quarter 2008 net income included $8 million of net unrealized gains resulting from the changes in fair value of proprietary natural gas storage inventory and natural gas forward purchase and sale contracts.</p>
          <p>Second quarter 2007 net income included positive income tax adjustments of $16 million. Excluding these items, comparable earnings were $316 million, or $0.57 per share in the second quarter 2008, compared to $241 million, or $0.45 per share for the same period last year, an increase of approximately 27% on a per share basis.</p>
          <p>The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily due to increased contributions from both the Energy business and Corporate, partially offset by a slight decrease in earnings from the Pipelines business. I will briefly review the second quarter results for each of our segments, beginning with Pipelines.</p>
          <p>The Pipelines business generated net income and comparable earnings of $158 million during the second quarter, a decrease of $8 million over the same period in 2007. Of note, GTN's net income for the second quarter increased $10 million, primarily due to the positive impact of a rate case settlement in January 2008, and lower OM&amp;A expenses. TransCanada's proportionate share of net income from other pipelines decreased $6 million, primarily due to increased project development costs, and the negative impact on earnings of a stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>Next, some comments on Energy. Energy generated comparable earnings of $143 million in the second quarter 2008, compared to $90 million in the same period last year. Western Power's operating income was $116 million in the second quarter, compared to $57 million last year. Higher realized power prices in Alberta were the primary reason for the significant increase in earnings in Energy's Western Power business. Also contributing to the increased earnings were higher realized power prices in New England, and increased sales volumes to wholesale, industrial and commercial customers in our eastern Power business. Eastern Power's operating income in the second quarter was $80 million, an increase of $10 million, compared to the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Finally, in power, TransCanada's combined operating income from its investment in Bruce Power was $31 million in the second quarter, which was consistent with the same period in 2007. Details of the proportionate share of operating income in Bruce A and Bruce B can be found in the Energy portion of our second quarter report.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, the overall plant availability percentage in 2008 is expected to be in the mid-80s for the two Bruce A operating units, and in the high 80s for the four Bruce B units. Finally, with Bruce Power at June 30th, 2008, Bruce A had incurred $2.2 billion for the refurbishment of Units 1 and 2, and approximately $200 million for the refurbishment of Units 3 and 4.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Corporate. Net income from Corporate in the second quarter 2008 was $15 million, compared to net expense of $3 million in the same period last year. Excluding favorable income tax adjustments in the second quarter 2007, Corporate's comparable income of $15 million increased $30 million, compared to $15 million of comparable expenses in the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Corporate costs were lower in the second quarter 2008, due to a reduction in various financial charges. Details can be found on pages 14 and 15 of the second quarter report to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to the cash flows statement. Funds generated from operations were $676 million in the second quarter, an increase of $80 million, or 13%, when compared to the same period in 2007. This increase was primarily due to the higher earnings from our Western and Eastern Power business.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures in the second quarter were approximately $635 million, and related primarily to the ongoing development of greenfield projects, such as the Bruce A Restart, Portland's Energy Centre, Halton Hills and Cartier Wind, as well as an expansion of the Alberta System and construction of the Keystone Oil Pipeline.</p>
          <p>Finally, our financial position remains strong. At the end of June, our balance sheet consisted of 48% debt, which included our proportionate share of joint venture debt, 4% junior subordinated notes, 1% preferred shares, and 47% common equity. I would note that our debt on this slide is calculated net of cash.</p>
          <p>Cash balances are higher than normal, due to a common share offering completed on May 13th. The operating resulted in gross proceeds of $1.27 billion that will be used by TransCanada to partially fund acquisitions and capital projects of the corporation, including amongst others, the acquisition of the Ravenswood generating facility, the construction of the Keystone Oil Pipeline and for general corporate purposes.</p>
          <p>After completion of the common share offering, TransCanada filed a preliminary short form shelf prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, and with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, under the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system. The short form shelf prospectus will allow for the offering of up to $3 billion of common shares, first preferred shares, second preferred shares, and/or subscription receipts in Canada and the United States.</p>
          <p>As with our existing Canadian and US debt shelf, TransCanada intends to maintain an equity shelf in the normal course of business. Additionally, on June 27th, TCPL entered into a bridge credit agreement with a syndicate of three banks for US$1.5 billion. This facility was put in place for the additional financing required to close the Ravenswood acquisition.</p>
          <p>Also of note in the second quarter 2008, TransCanada issued common shares from treasury under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan totaling $58 million. Following TransCanada's announcement that it had agreed to acquire Ravenswood from National Grid, all three rating agencies placed the ratings of TransCanada under review for a possible downgrade. Subsequently, S&amp;P and DBRS conducted their reviews and reaffirmed the company's ratings on April 18th, and May 5th, respectively. On June 24th, Moody's lowered the long-term debt rating of TCPL to A3 and the issuer rating of TransCanada Corporation to Baa1, both with a stable outlook.</p>
          <p>Following the downgrade from Moody's, TCPL's senior unsecured ratings, assigned by Moody's and S&amp;P, became effectively aligned at A3 and A-, respectively. As such, the company does not anticipate any material change in its debt funding cost. As Hal mentioned, we have a $17 billion capital program currently underway.</p>
          <p>This slide provides an update on our committed spending profile for the next several years. Our continued large capital program will add significant and growing cash flow over the next several years, which will be available to fund future growth. The ongoing dividend reinvestment plan will provide TransCanada with approximately $250 million annually. Combining that with our growing cash flow, strong balance sheet, our liquidity and access to capital markets, we are well positioned to finance our future growth program going forward.</p>
          <p>We would not expect to issue common equity to fund our greenfield program. As we add new projects to our existing growth program, we will look at portfolio management, and continue to monitor the capital markets for alternative financing options.</p>
          <p>That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back to David for the question-and-answer period.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody, and congratulations on a good quarter. Russ or Hal, the first question on Keystone here. To the extent we're looking at a range of 7.5 to 9% unlevered returns on the project as a whole, can you say whether or not the bottom end of that range, the 7.5% can be met with just what is under contract today, i.e. that 75%?</p>

          <p>Pretty much it can be met with minimal spot volumes, that's one of the major reasons for the range. The range sort of represents uncertainty around spot volumes, and at the bottom of the range, our spot volume assumptions are pretty minimal. As well, capital costs would be the other major variable that would be in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the key there is on minimal spot volumes, with just what we have committed, we can get roughly to that 7.5% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's about 75% of the revenues are underpinned by the contracts, so that gets to the low end of the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just the second question here, really looking at Bruce. With respect to &#x2013; I think it was page seven where we had the CapEx kind of broken down by project &#x2013; 3 billion for Bruce, I assume that's net to you guys. Now that we're kind of closing in on Units 1 and 2, I guess, being roughly 68% done. What is that implying for Units 3 and 4, as far as the spend? I mean, I can kind of do the quick math, but it's coming out to a fairly high number. And I just want to clarify that, and where are we with the OPA, as far as moving forward with additional contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry &#x2013; additional contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, if I remember correctly, there was &#x2013; we were looking to extend the fixed price out on to 4 as well, or was 4 covered under &#x2013; is Unit 4 covered under the original?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, under the amended agreement all four Units are covered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But as far as the capital spend for Units 3 and 4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well pursuant to the deal we did &#x2013; and I'm sorry I don't have all the &#x2013; I don't have the contract in front of me, but basically, how the deal worked is we agreed on a range of capital outcomes, and it's now up to Bruce and its partners to go through all the work to prepare a capital estimate, and if that capital estimate approved by Bruce and its partners falls within the range we had agreed upon, then the project will go ahead.</p>
          <p>In the event that our capital estimate were to fall outside the top end of that range, the option would either be to not proceed with the project, or to reenter into negotiations with the OPA, to see if there's a deal to be done at the higher capital cost. And so, we're right now just really starting to engage in that budgeting process. So, it's going to be probably a good year or so before we're through that process.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess I have to go to Western Power results, because they were spectacular, being up double year-over-year, with frankly, it doesn't look like much changed in your contract spot mix of 80-20. The sustainability of that, anything on the forward strip you could give us color on? One of your suppliers, I guess, this morning said that the spot average was $108. That's extraordinary for a Q2. What are your thoughts about sustainability here on a go-forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Sam, it's kind of interesting. Q2 has historically in the Alberta market always been kind of a weak quarter, pricing-wise, usually demand is not very high. You are correct, we had an average of about 107, $108 for the quarter. I don't think it would be reasonable to expect that kind of pricing to sustain, but I think we're looking at sort of for the balance of the year, probably something in getting towards the mid-80s, all ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Something in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A follow-up question, I guess, much broader. Saskatchewan's now joined the nuclear study party in Canada, along with New Brunswick and Alberta. I imagine you're involved in some fashion in those three provinces, particular Alberta. Is there anything to say on any progress there whatsoever at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be fair to describe all of those jurisdictions as in the sort of very, very earliest stages of contemplating nuclear power. Saskatchewan is an interesting one for us because it is such a large producer of uranium, and the people in the province have that much more experience with nuclear industry in that regard.</p>
          <p>It has a number of positives that I think potentially would even outweigh what regions outside of Ontario would have, so it's &#x2013; but once again, I mean, we're in really early days, and I think there's going to be a fairly extensive period of consultation before those provinces even develop a position on nuclear generation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Sam, it's Hal. I'd just add to that, that on many of these complicated development projects, we're really pressing for some sort of regulatory clarity, some sort of clarity around the government approval process before we get too far into them. You could say we've learned something in the Mackenzie, but I think, particularly with nuclear plants in Alberta or Saskatchewan, or the Slave River Hydro project, all of these kind of things, we want to see a clear roadmap as to how we're going to get through it before we get too far into it.</p>
          <p>And the governments are generally supportive of the plans we've put out, and we now need to work with those host governments and the regulatory authorities to figure out how do we get through what has become quite difficult regulatory water on many fronts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. In terms of funding all the projects, you talked about having a future offerings up to $3 billion, and I believe you also talked about possible asset portfolio divestitures. Is there a particular part of your portfolio that would be susceptible to sales, or is there &#x2013; it kind of the &#x2013; are you looking everything &#x2013; is everything on the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; the broad comment I'd make on that, would be that we would make decisions to hold or divest of an asset based on its remaining potential for value creation. If an asset is mature, and we don't see significant strategic value in retaining it to pursue other objectives, and we think we could get pretty full value in the market, then that would certainly be a candidate.</p>
          <p>But we don't have a lot in our portfolio right now that would fall into that category. We're pretty comfortable with the assets we hold on the pipe side. Our different pipelines give us great strategic advantage in pursuing everything from crude oil conversions, to US Rockies gas, to McKenzie in Alaska, and connecting LNG in the east.</p>
          <p>So, on the pipe side, we're comfortable on the power side, we've been pretty disciplined about sticking to our western region, and our eastern region, and Bruce, and so we don't have a lot of scattered, what I might call, non-core assets. The suite we've got right now is pretty good.</p>
          <p>So, I wouldn't see a lot of strategically driven divestments. We may from time-to-time have a financial reason why we'd want to sell something to raise money, but as Greg pointed out, that's not a near term priority. Greg, would you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just say that that portfolio management includes the wide suite of things that we could undertake. We've mentioned before that we monitor the potential for dropdowns into our LP, where we would maintain control of the assets. And we also from time to time talk about partnering with strategic partners who have an interest in assets that have a very long life and very stable cash flow. So, I'd take that in a broad context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with regards to the Keystone Pipeline, is there a particular grade of crude that the producers are looking to bring down to the Gulf Coast, or is it kind of mix of everything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that it's mostly heavy at the current time, but there is some interested in moving lighter grades of crude oil, and certainly, through Keystone to the Midwest, there's been lighter grades of crude oil. So, in total, the system will move a mix of various types of crude. But for the Gulf Coast, initially out of the gate, for the most part has been bitumen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to start with, most of the excess supply in Western Canada is bitumen and diluted bitumen, and most of the market demand for it in Houston, I think, Russ, would be for bitumen, because they have the refining complexity to process that.</p>
          <p>But I always like to add that the Keystone system would be quite happy moving lighter grades of crude, and the lighter the crude, the better, frankly, we can move more of it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, for some concerned parties that keep emphasizing that this project is just exporting jobs out of Alberta, we don't agree with that. It's very important that crude oil not be bottlenecked in Alberta. And Keystone provides a very high volume outlet to really high quality markets, and if the producers decide over time to upgrade more of that crude in Alberta, we're just fine with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is there any issues with the amount of &#x2013; supply of &#x2013; diluent to be able to transport that heavy crude down to the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There can be, but there's a number of different projects underway. It's one of the interesting things, is you can use synthetic crude from operations like Suncor and Syncrude as a diluent. And so that of course, is called synbit as opposed to dilbit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then, shifting &#x2013; on the power side of the equation the &#x2013; what were the observed market heat rates for your guys in Alberta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geez, I don't have that in front of me, but I would guess it would probably be about 10.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Something like that, it might be a little higher than that even.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you say that certainly higher gas prices played a part in kind of expanding those margins in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's right &#x2013; but one of the &#x2013; particularly in Q2, a really big impact in Q2 was &#x2013; there was that &#x2013; in addition to that, there were a fair degree of unplanned outages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Alberta fleet, which also had some impact in that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just on the Bruce reference prices that were reset on April 1st, the inflation adjustment &#x2013; is that observed from the kind of the floor prices that we see for Bruce B, or is that also observed in the prices for Bruce A?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it was &#x2013; I think that was primarily related to some just generally reduced BD cost, is primarily what it was. And, I think, we are overall generally tracking a little lower on BD cost than we probably had anticipated this part of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that generally our BD expenses, again, would be up, just due to level of activity that we're undertaking right now, as we kind of outlined in the overview. As far as the northern development numbers go, I'll have to get back to you on that. Glenn, take a look at --</p>

          <p>Bob, you're just looking at the million dollars a quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yeah, it was a million dollars in the quarter. There was nothing there before. I assumed maybe you were capitalizing it before, and so I was a little surprised there, and I would've thought maybe you would've started capitalizing some of the Keystone costs as well. So, I'm surprised to see it maybe rise up like it did in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the northern development, the Alaska costs, we haven't started to capitalize yet. As you know, the Mackenzie APG advances are capitalized. The amount is a million dollars &#x2013; yes, it was zero last quarter. I think you're looking at rounding in there, quite frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, and one last question on the Portlands, just accounting for that, again. How do you expect that sort of to come through? You were starting to run it this summer and than you closed it down again. Will you capitalize any costs through the &#x2013; between the periods it's running, and that comes up again next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically, the plant is meant to be a combined cycle plant. That's the intended use of it. So, we will be continuing to capitalize costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you report the earnings as they come through here in the quarter and then capitalized -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are effectively no earnings to date on Portlands Energy Centre &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just on the &#x2013; from the Rockies westward, does Palomar depend on Sunstone to any extent? Or are they two completely independent projects? I remember that Palomar was proposed first. So, I'm assuming there isn't much of a connection, that either one could go ahead, no matter what happens with the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are independent projects, I think Palomar could be larger, to the extent that Sunstone moves forward, and moves more volumes into that region, and one way to access the markets for Sunstone is to use to Palomar. But they are independent projects, and I would expect them to move forward on an independent basis. They have different groups of shippers that have indicated interest for both of those pipes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, and when should we see more &#x2013; look for more clarity on the &#x2013; Pipelines in both directions, either the Rockies, whether it's Pathfinder, Bison or Sunstone?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll see that the next couple of quarters are critical. The producers in the Rockies are getting nervous, as you can sort of by where market differentials are going, that they could see a very large widening of their differential, unless we bring on some new capacity in that, sort of late 2010, early 2011 timeframe.</p>
          <p>In order to hit that timeframe, some decisions have to be made in the next one to two quarters, as to which pipelines are going to move forward. So, I would say that you could look for that kind of timeframe for some decisions to be made by the various proponents.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Russ, you touched on the full cycle IRRs for Keystone. And at the 7.5% it that's where your current commitments are, what is that &#x2013; what's the assumption with respect to cost overruns, to be at that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's again -- is that -- the way we run it is we don't run, sort of, individual scenarios for sort of worst case of every scenario -- worst case spot, worst case capital cost overruns &#x2013; is we run very reasonable scenarios. And at the low end of all those things, we come to a number that looks like around 7.5%. I think the sensitivity we gave around capital cost was a third of a percent for every billion dollars in total overrun on the cost. So that &#x2013; it swings the IRR by about 0.3 of a percent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, to some extent, 7.5% is no additional volumes. We're probably on time, on budget? Like this isn't the worst case scenario, is that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It could definitely be worse than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, on &#x2013; is it symmetric on the 9% side, would that be fully contracted and under budget, or would that be fully contracted, on time, on budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Again, that's a reasonable range of the high range. It could be higher than that as well, based on a certain group of moving lots of spot volume, and coming well under budget, or even on budget, could lead you to a number in excess of 9 or 9.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess, just last question. If you're looking at the Rockies region, how many pipes do you see being needed in that 2010 to, say, 2011 timeframe to serve just the general Rockies region? And I don't know if you can split that between what you think might head east and west?</p>
          <p>And then with respect to Sunstone, given El Paso's announcements that Ruby's moving forward, is there a feeling that that's just, kind of, killed Sunstone at least for that 2010/2011 timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'd say that &#x2013; our view is that we'd probably need somewhere between 1.5 and 2 bcf of capacity out of the region in that 2011/2012 timeframe. So that would suggest that a couple of projects in the neighborhood of $1 billion could probably move forward.</p>
          <p>And with respect to whether there will be a west project or not, I think is still uncertain. What we're hearing in the marketplace is that there are still people interested in both our Pathfinder project, and in our Sunstone project, and we haven't seen any reason not to continue forward with those projects at this point in time.</p>
          <p>We understand that Ruby has announced that they're moving forward for sure, but we also know that there are certain hurdles that they have to get over in the marketplace before they can actually do that. One of them obviously, is their largest anchor shipper is Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which has to run through a regulatory process in California to obtain approval for that shipping agreement. And we know that that won't be approved till at least the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So, our view is it's still an open field for competing, and that's what we're doing as hard as we can.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from Matthew Akman from Macquarie. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, very much. My first question, again, it's for Russ &#x2013; sorry not to give your voice a rest &#x2013; but, in terms of your Horn River and Montney pipeline. What is the construct that would be developed under? Would that be in rate base, or would that be a contract-type pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would go into rate bases. And what we've proposed in our open season is a new build pipeline, that would be an National Energy Board-regulated. And then if we're successful in our application to change jurisdiction from albeit Alberta system, from Alberta regulator to a federal regulator, we would roll those shipping commitments, if you will, into the NGTL system and use the NGTL rate design to service those shippers. So it would become part of the NGTL rate base, essentially.</p>
          <p>In terms of timing, our understanding is that the National Energy Board is going to review our &#x2013; we had sort of dual-pronged application for jurisdictional change, one was to determine whether the National Energy Board had jurisdiction. And the second one was, if we did have &#x2013; if they did have jurisdiction, then, just the logistics essentially, of making the transition.</p>
          <p>The National Energy Board has ruled that they will hear both of those in parallel. So, what would happen is we would get a decision at the end, which would &#x2013; if approved in our favor, would be that jurisdiction would move, and all of the logistics and permits would be granted at that point in time.</p>
          <p>What they've told us is that that could occur as early the first quarter of next year, which sort of dovetails well with our planning for the Montney-Horn River play, as we hope that would come together in sort of the middle part of next year.</p>
          <p>So, we're actually planning right now sort of the two scenarios. One is, if the independent separately contracted pipe, if we don't get jurisdictional change, and it will <mark type="audio gap" /> to our existing rate base, if we do get jurisdictional change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that, I guess, then &#x2013; is the NGTL system still going to be reviewed by the Alberta Utility Commission in terms of its equity ratio and ROE at the same time, even though it may not be under that purview anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the &#x2013; at that point in time, I guess it'd be -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because the AUC is doing a generic hearing for all the assets. So, it's kind of happening at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. So, I again, we've got a number of proceedings underway that are currently operating under AUC jurisdiction, our north central cross-over application for example, our NGL convention application as well. And we would expect that the &#x2013; business as usual &#x2013; that the AUB would render a decision on those. And those would be binding decisions.</p>
          <p>The generic process, in terms of timeframe, is &#x2013; I'm not sure if that timeframe will dovetail with the National Energy Board timeframe of Q1 of next year. If a decision was made before, a jurisdictional change, obviously, that would change. If they made a change in capital return of either structure or a rate of return, those would be applicable to NGTL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if it happened afterwards, I wouldn't think that they would be &#x2013; is &#x2013; those would be &#x2013; have to be determined by the National Energy Board. And speaking of generic process, I guess &#x2013; in terms of outcome, I'm not sure if, automatically, we'd see a change in our rates anyway, or whether we would have to apply for new rates. So, a lot of those things haven't been sorted out yet &#x2013; but that'd be my view right now, Matthew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's hope the NEB comes out on top of all this anyway and don't have worry about it. My next question is just a quick one for Greg, on Corporate, usually I think of Corporate as being an expense, but I think there was income in this quarter. What &#x2013; I could ask detailed questions about it, but instead, I'm just going to ask, bottom line, what should we expect for a run rate in this segment going forward?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say Matthew that, you're right, Corporate is a bit of catch-all between financial charges, and some other adjustments, and tax adjustments and things such as that. As you see, it is positive this quarter. I don't think you'd normally see that, if I can say that. So, as far as a run rate, I think something more akin to where &#x2013; where you saw first quarter probably makes some sense, somewhere between zero, and I think we had 22 at first quarter, so somewhere in there.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. Not sure if Hal or Russ, you want to deal with this one. But just your outlook on crude dispersion in North America, especially Alberta production, how much volume do you see over the next, let's say, 5 and 10 years being shipped down to the Gulf, and than in just the other areas in North America, how do you see the markets developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start out. Russ may have better answer than I do, Andrew, but I just observe that we are going to be set up to move roughly a million barrels a day through the Keystone system, a significant portion of which may be just notionally think 6 or 700,000 barrels would end up at the Gulf.</p>
          <p>A certain portion of that volume will diverge to other markets on the way down. But I think we would see that much, and we're set up over time to have low cost expansions of Keystone. One of the advantages of having some spot volume space available is it does give us a leg up on competitors who don't have that space available.</p>
          <p>We've learned in our Canadian gas system that having a little spare capacity is a good thing in that we can bring it onstream much cheaper than other people can bring on new projects. So, we would intend to stay ahead of that curve and be the preferred shipper of Western Canada crude to the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>We also would recognize that the Chicago market, and markets in that Chicago region, are attractive to Canadian shippers, and our competitors do move crude oil into that area, and we would expect that to continue. But the volume there would largely be determined by demand. And it'll be a market that is preferred for Western Canadian producers, but I would hazard to say that it's probably limited in terms of absolute volume growth, it's a pretty mature market.</p>
          <p>We see some crude perhaps moving east, but you know the tough thing there, is you get to the East Coast of North America, and you're competing directly against crudes that can come in from Norway, for example, and places like that at a relatively cheap shipping cost, much shorter distance of haul from Norway to the Northeast US or the Maritimes of Canada, than it is from Norway or other places to the Gulf Coast. And so we think the Gulf Coast is actually a better market for us than the far eastern parts of Canada.</p>
          <p>And finally, we know that there are multiple projects that people are pursuing to move crude to the Pacific Rim, and we think that is a good option for Canadian crude, if there's a pipe there that Canadian crude producers might want to use that, perhaps as a spot market, or perhaps as a base market, but it's not the market that we would consider to be the preferred market for Western Canadian crude. We would give that to the Gulf Coast, and so that's where we've chosen to focus our efforts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see any opportunities to really head into the California market at all using some of your existing rights of ways?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do &#x2013; but there's lot of other issues there. Clearly, we believe there will be crude oil supply available out of Western Canada, and we do have rights of way, and we've also done extensive engineering on other routes that we could use to go down to the California market, but we'd have to see some evidence that the California market would be a stable market for Western Canada crude oil over the longer term. And I think that would be a bit of an uncertainty right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think what we're dealing with is, is that we're expecting production to grow in Alberta 2 to 3 million barrels a day and today, the bulk of that goes &#x2013; we service the Alberta refineries, and then the bulk of it goes to the Midwest, as Hal said, and pretty much, that market is saturated with Canadian crude. We've got about &#x2013; Canadians have a very high market percentage, probably 70, 80% plus.</p>
          <p>So, there isn't &#x2013; we don't see much growth in that market. We may see a shift in quality, if certain refiners add cokers, and that sort of thing, but if they do that, that means we'll introduce heaviers and it'll push out lighter crudes.</p>
          <p>So, those crudes, that 2 to 3 million barrels a day, have to find a new home. And we've looked at all the various new homes that it could go to, so as Hal mentioned, offshore, going to Pacific Rim, going to California, as you mentioned, and the Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast is currently the biggest pocket that can absorb that amount of crude oil. Just coincidentally, their supplies are declining. The Canterelle field's declining, the Venezuelan crude's potentially moving to other places like China, and those sort of heavier grades sort of moving away from the Gulf Coast provides an opening for Canadian crude.</p>
          <p>But I think where we have to go in terms of dispersion, your question on dispersion, is we have to find a market that's large enough for a couple of million barrels a day of steady sort of eating up of that crude every day. And so that's why that we believe that the marketplace has jumped on the Keystone project, is it provides that link for a million, or a million and a half barrels.</p>
          <p>That's not to say that once we grow through that, that they might look to other markets, but what we know is that the Gulf Coast could actually absorb a few times that amount if necessary, if Canadians needed to push crude, and compete sort of with &#x2013; sort of crude on crude competition &#x2013; that's a place where they could compete, and push out other crudes. You can't do that in the Midwest and it's very difficult in California. There just isn't &#x2013; the size of the market there &#x2013; necessary to move couple million barrels a day to it.</p>
          <p>So that's how we came to the conclusion, both on our own, and then the market response is, that's the logical place to move the bulk of the new production that comes on, but we are looking at projects that go both &#x2013; go off the West Coast and down the West Coast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one final point &#x2013; the look of the market size in the Gulf Coast, you see growth opportunities for Keystone, but do you see growth opportunities for other pipelines within that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is like I said, there's &#x2013; right now, we have captured I think the next phase of growth are the Western Sedimentary Basin out of the oil sands. But there'll be another one in 2014/2015. As we said, we're positioned with the potential for an expansion of another 400,000 barrels a day at that point in time. And we'll have to compete head on with others with their proposals as that new crude comes on.</p>
          <p>And then, if you can believe the forecast, we're going to see even more crude production by sort of 2018, '19, '20, and we'll have to find new markets for those as well. And the Gulf Coast is the likely place to absorb the lion's share of that volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just a clarification on Keystone. You mentioned that you expect about a million barrels per day, running on Keystone, maybe 6 to 700,000 of that to the US Gulf Coast. What timeframe are you referring to, to get to that 6 to 700,000 barrels a day? And I guess, I'm looking for an expectation of ramp-up, not just before that point in time, but also beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the &#x2013; initially, we'll come on at about &#x2013; the initial capacity of the system is about 600,000 barrels a day and able to take the crude to Patoka and Wood River. So the ramp-up timeframe we're looking at kind of right now is, it'll probably take us two years to ramp up, sort of 2009/2010 to get to that sort of level.</p>
          <p>And then, for the expansion to the Gulf Coast, as we said, it's 500,000 barrels a day that we'll have available to move to the Gulf Coast. And I would expect that the &#x2013; pretty much the day that we're ready to start operating, we'll move 500,000 barrels a day to the Gulf Coast. As we've said, we've got 300,000 barrels a day under contract currently we're out for an open season.</p>
          <p>Our expectation is that number will come up somewhat, but depending on sort of the supply-demand, we'll be in a position where we could move 500,000 barrels a day in some time, sort of pick mid-2012, plus or minus a few months, as our expectation of when we would be in a position to move crude to the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>But once it's ready to go, once we've filled it up with line fill and the pipe's ready to go, we'll be ready to move that crude to market.</p>

          <p>And Linda, there's the Cushing destination point as well. Some of that volume, depending on what shippers want to do, could end up moving further south to the Gulf Coast. When we proposed, I think Russ, the first project at Cushing, that was as far as it was going, and people nominated to Cushing, because that's far as they could get. It remains to be seen as we move to the fully integrated extent of an expanded system, some of those volumes may move around a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; Hal's absolutely correct &#x2013; is, potentially at the end of 2010, we might be in a position to move, because we may construct both the Cushing leg &#x2013; like from Steele City to Cushing and Cushing to the Gulf Coast simultaneously in 2010. And if we do that, we could probably push through, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 300,000 barrels a day to the Gulf Coast in 2010, if that's how our customers wanted us to sort of ramp up the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, beyond the mid-2012 time period, you're assuming perhaps an extra half a million barrels by 2014 in your internal planning purposes or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, our internal plan, like in terms of the economics we've presented, it doesn't include any of that expansion today. If the volumes grow in Western Canada, and there's a desire to move that to the Gulf Coast, what we're saying is that, in a very short order, we could pumps in 25,000 barrel a day increments after that 200,000 barrel a day level.</p>
          <p>And then we could that loop that section from essentially Steele City to Cushing, and get ourselves up to 400,000 barrels a day, if that's what the marketplace wanted us to do. And it wouldn't take us very much time after 2012, if there was actually crude volumes to move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just a clarification on your sensitivity. That billion dollars that you cited on a third of a percent of returns, was that on 100% pipeline basis, or is that net TransCanada ownership?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's 100%. So, our estimate is 7 &#x2013; or 12 billion, if it goes to 13 billion, that's the kind of sensitivity that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up question on your current operations on ANR. I was bit surprised to see earnings down $4 million year-over-year, and it appears that it's largely higher OM&amp;A. Is that a timing issue, or should we expect that sort of continued higher level of OM&amp;A every quarter going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you should expect a higher level of OM&amp;A than we experienced in the same quarter of last year. So, I would suspect that there's some timing difference in those kinds of things in there, so. So, I think run rate would be someone in the middle of those numbers some place, if we're talking about a $4 million spread there. I don't know, Glenn, if you have a better view than that, but there's no reason why costs are up. Actually, costs should be down slightly, because we're sort of getting through the initial phases, and getting everybody in their jobs, and that sort of thing, so we should see some of those redundancies and things that you have initially start to move away. So, if anything, I would expect them to be down slightly rather than up slightly going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's fair.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from Daniel Shteyn from Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. First, I'd just like to check something about the Keystone pipeline. Now, I certainly understand the fact that it's a contract that is opposed to a regulated pipeline, but have you been able to build any sort of shipper support for your piece of the capital spend during the construction phase, such as for instance, AFUDC on the regulated pipe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if I understand your question. Is it &#x2013; we will &#x2013; we in the contracts, we get &#x2013; there's a contractual, I guess, return of AFUDC, so we get return on the pipe during construction from an earnings perspective. We don't actually take that into earnings. We capitalize the interest costs, and that's the extent of sort of benefit on the earnings side.</p>
          <p>But from an economics perspective, we do get the benefit of AFUDC during construction. It's part of the capital cost estimate, which goes to the calculation of the toll. So &#x2013; for example, if the project takes longer and the AFUDC is higher, that's part of the 75-25 risk sharing that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, there is AFUDC, but from what I understand you were saying, there is just AFUDC on the debt portion but there isn't any on the equity portion <mark type="inaudible" /> accounting statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just for earnings for the accounting statements from it. But from an economic perspective, we do collect AFUDC on total capital. It's calculated based on our weighted average cost of capital, is the way we calculate AFUDC for economics. But for accounting purposes, my understanding is we only capitalize the interest portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that's the difference between the regulator pipe and the contracted pipe in this case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that means, I think, Daniel, is that a regulated pipe would show earnings upfront, even when it's not operating, but for the equivalent IRR, it would then show smaller earnings over the future life of the pipe than a regulated pipe would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. So, that's the first thing, the second thing is, looking at slide 25 of your slide package for this quarter, the estimated capital spend. Just looking through, I guess, the five years there, wondering if under the Energy you've baked in any sort of CapEx for the Ravenswood expansion or that potential expansion that you talked about when you acquired the asset? Or is that something that is not being in put in there for &#x2013; deliberately or what's the deal with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not in those numbers. Those numbers would correspond to the list of projects that Hal talked about on page seven. And Alex, maybe you just want to talk about timing of looking at potential -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just I think really the only comment I have on that is that our real ability to really roll up our sleeves, and dig into the re-powering options that we identified will occur after the deal closes in Q4. But that we certainly &#x2013; we are staffing up and putting our best people on that. So, we'll be working on that over the next number of quarters after we close the deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Hal here. I'd just point out that what do you see on slide 25, are only those really solid committed projects, that we've got underway. In the Energy sector in particular we always, every year, we have a growing portfolio of projects that we're going to invest in. This fade that you see on Energy investment from '09 through 2012, that's simply because we have not yet brought firmed up projects forward. I am pretty comfortable that we'll be investing something like $1 billion a year, and maybe little more than that in Energy projects as we go forward. But these are the ones that we're committed too, and that are actually tangibly going ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Finally, last point on Alberta power prices, which have certainly been pretty high over the last quarter. Is there &#x2013; I'm just wondering, what has been the earnings effect of the new emission intensity rules in Alberta on your bottom line? Has that been a net cost to you, in terms of what you have to pay TransAlta for instance to make them whole under the PPAs? Or have you been able to recover most of that in higher power prices, so that's relative to the historical and also, what's your expectation for the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; my recollection is it's probably about somewhere between 15 and $20 million a year, would be the costs that we've calculated under the Alberta program. And I mean, I guess what I would say is, to the extent that coal-fired units are setting the price, we and I imagine every other coal-fired unit that is setting the price, we would be recovering that. And there's probably something less than a full recovery when the gas units are setting the price. So, I would probably say that we're probably recovering somewhere in the range of probably around 35, 40% of those costs.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Well, one more, as I've &#x2013; we've taken up a lot of time, but the Bruce A Unit to Re2 project, well over halfway, half of the tubes removed, but at this point, how is that project looking for being on in 2009 or early 2010?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're still on the ballpark on that. I think that we've sort of always said around the end of '09, beginning of 2010, with one unit lagging the other by six months. And I think we're in that range.</p>
