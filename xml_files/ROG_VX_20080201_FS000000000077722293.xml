          <p>Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome to the Roche Full-Year Results and Report 2007. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Franz Humer, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our yearly results presentation. Roche again in 2007 achieved outstanding results operationally, financially, and as it regards the progress of our pipeline. As in previous years, we again delivered on all the commitments we have made to you at the beginning of '07.</p>
          <p>For the seventh straight year, group sales increased in double digits to a record of 46 billion Swiss francs, an increase of more than 4 billion over '06 achieved entirely through organic growth. Clearly, the Pharma division was the main driver behind that growth. Sales again grew twice at the rate of the world market, driven by the high demand for our key product in oncology, transplantation, and virology. Sales of oncology products in total grew by approximately 20% and now make up 50% of our Pharma sales.</p>
          <p>Also Roche Diagnostics, growing at 6%, grew faster than its respective markets and Bill and Severin will go into more detail on those numbers.</p>
          <p>As we have predicted and as we had anticipated, orders for pandemic stockpiling of Tamiflu declined significantly in the second half. However, if you exclude the pandemic sales, the underlying growth in Pharma continued at double-digit levels with the fourth quarter being the strongest growth quarter of the whole year for Pharma.</p>
          <p>Most of the government stockpiling orders have now been filled and we anticipate further significant decrease in Tamiflu sales in 2008. As we've implemented over the past few years a flexible supply chain, we do not have any one-off expenses due to that change in demand. The combination of higher revenue and a variety of programs we instituted already a few years ago to increase productivity had a very positive effect on profitability, despite the fact that R&amp;D grew at a significantly faster rate at 16% to 8.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Overall cost growth was below sales growth and as a result operating profit increased by 22% to 14.5 billion. The margin achieved a new record increasing by 3.5 percentage points to reach for the first time more than 30%.</p>
          <p>Due to the fact that we also decreased slightly our tax rate, we achieved a net income increase by a quarter, by 25%, an outstanding performance also in comparison with our peers. This record net income does not include any exceptional items. It also led to a further strengthening of our balance sheet and Erich will talk to that one.</p>
          <p>As a result, core EPS grew at twice the rate of sales, and as you know by now the Board of Directors is therefore proposing to the AGM at the beginning of March an increase of our dividend by 35%. So the dividend payout will increase from 3 billion to 4 billion Swiss francs, thus we are continuing to progressively raise not only the dividend but also the payout ratio.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to further strengthen the base for future growth. We have separated the roles of Chairman and CEO; the restructuring of our R&amp;D organization into five disease biology areas, which we explained at the beginning of '07 and also at mid-year is progressing, has progressed very successfully. It is now up and running and gaining in momentum.</p>
          <p>In 2007 we've also been focused on growing our pipeline. We continued to create 40 new alliances between Pharma and Diagnostics, thus enhancing our portfolio of products, tests and technologies. Among the most significant ones were the purchase of Alnylam, which gave us access to the Nobel Prize-winning technology of RNAi, our entry into therapeutics vaccines with Transgene, the agreement with Toyama for the development of an oral, totally new RA drug.</p>
          <p>We also stepped up our acquisition activity. We acquired THP to strengthen our therapeutic antibody research, we acquired BioVeris, 454, and NimbleGen in Diagnostics, and the latter two make us the world market leader in the exciting field of ultra-fast gene sequencing and high-density microarrays. Very importantly over the last two weeks we've signed the definitive merger agreement with Ventana. This gives us access to the fast-growing field of tissue-based diagnostics and increases our leadership position in the area of personalized medicines.</p>
          <p>We now have nine products in Pharma, each generating over a billion Swiss francs. Apart from CellCept's patent expiring in the U.S. in '09, we have no major product patent expiry over the next years. We are committed to maximizing the potential of our core assets and build our new products as they come to the market over the next few years.</p>
          <p>As I've mentioned already, most government orders for stockpiling of Tamiflu have now been completed. And excluding Tamiflu, we expect in 2008 the Pharma division again to outgrow its market, we expect the Diagnostics division to outgrow its market, and for the group to grow in high single-digit figures. This is due to the continued growth of our existing products in oncology, but also due to the new introductions of products like Mircera and towards the end of the year, Actemra.</p>
          <p>If we look at profitability for '08, we can see three different movements here playing out; on the one hand, increased profitability due to continuous productivity improvement programs in all areas, improvement of the product mix, and also the growing portfolio. On the other hand, we have a decline in Tamiflu sales and the associated profits with it and that is a decline in sales of 1.7 billion Swiss francs. And thirdly, we have decided to continue to invest in all therapy areas in our promising R&amp;D pipeline. We expect in 2008 additional clinical data in CNS, core assets to move into Phase II, and we've got a number of very important compounds and Bill will refer to those in more detail to move into Phase III &#x2013; the CETP inhibitor, GLP-1, pertuzumab, ocrelizumab. So a portfolio that goes from strength to strength.</p>
          <p>I know that many of you write and talk about the clouds hanging over the pharmaceutical industry and you are probably right. But undoubtedly Roche is a different company; it is a different animal, different from its competitors. None of our competitors has an organization in research and development like we have with the majority ownerships in Genentech and Chugai and our spread of our own research centers and disease biology areas across the globe. None of our competitors has a lower exposure to patent expiry than we have.</p>
          <p>We have an existing portfolio on the market with very strong growth potential due to earlier use and new indications. We have a new product portfolio that is delivering and no other one of our competitors can bring Diagnostics and Pharmaceuticals better together to create the long-term competitive advantage in personalized healthcare.</p>
          <p>So for 2008 we expect to achieve a high single-digit increase in sales, both divisions outperforming their markets despite the lower Tamiflu sales, despite the higher R&amp;D spending. We are aiming at a core EPS at least at the same record level as in 2007 and due to the fact that we continue to have very strong cash generation, we intend to continue raising our dividend payout ratio over the next three years. I think that is a very strong, a very ambitious outlook and we are committed to deliver on that outlook.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. With that, I hand over to Bill.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Franz. Ladies and gentlemen, an absolute pleasure to take you into the overview of the Pharma division and the results '07 and some of the updates on a lot of the key important issues and projects that we are developing for the years to come.</p>
          <p>But, first of all, if you like, the end of term summary note from the teacher. Double digit growth in sales and profits, certainly if we were to be a U.S. dollar reporting company it would have been a 15% growth in sales, with an 11% local growth and it would have been 14 if we took out the pandemic sales of Tamiflu.</p>
          <p>The margin increased by the single largest step ever of 3.8% to 35.5% and we saw significant progress in all our key marketed assets. Avastin in the Roche territories, now launched in breast cancer, towards the later end of last year in lung cancer, and right at the end of the year we received approval for renal cell carcinoma plus interferon and also as the year started we got the broadening of the label in colorectal cancer, for a further two-thirds of the patients with that disease. We saw Mircera launched in the European Union and start its contribution to the management of our erythropoietin franchise. We saw in terms of milestones from the portfolio that at the end of the year Actemra was filed here in the United States and also in the European Union. That was the summation of four pivotal studies, 4,000 patients, there is a fifth study continuing which looks at the long-term joint protection elements of the product.</p>
          <p>Ocrelizumab was entering into Phase III in lupus, we also moved into a dose-finding late-stage Phase II in multiple sclerosis in the relapsing-remitting setting. Pertuzumab, the dimerization HER2 product that we've taken now into Phase III in combination with Herceptin in metastatic breast cancer. And also as the year ended, we concluded our overview of the CETP inhibition sector and have taken the decision to move forward into Phase III.</p>
          <p>During the first half of this year, we will see the second of the GLP-1 studies, the Phase II study with higher dosages, but we've already budgeted that this will go into Phase III from the mid-year.</p>
          <p>So if you were to look at our score card that we shared with you at the beginning of last year, we have updated this regularly, quarter-by-quarter and probably the most significant element at the close of the year was the Actemra filing in the United States and Europe.</p>
          <p>When we look at the growth rate, this just again pro memoria shows you the total growth rate, the growth rate of the legal entities that constitute the Pharma division and also in circles on the right hand side of the screen here the, excluding Tamiflu and the Roche Pharma, 12% growth in both half years, 12% total year. So a solid year of performance of the key asset in the Roche Pharma territories, good growth in the States with Genentech and Chugai going a little bit under the market. But I'll explain some of that as we go through.</p>
          <p>I mentioned on the operating margin; this moved forward in all three of the business legal entities and the division at 35.5% is certainly top tier now. When I say now, maybe six, seven years ago when we were looking at the lower ops of 19 or 20%, we certainly did not feel comfortable with that, and I hope you agree we have moved ourselves into the top tier.</p>
          <p>When you look at the overall P&amp;L, that 11% growth in local sales translated into 22% growth in operating profits. You can see that we benefited on the one hand from what we call royalties and other operating income; some of that is just sheer underlying royalties. Some of it is the sale of assets. You can argue are those one-offs. We each year do a job of tidying up the tail products and we tend to use that for licensing business development. We actually put in about 700 million into business development activities during the year. And we also embedded within items like the cost of sales, we had one off cost, the withdrawal of Viracept in Europe at 135 million is certainly an offsetting one-off.</p>
          <p>So there's nothing fundamentally behind these royalties but is, if you like, triggering the growth in the margin and the growth on the operating profit. It's just the intelligent management of the business.</p>
          <p>Research and development; if we exclude the impairment, that grew 17%. And this figure does not include the partnership deals, because under IFRS, much of the up-fronts are capitalized. So in R&amp;D, strong growth really and we've been signaling this in this room and others for the last few years. Our real goal here has to be that we have a richness and a depth of development activities that take us forward into the two thousand and teens and we are continuing the growth trajectory of the company.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A at 17% did have some one-off items: for example, high legal costs in the courts in Boston and a number of other projects where reducing from thirteen SAP systems in Europe to one, a project that rolled out in our top five markets during the course of the year, and that's still work in progress but these are, if you like, one-off costs in the cost structure, so net-net, a doubling of the rate of growth on the operating profit than on the sales line.</p>
          <p>So let's look, what lies behind us now. We will first of all touch on oncology and you can see here that the oncology growth, 20% growth overall. We are now number one clearly by miles in the oncology field. Interestingly enough, when we had an internal meeting the other day, the head of oncology, on his chart, showed the oncology sales of Roche would, if it was a separate company, be number 12 in the world market. So it's a very strong, very significant portfolio and you see that the growth outside the United States, given that some of the products have arrived later into those markets, is certainly growing strongly and that now 50 percentage or 56% are outside the United States and for some of the cancers, I think historically people have viewed U.S./Europe at about 50-50. What has been underestimated is the demand in the emerging economies of the world, economies that have a growing population that can't afford these interventions.</p>
          <p>Also, on the right side of the chart when we look in the IMS data set, Avastin is clearly the most successful off take of an anti-cancer drug ever and that growth rate, with the indications coming through, we certainly aim to sustain.</p>
          <p>If we look at the individual brands; Rituxan, MabThera, certainly at 15% growth we still continue to benefit from maintenance therapy extending the use of the product, and as I will come to shortly, the sales in rheumatoid arthritis have reached a very useful first half billion in Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>For Herceptin, you would have heard from Ian Clark at Genentech on the Genentech review, the penetration in the U.S. is at about 75%. In the top five European Union markets we have reached 70% and still more to go. I don't think until we are well over the 80% are we beginning to plateau in patients in those countries.</p>
          <p>What is interesting is to see the growth of Herceptin in other markets; Eastern Europe, Central and Eastern Asia, Middle East, Latin America and so forth. For Avastin, clearly the lung cancer sector was one of the key growth engines here in the States. Outside it's still principally been in metastatic colorectal cancer, a promising early launch in breast cancer and we did, in one or two countries, significantly put in capping programs, which are also working nicely now. In some other countries we got full reimbursement and then in the autumn, we added lung cancer and that is off to a good start, but it would still be more of the growth of this year and beyond for the European sector.</p>
          <p>We also saw Avastin launched in the mid-year into Japan and given that the requirements in Japan are to collect the first 3,000 patients under some rather constrictual pharmacovigilance program, that was completed by September, October and so now our colleagues there are broadening the engagement with the treatment audience and improving Avastin's uptick.</p>
          <p>For Xeloda at 19% growth both here in the United States and in the rest of the world, increased use in the adjuvant setting in colon cancer, in metastatic colorectal cancer and, as we are working on the broadening of the label, both in Europe and in the United States. Also Xeloda was approved in Japan in the adjuvant setting given that this oral delivery system of 5-FU has its origins in that country, it is a large sector and Xeloda is one of the most documented from a regulatory point of view and therefore, I think that will be an engine of growth also in Japan.</p>
          <p>For Tarceva, strong growth in lung cancer; during last year we got the approval in pancreatic cancer and that will become a further enhancer of the growth rate. Maybe what's also important to say for Tarceva, the incidence of lung cancer is much higher in Eastern Europe, in China, in some parts of Latin America and therefore I think the stage is set for this product to grow significantly in <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>One way of summarizing some of this potential and just maybe trying to put a perspective on the U.S., non-U.S. proportionality would be if you took &#x2013; that Herceptin we are now at 68% non-U.S., for Xeloda 62%. Now, some of that I'd have to say is reimbursement of oral cancer drugs and this country still favors injectables rather than orals. But this is still a strong performance and we think we can grow in both arenas with Xeloda.</p>
          <p>Tarceva rather similar as an oral intervention and MabThera/Rituxan, you will remember on a stage like this, a couple of years ago, we were sitting at two thirds U.S., one third non-U.S. and that steadfastly has been addressed and we're getting closer to the 50-50 mark.</p>
          <p>With Avastin, we're at an earlier stage in the journey outside of the United States in just the chronological launching and that is growing strongly as you would have seen if you look at our quarterly growth rate.</p>
          <p>So where are we in the profiling of Avastin? This chart helps to summarize in green those areas where we've secured European launches, U.S. launches and what they're with. You can see in the adjuvant setting, clearly the C-08 is probably the study that most people in the financial community are modeling or following because it's chronologically viewed on a safety update every six months.</p>
          <p>As you know, there are probably two viewpoints this year, and clearly this is still a very interesting one to watch. From first principle, the drug should work in the adjuvant setting. Clearly the question has always been in that earlier cancer is the safety profile suitable for that audience? Every time the safety people open the box and tell us to carry on, I take it as a further endorsement on the safety.</p>
          <p>So I think we're on the right journey here. You just have to place your bet. There is a power into this study, which tells you it should be 2009/'10 for it to read out. What we're looking for, and what I think many people are waiting for, is the signal stronger such that it crosses the line of significance earlier. When? This is nothing that any of us can predict; absolutely data-driven.</p>
          <p>And data-driven, the AVANT study, which is also fully recruited, is also being tracked. But it's tracked by its Drug Safety Monitoring Group on an event-driven basis. So that's not something that we can predict when the Drug Safety Monitoring Group will be meeting, but that is a second very large study. There's more than 3,000 in one and 2,000 in the other; so it's significant.</p>
          <p>As the year went on we started the recruitment in lung adjuvant, and right at the close of the year and at the beginning of this year, we're rolling out the HER2-positive and negative breast studies.</p>
          <p>So also what you see upcoming in lung will be the results of the Becta study, second line treatment Avastin plus Tarceva. Some of you who attend ASCO will remember those very encouraging Phase II data here. This is the Phase III study running, and if the event rate happens as maybe predicted we should have those results this year.</p>
          <p>If we just look for a moment, at what does this mean on the labeling &#x2013; so right now you've heard us announce that Avastin is approved in Europe for the expansion of the label in colorectal cancer and for Xeloda. That has been recommended for approval and we expect any day now to be able to share with you the final approval. So what does it do to us? It actually takes us from a market where historically we were not able to go into the oxaliplatin; we were only in a Erina-Tcam 5-FU sector, so about one-third of the market into the full market. And for Xeloda 14% to be able to be used with oxaliplatin regimen plus Avastin also opens up some significant opportunities for both medicines.</p>
          <p>If you were to look at what we achieved for our non-small cell lung cancer, then you can see that we are entering two-thirds of the market on a platinum-based regimen. The other one-third are on a variety of monotherapies. And for breast cancer, what we have is a very good label, the EU label with paclitaxel, and what we're working on is broadening that target label up to 80% of the <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>And the news flow clearly here in the Unites States, the attention still focuses on the outcome of the FDA action date, February 23rd. There's still, I think, a lot of room for optimism here. There's nothing particularly changed in recent weeks. We continue through Genentech to interact with the FDA and that's where we are. I think it's still a very exciting opportunity, and as Ian would have shared with you, about 29% of ladies with breast cancer already get access to this through the compendia listings.</p>
          <p>The other work that's coming through imminently, we should be having hopefully in the coming weeks the AVADO results. As many of you will remember, this is looking at the two-dosage regimens for the product in breast cancer, and we expect to be able to share that with you in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>The RIBBON data, which is looking at various chemotherapeutic regimens, plus and minus Avastin is expected in the second half and that helps us to broaden the label. And then we've got the adjuvant trials running.</p>
          <p>So in terms of news flow, what can we share with you that should be coming up during the course of the year? AVADO and RIBBON, as I've mentioned, the start and the recruitment moving up a gear on Herceptin plus pertuzumab. We work with Genentech on the DM1-Herceptin armed antibody. So within the HER family, I believe that we are profiling mixed-generation work, beyond a Herceptin-alone intervention with HER2-positive. The adjuvant trials starting, and then in metastatic colorectal cancer, the launch and roll-out of this enhanced label in Europe, and when we conclude with the FDA on Xeloda, then we would hope to broaden the launch platform here in the United States.</p>
          <p>The other element that has happened early (it's about a year early) is the feedback from the study on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is an 800-patient study orchestrated by the German collaborative group in 11 countries. And this met its endpoint a year early. So this will now be added to our submissions chart for this year. Clearly around the world, a number of patients are already benefiting from MabThera/Rituxan in CLL. But it is important, if anything also from our own competitive point of view, to get this well-characterized on the label.</p>
          <p>Turning to inflammation/autoimmune disease, transplantation, as many of you know, clearly CellCept is our key product at the moment here; 10% growth in the last year. So it continues its successful &#x2013; pivotal role really, in the handling of transplants. What we've seen is an 11% growth in the franchise and MabThera. In the patients who cannot tolerate or felt not suitable or have had previous exposure to anti-TNF (so a rather discrete segment of the market) we have already clocked up 0.5 billion sales in the U.S. and Europe. What we will have in the course of this year is MabThera data on the earlier signs and symptoms. And you probably read in our news flow the SERENE study (this is the first of those studies) has had a positive readout. So we'll continue to analyze that and communicate with you as the other studies in the series come through. Actemra, as I mentioned at the beginning, filed and we should have an action date in the fourth quarter of this year, which would lead to an immediate launch here in the United States. Good news from Japan in the last couple of days that the government in one of their regular committees have reviewed this, and it moves to the next step towards licensure, which should hopefully occur around April of this year.</p>
          <p>For other indications (and rheumatoid arthritis is clearly not the only one in this sector), we've had a good year also in data flow. Very encouraging results on Rituxan/MabThera in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Now clearly this was a Phase II study. This is not a comparative head-to-head study. But we take encouragement from the fact that the strength of the signal is somewhere between what we've typically seen with a beta interferon and Tasobry. So we're clearly in the frame in terms of having a signal as measured by the myeloid elements in the brain. And on that basis, we will move ocrelizumab, the fully humanized second-generation product, into a late-stage Phase II just on the dose finding, and then we'll move into Phase III. With ocrelizumab we've &#x2013; sorry we've moved that. We also moved into lupus in Phase III.</p>
          <p>So how are we shaping up our own approach to the CD20 franchise? Clearly the viewpoint that Roche-Genentech are taking here with Biogen is that we'll move ocrelizumab more towards the rheumatoid arthritis/autoimmune diseases. A role of the fully humanized version is clearly seen as an advantage by the treatment physicians. The fact that there's an enhancement and less possibility for immunogenicity is the benefit that that confers. We're looking for dimensions of tolerability, shorter infusion times, and other ways that we can make sufficient incremental improvements in this. But it really is different to be the first line that we've had with MabThera/Rituxan.</p>
          <p>In the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma arena we have a very interesting molecule that we as Roche acquired when we bought GlycArt a couple of years ago. This was a group of bright young souls out of California and other parts of the world that ended up following their teacher to the ETH in Z&#xFC;rich and then became a spin-off company.</p>
          <p>And their very sort of clever approach in enhancing and turbo-boosting the efficacy of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicities of the molecule with reduced complement dependent cell toxicities. The hypothesis here is a greater degree of affinity and of action at the cancers with more apoptosis of the cancer cells leading to an improved efficacy and less infusion reaction. Now that's the hypothesis. We are in Phase I in patients, and this has got a high hurdle to jump. We don't compromise on our clinical differentiation of molecules into clearly clinically differentiated medicines, and so this has a high hurdle to jump. It'd be a good successor product to Rituxan/MabThera.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean for 2008 in news flow? The earlier signs and symptoms in DMARD patients with MabThera, Actemra's regulatory pathway, the wild card that we have that we'll read out in the first half of the year, we trust, is in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. This is one third of the patients with multiple sclerosis and they just have a different form of the disease. There's virtually nothing to treat it, and therefore this is a Phase II/III study that if the signal is strong enough, we believe that the authorities will be ready to approve it for that miserable disease. For lupus, we should be hearing of the Phase II/III data from MabThera and SLE, again during the first half.</p>
          <p>Turning then from that biology area to virology, as Franz has mentioned, Tamiflu, we had a strong year; 1.9 billion of government orders that we felt we achieved in this year. But as we look into 2008, the orders that we have and the line-of-sight on orders that we have, we have to guide you that it's between 100 and 150 million Swiss francs worth of orders for next year. That is a reduction on this year of about 1.7 billion. So that has to be accommodated into our guidance. This has been something we've shared with the investment community for a number of years, but this would be on a phased approach and clearly, the planet is not yet ready. There is still a lot of work to be done. Even here in the United States, the original target of getting to 81 million courses has not been completed, but we're ready to work with governments, we're ready to work with the states of the union on this, but we just don't see the finances in place that are resulting in the tentative orders; that's still work in progress.</p>
          <p>For Pegasys, a year of enhanced market share in the United States and in Europe. We clearly &#x2013; if we take the international arena, we're at two-thirds of the market. If we include Japan, where we only had the opportunity with Copegus to launch the combination last year, we're still sitting at 57%.</p>
          <p>So the market leader; that's how we intend to keep going. What's interesting is that with a number of new interventions being talked about, here in clinical trials and in Europe, we do not see an unlocking of new patients with, to the same degree as we've had in the past. The market, at best, is flat if not slightly drifting downwards. Where we've had the cash growth &#x2013; has been outside of Europe and the United States. Significant orders from the emerging markets in Russia and Latin America and in some parts of the Far East, including China. So that's where we tend to be seeing the cash growth at the moment. And those are the principal interventions, you can see the other products all continuing to grow.</p>
          <p>Really for your reference, just to help in the modeling, this is how we would characterize the last number of quarters on the pandemic and the seasonal sales. To help you say that on top of the pandemic, there are remarkably modest seasonal sales that we can predict. Despite enormous efforts by the entire organization in multiple countries, capture the hearts and minds of the prescribing physicians, that genuinely each winter they should do more for patients with influenza, that's proven extraordinarily difficult. We've made some patchy progress but still difficult. So it's not something that we again can be over enthusiastic on forecasting for you.</p>
          <p>Within our emerging pipeline and this is a pipeline that's at an earlier stage to the assets we've talked about before, you see here a polymerase from Roche, a polymerase from our partners at Pharmasset and a protease inhibitor from our partners at InterMune.</p>
          <p>Now clearly what is it that people are looking for in Hepatitis C? Hepatitis, now that we've got the genotyping, genotypes 2 to 4, we're done to a remarkably small number of weeks, I think we now at about 16 weeks therapy for those patients to get to a viral clearance for the people that do respond. They would like something that increase the response rates a little bit more and maybe could shorten the therapy more.</p>
          <p>The crying real clinical need is in genotype 1 which is still about 70% of the market here in the United States and in the other developed countries. And here it's an improved efficacy and ultimately if we could get to a shorter treatment duration that might encourage more people to come into the treatment pool.</p>
          <p>So if with this in mind that we are working with our partners, we've got very good signals in this early work of efficacy. So we now just need to work on this, profile it, we're looking at the combination with ribavirin and with Pegasys, and we'll take the right steps with all of these assets to move forward because we do believe that there is a bright future here and there's no picking and choosing, we are working on these assets and also we know some competitors, who out there, want Pegasys as part of their baseline of therapy, since it is the brand leader.</p>
          <p>If we turn to metabolism and bone, clearly Boniva here in the United States has had a very strong performance exiting the year at about 15% market share in prescriptions. In France and in Italy and Spain, we've seen some very good take-offs in the European arena. In some of our markets less attractive because we have been launching after the availability of generic Fosamax so I think it has been important to get established before that product does go generic and to our team here in the United States, full marks for an impeccable rollout of this product.</p>
          <p>For Xenical, obviously we are coming towards patent expiry in some places, but the more interesting life cycle management is on the OTC availability of this product. Launched last year in the United States through our partner GSK, we do have a royalty flow from that and we do have a supply agreement with them and milestone payments. So that's working well and we are working with them to achieve the same registration in Europe.</p>
          <p>It would be more significant for all of us what's round the corner, what are we shaping up? As many of you have followed, we have not lost the faith in CETP inhibition as the next frontier in cardiovascular risk reduction. We know that every 1% reduction in LDL has a reduction of cardiovascular risk by a similar 1% and there is a clear hypothesis that by increasing HDL you achieve the same improvement for the patients there. Clearly torcetrapib made us a pause, made us think very mindfully. We have spent the best part of the last year looking at all the data, our own and others, of profiling that molecule, is it a class problem, it is a unique molecule problem? I am very happy to share that we all believe that the torcetrapib issue was a fundamental flaw in that molecule alone and that it had some interference with the aldosterone system which resulted in the cardiovascular issues that we've seen.</p>
          <p>What we can say about our own molecule, which we've partnered from Japan Tobacco, is that it is well tolerated, it does not have a profile that would lead to a cardiovascular risk and believe me we have tested this strongly, not only from our own Phase II data, but also by looking very, very thoughtfully over the torcetrapib data and indeed generating data in our own laboratories.</p>
          <p>We have also seen a very useful level of HDL raising. We've networked with the Food and Drug Administration, with the key markets in Europe from a regulatory point of view, with all the key opinion leaders, and we have come to an informed decision that we will move into Phase III with this molecule, given that it's different in its chemical structure, its binding sites and so forth. So we start on a mortality morbidity outcome study. There is no shortcut to this given the torcetrapib history, given the interactions with the FDA and others, and we will be recruiting 15,000 patients starting in the second quarter of this year, which will lead to a 2011-12 submission.</p>
          <p>Very important significant invest, so we have also built into the study design the appropriate governance for both safety, utility analysis, and made sure that the statistics and the power in the study take this into account. We've also set our sights on the three key hard end points that one can have from a regulatory point of view in this so that we can run the study very successfully around the world. Of the 15,000 you should expect approximately one-third here in North America. So we'll handle that as prudently as ever.</p>
          <p>This GLP-1 is an entirely synthetically-developed peptide. It has a very interesting delivery system that allows us, from what we've seen from our first Phase II study, for a once-weekly administration, with a very neat solution that allows for a very fine needle size delivery. Also this is allowing us for a much more enhanced delivery system to be used, an auto-injector. And therefore the target here is to be best in class.</p>
          <p>We have more Phase II data to come in the first half of the year using higher dosages. We were looking, could we extend it beyond a week, but what we need to find is that balancing act between the duration of action and the efficacy on blood glucose, and not triggering some of the side effects of nausea and vomiting that have been seen with the GLP-1 class. So you should expect us to be looking at that data to find the sweet spot of the dosage that we take forward into the Phase III trials. Those Phase III trials are fully budgeted for the year and therefore they are part of the guidance that we share with you.</p>
          <p>So what do we see for the year in the news flow? That move into Phase III of CETP, the announcement towards the middle of the year on the Phase III start for GLP-1. We'll be publishing the first Phase II study during the year, and also in the background, there's a couple of Phase II studies running which, if they jump high hurdles, would be candidates to move forward to Phase III.</p>
          <p>The first is a DPP-4. We know this has been a troublesome class. We know of the success of Januvia, we know of the troublesome passage for Galvus. Our sights are set on a product that has to have all the qualities that you would expect from a DPP-4, plus significant weight reduction. So it is a high hurdle; I have no idea if it'll jump that hurdle, but that's where we are. And it's just to give you an example of the discipline we try to give ourselves on the degree of clinical differentiation that is required in today's world.</p>
          <p>We have a PPAR alpha, gamma, also another difficult regulatory pathway; multiple positive signals that we're getting from some of the early work here. And I'll be intrigued to see just how strong are those signals when we study the full Phase II.</p>
          <p>So if we try and summarize then for pipeline, outlook and what are the catalysts, clearly as regularly we share with you the movements that we have here on our filings, and this is in the Roche territory. So MabThera, Avastin, and a couple of indications, pancreatic probably the wilder card in that grouping. Also, intriguingly Tarceva plus Avastin, that Phase III study which I think keeps us ahead of the curve, the first targeted approach in lung cancer.</p>
          <p>Also just the richness and the depth of the Phase III commitments that we've embarked on, all those adjuvant studies for Avastin are large patient numbers. Pertuzumab Phase III, possibly worked like multiple sclerosis with a high cost for patients with MRI studies. These are the reasons that lie behind our signaling to you of our, again another year of growth in research and development expenditure that will be in excess of our sales growth.</p>
          <p>It's a privileged position to be in to have a portfolio of development projects and it's really development that's the driver here, that takes us forward to a bright tomorrow hopefully. We know that not everything in the world makes it, but that richness and depth and I hope the intelligence with which my colleagues are scoping and setting the hurdles and the statistical validity of what we do, will lead to the fuel for growth in the years to come. And that can be best summarized by just looking at the time lines in a broad schematic of how this can play out in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Specifically for the year ahead, again the scorecard with which to track us as the year goes on and to reconfirm the guidance that we plan to be well above market. For markets, in my mind, we're probably looking at somewhere between 4 to 5% for the world Pharma market next year. And that's not because everyone's losing faith, that's nothing to do with the fact that America is going into an election year or whatever. But more to do with the decline of a number of products that are going to go off patent. There's a huge number of big molecules that will face patent expiry. Our contention is that, that is some of the oxygen in the systems to help some of the products that we're bringing forward be financed, before governments need new money.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand over to Severin to take you into the Diagnostics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, Diagnostics had a very special year. On the one hand, we could consolidate our market position with a number of new products, but probably even more important we had a series of important transactions, licensing agreements, and acquisitions, and I will come back to this in a moment.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the sales development, overall 6% growth in local currencies, very much driven by the good growth in Professional Diagnostics Avastin market with 8%, as a result of the good development in the biggest segment immunochemistry.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care has picked up and is now growing 5% for the full year. Molecular Diagnostics down with 2%, entirely due to the loss in the industrial business as a result of the expiry of the foundation of PCR patent.</p>
          <p>Applied Science doing very well with 11% growth driven by the sequencing business. You can see that the growth over the last three has accelerated and we expected momentum to continue as we go forward into 2008. We are the clear; number one player in the in-vitro diagnostics markets; in a market, however, which has seen dramatic changes over the last two years. An unprecedented number of deals, new players such as Siemens now taking the number two position.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the P&amp;L, you can see that we increased our operating margins to 17.6%, but if we then look into the individual line items they are distorted by a number of one-off effects. Cost of sales and R&amp;D are only flat because we had impairment charges in 2006. And on the other hand, if you look into the G&amp;A line, we had a number of one-off items such as legal costs and restructuring provisions.</p>
          <p>We now turn more specifically into the performance of the business areas; Professional Diagnostics, driven by immunochemistry, driven by the strong placements we had and to pickup of new novel markers such as NT-proBNP.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care has picked up to 5% local currency growth and that is really the result of the new products such as Accu-Chek Aviva, Performa, Compact Plus offsetting the erosion of our former flagship the Accu-Chek Advantage.</p>
          <p>We move on to Molecular Diagnostics, you can see a solid growth for the virology business. That is primarily driven by our real-time platform CAP/CTM for the mid-throughput segment, which we launched very successfully already in the European markets and which we are now holding out in the. U.S. Blood screening is flat, very competitive in price sensitive markets; and again, you can see the decline of the industrial business as a consequence of the expiry of the PCR patents.</p>
          <p>Now in 2007, we made <mark type="inaudible" />, a big step forward in completing our portfolio of technologies. On the research side, with 454 Life Sciences, with NimbleGen and also with BioVeris, we are now the most comprehensive provider of genomic solutions and we have also entered immunochemistry for the research in clinical trials market. And we signed last week, the merger agreement with Ventana, which gives us access into the tissue-based diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Now, shortly again, to recap Ventana, it is the leader, the worldwide leader in tissue-based testing. It has about a turnover of 300 million U.S. dollars, a thousand people headquarter in the U.S. in Tucson, Arizona.</p>
          <p>The tender offer over $89.50 will expire on the 7th of February and with that, we expect the closing in the second quarter of this year. Now this is certainly a very attractive offer for the shareholders of Ventana, but it does reflect the strategic value of this business for the Roche Group and it also reflects the value, which we put to a friendly transaction, which allows us now with the full commitment of the management, to accelerate the integration.</p>
          <p>The CEO will continue to lead the business out of Ventana as a separate, dedicated business unit within Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>The synergies, which we expect, are on the one hand, within Diagnostics. With our know-how and capabilities, in particular, in the detection of protein markers and nucleic acid markers, we should be able to provide even better solutions for our customer, the pathologist. Equally important is that the combined operations can provide a better support to the Pharma Divisions by providing necessary tools and technologies to help the targeted medicines in a better way, in particular, in the important field of oncology.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to stress now is that with the number of transactions which we did last year and with Ventana underway, this is not just a random series of acquisitions to be part of the overall consolidation process, which we see currently ongoing in the diagnostics industry. These are very, very targeted acquisitions aligned to our overall strategy, and the strategy, like it is the case in Pharma, also in Diagnostics, it's very much about the medical value which we provide for many diseases. Also in Diagnostics, we do not have proper tests or no test at all. And the enabler of this strategy is certainly the progress in science, the enormous progress we see, in particular, in molecular biology, and that builds on the strength, which we have already in the Roche Group.</p>
          <p>We are the leader in genomics and the life science area. We are the leader in Molecular Diagnostics. We are leading in immunochemistry, we have cutting-edge facilities in proteomics and we are on the Pharma side, the biggest biotech company in the world, and those acquisitions, like NimbleGen, 454, they build exactly on those strengths.</p>
          <p>Now, we have a comprehensive portfolio in genomics, we have a complete portfolio in immunochemistry. And with Ventana, we will be able to strengthen the links between Diagnostics and Pharma.</p>
          <p>As we go forward into 2008, I'm very confident that again, we can outgrow the market. Thank you very much, and with this, I hand over to Erich.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Severin. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Through '07, bringing together an excellent operating performance and quite a good finance performance in a challenging environment has really built a record year for Roche. But through '07, maybe also looking into the future was an important year listening to you. I relished, did so many road shows and on those, not only trying to sell Roche, but also trying to understand what you expects from Roche.</p>
          <p>One outcome is definitely that we have further improved our transparency of financial reporting and I can only encourage you to really dig into the financials. And my team just had a review and they said "nobody has come up with one single wrong figure," so maybe I can raise your ambition that you still can prove that they are not 100% perfect in the front row, otherwise, there is always this risk that they could become complacent, but I don't think so.</p>
          <p>The other element is that we tried to listen to our U.S. investors and we have upgraded our ADR platform in the United States.</p>
          <p>If we look at these figures, a lot has been commended. This morning it happened that these figures ended up next to the figures of Google, and you would allow me to say I suddenly started to dream because, yes, Google is a 21st Century company, yes, Google has a certain market cap, but where is the beef? I mean you see the absolute power Roche is putting on the road with these figures, and now you understand our ambition to convince all of you that Roche as a group is not just a sort of Pharma company, but this is a high-tech healthcare company which really is unique in its kind and is very much in the 21st Century. But, away from dreaming to reality as Bill has pointed out, Pharma has now increased the operational margin over the last five years, step by step. And Diagnostics, in a very difficult environment, is still with the EBITDA margins point; not 10% higher but 10 percentage points higher than the average of its peers.</p>
          <p>So I think, we have understood several years ago that this is the 21st Century where only if you improve yourself in all elements, constantly, of your value chain, that you can be a leader and, in the end, a winner. And I think the detailed figures show you that we're never pleased with what we have achieved, but the ambition is to go into the right direction. And if you look at these figures, I think they start to resemble the high-tech healthcare company Roche wants to be. With a clear commitment to high-tech production, but lean production sites around the world, a very efficient network which can be more or less virtually upgraded but which is not based on huge physical spaces.</p>
          <p>And I also think what Bill has achieved with his team to go from more or less 10 million dosages of Tamiflu up to 400 million, and now having to go back to reasonable ambitious seasonal flu sales, and me not standing here and saying now the bad side of the good story in the last few years is that we have to tell you an impairment. I think this shows you that we are proactively looking into the future in a manner to actually think the scenario through and to escape just the common thinking of &#x2013; oh, business is going well, you can increase your fixed cost. That's the cost of sales line and as you also can see the M&amp;D line, very, very efficient. I mean, we have as Bill has pointed out we have sold some tail products in the Pharma portfolio because smaller companies can much better focus on these small tail products but at the same time, we have immediately reacted and we have laid off several hundred people in the sales and marketing arena. So I just want to point out, these figures do not come automatically just out of the product mix. These figures are also a result of very efficient measures to constantly improve our cost base.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, the heart of anything which goes into the future and even there we are looking that efficiency is they actually increased and if we come to G&amp;A, I have on the next chart a detailed analogy so that you don't have to be afraid that we are getting complacent and that we are spending actually on administration. So you have the effect, therefore with the 146 million, the highest point was actually restructuring expenses connected to the layoff of sales force people in Europe and also in the United States and there were some legal provisions here.</p>
          <p>If we come to the financial field, I must confess by waking up at 3 o'clock in New York, you have time to read newspapers. So I think if I can report that on over 20 billion of Swiss francs actually managed by the Roche finance team, that all together on a prudent way, we had to impair anything originating in the subprime arena by a total of 68 million Swiss francs and of these 68 actually 8 million are really gone and the rest is a prudent probation taking. So I hope that this gives you a signal that we try to stick to two things. I was standing here four or five years ago that &#x2013; promising that we have reduced the risk taking in actually managing our financial assets and on the other hand, we always said, the only risks which a high-tech healthcare company should take are in innovation. So the liquid funds, even with the financial crisis being out there, they're still here. They are not melted away by any effects. And what you also can see we have constantly de-layered our debt situation. There will another 2 billion of debt be going this year so that we actually have a very strong position.</p>
          <p>Good news, actually. Our tax rate of course with our unique hub-and-spoke model with Genentech being a proud U.S. company and paying proud U.S. taxes, and Chugai being a Japanese company and paying Japanese taxes, I can probably report that there are places in the world where you can achieve a little bit lower tax rate. And for a Swiss company, we now have achieved the status in the range of 15 to 16%, which has driven down the group tax rate quite considerably.</p>
          <p>EPS, nice development, totally in line with our guidance. Equity, I mean, such a strong net income helps to strengthen the equity base and with this of course the balance sheet. And I know you have seen our Chairman and CEO taking the blame; I take the blame. I know that this balance sheet is solid. Some of you may think it's too solid, not leveraged enough. But I think in today's world it's not bad to have a strong balance sheet. And you can be assured we are not following up. I had about ten e-mails directly to myself why we wouldn't bail out certain financial institutions in Switzerland. And I can warn you (and I think these rumors even found its way into newspapers), I'm coming back. This is a high-tech healthcare company investing in innovation. And at the moment, we will even in the breakout sessions take maybe another blame that this balance sheet is too strong, but we can live with it at the moment.</p>
          <p>Net cash has increased, but not so much as in the past years, because we did act. You have heard all these small acquisitions, our corporations in Pharma and Diagnostics, the Tanox closing of Genentech. We have actually spent quite some cash on acquisitions and broadening our innovation base. But you as shareholders also participate. I think it fits into the overall picture that we have again for a second year a dramatic increase of our dividend payout, should actually the shareholders approve our proposals. But there is little risk that they won't. So with four-francs-sixty I can now also start to address on our road shows not only the growth investors but also the value investors.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to the guidance, which I think in the interests of time, I will not read down. Nothing has changed to what our Chairman has already spoken out. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as side effects are concerned cardiovascular, as I said in the presentation, is not a concern to us. And given that this is a product that will go into a primary care setting and with today's regulatory environment, we know we have to keep a very close look at any side effects. We need a good clean profile. Everything that we've seen through from the preclinical to the Phase II work is encouraging for us and that's why we go forward.</p>
          <p>On the gating of the expenditures and the reviews of the safety, these will not be communication points because there's no signal. It's not like tracking in an adjuvant setting whether the drugs have crossed the statistical line or not. Forgive us, but we'll run the study. I'm more showing that as a prudent way of managing the invest rather than as a data flow potentially in the coming months and years. So it will be a full run program through to a 2011, '12 submission point. And if there is something to be reported, obviously out of the interim analysis, positive or negative, and if it changes our decision point, we will of course communicate. But it's not our plan as we stand here to say that there's going to be a news flow every six months every time these guys meet.</p>

          <p>Okay, as I said, both audit committees of Genentech, because Genentech has an independent treasury, and Roche, they focused hours on exactly this issue. And the good news I can report is that the Roche Group all together had a hit of 8 million Swiss francs out of really losing out of this whole situation. And another 60 million were taken as provisions for potential impairment of our assets. So we have an extremely tough risk policy. So I tell you frankly, it may not sound very professional. I'd just say what you can't explain to a lay person in 10 minutes, we just don't do. And this has saved a lot of downside out, and I have to be careful here. But I have to tell you, 80% of all these fancy instruments which are offered, I do not see any value for the customer. I only see value for the banks, and that's why we are not doing it at Roche. So maybe it's quite a clear-cut risk environment, which may not generate top returns, but I'm quite pleased with what my team has achieved. And it is also definitely not that we have to stand in front of you in a happy year with much more because we have this process under control.</p>

Doubtless there'll be some in 2008 as well. But I think if you have a look at the analysis there, it will give you the detail you need.

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will first confess to not being an expert in pharmaceutical, so I apologize for my elementary question. But one of the observations that one of you made was that what is different about your strategy in investing in your business is you want to be and believe in being part of every value chain. And then that's sort of what differentiates what you would like to accomplish; hence your presence in diagnostics and other parts of the value chain. Could you elaborate on why you think this makes sense for you and why other pharmaceutical companies do not follow in that path?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why it makes sense for us, the combination of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic, is that we believe that medium-to-long-term there will be an increased interaction between those two as we approach gradually in certain therapy areas what is being called a personalized medicine or targeted medicines to patients and patient groups. That's the underlying belief that we have, and the technologies point in that direction.</p>
          <p>Other companies are increasingly talking about it, but they all lack essential pieces in order to implement that strategy. I mean, if you look at some of the analyst presentations that Siemens recently gave, they talk about personalized healthcare and personalized medicine. But what they lack is the pharmaceutical side, and what they lack is the medical know-how, the medical knowledge, and the content knowledge in the diagnostics area. So I can see at the moment the beginning of an imitation of the words without being able to deliver on those words. And we probably have a fairly large time advantage and know-how advantage compared to those competitors who are trying to get into that field.</p>
          <p>And let's not to forget many of our pharma competitors do not have a diagnostic company on their side. They then say, well, it's as easy to work with a third party. Believe me, it is not because the openness to interaction, the depth of interaction, the free exchange of information that is perhaps not yet patented but patentable is so big in-house that cannot be imitated with a third party out of house. Does that answer your question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If you take us over the years, we had the experience with HIV/AIDS, which told us that by using PCR and being able to detect then the quantitative PCR, being able to track using CD50, being able to get to surrogate markers that were clear predictors of clinical outcome was one experience line. Also in virology in the way that we handled Pegasys, we had a competitor that was ahead of us. We knew from our knowledge of that area that if we measured at three months rather than six months of treatment, we could outsmart the competitor because they would lose revenues. But we could do that because our knowledge of the sensitivity of the test allowed us the confidence to go forward and the trials to do it. Then the other area in cancer, nobody really has had the experience that we have with Herceptin of being able to use a diagnostic and take relatively mediocre Phase II results, the stunning overall survival data for 20, 25% of ladies with breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Now that's an encouragement that our company has, but fast-forward. About three years ago &#x2013; and this is maybe to your question about why Roche and what happens in the rest of the industry. We were involved in recruiting a Head of Research for our Palo Alto research site. And we got down to three finalists that I saw. Two out of the three when we had come through a discussion on this sort of subject about personalized healthcare, stratification, looking for subsets more likely to respond to an intervention, two out of those three research people from our competition could not &#x2013; they publicly admitted it. They said, I can't have this discussion in my company. They don't want to know. So there are elements where sometimes our experience line aggregates. And we happened to understand I think this earlier, which led then with the growth of our diagnostic business <mark type="audio gap" /> take a holistic view. Genomics, genetics, proteomics will all play out in a way that probably will get better diagnosis as first, better use of today's medicines second, better design of tomorrow's medicines third. And in areas where we haven't even got it, out of clinical trials responder/non-responder, that maybe can create a hypothesis to go back around the loop again. And you just need the intellectual power and the preparedness to look at that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From a consumer point of view, is one of the barriers to more widespread use of some of your drugs (and Avastin is probably a good example) is the side effects tolerability? You talked about in passing, but I wonder if you feel that as part of your marketing effort, you could and should do more to teach physicians how to minimize or offset the side effects, and that would pay off in greater willingness by patients to use these products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't agree more. And that's part of the rollout of any of our medicines. I think there's some aspects in our industry where people and many salesmen, it's within their gene pool almost to talk about the good news and try and minimize discussion on the side effects. When you are in many of our areas of medicine and more specialized areas, it's absolutely in our interest to talk and to have people handle the side effects. On the experience line of this, most of my colleagues in the company, in managing over about 20 years Accutane and the treatment of acne, saw continuing steady growth of that brand over many years. And we almost discussed nothing else but the side effects and how to manage it, and how to manage the patient recruitment. So that's again part of the gene learnings within the company &#x2013; that there's no downside to squaring up to this is the good news, this is the bad news, this is how to handle it, and this is how to minimize the comfort for the patient.</p>

          <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what is helping us here, especially in the field of oncology, is working with patient organizations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so. And actually we have a patient charter because again there's been criticism of the pharmaceutical industry dealing with the patient organizations. So this is one sort of part of marketing, and all we're interested in is just hustling on a given product. And our charter requires that it's a long-term relationship, it's win-win, and it's not product-specific. And out of that, we also have regularly councils. In Europe recently we had people from men's health, women's health, the cancer world, the Alzheimer's world, people against viruses, HIV/AIDS, and what have you, and even encouraging those patient organizations, learn from each other, and swap notes. And it also enhances how we can interact on behalf of the patient.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A year ago everybody was talking about the pricing of some of your cancer drugs and the concerns about it. This is some in-depth <mark type="inaudible" />, at least in the press. Maybe can you give us an update on how you see this developing and what has happened in the last 12 months and what might happen going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally on pricing, clearly almost all the developed world has balancing acts to do with its healthcare budgets, and that's broader than the pharmaceutical or the hospital care system or whatever. And clearly, in many countries you will still see people exerting a downward pressure where they can on pricing. Sometimes governments will announce this is the fixed budget for next year. Sometimes they will announce, as Japan has done very skillfully now over 10 years, of trying to take discounts out of the system. The net result for Roche in the last 12 months, we've seen here in the United States the totality of our business grow at no more than CPI, at about 3%. And some offsets in Europe, usually we lose about 2 percentage points of growth in Europe. We still have modest opportunities on pricing in Latin America and some other places, but the net result for the pharmaceutical division this last year was neutral. So really I think we've come through in a remarkably strong way this last year, despite all these ups and downs and flourishes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's also one of the reasons why it is so important that we continue to implement and look for efficiency throughout the organization, from administration over to marketing and all the rest. And those programs very often are long-term programs. If you talk about concentrating or streamlining some of your production in our business, you can't just relocate production of one product from one factory to another. You need to get approval from the authorities in all the countries where the product is marketed, and very often you need to repeat all your price approvals. So those are long processes and procedures before you can get to those efficiencies. And that's a program that Bill initiated some four years ago. We started two-and-a-half years ago with concentrating all our back office in Europe in one location and that's just going live at the moment where we do that out of Budapest. We concentrated all our infrastructure in Latin America in Sao Paulo, and those are the efficiency programs ,which go on behind the scenes, which compensate for those price pressures.</p>
