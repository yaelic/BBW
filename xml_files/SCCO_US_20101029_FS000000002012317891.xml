      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Andrea. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Participating in today's conference call is Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO. On today's conference, we will begin with an updated view on the metal markets, we will then talk about Southern Copper's most relevant results in production, sales, operating costs, financial results, capital spending program, and finally about Americas Mining Corporation proposed transaction development. After that, we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>Focusing on the market and the prices for our main products, during the third quarter of 2010, we have seen a significant recovery in the prices of our products. We believe the drivers for these higher prices are twofold. A stronger physical consumption from the emerging economy and the possibility of a second consecutive EC from the U.S. Federal Reserve.</p>
          <p>Focusing on copper, on the demand side, what we see that the red metal physical consumption has maintained its activity in the third quarter of 2010. According to CRU, for the first nine months of 2010, worldwide demand grew by about 10%, being led by Asian economy, which today holds 64% of the world's demand.</p>
          <p>As you know, the most important of this economy is China, representing today 38% of the world total demand. In our view, demand in these countries will remain robust for the rest of 2010 and 2011 due to its strong GDP growth. We believe that Chinese economic authorities are committed to prudent monetary on fiscal policies to console inflation without sacrificing significantly growth.</p>
          <p>For the U.S. and Europe, we're also getting positive news that reflect that certainly at a slower rate major economy economies are moving away from a recessionary environment. On the supply side, current production growth is not catching up with the demand performance. A clear sign of this is the continuing reduction in the combined copper inventories at the London Metal Exchange, COMEX and Shanghai warehouses. At their latest peak, in February of this year, the sum of their combined inventories was 815,000 tons. As of yesterday, they were approximately 543,000 tons, a 33% reduction in seven months. We believe that these significant inventory reductions will support copper prices during the fourth quarter and in 2011, when we expect our market index.</p>
          <p>For molybdenum, as you know, it's Southern Copper's main byproduct. In the third quarter, this metal represented 12% of the company's sales. We're currently seeing a soft recovery in the molybdenum consumption. For the rest of the year, this quarter, we're expecting a relatively balanced market for this metal.</p>
          <p>Silver represented 7% of our sales in the third quarter of 2010. We think that silver prices will continue to have strong support in 2010 due to its use as a value shelter for inflation concerns. Zinc represented 3% of our sales in the past quarter. We believe this metal has very good long-term fundamentals due to a significant industrial consumption. However, inventories are currently at relatively high level, which have affected zinc's price.</p>
          <p>Copper production, the company's copper mine production in the first quarter of this year increased by 4.1% to 125,183 tons compared to the 120,000 tons to 140 tons in the third quarter of 2009. This increase was mainly the result of 4,985 tons of SX-EW copper production at our Cananea mine, which is currently operating at 30% of capacity. Toquepala mine production also increased to 35,300 tons compared to 31,900 tons in the third quarter of 2009 due to higher ore grade and recoveries.</p>
          <p>Copper mined production in the third quarter of this year also increased by 10%, compared to the prior quarter that is the second quarter of 2010, because of higher production in all of our operations due to higher ore grade recoveries and the mentioned SXEW copper production at our Cananea mine. And now that we're speaking about Cananea, as we have previously reported to the market, after the termination of the labor relations with the national mining union by the Mexican Supreme Court decision, the company has aggressively initiated the reconstruction and ramping-up of Cananea. We expect to reach full production capacity by February of 2011.</p>
          <p>Currently, we have hired 4,200 contractors and workers for a major construction and ramping-up of the mining and metallurgical operations. The construction of a new leaching plant that will be the third plant that this facility will have and its Quebalix facility and the development of social, educational and recreational infrastructure that will benefit the communities close to these operations.</p>
          <p>At this point, we're maintaining the estimated cost of the repairs of this mining unit at approximately 114 million and returning portion of the total expenditures should be recovered by insurance. The company will continue with the social, educational and corporate programs that we usually conduct in all its mining operations in conjunction with the local community. These programs were put on hold at Cananea due to union labor disputes.</p>
          <p>Regarding our metallurgical facility, we had 13% decrease in anodes production in Ilo due to a major maintenance of the smelter performed this past August. This kind of needed maintenance is scheduled every 2 years and affects approximately one month of copper smelting. The Ilo smelter maintenance affected refined production at this facility reducing it by 24%. Production at the La Caridad metallurgical complex was 41% lower than the third quarter of 2009, as operations were disrupted in the third quarter of 2010 due to blockages, productive roles and other interferences caused by a group of terminated employees and outside agitators.</p>
          <p>However, by mid-October, Mexican authority established order by securing access roads to the complex. Activities at our Mexican metallurgical operations are currently normal with full assistance of our workforce. As a result of the mentioned reasons we had a reduction also in refined copper production of 30% in La Caridad. I'd like to point out that La Caridad mine operations were not affected whatsoever by this event.</p>
          <p>At this point, we're maintaining our copper production guidance for 2010 of 500,000 tons, including in this estimate 20,000 tons from Cananea.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum, as you know, our main by-product, had a record production in the second quarter of 2010. But for the third quarter, we reached a production of 5,000 tons, 3.5% lower than the production of last year's, the same quarter. The lower molybdenum production was a result of lower production at the Cuajone mine in Peru due to lower ore grade and recovery, partially offset by higher production at the Toquepala unit also improved. The La Caridad operations maintained its production level during the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the 9 months of 2010, molybdenum production increased by 12% percent to 15,300 tons from the 13,600 tons that we had for the 9 months of 2009. We are currently maintaining our molybdenum sales guidance of 20,000 tons for the year 2010.</p>
          <p>Zinc refined production increased by 1% year-over-year. Zinc mine production in the third quarter decreased by 12% to 24,500 tons compared to the 27,800 tons in the third quarter of 2009, this was mainly the result of lower production at the Santa Eulalia mine because of unusually heavy rain that caused flooding in the area and hindered production. The company is working to correct this problem and expects to restore production by April of 2011. Santa Eulalia represents approximately 14% of the annual zinc production of Southern Copper. We are currently estimating zinc sales of 95,000 tons for the year 2010.</p>
          <p>Silver refined production increased by 6% in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2009, mainly due to higher silver content in third-party material processed at our Ilo facilities. We're estimating 16 million ounces of silver sales for 2010.</p>
          <p>Focusing on Southern Copper financial performance, third quarter 2010 sales were 1.3 billion, 9.2 higher than the 1.2 billion that we had in the same quarter of 2009. Nine months 2010 sales were 3.7 billion, 41% higher than the 2.6 billion that we had in the 9 months of 2009. These increases were mainly the result of higher metal prices, as well as higher molybdenum sales volumes for the 9 months. When compared to third quarter sales volume &#x2013; when compared to the third quarter 2010 sales volume for copper, it decreased by 5%. In the case of molybdenum, the volume decreased by 3%, for silver 9%, and for zinc, 22%.</p>
          <p>Copper hedging. Even though we believe in a very strong market for the remaining of 2010 and 2011, we also think that copper prices have strongly reacted to 2 short-term events that created significant volatility. One is the high possibility of a second round of competitive easing by the Federal Reserve. And the second event is the recent news regarding copper ETF that may require <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Considering the strong volatility created by the mentioned events, Southern Copper has undertaken price protection actions to secure portion of our EBITDA at a reasonable group copper price. As a consequence, beginning on September 29, we have been contracting copper hedging swaps and zero cost collars.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2010, we have contracted swaps at a fixed price of 360 per pound for 58% of our production. For the year 2011, we have copper swaps for 11% of our production at an average price of 3.73 per pound. In addition, the company has hedged approximately 16% of 2011 copper production through zero cost collars with an average floor price of $3 per pound and an average cap price of $4.54 per pound.</p>
          <p>Operating costs. Our operating costs and expenses have increased only 2% or 12 million when comparing to the third quarter of 2009 with the same &#x2013; 2010 with same period of 2009. The main variances that explained this $12 million increase, our SKU and power costs have increased by $10 million. Labor cost 2 million, other operating materials 18 million, translation difference due to local exchange rate appreciation, 10 million, and lower third-party copper concentrated purchases, negative 33 million. Other operational cost variances explain the remaining differences.</p>
          <p>As a result of the mentioned sales and operating cost variances, EBITDA for the third quarter of this year was $676 million or 54% of sales. This figure was 14% higher than the $592 million of EBITDA for the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper operating cash costs, including the benefit of by-product sale was 28.7 cents per pound in the third quarter of 2010. This cash cost was $0.17 higher than the 11.5 cents per pound of cash cost for the third quarter of 2009. The $0.17 increase in cash costs was the result of lower by-product sale, mainly from molybdenum. The molybdenum credit decreased by $0.15 in the third quarter of 2010 when compared with the third quarter of 2009 due to lower price and volume reductions.</p>
          <p>The company third quarter 2010 operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-products credit was $1.45 per pound. This $1.45 is $0.13 lower than the operating cash cost of $1.56 that we have in the second quarter of 2010. So we have reduced our cash cost between the second and the third quarter by $0.13 before byproduct credits. The reduction in cash cost is mainly attributable to the higher production recorded in this quarter.</p>
          <p>As result of the better market prices and efficiency gains, net income attributable to Southern Copper shareholders in the third quarter was 365 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.43. This figure compares with net earnings for the third quarter of 2009 of 312 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.37, a 17% increase.</p>
          <p>As you recall, during the second quarter, we announced approval of the investment project in Mexico, totaling $3.8 billion that add to the already approved investments in Peru totaling 1.8 billion. When completed, these projects will increase our production capacity by 600,000 tons of copper and 5,600 tons of molybdenum, while maintaining Southern Copper's low-cost leadership.</p>
          <p>Capital and exploration expenditures in the third quarter were $121.8 million. The third quarter amounted to $26 million for the Tia Maria project, 15 million for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, 16 million for the Cuajone concentrator expansion, and $46 million for our Mexican operations. Capital and exploration expenditures in the 9 months were $309 million.</p>
          <p>The new SX-EW plant and the Quebalix projects both at Cananea has been restarted. The basic engineering for these SX-EW number III plant developed in 2006 is being reviewed by ICA-Fluor and is expected to be completed by December 2010. We expect to start the detailed engineering early in 2011, and when completed, we will begin the acquisition of major equipment and plant construction. The total budget for this projects is $180 million, of which we have spent 1.9 million as of September of this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Quebalix, and let me mention that Quebalix is a crushing, conveying and spreading system that makes much more efficient the production of the SXEW plants.</p>
          <p>The Quebalix plant has been almost completed in terms of the equipment acquisition and we will begin construction of the crusher building. We expect to invest in this Quebalix facility $56 million, of which we have spent already 35 million as of September of this year. In total, as of September, we have to spend $115 million on the Toquepala concentrator expansion. The use of high-pressure grinding rolls and wet screening at the tertiary crushing stage was defined. Engineering for the project is under review and the environmental impact assessment is expected to be presented by the end of the year 2010.</p>
          <p>The Cuajone project is also ongoing. As of September of this year, we have to spend a total of $39 million in this project. We purchased mine and ancillary equipment to support the work to optimize the Cuajone mining plant, and this is part of the Cuajone expansion plant. The project contemplates a variable cut-off methodology, which would increase the copper and molybdenum production by a total of 147,000 tons for copper and 3,000 tons for molybdenum in the next 10 years.</p>
          <p>Regarding Tia Maria, additional information for the project included &#x2013; including the use of sea water was submitted to the government. We expect the government's decision on the new actions required to obtain approval of the EIA, environmental impact assessment, shortly. Construction works are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2011 and copper production by mid-2012.</p>
          <p>The construction of the Tantahuatay gold project, a joint venture with Compania de Minas Buenaventura, has advanced and is expected to start ore gold production by June of 2011. The project is expected to have an average annual production of 90,000 ounces of gold and about 426,000 ounces of silver for 5 years. It will require a total investment of $110 million. Considering Southern Copper's 44.25% interest in the project, we will have to invest in it approximately $49 million.</p>
          <p>We already commented on Cananea work and the normalization of activities at the La Caridad metallurgical facilities.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, the company also reached a new 3 year collective bargaining agreement with the 3 major unions at our Peruvian operations. This agreement includes, among other things, a 5% annual salary increase in local currency and a signing bonus of approximately $6,700 for each of the 2,000 unionized workers. And in addition, the agreement has a process that encourage productivity savings and includes also no-strike clauses.</p>
          <p>Regarding the AMC's proposal to affect an all-stock business combination, on July 22, 2010, the company received a non-binding proposal from its parent company, Americas Mining Corporation, offering to affect an all-stock business combination of Southern Copper and AMC, the parent company of Asarco.</p>
          <p>As proposed, all stockholders of Southern Copper will receive 1.237 common shares of AMC in exchange for each share of SCC. As part of this process, the stock of AMC will be registered and listed on the New York, Mexico and the Lima Stock Exchanges. Once completed, SCC shares will be deleted from the exchange.</p>
          <p>On August 10 of this year, the company formed a special committee of independent directors to evaluate the AMC's proposal. The special committee has engaged independent legal and financial advisors to assist them in this transaction and help in the evaluation of this proposal. There is no specific deadline for this process.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review at each Board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources, expected cash flow generation from operations, and after this review, determining an appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as disclosed to the market on October 27, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.43 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 30, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2010.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us. And I'd like to open the phone for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. My question is regarding the new hedging strategy. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on what is your thought process there. Is this related to the increased CapEx <mark type="inaudible" /> -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to answer for your question, with us, we have Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz, who is the CFO of Grupo Mexico and he will explain or answer your concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Alex. We've been taking advantage of the high prices. Dollar has been depreciating dramatically. The reason was, as Raul just pointed out. We've seen prices keep on climbing although inventories keep on falling. And what we've done is try to ensure and take volatility out of the earnings for the next quarter and for a small percentage of the next production.</p>
          <p>Regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> and that's what we've been trying to promote although <mark type="inaudible" /> we thought that way we could really see a good profit margin for the rest of the quarter of this year and for a little bit of the production of next year. That's usually, as you know, in the past, what we've been doing also; 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, the company did not hedge anything of its copper production based on the economic crisis and circumstances. But this year, we thought it was advisable and a good opportunity to take with the products that we sell in the market. So we've been doing hedging in an opportunistic way and pretty much in consistency with what we've done in that past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Can I just have a follow-up, if it's okay? The copper price was very good in 2007 and early 2008 and the company didn't hedge then. And obviously you have a very good balance sheet, bottom of the cost curve, no worries about cash flow, really regardless of the copper price. So I guess what's changed between today and two years ago when there was also a similarly very good copper price, an opportunity to hedge at very high levels? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Alex, on the contrary, actually 2007 and 2008 we did hedge, and we did use the same strategy that we're using there now of opportunistically going to the market. Riding the peaks in the mean cycles quarter to quarter, and 2008 turned out to be a great hedge based on the economic crisis that we did and 2009 wasn't that bad either. So we've been doing that consistently.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Daniel. Sorry, I forgot about the hedges in '08. I guess I didn't have enough coffee this morning. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Just to follow-up on the hedging. So can you just comment how you're hedging for 2011, specifically if they are evenly distributed throughout the year or if they are concentrated in the first quarter? And also if you could comment, what should we expect from your hedging policy going further if we see copper prices hitting like $4 or $4.20 a pound, can we expect to see you being more active on your hedging? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe. First of all, we've done the whole calendar '11, 2011, that's the losses of the collar that we've taken as in some copper that's for the full-year. As you know, the third quarter has been a flat, as we could probably remember in the previous years that is not backward guided that in the previous peaks of the market, if you will, in 2007, beginning 2008. So we've done 2011 swaps and collars.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I mean, we think we've done what the Board had thought was advisable at this point given the secured prices. At this point, we're going to wait and see what the market does from now on. And as I was commenting, being opportunistic as a policy, we should wait and see how this evolves and have our risk assessment committees meet and we'll take it from there. At this point we feel that we've taken advantage of very high prices, almost historic high prices and that we've hedged the percentage that we were looking at.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel and Raul. Congratulations on the strong results. And if you can give us a little bit more color of how is the labor situation both in Cananea and Caridad. We read that the Caridad is getting back to normal. But is there still policemen around there? How long are they going to stay so? How is the spirit of the unions and things like that? And the second follow-up question would be, if you can give us some guidance in terms of volumes and cost for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's go ahead with the labor situation. Basically, Cananea, I think that after a peak in turmoil at the town site, local authorities reinforced security in the town of Cananea, that could help us quite significantly. We mentioned already that we have over 4,000 contractors and workers doing the repairs and working on the project that we have for the Cananea operation, as well as the infrastructure creation.</p>
          <p>I think that the activities are becoming much normal now than what has been the case in the last three years in Cananea. So in that sense, news are very positive and we're also very positive on the ramping-up of this operation as well.</p>
          <p>In the case of Caridad, as we pointed out a few minutes ago, we had a disruption of operations by blockage of road access mainly. Again, the authorities were very responsive to our request and cleared the problem very quickly. So right now, operations are normal. The smelter of Caridad is almost ready for re-initiate smelting, which is excellent, excuse me. And you had another question related to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just add to that, one minute Raul. Victoria, regarding Cananea, we're seeing an incredible new environment there in terms of the people, the different ways they converse, I mean, more alternatives have opened in the town, that they were open even before the strike. We've been investing in cultural and educational and social centers. And people are &#x2013; I mean there is a really transformational process going on there at Cananea, if you will.</p>
          <p>Regarding Caridad, I think, just I'd like to mention that regardless of the blockages, as you know we are a fully integrated copper producer. So we were able to sell the concentrate, and as you know, the concentrates now have important theme. So the company was not overtly affected by that. Raul, you wanted to talk about costs?

        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me tell you that we're currently reviewing our production plans for 2011. So I can't offer you more guidance of what we already mentioned and that's &#x2013; it's a number that may be adjusted due to the Cananea expectancy of production that we will know much more closer to year-end how much would that be in terms of its contribution. So I'm sorry about that, Victoria. But right now we are speaking to our guidance of 650,000 tons for next year, which is what we mentioned before.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you?. Hi, Raul. A couple of things. One, Caridad vehicle's being presented to the Anglo Board before the end of the year. I was just curious if there was any possibility for you still to be able to get into that deal? It looks like they're going for their own desalination operations in terms of addressing the water concerns. The operational logic of you being involved is obvious. Have you given up? Or do you think there is still a chance of participating?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Rene, we basically have no comments related to that. <mark type="inaudible" /> their own efforts to get their water supply, and we'll certainly like the idea of having another mining company operating crew, that will certainly help our industry improve just basically.</p>

          <p>And then just if I may on Tia Maria. I hope &#x2013; good to see that we're hopefully moving forward with the desalination operations et cetera. Can you just talk a little bit about the timeframe from year-end? Is there a new series of public hearings that are required or is there going to be a speedier process in terms of...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are expecting from the government that they advise us on the new way to review the environmental impact assessment with local communities. At this point, there are no hearings. We don't think that hearings will be the next step. We believe that most likely it will be TV presentations and radio transmissions explaining the process and informing local communities on that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello? Yeah. So my question is related to your dividend policy going forward. I just wanted to get a sense of given that of &#x2013; given the substantial amount of investments and the huge CapEx spend that you guys are expecting over the next year. If it is correct to assume that payout ratios should be slightly lower over the following years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am so sorry, but we heard your question cut, so we couldn't copy you well. But if I understood what you're saying, you're asking about the dividend payments in the future considering our capital expenditures program. Is that your concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's exactly. Just wanted to get a sense if you can give us any color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, Renato, the company has already issued the debt portion that we believe is necessary to have as a cash position for moving forward probably without affecting &#x2013; without being concerned on the short-term changes of the market. So we have secured the money for the startup of the projects.</p>
          <p>And as I explain in the conference call, the Board has the final word regarding dividend payments, and they usually look at the cash position of the company, the cash flow generation, and any requests for payments of debt, which we don't have significantly ones until 2015, and the capital expenditures that we're expecting, and on that base, a dividend, it's agreed. I think as the practice of the company has shown very extensively that we don't want to hoard any cash, that's one of the characteristics of the company. So on that basis, you can really make your own conclusions.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks, guys. Sorry, a follow-up question is regarding El Arco and Los Chancas. Given the $5 billion CapEx program you already have, where are these greenfield projects going to slot in? And I guess can we get an update of what stage in the process those are at right now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In Los Chancas, we are doing the <mark type="inaudible" /> in order to start the basic engineering at the beginning of next year. And then we will see if we will go for a quotation process or for a leaching process, that is one of the options that we have in that project. And about El Arco, we are doing &#x2013; checking the engineering that we have and we will see if we will continue with that project after the initiation of the CapEx in Cananea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again just to follow-up on that, Alex, is the Board <mark type="inaudible" /> at this point the ramp-up on expansion at Cananea, when you think about comparing it with El Arco, but still El Arco is a great deposit, we're still moving forward, as Mr. Gonzalez Rocha pointed out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add that at this point, the $5.6 billion are not considering the major investments for El Arco or Los Chancas, just studies. The actions that we're undertaking for having the projects ready to go when we think that they are appropriate to develop.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. My first question relates to the Peru signing bonus for the new contracts. I think you mentioned it was $6,700 averaging per person with 2,000 people. That's in the neighborhood of $13 million. What is your accounting treatment for that bonus? Is that charged to expense in 3Q? Or are you amortizing that over the life of the contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will amortize it for the life of the contract in three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That was number one. Now on the cost of getting Cananea back in operation, I may have missed it, you estimate the cost at 114 million and some of that would be covered by insurance. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, for 3Q, what has been your accounting treatment for the cost of getting Cananea back in operation? Is that being charged to repair expense or is that being capitalized or some combination thereof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point, most of the cost has been capitalized, and that's how are we proceeding with expenditures related to the Cananea operation. Let me explain why we haven't capitalized 100%. And the reason is that there are some activities that qualify as maintenance of these operations and they are not CapEx. So when we're repairing and replacing equipment, those goes to capital expenditures, which is most of what we're doing. We have a maintenance that has been &#x2013; couldn't &#x2013; that wasn't performed because of the labor dispute, but it was certainly spent. But it's a minor amount. And we're still holding the $114 million as a total cost minus a refund that we don't know at this point how much it's going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And one more question. You mentioned earlier that Cananea was running at 30% capacity, if I wrote down what you said correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say it's 30% of capacity, are you referring to SXEW capacity or total capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the total capacity of 180,000 tons of copper production per year, we are currently operating the two SXEW plants that have a capacity of 55,000 tons combined. So if you do the math, it will show that it is 30% of the total capacity.</p>
