          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the Nordea and the Presentation of our Results for the First Quarter this year. The presentation will be made by our President and Group CEO, Christian Clausen and will take approximately 25 minutes. And after that we have a short Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And welcome to this press meeting. I am proud to present our Q1 report. And let's start with the sort of a simplified chart, stating what happened in Q1. Revenues up 5% on the quarter; expenses down 5; total lending is up 2; loan losses is 54 basis points, in line with our guidance and risk-adjusted profit is up 21% on the quarter. Our capital position is very strong, clearly above the target.</p>
          <p>Now, this is the simple version. Unfortunately it gets much more complicated. Particularly, this quarter, the currency effects are quite significant as you may have seen from the report. The weakening of the Swedish and Norwegian kroner where we have substantial business in fact impaired &#x2013; impairing the possibility of comparison.</p>
          <p>So, let's try to see if we can get through it. These are the reported figures, as you &#x2013; we already saw. Operating income up 5%, 16% up year-on-year. Expenses down 5. Profit before loan losses was 17 and 31% year-on-year and operating profit up 20%.</p>
          <p>As I said, there is lot of currency effects in this, and if we try to net these out, we can see that if we take Q1 and compare to Q4 and take out and do it in local currencies, i.e., the Swedish operation in Swedish kroner, Norwegian operation in Norwegian kroner and so on, which is of course, the underlying business, we can see that revenues are actually up 9%, costs are flat, profit before loan losses up 20%, and operating profit up 22%.</p>
          <p>And if we, in the same way, with the local currencies compare to Q1 last year then revenues up 22%, cost up 10% and profit before loan losses are up 36%. I hope this overview helps you. I will give a few comments as I continue with some of these comparison numbers.</p>
          <p>Let's take the corporate customers first. Our income from the corporate customers remained at the very high level. In local currencies it's actually up 3% on the quarter, is 20% up compared to last year. Strong contribution from net interest income and very much also the capital markets operations, which had very high activity towards our corporate customers. I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Corporate lending is up 1%. We continue to support our corporate customers. Demand is, however, down clearly in the quarter. And we also have helped a number of our large corporate customers to issue bonds in the capital market, which of course, also have taken off some of the increases. The corporate lending margins continue to increase, reflecting the re-pricing of especially the credit risk, but also the increased liquidity premiums.</p>
          <p>Income from the household sector is down, clearly 9%. There is severe pressure on deposit margins, obviously from the lower interest rates. We see, however, lending increasing both from mortgages and consumer lending. And we see volumes in the Gold segment up 3% on the quarter, which is very satisfying. We also see somewhat higher lending margins, not a lot, just a little on the households sector, also reflecting the higher liquidity premiums for funding the longer term commitments.</p>
          <p>The net interest income is stable at a high level. In local currency, it's actually up 3% on the quarter and then we have few days less, which is another 2%, so actually the underlying effect is up 3% &#x2013; 5% &#x2013; sorry.</p>
          <p>Again, we have a negative effect from the deposit margins, which is quite significant around 180 million. We continue to attract deposits from both household and corporate customers. And quarter-on-quarter, we see that the income &#x2013; net interest income is up 15% and our deposit growth in the period has been somewhat faster than the market.</p>
          <p>Net fee and commission income is stabilizing at this level. It seems to be down 2%. It's actually up 2% in local currency. Our savings-related income is down 11%, but it is stabilizing during the quarter. We see assets under management stabilizing, because we see equity markets rebounding.</p>
          <p>Lending commission is up 16%, very much from our large corporate customers, reflecting also I said, the increased number of bond issuance we have been making during the year &#x2013; the quarter. Payment commissions are down and the commission for our State programs is 51 million, 45 for Denmark and 6 for the Swedish Stability fund.</p>
          <p>Net gains/losses up 58%, a record result in capital markets. We have seen very high activity from our corporate customers, mainly in hedging their position on interest rates falling and on FX, the weakening of the Swedish and Norwegian kroner. We have been managing this in a very good way and we see the result of this. It's a very strong part of our franchise and it has been integrated part of our strategy to service our customers this way and it is certainly paying off this quarter.</p>
          <p>We also have a strong result in Treasury with good gains and year-on-year its up &#x2013; the gains/losses are up 81%.</p>
          <p>The costs are actually reported down 5. In local currency it's unchanged. The cost/income ratio is going down to 48 compared to 51 and 54 one year ago. We continue to manage our cost down. We take a number of measures. The number of employees is down 1% in the quarter and we are accelerating a number of our efficiency programs. Year-on-year, the costs are up 3% and 10% in local currency.</p>
          <p>Loan losses are in line with the expectations. We report net loan losses of 54 basis points, &#x20AC;356 million. Gross provisions are lower than they were in Q4 because recoveries are &#x2013; is also lower. The loan losses continue to come from a large number of small and medium size companies, corporate customers, very few large ones. And a large part of the loan losses actually relate to the Danish operation. As we can see, a part of that is related to the Danish guarantee schemes, which is actually, losses in all the banks.</p>
          <p>The weakening economy affects impaired loans. We have impaired more loans in Q1. It's up 33% to 100 basis points of total lending. It's 68 basis points, net of allowances, and 62% of the impairments are still performing. So, we are early out impairing loans. As you can see, the bulk of it is still performing, but we are early out noting that these might get problems going forward.</p>
          <p>Good part of the increase relates to Finland and Denmark, as well as the Baltic countries. And the biggest sectors are retail trade, shipping, and offshore. The allowances are also going up and we see that collective allowances are up 78 million in the first quarter, both relating to the Baltic countries, shipping, and retail.</p>
          <p>Let's get extra view on the Baltics, which is of course, important to analyze right now. We see annualized loan losses in the Baltics of 119 basis points, of which 60% is collective, a very high number. The increase of impaired loans in the Baltics are now 342 basis points of total lending. The increase is driven by few, very well collateralized exposures, where we do not expect large loan losses and the allowances are now 214 basis points. So, 214 basis points of allowances has covered the impaired of 240 &#x2013; 342, which means that we have a coverage ratio of 62%, which compares very well.</p>
          <p>75% of the total allowances in the Baltics are collective provisions, meaning we have not identified individual customers which are having the problems yet. We have provided in good time for this, because we are &#x2013; foresee more problems &#x2013; more issues going forward on &#x2013; for some of these customers.</p>
          <p>We have reduced lending volumes in the quarter quite significantly. And it's also worth noting the composition of our portfolio. The Nordic and international customers and the large local customers is a quite significant part of the portfolio, actually more than half. And in this area, we expect very few loan losses. These are customers we know very well. They are very transparent. They're easy to analyze. And we have a low expected loss ratio here. The problems will come and I &#x2013; it's already there in the mid-size, which is less than half. Actually, the mid-sized local companies have around 1.7 billion of exposure. And that's where we are seeing the problems, are going to see the problems. But it's worth noting it's a limited exposure we have there.</p>
          <p>On top of this, we have the household exposure, which is also quite transparent and not that difficult to forecast. So, all in all, we find that the Baltic situation had been deteriorating. We are impairing more loans, but we think we are well provided for.</p>
          <p>If we look at the total credit portfolio, it's worth noting that half of the portfolio is actually low risk areas, like mortgage lending and telecom and so on. And here we expect low loan losses. In our guidance from one quarter ago, we expected around maybe five basis points, maybe up to 10 basis points of loan losses in that area, well-controlled loan losses.</p>
          <p>Then we have a third of the portfolio, which is medium risk, telecom, metals, media, transportation and so on. Here we will see some loan losses. It could be expected to be in the area of magnitude of 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>And then we have special attention areas, which are the well-known areas, which have higher risk, that's only 19% of the portfolio, construction, dry bulk, private equity companies, Baltic, Russia and so on. Here we will see loan losses probably above 50 basis points, in some of these areas in the hundreds of basis points. And in these areas, we can comment on some of these special areas. The private equity owned companies; this 3% of lending is well diversified, insignificant junior debt. It's more or less only senior debt. And here we have already done quite a few workout cases, which have ended very well with very little loan losses.</p>
          <p>Shipping and offshore, which is 4% of lending, which is largely collateralized, well diversified also. Here we have also done a number of workouts, which have resulted in a good result with the low loan losses.</p>
          <p>Commercial real estate is 7%. And here it's actually very well-secured and with the low interest rate level we see now, we actually see this sector as quite healthy right now. But we are, of course, following it very closely.</p>
          <p>And then the Baltics, as I've mentioned, 3%, but actually only 1.7 billion is exposed to the real risk sectors in this area. All in all, we find that it's very difficult to forecast the impairments going forward in the Baltics. But we think we are very well provided for.</p>
          <p>This means that the operating profit is up 7%. And if we look at profit before loan losses, it's up 31%. And this is a very significant figure. This is, of course, reflecting a very high loss absorption capability in that area that we produce this kind of profit before loan losses.</p>
          <p>Our long-term target remains unchanged. I will comment on that on the next few slides. Just here, ROE 13.9, which certainly compares well with our Nordic peers we have seen so far, and I will comment on the others on the next few slides. The TSR, total shareholder return, we are still in top quartile. We have now for three years in a row been in the top quartile, number one, two or three, which is quite amazing and we still stay there. During the quarter, we have been in a position between number three and number one.</p>
          <p>And on our risk adjusted profit, we are above our target. You probably remember that we two-and-a-half years ago set up the target to double the risk adjusted profit in seven years, which meant that we expected 10% average growth rate per year. We were above in '07, a bit below in '08, now we are above again. We actually expected during this crisis that we would stay below the line. Now we're above, that's very nice. And of course, it's amazing to see that we are up 21% on the quarter and 38% compared to one year ago, showing that the underlying business momentum in Nordea is indeed very high even though we are facing these difficult economic times.</p>
          <p>Let me give away few comments to the strategy. As we already mentioned a few months ago, we are staying loyal to our long-term vision of a great Nordea. We keep our organic growth strategy, but we take down the speed. We apply a middle of the road strategy right now, which is focused and which means that we are balancing opportunities and challenges.</p>
          <p>We are focusing on our core customers. We select new, high-quality customers, which we do take in. We are very proactive of risk management. We are gradually managing the cost level down and we make significant adjustments in the investment we do. We're also creating a core Tier 1 capital ratio of more than 10% and we have already done that.</p>
          <p>And the reason for this approach is, of course, we want to keep the business momentum now in the middle of the crisis. So, we don't want to overreact to the situation where we close down activities and initiatives, drastic cost-cutting, lower lending, reduced balance sheet and no payout and so on, which actually will mean that we will lose momentum and lose customers and withdraw from the market.</p>
          <p>A lot of banks in the world and in Europe is doing that right now out of necessity. But we don't want to be there as I will demonstrate later. Organic growth strategy has served us really well. And on the other hand, we do not also want to not react to the situation. We are obviously in the worst economic crisis for decades, so we don't -- don't want just to go ahead on lending growth, not do anything on costs or initiatives and so on and not raise capital, which I think is not a prudent way to react.</p>
          <p>So middle of the road, it's a simple of wanting to balancing the opportunities and challenges and keep the business momentum. And this translate into our strategy map here where we want to serve our existing core household customers, we attract healthy new core customers, as I will show, quite significant numbers. We support our core corporate customers in these difficult times, but we step out on risk management and we have to make sure that our margins is reflecting the risk and the liquidity premiums.</p>
          <p>On shipping, we are managing exposure. It's done in an orderly way and quite successful, but it's prime focus on shipping. And in new European markets we are reducing the speed. We are taking down initiatives. We are focusing a lot on helping our customers to restructure in that are also in an orderly way. And we are accelerating the efficiency improvements and we're stepping on credit and capital and risk processes, as we have done all the time, but now it's clearly in focus.</p>
          <p>This is all because the relationship-driven growth strategy has proven very successful. Our credibility and stability in this environment has meant that we have increased customer loyalty and we have increased customer acquisition. So, in this quarter, we have 26,000 new Gold customers, which is in line with our plans, but also very encouraging and we have a record level of the customer meetings.</p>
          <p>Actually today we have twice as many customer meetings per employee as we had one year ago, twice as many. It's quite an impressive efficiency gain. And this is extremely important because in these difficult times what we really need to do is to get really close to the customers. They need somebody to talk to. They see difficulties out there. They are uncertain about the future, and they want to talk to us. And of course, being this closer to customers makes possible for us to see all the early warning signs, also to do all the business which we can, which is reflected in our figures.</p>
          <p>On Private Banking, we see stabilizing assets under management and very good inflows in Q1, also an important segment. On the corporate side, we see an improved position. We attract selectively new customers and we increase our market shares in this area, and income growth is very impressive 28% in the larger segments. And in New European markets, we also attract quite a number of Gold customers in the higher segments, customers who are doing well and which will be good platform for the future.</p>
          <p>As I said, cost, risk and capital management has taken the lead. This has always been part of the important foundation in Nordea, but right now it has taken the lead. And on costs, we are accelerating our efficiency programs. Costs are down in Q1. We are managing gradually the costs down during the year. So, we are not abruptly just taking out costs or people, but we're gradually right-sizing, which means that we in Q1 actually reduced the staff by 1%.</p>
          <p>We are stepping up on risk management being more proactive. I will come back to that. And on capital, we have strengthened the Tier 1 ratio clearly by the rights offering and we have more capacity going forward.</p>
          <p>We have good demand for our issuance, so our funding situation is strong. Our liquidity situation is strong. We attracted long-term funding of 7.3 billion in Q1, which is a high number. It's in line what we did last year and the year before. So, we are continuing having a large proportion of our wholesale funding as &#x2013; with long maturities.</p>
          <p>We have very large liquidity buffers, &#x20AC;42 million, which means that we do not have to tap the market from more than one year. We do not need it if we don't have to do it, which is strong position. Of course, prices on funding, particularly the long-term funding has gone up, reflecting the market environment that is clear.</p>
          <p>We are stepping up on risk management. We have make an organization where we do many additional credit reviews in the branch regions. We have reinforced workout teams in all countries, so we have a core unit in each country. And then in addition, we have virtual teams on the more complicated and bigger cases. We have very senior bankers, specialists, analysts and the lawyers coming together in a virtual team, which can go in all countries where we needed, and solve the cases and help the customers to restructure and get through the problems.</p>
          <p>We have external resources identified to handle very specific problems, and we are prepared to take over companies and the collateral, either in direct or indirect ownership. That set up is made. And this is, of course, because early action is the name of the game here. The earlier we help the customer restructure, less the loan losses and the better we get through this crisis together and of course, top management is clearly involved.</p>
          <p>I'd like to stress that this whole area, it's a very orderly process. It's well-structured and it's well-organized. And sometimes when I read the papers, I get sort of the impression that everything is pure panic and things are melting down and things &#x2013; that is not the picture I recognized.</p>
          <p>We have an orderly and strong process on this, and we feel quite comfortable about it. Of course, the uncertainty going forward is large because of the large uncertainty on the macroeconomic development. But we think we are well-organized and well-structured to handle this situation. This is, of course, key and this is a key focus area in the whole Group, not only in central but in all decentralized units, everybody is of course clearly focused on this.</p>
          <p>The outcome of the rights offering concluded earlier this month was very successful. As you know, it was fully subscribed and it has attracted more than 2.5 billion in core capital. And this means that we are one of the strongest banks in Europe on capital, core Tier 1 capital, which is the real cash equity, which is the strong capital, the capital that can absorb loan losses and can take rating migration from our customers.</p>
          <p>And except these two guys here who have state asset protection schemes, then we are number one or two in Europe right now in capital &#x2013; core capital ratio, which is the key number we are following. And this also means that we are above our targets on core Tier 1 capital the 10% and on Tier 1 capital is 10.9%.</p>
          <p>Actually it's worth noting that our capital base is now &#x20AC;21.9 billion and this means that we have excess capital over the Pillar I capital requirements of 8.2 billion, quite a significant buffer to have in these difficult times.</p>
          <p>And this has become my favorite slide underlying the very strong business momentum in Nordea. Over the last three years, since Q1 '06 to Q1 '09, we have increased revenues very significantly. I think this proves the value of our organic growth strategy. It's not fluctuating. It's very predictable. And look at the figures 2279, 1754, 500 million more revenues and a run rate, which is maybe a bit lower than that, but you can say that this is quite significant achievement meaning that we have the priorities to keep the business momentum. As I said, we stay by our customers. We service our existent relationships. We add in, of course, some selectively new customers. But it's very important that we continue this momentum and this is very much also about keeping our focus on the risk management as I've already said.</p>
          <p>So concluding, this is the strong start of the year. It's a record result, especially in markets but also in other areas. Continued strong income growth momentum and high activity among customers. Nordea is moving ahead and is completely open for business.</p>
          <p>Organic growth strategy has been adjusted downwards to adjust to our 'middle of the road' approach, where we balance opportunities and threats. We have a stringent cost management. Expenses in line with the outlook. Net loan loses in Q1 is in line with Q4.</p>
          <p>The weakening economy is clearly affecting impaired loans as expected. Risk-adjusted profit is up 21% on the quarter and 38% on the year. We do not change our guidance. We think that we still have a pressure on deposit margins and uncertainty out there. So we keep our guidance.</p>
          <p>Cost, risk and capital management has taken the lead as I've demonstrated and we have a successful outcome on the rights offering meaning our capital position is one of the strongest in Europe right now.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation and there will now be a Q&amp;A session. I will ask Fredrik Rystedt and Carl-Johan Granvik to join me here on the podium for questions, so we can give good detailed answers to your difficult questions.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Peter Groud at Handelsbanken. I have two questions. Firstly, if you can elaborate a bit about what you anticipate in terms of interest margins, combining both deposit margins and lending margins together going forward? And secondly, if you can elaborate also a bit about the growth of risk-weighted assets, what should we anticipate here and what is here the main drivers including the migration impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Margins is very difficult to put into one simple sentence. We see deposit margins coming down and we saw a significant impact in Q1 and we will see a full quarter impact, you can say in Q2 of this drop in the interest rates. On the other hand, lending margins is clearly going up. But that's a slower development you can say. We are gradually increasing lending margins. So whenever the interest rates have gone down, it's sort of been an overnight effect on deposits margins. So these two curves are in opposite directions and exactly how that spells out quarter-by-quarter. It's very difficult to say that. But net, I think there will be positive effect from this. And your second question was, yes, maybe you will say something here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can do that. I think there are two main factors impacting risk-weighted assets. Of course &#x2013; the first one of course, is growth in our business. You have seen the first quarter growth being relatively modest in terms of risk-weighted assets or lending growth. But we expect, in general for this year, some growth in lending. So that will increase risk-weighted assets. I think the other issue is migration on the credit side particularly, and you've seen in the first quarter 1.2% approximately. We have previously communicated that it could be up to 8 to 10% for the full year. It's very difficult to estimate, but it could be in that order of magnitude. And we will see, as we go about. But those two in combination will give you an approximation of the increase in risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Can you please give some idea of the sustainability on the trading lines, a little bit more color on what's in there and so on? I'd also like to ask you about the guidance on the loan losses and how you go about and think about it, because in terms of impaired loans and everything do we have &#x2013; in a period of exponential increase of, I think just getting bad -- worse. How &#x2013; how do you come up with a number of around 50 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a few comments on the capital markets. First of all, I'd like to stress that I have been here now for two years presenting our strategy, and capital products to corporate customers have been key part of all the presentations. We have built this, and it is a very strong part of the one Nordea team thinking that we service our customers through customer relationship, people, and through our capital market people. The risk management, of course, these days is key. So this is a core part of our strategy. Having said that, Q1 was exceptionally good, meaning that all customers try to hedge against falling interest rates and falling currency and these things. And of course, in this environment, it's easier to have a good margin on that operation. But it takes the operation to do it.</p>
          <p>Also in this quarter, we are clearly the biggest provider of new bond issuance in &#x2013; for the big companies we've done a large number of very successful bond issuance, which also comes into the capital markets. So a number of large transactions also comes in. Whether it's sustainable or not depends on the activity among our customers. So it is, of course, an activity-related line more than a risk-related. So, we have not increased our risk in our trading areas in this quarter, but it's activity-related, just like fee and commission income is activity-related. So, I think it's an exceptionally good quarter. We hope that it will stay at a high level, but it's extremely difficult to predict. Carl-Johan, impairments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As you saw, the majority of the impairments in this quarter related to still performing loans, which has been the tendency all the time, i.e., that we are early in recognizing the problems as they occur. And also, following up on that, the major part, or the whole portfolio, is actually related non-performing to &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; impaired to performing loan. In addition, we have continuously increased the provisions we have for collectively impaired loans, i.e., this quarter again we added another 78 million to collective provisions, indicating that we see some problems which we cannot identify it. The day we can identify it, we actually are already provided in the collective ways. That is the basis for how we see. But as we said in the outlook, obviously nobody knows in terms of how bad the economy goes, but we feel today confident with the outlook that we gave at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have some assumption of economy is turning up, or demand increasing among your corporate clients? What's the timing on things there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I will also say that one quarter is, of course, a very short period in the lifetime of a business of our kind. So, of course, you might see quarterly differences. But the trend I think -- we see certain positive signs that the free fall is certainly over in the economy. The Q4 effect, that continues into January, maybe February. We cannot claim that we see a growth path yet, but I think we can see leveling out on this level and with some hopes of actually then, positive development come autumn.</p>

          <p>Right. Hampus Brod&#xE9;n at Enskilda. I just saw that your incremental reserve ratio, so to speak, this quarter is 35%, but the increase in total operations as percent of the increase in impaired loans. That's 35%, which puts the reserve ratio, including all collective reserves and so on, on 48%. I believe that was above 70% just over a year ago. So my question is this incremental reserve ratio of 35%, sustainable going forward, or do you plan to actually level out somewhere around those levels when it comes to the reserve ratio in the Group?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We take every situation individually rather than aim at a certain ratio. Obviously, it is comfortable to have a high ratio, which I think all the banks have before the crisis started, so to say. Now, we go much deeper into the &#x2013; in the individual cases and make the valuations on the security that we have and the possibilities for cash flow generated income streams. So in that respect, we are focusing down much more on the specific issues. And therefore, we don't have a target on the ratios as such. But the fact that we have a fairly high number &#x2013; a fair high number of collective provisions give the buffer that, if we were wrong in terms the valuation, we actually have buffer in that area.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give some more flavor to the extreme deviation in the Baltic losses compared to the market we've seen so far in Q1, except for the slide you show, there is in terms of segment, and as you have had a quite good growth in the area. And also if you could comment on how you expect that to develop going forward into the end of 2009 or 2010? Thanks.</p>

          <p>If I continue maybe somebody want &#x2013; like to support me. But I think we shouldn't look just at the one quarter. We were actually early out, already at the end of 2007 made major provisions for the Baltic portfolio. Meaning that today, if you compare the Swedish banks that are involved there, we are actually on the same basic level, or say somewhere in between the two other players. Also, I think that we had the structure of the portfolio, as Christian pointed out here when we looked at the corporate portfolio, is a stronger portfolio than our peers, more are local &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; are Nordic international business more of stronger local companies involved in infrastructure and with some public support and so on. Of course it is a challenging market, but I don't think you can take the portfolios one by one, and I'd say over the period, our provision levels have not deviation that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given that you're now on similar provisioning levels, or coverage ratio, would you expect the differences to vanish going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, maybe Carl-Johan, if I can say that it's very difficult to analyze other banks. So we won't do that. We will analyze our own situation. So, I think, we &#x2013; when you focus on our portfolio and the risks involved, and I'll try to give some more highlights onto that. And if you look at the exposure at risk, then I think it's a fairly low number. We have provided a lot. We have 75% of our provisions in the Baltics are collective, meaning that we could not identify the customers. They are collective for the general outlook, which we of course agree is very, very dark. But exactly how it will spill out is impossible to say. For that reason, we also, one-and-a-half years ago in Q4 '07 actually, made a large provision of 500 basis points annualized. Somebody have forgotten that, because it's so many quarters ago. So we did it very early. And we are still providing this collective in Baltics.</p>
          <p>The actual losses there are still at a low level. But of course, we see the economy developing. But we see very strong signs within our portfolio that a large part of it is, as I said, Nordic and large corporates where we have full grab of the situation, losses will be very low. And then we have SME, medium-size sector, which is where we see all the problems. And exactly how that is going to spread out is very, very difficult to forecast. We can just say we feel that we are doing exactly as we should. And I also think we are doing a very predictable process. Quarter-by-quarter, we're going through the -- each corporate, each company, each customer. We are impairing. We are reserving, and we are doing the same every quarter. So we have a gradual development.</p>
          <p>And if things deteriorate, then of course, we'll go the one way and if they get a bit better, we'll go the other way. But to forecast an economy which is &#x2013; have a GDP decline of a yearly rate of maybe 10 to 12% this year is more or less impossible. So I think we have to dive into the -- each portfolio and see exactly where are the risks. And here it's, of course, very important which sectors you are exposed to, very important.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Just a follow-up to Thomas' question on the sustainability on net financial income. Given the measures you've taken, do you think is it too conservative to assume that you would come back to your average level of around 200 million you had quarterly in 2008, or have you really established a new sustainable level, although perhaps not 500 million a quarter as you see it? And secondly, a more detailed question, your margin trends in Norway look a bit strange on household mortgages and deposits &#x2013; for household deposits, if you just can confirm that was primarily due to the six-week notification period? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's difficult to forecast that line. As I said, it's activity based. We have clearly gained market share among large corporate customers. We are clearly gained in this area. So I think the level is moving up, not only because normal trading and hedging, but also because of large transactions we are doing all the time. And this need is, of course, going up because still more corporates will access the capital markets rather than get the funding from the balance sheet of the banks, which have difficulties, of course, in attracting long-term funding.</p>
          <p>So the nature of things would be to see this level higher, that's our expectations. 500 was a wonderful figure, and I'd like to see it every quarter. But I think maybe this is little in the dream world, so we don't think that. What we focus on is not necessarily products, it is the activity level. The activity level with our corporate customers is extremely high on all sorts of transactions. Not only capital, it's payment transactions, it's lending, it's deposits, and all sort of things. Everything is going up. So as long as we have this high activity level with our customers and that's also goes for household customers, we are sure that we will catch the revenues streams whether they will be lending margins, deposit margins, fees or net gains going forward. So we cannot give a forecast.</p>

          <p>You are talking about the administrative rights in Norway. The answer is, yes that it has to do with that. So we &#x2013; if you look at reported mortgage margins, for instance, of 200 or so basis points, the underlying margin is more in the region of 80 to 85, which is comparable to Q4 or slightly there above. And of course, the same thing for deposits margins that is actually minus 33 now and then an average for underlying margin is some 70, 75 basis points. So the answer is, yes.</p>
