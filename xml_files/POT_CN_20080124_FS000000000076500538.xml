        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you, Denita.  And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this discussion of Potash Corp.'s performance in the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2007.  It was a very good year and we have never been more excited about the future for our company.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter earnings of $1.16 per diluted share doubled our earnings for the same period the previous year, which were a record for our company at that time.  This raised our full-year 2007 earnings to $3.40 per share, our fourth consecutive year of record performance.  And we exceeded $1.1 billion in net income for the first time in our history. Quarterly gross margin of $535 million was our highest ever.  This raised our 2007 total gross margin to $1.9 billion, far surpassing the previous record of 1.1 billion set in 2005.  We also set full-year records for EBITDA and cash flow, enabling us to build on our strengths and generate even greater returns in the years ahead.  As pleased as we are with this record-setting performance, we believe that in many ways we are just getting started and the best is yet to come.</p>
          <p>With the uncertain US economy creating stock market volatility around the world, virtually every industry has been caught in this net.  For several days over the past week or so, we were no exception.  That resulted in a tremendous opportunity and our Board of Directors acted swiftly yesterday to approve plans to repurchase up to 15.8 million Potash Corp. shares.  While some businesses face uncertain roads, our company is standing on the threshold of unprecedented growth.  We aren't shaken by the current environment in the capital markets and we recognize that our continued growth will not always follow a straight line up.  The reality is, however, that even after four consecutive record years, we have never been in a better position to demonstrate the strength of our business.  Our confidence stems from long-term global fundamentals that are ideally matched to our strengths.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, we're not in a luxury business.  Eating is very high on most people's priority list.  Countries like China and India continue to grow in terms of population and economies.  They have more people with more money and they are developing appetites for the types of food we in North America take for granted.  The desire for better food in developing countries is not a fad.  People who have been introduced to more nutritious protein-rich foods will not return to starch-based diets.  There are literally hundreds of millions of people in those countries who are making the shift to protein and competition for food worldwide is a new reality.</p>
          <p>While GDP growth initiated this fundamental shift, the trend has now moved beyond economics.  This human development story has momentum built on food demand and the limitations of global crop producers.  The growth in global grain consumption has exceeded increases in production in seven of the past eight years and the USDA is forecasting another shortfall for the 2007/2008 crop year.  Despite record harvests and the best efforts of the world's farmers, production of grains and soybeans continues to fall short of demand.  Countries have consistently drawn from long-held inventories to meet their food demand.  This has masked the grain deficit for many years and kept crop and food prices artificially low.  That can't continue.  Now those inventories are severely depleted and it's estimated that the world has only enough grain in reserve for 1.7 months.  This is a very precarious situation for the world and is a problem which is not getting nearly enough attention from global leaders.</p>
          <p>The realities in the agricultural sector are that food demand is increasing, crop prices are rising and people will have to pay more for food.  This creates some interesting dynamics.  In China, food inflation is a major concern and the Chinese government is taking steps to curb rapid increases.  Price controls were recently enacted for energy, grain and now urea and phosphates fertilizers.  These caps are intended to protect farmers and, most importantly, the country's food security.  Coupled with excise taxes on exports that we believe the government will increase if necessary, the Chinese are working to ensure their farmers can maximize food production because the only real way to fight food inflation is to produce more food; that means using more and not less fertilizer.</p>
          <p>While the Chinese are self-sufficient in nitrogen and phosphate, they rely heavily on potash from countries like Canada.  To maintain the appropriate nutrient balance and protect their food supply, they will have an even greater and more urgent need for potash imports.  Add to that the potash needs of India, Brazil and Southeast Asia and you can see how demand is growing.</p>
          <p>As a whole, the fertilizer industry's working to keep pace, with most companies being pushed to their production limits.  Supply is very tight, especially in potash and inventories are well below five-year averages.  Our company is coming off a year of record potash production, but our inventories closed 2007 at the second lowest level since 1991.  This puts into context inventory data that showed a minor increase from November to December.  It was possible to misinterpret that as an ominous sign of build-up throughout the system; this could not be further from the truth.  Not only are inventories low, customers all along the potash pipeline are looking for more product.  North American and offshore customers have been receiving shipments on an allocation basis since the middle of 2007 and this is expected to continue well into 2008.</p>
          <p>In Phosphate and Nitrogen, supply is tight as well.  Growing demand is tight in market fundamentals for solid phosphate fertilizers, leading to higher global prices for the phosphate rock and phosphoric acid used in all phosphate end products.</p>
          <p>Sulphur prices have also risen dramatically.  As a result, global producers who import these feedstocks face higher costs and with that, need to raise prices just to stay in business.  With our low-cost, high-quality rock and our North American sulphur advantage, we gained tremendous gross margin potential as phosphate prices continue to rise.</p>
          <p>In Nitrogen, the strength of our Trinidad operation are becoming even more pronounced.  We have long-term, lower-cost gas contracts and proximity to the United States that provides cost advantages in the face of higher ocean freights.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to 2008, we expect to flourish in all three nutrients.  This gives us the potential for gross margin growth that far exceeds anything that we've ever seen before.  In 2007, potash volumes were the primary driver of our record results.  Even though prices that were scheduled to increase were introduced, the full benefit was not realized on all tons sold.  China and India, for example, were buying under contract pricing, which gave them a very attractive deal relative to other markets.  In 2008, we anticipate gross margin will drive our results as we combine the benefits of higher volumes, higher prices and lower per-ton cost.</p>
          <p>While everyone in the potash business is running full-out, we are the only company that can introduce significant capacity to the market in the coming five years.  Our Lanigan project is scheduled to come on screen in the second quarter of this year and when fully ramped up during 2009, will raise our production capability by 1.5 million tons.</p>
          <p>In the years that follow, we'll continue to increase our capacity with a target of 15.7 million tons by the end of 2012 and potentially 17.2 million tons by 2015. As we produce more, we also reduce our fixed cost per ton and lessen the impact of provincial taxes on additional tons produced.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we expect to realize the full benefits of North American price increases announced in late 2007.  Offshore stock markets are anticipating prices above $500 per ton, while buyers in China and India are expecting higher prices on our next contracts to secure the potash their farmers need. With a potential for further price increases in spot markets during the year, the impact on gross margin going forward is expected to be very powerful.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, we anticipate our 2008 Potash gross margin could be approximately 2.5 times the record of 2007. Nitrogen and Phosphate on a combined basis are expected to exceed 2007 gross margin by 20 to 25%, reaching record levels in both nutrients. We expect earnings per share for 2008 to be in the range of $6.25 to $7.25 per share, reflecting a fifth consecutive year of record earnings.</p>
          <p>This is an exciting time for our company and we are eager to fulfill our role in the global development story.  The uncertainty of the stock market in recent days has people looking for stability; this has always been a hallmark of our company.  And our strategies for delivering growth while reducing volatility have been executed and tested over time.  As the world's largest fertilizer enterprise, with unmatched potash assets complemented by world-class nitrogen and phosphate operations, we believe our company has the greatest upside in our industry.  We have patiently and steadfastly moved forward over the past two decades, building towards the position we hold today.  Now, we have an unmatched asset base to serve our global customers and the leverage to reward our investors. We look forward to delivering on the expectations of all of our stakeholders as we move ahead.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by members of our Senior Management Team, so we'll open this up and answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bill.  As usual, there's been a lot of focus on the status of Chinese potash negotiations, but could you please give us some color on how Indian potash buyers are reacting to current market conditions?   If Chinese negotiations become extended, would you expect Indian buyers to hold off until China reaches an agreement or do you think they will try and lock in an agreement given the rising price environment?   Also, could you tell us why 2008 will be different than 2006 with respect to Chinese potash negotiations and the situation in the rest of the world?   Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Fai, thank you very much.  First let me comment on the Chinese potash negotiations.  Those negotiations are being held as they have been historically over the last few years with the Belarusian Potash Company as the main negotiator with the Chinese side and as you can imagine, there's some very substantial price increases being requested.  I would tell you that from the information that we have, of course we don't know when they'll conclude, but our best guess is at the end of March or the beginning of April, although there is a situation that has developed now in which ocean freight rates have taken a rather major correction, which may serve as a catalyst to get this thing started a little bit earlier.  You've got Chinese New Year coming up, so you either get it done before Chinese New Year or after Chinese New Year.  For our planning purposes, I can tell you that we think it's going to be very end of March or beginning of April.  And from our shipment point of view, we of course have told the Chinese that we can't hold back and keep material for them because the demand's so strong from all the other markets that we will pro-rate the year on the time of the conclusion.  So I can tell you that, because you have to plan ahead here, we have already taken February out for the Chinese, so obviously January's out and we are now on a 10-month program, so it would be 10 months pro-rated versus what we shipped last year.  And if we don't hear reasonably early in February, then we would take March out.  And all this, I would tell you, is in an environment in which the demand for our products is extraordinarily strong around the world.  We won't miss a beat without China in the first quarter because we're sold out and that's a very, very strong position to be in.  And my guess is that the Russians and the Belarusians are in very much the same position.</p>
          <p>So the negotiations this year with China, I would tell you that the potash producers are in a much stronger position just from a supply-demand situation, really, I think, than they've ever been.  And China will go through its own inventory fairly quickly here and I think there's general recognition that this market has moved much quicker than they anticipated.  If they had concluded in the fall of last year, they would have done a lot better than I think they're going to do.  The markets in Southeast Asia, I think you've seen an increase of $100 for the second quarter of 2008; that gets it up to five and a quarter.  If you think where the Chinese are with today's freight market, they're paying no more than two and a quarter, so that's a $300 differential with the spot market.  The Chinese deserve a discount, but not that big a discount.  In terms of India, the Indians have been burned a couple times with negotiations and I don't think they have the stomach for that.  Their need is real as well.  There's a lot of pressure on India to produce food.  There's a lot of people excited about potential food shortages; even the Prime Minister of India has spoken to this potential.  And I just don't think they have the stomach to take on the newly-enriched young people who have this money in their pocket that are absolutely demanding food be in the market for them to consume.  It's a real political risk and I can guarantee they're just like our politicians here in North America, they respond to pressure.  So we don't see India being a problem in the negotiations either; there's real need there as well.  So I hope that gives you a flavor, Fai.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys.  Bill, quick question.  Can you talk about the inventory situation in China in terms of how much do you think they have because we hear different stories that they have from 2 million to 4 million tons and how long can they last if they don't negotiate soon?  And also, can you elaborate on the uptick in inventory we saw in December?  I mean, exactly what happened and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.  Edlain, what I'd tell you, our best guess of Chinese inventory at December 31st was 4.5 million.  Of that 4.5 million, 1 million is below grade, so really not usable in a direct application basis.  So if you take that down to what they need to ship around the country, they've got about 3.5 million.  The Chinese use about a million ton a month.  There's no Russian rail being shipped into China. Quite a bit different situation from that long negotiation we had in 2006 when the Russians were railing material in.  The Russians are not railing material in because there was a cap put on Russian prices and the Russians can clearly sell that same material into offshore markets at much higher levels, so you don't have any Russian material coming in.  Clearly, Canpotex has not shipped anything in the new year, so this is why I say our best guess is end March, early April because that's when they run out.  And the government's going to try and play their hand, but their hand's not a strong one and I think there's a realization coming fairly quickly.  And that's why I say if they're smart, they see this downturn in ocean freight where they could lock-in Panamax's, in certain instances, half the value of what they were paying as recently as last November; I think they do themselves well.  In terms of the uptick in inventory in December, what I'd say to you is I said in my remarks, we ended December with the second lowest inventory level in our history since 1991 and you think about how big the market is today versus where it was in 1991; in real terms, that's quite a bit different story.  We had some weather difficulties the last week of December.  We actually had six vessels, Canpotex vessels, that were scheduled to get out that last week and due to very heavy rain and winds, we didn't get them loaded; that was about 200,000 tons right there that we still counted as inventory.  It's a very minor thing and if there was any analysis done on that, I think you'd find that that was a bunch of poppycock because the system is as tight as it can be and, as I said, the market's on allocation.  So potash is tight to short and everybody including the Chinese realize that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bill, just a question on pricing, both domestic and in offshore markets.  We know the Southeast Asia spot price; what's your information on in-country pricing in China currently on potash and also, turning to the US, sort of Midwestern spot prices that relative to your now higher list prices as of January 1st?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Don, I'm going to have David answer the domestic spot pricing situation.  In terms of our information on in-country China pricing, it's quite a bit higher than where the market is.  As I said, they're paying about 225 metric delivered into Chinese ports on their 2007 contract from Canpotex.  The internal market pricing's up, all over $400 and there's hoarding going on in China.  And I will tell you, the government even sent inspectors to Qinghai Salt Lake Potash, which is the biggest potash producer we have an interest, who <mark type="inaudible" /> in that operation, so we know full well what's going on there and just to make sure that that inventory was going to flow rather than be hoarded.  These Chinese traders, they're sharp as can be; they know what the market is and you're going to see a shortage situation in China develop until they get the price that they want.  So they're not fools; they're in the profit-making business as well.  David, why don't you talk about domestic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, going back to the fourth quarter, we had an October 1st pricing increase of $20 that was fully realized in Q4.  Just to look at our reference price in the Midwest, that puts St. Louis at $252.  We had a $30 increase December 1 and $50 Jan 1.  That $80 will be fully realized in Q1.  That puts our St. Louis price up to 334.  And we have another $80 price increase announced for March 1st.  That $80 will be fully implemented in the second quarter; we'll realize that in Q2.  That puts St. Louis up to 414.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bill.  I'm wondering about the relationship of contract versus spot.  I guess when Lai was saying that they were going to reserve more of their production for spot and the consortium BPC allowed that.  I'm just kind of wondering would this Canpotex allow you to have flexibility there and what might your policy be in relation to balancing the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Neal, what I would say is the key for Canpotex this year is to get the contract market up closer to the spot market.  The greatest percentage of our business is spot and, of course, the big contract markets are China and India; Brazil's the largest spot market.  Of course, North America's a spot market; Malaysia, Indonesia spot markets.  So those two big contract markets, those will continue to be contract markets for the Russians and Belarusians as well.  And as I said, it's just a question of getting those markets closer to the current spot situation.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys.  I have one question sort of related in two parts.  First, Bill, if you can give us an update on the Canpotex freight agreements that are in place in terms of is there a guideline, what percentage is sort of locked in, how far are we from where the crushing's been on the freight side?  Just to get an idea on what the net-backs potential is in terms of the comment there that if things stay low, the net-back's higher.  And tied into that, talking about the scale that's coming in terms of 2009 and so on, on a gross margin, meaning percentage of sales for the potash segment, how much on the cost side in terms of the operating scale that you can gain, excluding any price or net-back benefits?  So on an operating basis, if you're looking at a 60% gross margin right now, are we looking at a two point kind of pick-up on an operating basis if you had to leave pricing alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul, we'll handle that two-part question.  I'm going to ask David to comment first on the Canpotex freight agreements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul.  We're planning for '08, Canpotex, their CFR sales will be about 65% of total sales and about 32% of that is under some type of freight-forward agreement and the savings on that's around $75 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I just add there with this recent down-tick in the freight markets, Canpotex has taken on a couple new vessels, so we'll look a little better on that scale.  Garth, do you want to talk about the cost side part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Paul, as far as the operating costs go, I think we can put it with the increased volume and continuation of operations.  We can see probably about a 3% reduction in operating cost and that's exclusive of the brine costs, which we talked about in our release, which are high in New Brunswick, and we expect to see them come down a bit, but they're going to remain high for at least the first half of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Bill I have a question for you, I guess about how the stock market seems to value your company. So if you go back over the past year, I think your closest peer, Mosaic, has increased in value by a greater amount than Potash Corp. And more to the point, I think over the last couple of weeks and even at various points yesterday, the enterprise value of Mosaic is actually higher, or was higher, than the market valuation for Potash Corp. So I imagine you probably discussed this internally, you probably discussed it with your investors, can you give us a sense of why you think the market looks at your asset mix and maybe that of a peer and does not value your Potash position, your strategic nitrogen, your equity investment stakes, higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Okay. Dave, I'll try to answer that one. First of all, I'm not going to comment on Mosaic, other than to say that I have great admiration for the job that management has done at Mosaic. I think that was a great company all along, if you think about the Cargill piece and the IMC piece having worked at IMC over 20 years ago, I have full understanding of what that company represented and of course Cargill had some very good assets. What they didn't have was the management to pull it off and I think that they certainly do now. So we have great respect for that management team. In terms of how the market looks at us, the problem is keeping the market's attention. I sometimes joke with my friends in the major markets when we visit Toronto and New York, that Attention Deficit Disorder is alive and well on Bay Street and Wall Street, and it's just -- our company is a long-term enterprise, and of course we don't manage for the short term and we don't -- we're doing mining plans.  We have 25 and 30-year plans out in the future, but if you look at the assets, the underlying assets of these companies, we just -- in my remarks I talked about bringing on substantial potash in a potash world that is essentially sold out. The only company that's going to bring on substantial potash capacity over the next five years is Potash Corporation, in an era in which potash prices are accelerating rapidly. So the gross margin potential, and as I've said all along, there's no company that's going to be more profitable than Potash Corporation over the next five years.  There's just not a chance of that and the reason is because we have the best assets.  And I can tell you that any one of our competitors -- I'm really glad that they're all doing well and they're managed by and large by really good, smart people, but they don't have our asset mix. And any one of them would trade their assets with ours straight up today.</p>
          <p>They might throw in a couple high draft choices on top of it.  But it's just -- there's just no comparison.  When you think about the potash prices we have, the fact that we have more Saskatchewan capability, the only company that has New Brunswick capability, and then the only company that has investments around the world, in Jordan and in Israel and SQM in Chile, and China, no one has the depth or the reach in this most valuable nutrient -- the one that's best structured, and all of our competitors know that. There are people that drool when they see our potash and we've got all these new guys talking about potash up in Saskatchewan now; they changed their names to become more potash oriented, and people are calling themselves &#x2013; it sounds like airplanes, Potash One, it's quite remarkable.  I love the comment one of them had where he said that, it's just great to be in the potash business, and I thought to myself, well, that's absolutely right, but you're not in it.  And it's just interesting when you see sort of a broad brush painted over everything, over all companies, and that's given all the same valuation.  But when you really peel the leaves off the cabbage, there's quite a bit of distinction and we know that if we just do a halfway decent job of managing our assets, which are second to none in the world, that our shareholders are going to reap greater benefits.  You know, one year look at a company, that's one thing.  You take a look back five years or you take a look back 10 years, or go back to when a company first started trading as a publicly traded company, we don't have to back up to anybody.  So I think that the market will get it again and we'll come back into the attention realm for a lot of these companies.  Because when they really take a look at it, and they see the earnings, and all we have to do is perform, which we will, and the market will get it.</p>

          <p>A question here on the Chinese potash again.  If this negotiation takes past late March into early April, at what point do you take a mine shutdown?  Because if I remember correctly, in 2006 about this time, we heard similar guidance as far as when it would be settled, inventory levels, and the availability of Russian supply.  And then just Part B, just a little bit on the provincial mining taxes.  You made a comment earlier on about improvements in the tax rate with an increase in volumes.  Just what is the math behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm going to ask Wayne to answer the second part of that question after I try to tackle the first part, Jacob.  What I'd say, the difference between now and 2006, the negotiations are totally different.  The pipeline at the beginning of 2006 negotiations was full, and I mean full on a global basis.  The pipeline at the beginning of the 2008 negotiations is empty on a global basis. Beginning of 2006 China had many people that stopped buying, including here in North America, because they thought the Chinese were going to be successful in breaking the potash price and reducing the potash price.  And if you remember, they wanted a $20 per ton reduction, and so India stopped buying, and the Brazilians backed away, and the North American market clammed up.  And with the pipeline full, everybody was worried of course.  We took shutdowns and even the Russians and Belarussians for the first time in history took shutdowns and it ended up China accepted a $25 increase that year.  Now we're in 2008.  As I said the pipeline is empty.  The Chinese know full well that the market has moved beyond them.  There's not one other player that's holding the bag for the Chinese.  As a matter of fact, what we're getting in the marketplace is people saying, "Look, if the Chinese don't want their tons, we'll take them," and that's why we are prorating this year as we speak.  And we will not miss a beat in the first place.  As a matter of fact, we'll do better without them.  From a bottom line point of view, we'll do better without them.  The Chinese don't have the inventory; the Russians aren't shipping.  That again is a big change from where -- the rail shipments I'm talking about.  That's again a big change. So food production in these countries, when you think about India and China and the demand for food, these politicians will not take that risk.  It's a huge political risk, and they are looking to save their own scalps, and they will not do that.  So we have full confidence.  But if, Jacob, the world turns upside down, we would not hesitate to take shutdowns.  Don't ever underestimate that.  We will take shutdowns when and if they're required.  I'm going to ask Wayne to address the second part of the question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jacob, back in the early part of the 2000s, the government, as an incentive to encourage additional expansion activity in Saskatchewan, wanted to go with a plan that would allow them to do that without giving up existing revenues from the tax base.  So what they did is they agreed to lock in volumes at 2001/2002 average levels as the cap on which you would pay profits tax.  For this company, our cap ended up at about 5.7 million tons.  So every ton of sales in excess of 5.7 million tons is not exposed to the profits tax.  So as our volume goes up, and, for instance, in 2007, where we sold 9 -- sorry, we sold about 8.7 million tons of Saskatchewan potash, there was 3 million tons that was not paying a profits tax.  And so as our expansions come on at Flannigan and at Patience Lake and Cory and then subsequently at Rocanville, all those incremental tons will not be paying a profits tax.  So actually, it will be a significant benefit to all of our shareholders on that program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jacob, just one other point on the market difference between 2006 and 2008. The global grain situation is completely different.  You've had an explosion in grain prices.  You have $5 corn on futures market.  You have $12 plus beans, and we think both of those have real upside potential because the competition for food is real.  So I wouldn't be surprised to see $6 corn.  We had nowhere near that situation.  Palm oil.  Look what's happened to palm oil since 2006.  You think the Malaysians and Indonesians are going to wait for the Chinese?  Not on your life.  They're making all-time record profit per acre in palm oil with potash prices of $525 per ton.  They're not asking about price.  They're asking about, please cover us for this demand that we have.  And it's an explosive demand, so it's a completely different market than 2006.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Two things.  Just one theoretical question, then a cost one.  Bill, when you look at how different the outlook is versus where it's been and you think about the balance between annual contracts and spot -- two-part question, are annual contracts still good for Potash Corp?  And second, is the overall mix of contract versus spot where you think it should be for sort of these new realities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that, Mark, I would say yes.  Certainly in the long run it's good to have that balance.  And that's how we look at this business.  In the short term last year, would we've preferred not to have China and India versus what was going to spot, obviously we would have preferred those to be spot markets.  But over the long term, these things tend to balance and so when you look at the shipping requirements alone for markets that are that size, it just becomes very important to have some sort of stability in your system.  And I think it works, so I'd say the answer to both of your questions is yes.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Art Gray of Raymond James.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  This may be more of a question for your economists, but one of the things I haven't heard discussed much on this call is the shortage in water throughout the world.  Just an example, Saudi Arabia, you may have seen this yesterday, talked about the fact that they are currently 100% deficient with wheat.  They will in 2015 import 100% of their wheat to conserve water. The Chinese have some of the worst water conditions in the world.  My point is, it appears so many countries are choosing now to import grains to allow a better use of their water.  What are your thoughts on this and what that means for prices going forward in the commodities themselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a big question.  We could spend about three days talking about that one, but we share with you the concern for water around the world, fresh water, specifically aquifers for food production.  What I would tell you is that Potash fertilizer is a real good way to &#x2013; to have your potassium levels up in the soil is a real good way to help you overcome drought and stress due to lack of water at particular times during the growing season.  So any drought year you will see properly fertilized farms, that have got their potassium levels in the right order, have a huge advantage over those that tend to scrimp.  We are seeing quite a bit of good progress in triple stack and future stacking of genes in corn to take some of that risk of drought out of corn production. Monsanto's doing a real good job there.  We're paying very close attention to what they're doing, but clearly proper fertility is a real good answer to water shortages in growing seasons.  You're always going to need water to grow a crop though.  There's just no doubt about that.  It takes water to get the seed to germinate, and to get it out of the ground.  It takes the fuel of fertilizer to get that seed growing, so that combination is a powerful one, but a big subject, a big issue, and we pay very close attention to it, Art.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm glad I'm squeezing in.  Just in the global picture of logistics, you elegantly described the freight rates coming off which is absolutely true obviously, but globally and from your point of view, do you think with the record third record volumes, you will have it easier globally?  Are there any issues that your team is seeing as possibly logistical issues of being able &#x2013; either the ports, or the transportation rail, or the shipping that can cause more mishaps, and inventories not being built at the right places?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question Terry, it's one we spent a lot of time on both in Canpotex and in our own shop here as it applies to the domestic market.  We're in very good shape from a logistics point of view.  We've been kind of ahead of the curve.  We were building, for example, a port in Portland when everybody said, what the heck are you doing that for?  You don't need it.  And of course, we just put an expansion in out of Portland and we inaugurated that at the last Canpotex board meeting. So we are also in the process in Canpotex of looking at a new Greenfield site, so we will -- we'll either have two or three facilities; we may expand one facility on the west coast or have an additional Greenfield facility. We haven't made that final decision; should be made by the middle of this year. But there again, to stay ahead of the game, we have been adding rail cars to our fleet. In the Canpotex fleet, we've just got a thousand car build that's going to be completed by April of this year, so that gets us up to 4,500 cars, and these are new cars, state-of-the-art, specifically designed for potash.  The railroads have been doing a better job lately.  We haven't had the, of course the weather issues that we had last year with landslides and avalanches and -- we just had one problem after another last year, so they've been doing a better job.  I'd take both into the domestic market and to the export market, but this is an issue that occupies a lot of our time and we try to stay ahead of it.  In terms of ocean freights, I think you're going to see a pop back up in ocean freights.  Again, I think we're into a lull now, but I think you're going to see some pretty extraordinary movements and therefore a rebound for the balance of 2008. And I don't think you're going to see a real consistent softening until 2009 in ocean freights, so we're trying to take advantage of this lull in the market to do some things. But this is a huge issue, and when you think about new entrants, people talk about coming into the potash business, and I'm listening to some pretty good promoters.  But, one of the things you've got to think about is how you get this stuff shipped?  And to have a terminal, and where are you going to build it? And the rail lines and the cars that are involved, so when we talk about $2.5 billion for a new potash mine, that's just within the plant gate.  You get outside of that plant gate, you have enormous infrastructure costs, and the time to do that and just to physically find the location for a terminal when the best locations are taken, that's another barrier to entry that not a whole lot of people think about. So we're clued to our logistics, Terry, and we think it's obviously going to be more and more important as time goes on.</p>
