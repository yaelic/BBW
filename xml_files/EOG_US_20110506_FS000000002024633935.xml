          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources First Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2011 earnings and operational results.</p>
          <p>This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.</p>
          <p>This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.</p>
          <p>Effective January 1, 2010, the SEC now permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast including those for the Eagle Ford may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page at our website.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP, Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations; Bill Thomas, Senior EVP, Exploitation; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice-President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night and we included second quarter and full-year guidance in yesterday's press release. I'll now review our first quarter net income and cash flow followed by our operational highlights. Tim Driggers will then provide some financial details. Then I'll provide some macro and hedging comments along with concluding remarks.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter, EOG reported net income of $134 million or $0.52 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain one-time adjustments as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter adjusted net income was $177 million or $0.68 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $947 million.</p>
          <p>I'll now discuss our 2011 business plan and operational results. Our business plan continues to be consistent and straightforward. We're rapidly making the organic conversion to a liquids based company by exploiting our world-class North American horizontal oil positions while still preserving 100% of our large North American natural gas resource play assets and maintaining a low net debt-to-cap ratio.</p>
          <p>As our first quarter results indicate, the plan is working just like we drew it up on a chalkboard four years ago. We have invested the majority of our capital in very high reinvestment rate of return domestic oil development projects, which will ultimately flow through our net income and show up as superior ROEs and ROCEs. We're very comfortable regarding our 2011 goal of approximately $1 billion of asset sales, which will help maintain low debt ratios.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we received $260 million from property dispositions and asset sales. Since March 31, we have received an additional $387 million of proceeds and we're actively working on an incremental $400 million of sales, so this goal is well in hand. In the first quarter, total company production averaged 14% year-over-year, total company liquids increased 47%, and unit costs remained in line. Although our second quarter oil estimate has been significantly affected by flooding and ice storms in our North Dakota Bakken and Manitoba Waskada fields and major electricity outages impacting our North Dakota Bakken operations, there's no change to our full-year production growth targets of 9% for total company and 49% for total liquids. This is reflected in last night's guidance.</p>
          <p>I want to repeat a comment that I made on a previous quarterly call. At the current 23 to 1 crude oil to natural gas price ratio, I believe the overall production growth yardstick is somewhat meaningless. In today's world, the metrics of liquids production growth and product mix change should be the focus since cash flow, returns and earnings will follow liquids growth, and that's how we have defined EOG's strategy.</p>
          <p>I'll now discuss several of our key plays beginning with the Eagle Ford. I'll start with an editorial comment. I believe Wall Street continues to undervalue our Eagle Ford oil position. Perhaps the undervaluation is disbelief at the sheer size of this on-shore position. Not many people can believe the fact that we have captured a 900 million barrel oil equivalent net after royalty position consisting of 77% oil and 11% NGLs with very high reinvestment rates of return. I can't think of a single company, independent or major, who has captured this size net oil accumulation in the on-shore lower 48 in the past 40 years. We're in the first inning of developing this asset, and just like the Bakken, this is becoming one of the hottest plays in North America.</p>
          <p>EOG, by moving early, has captured the largest acreage position in the crude oil window. We're the biggest producer from the oil window, with net production of 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent at the end of the first quarter. Our press release contains multiple individual well results, so rather than providing a well-by-well recitation, I will provide some context regarding the overall play. There are three key points: first, we are currently drilling with 18 rigs. Simply put, we continue to have 100% success with our drilling results. We have now drilled enough wells throughout our 520,000 net acre spread to feel very comfortable that all the acreage is good.</p>
          <p>Our most recent success is in a new fault block identified on 3D seismic at the northeastern most end of our acreage where the Hill Unit #2 well tested at 1,233-barrel oil per day initial rate. The results from the wells we've drilled across our entire acreage position are very consistent: the wells in the northeast and center portions of our acreage IP at between 800 and 1,500 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas while the southwest wells IP at 600 to 800 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas.</p>
          <p>As with any resource play, the wells exhibit a steep decline the first few years and ultimately level out at 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day over the long term. Our per well reserve estimates are unchanged from our previous estimate between 430,000 and 460,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty.</p>
          <p>Second, project economics have improved with oil prices and our ongoing focus on cost-efficiencies. Last quarter I quoted 65% to 110% direct after-tax un-levered reinvestment rates of return using current well costs. Using the current NYMEX oil strip, the per well economics are 95% to 140% direct after tax.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we still expect to further improve these economics by decreasing well costs from the current $6 million target to our goal of $5 million by 2012 with our self-sourced fracs. When combined with the size of the prize, this bodes huge for EOG's future profitability. Over time, we will invest between $10 billion and $15 billion developing this asset. Again, I cannot think of another E&amp;P company or for that matter any company in any industry who has captured this magnitude of a very high return reinvestment opportunity.</p>
          <p>And third, last quarter I mentioned two Eagle Ford logistics issues: the lack of both frac proppant availability and crude oil take away capacity. These problems still exist, but so far neither has bitten us. Proppant availability is still hand to mouth existence, but we have arranged for some temporary fixes until our self-sourced sand arrives later this year. Regarding crude oil take away capacity, we have installed a crude by rail facility. We are currently moving 4,000 barrels of oil per day and expect to be moving 20,000 barrels of oil per day of Eagle Ford oil by rail by year-end. The concept is the same as our highly successful Bakken crude by rail program where we were moving on average 40,000 barrels of per day.</p>
          <p>Shifting to the Bakken, we continue to be the largest North Dakota oil producer and registered our typical great results from first quarter wells. As with the Eagle Ford, I won't go into a well-by-well recitation, but will instead provide an overview. We are currently running 10 rigs and are having consistently good results, i.e., 100% success across our 600,000 acres. Aggregate, direct economics in the Bakken are 40% to 50% after tax. Currently the Bakken is our largest crude oil component and will continue to be until Eagle Ford surpasses it in a few years.</p>
          <p>Our Barnett combo play is also performing well. We did have weather hurdles during the first quarter with freeze offs and associated downtime. We expanded our core position to 185,000 net acres. We are running 11 rigs and are achieving good results in both eastern and western portions of the core area encompassing Cooke and Montague Counties, at our $3 million well cost, the typical direct ATRORs here are 40% to 60%.</p>
          <p>In the Permian basis, we had further success in Irion and Crockett Counties in our Wolfcamp play where we are running two rigs. Two wells are the Munson 2701H and the University 43-1001H, which had 30-day production averages of 330 and 440 barrels of oil per day with 400 to 700 Mcf a day of rich gas respectively. The Wolfcamp is in the early stages of optimization. We recently completed the University 40-1404H well using a different type frac. The well is currently producing 624 barrels of oil per day with 539 Mcf per day showing good results. We have proven up 44,000 of our 120,000 acres, and by year-end, we'll have the remaining 76,000 acres tested. This area contains multiple separate Wolfcamp pay horizons so we're excited about the ultimate potential here.</p>
          <p>Also in the Permian Basin, we're running one rig in our Leonard shale horizontal play and continue to have positive results such as the Vaca 14-5H well which averaged 476 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 million cubic feet a day of rich gas for the first 15 days. We're executing our Leonard development at a relatively slow pace because we don't have the lease exploration issues that we have in other areas.</p>
          <p>In our DJ Basin Niobrara oil play, recent results have shifted my feeling regarding the play from cautious to optimistic. We have made great strides in improving our understanding of the play on our 80,000 net acre Hereford Ranch field where production is 4,000 barrels of oil per day net. During the remainder of the year, we'll test other portions of our 220,000 total net acres. Industry results today have been mixed, but we feel pretty good that we've got a significant oil play to develop. However, it will be year-end before we can provide you a reserve estimate.</p>
          <p>I'll now discuss a play and acreage position we haven't previously disclosed. We have 138,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and feel this acreage is prospective in multiple pay horizons. To date we have concentrated a one-rig program drilling wells in Campbell County, Wyoming. So far we have drilled eight successful horizontal wells in the Turner sandstone. A typical well is the Crossbow 7-06 H, which had a 30-day average rate of 275 barrels of oil per day with 100 barrels per day of NGLs and 2 million cubic feet a day of gas. We'll be testing other intervals on this acreage later this year and in 2012.</p>
          <p>The last oil play I'll discuss is our Waskada horizontal field in Manitoba. Our Canadian crude oil production grew 47% year-over-year in the first quarter due to further field development. During the first quarter we drilled 47 wells and obtained an average IP of 240 barrels of oil per day from this program. Production will remain flat during the second and third quarters due to flooding and spring breakup. Production growth will resume in the fourth quarter when we put more wells online. This area continues to generate 100% direct after tax rates of return.</p>
          <p>Turning to the dry gas side of our ledger, we're focusing essentially all natural gas investments in areas where we have to drill to hold acreage, the Marcellus, Haynesville, and to a lesser extent the Horn River. In the Marcellus, we have added another data point from our 50,000 net acres in Bradford County, Using our new frac design, the Guinan #2H tested at 9 million cubic feet per day. This complements the Hoppaugh 3H well that we reported last quarter with a 14 million a day IP rate and provides further confirmation that our acreage is quite good. We have 100% working interest in both wells.</p>
          <p>In the Haynesville, we have increased our sweet spot holdings by 7,000 net acres with average 8.5 drilling rigs this year and we're achieving expected results. In Nacogdoches County, the Kurth #1 IP'd at a restricted rate of 16 million a day with 8,800 PSI flowing pressure from the Haynesville. In St. Augustine County, the Sunrise #1 well IP'd at a restricted rate of 12 million cubic feet a day with 8,600 PSI from the Bossier formation. We continue to make good progress in reducing completed well costs with a 12% reduction in our Nacogdoches and St. Augustine County program in the first quarter versus our 2010 results.</p>
          <p>In British Columbia, our Kitimat LNG project continues to make progress. The two key commercial items that will determine ultimate project viability are the detailed project cost estimate, which is underway, and securing oil indexed off-take contracts. I continue to be optimistic regarding this project, but I think it will be year-end or first quarter 2012 before we can determine if this project is a definite go.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $15.6 million. For the first quarter 2011, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.58 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment expenditures were $160 million. At first quarter end 2011, total debt outstanding was $5.2 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 31%. At March 31st, we had $1.7 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $3.5 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 23%. On a GAAP reporting basis, the effective tax rate for the first quarter was 41% and the deferred tax ratio was 34%.</p>
          <p>Yesterday we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for second quarter and updated full-year 2011. For the second quarter, the effective tax range is 35% to 50%. For the full year 2011, the effective tax range is 35% to 45%.</p>
          <p>We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. For each $1 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price combined with the related change in NGL price, the sensitivity is approximately $25 million for net income and $36 million for operating cash flow. EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas prices is approximately $16 million for net income and $23 million for operating cash flow excluding any impacts from swaptions.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss hedging and provide his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim. Now I'll discuss our views regarding macro and hedging. Regarding crude oil, we still like both the short and long-term supply demand fundamentals, although guessing which way short-term oil prices will move is a speculative call. We're currently 27% hedged June through December of this year at a $97 price, and for 2012 we're approximately 6% hedged at a $107 price. We continue to have a one to three cautionary view regarding North American natural gas prices but believe in the 2014 plus time period, natural gas markets will balance as gas power generation demand increases.</p>
          <p>Our hedges are consistent with our macro view. We're approximately 48% hedged at a $4.90 price for June through December this year. Additionally, we sold options at a $4.73 price that if exercised would mean we're 86% hedged through year-end. For 2012, we're approximately 38% hedged at a $5.44 price with options that if exercised would increase to a 69% hedge level at a $5.44 price.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are six important points to take away from this call. First, our shift from a natural gas to a liquids company is essentially complete. At current prices, we expect approximately 70% of our North American revenue to emanate from crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids as opposed to 30% from natural gas. A large majority of the liquids are oil and not NGLs.</p>
          <p>Second, all of our oil plays are on shore North America with the vast majority in the U.S. All of this oil is sweet, good quality, and highly desired by refineries.</p>
          <p>Third, our reinvestment rates of return are very strong. I think they're the best in the industry led by the Eagle Ford.</p>
          <p>Fourth, during my visits with shareholders, I'm often asked about industry capital allocation. We recently tabulated 2010 actual and 2011 projected North American gas production for all mid- and large-cap public independent E&amp;Ps. EOG is practically the only company who is not growing North American gas volumes in this oversupplied market. This is truly amazing to me. For investors who focus on the efficacy of capital allocation this should be a positive discriminator in EOG's favor.</p>
          <p>Fifth, for the first time, we've introduced our Powder River Basin acreage position where we've already drilled eight consecutive successful wells. And sixth, we're on track to execute our 2011 capital expenditure program while maintaining low net debt.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Scott Wilmoth, Simmons and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Looking at your Eagle Ford rail facility, is that crude coming to the Gulf Coast? And how do the transportation costs compare to trucking your crude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scott. Good morning. Yeah. The crude by rail that we're moving from the Eagle Ford is either &#x2013; it's currently either going into the Beaumont area or into the Louisiana area. So it is currently getting a price that is a hybrid between WTI and LLS. And compared to the trucking opportunities where you're not going to end up at those end markets there's a very significant difference right now. The crude takeaway continues to be a very, very large problem in the Eagle Ford and as Eagle Ford production grows it's going to just get worse, I believe, in terms of crude takeaway. And so this rail system that we hastily put in is probably going to turn out to be a very profitable item for us similar to what we have done in the Bakken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And then next on the Eagle Ford well spacing, I know at the analyst day you guys were saying anywhere from 125 to 140. Can you give us an update on that? And then what percentage of your acreage have you tested on that spacing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on I guess overall question here, Scott, what percentage of our acreage have we tested, we'd say we've tested 100% of our acreage with wells. In terms of the spacing, we're still doing some work to determine what the optimum spacing is. The range of wells we'll need to drill is still somewhere between 2,100 and maybe 2,800 wells depending on how the spacing plays out. But that's probably going to be another couple quarters before we can definitely say the spacing is x.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today will come from Leo Mariani, RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning here, guys. Just a quick question on asset sales. Just trying to get a sense of a little bit more color on what these $387 million in asset sales were for the quarter, if there was any production associated with that? And then just any thoughts you guys might have on the $400 million in pending asset sales. What are those? And what sort of target here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the $380 million of asset sales that we announced basically year-to-date in the second quarter were all long-lived gas producing properties, fairly mature producing properties. The biggest portion of that was some Cotton Valley production, Cotton Valley/Travis Peak production in the East Texas area. And we also sold some production in the New Mexico area.</p>
          <p>And if you take a look at what we produced in terms of gas production in U.S. gas production in the first quarter, I believe it was 1,134 million cubic feet a day. And then I think our midpoint for the second quarter is 1096. Don't hold me to that number. I don't have it in front of me. But that kind of shows an approximate amount of what we sold that we would expect in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As to the remaining sales for the rest of the year, it's going to be a combination of some mid-stream assets, some just raw acreage, and some additional producing properties. Does that give you enough color there, Leo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Yeah, that was very good color there</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Leo, this is Maire. The year-to-date asset sales was $647 million, but really $387 million was subsequent to the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Got you. Okay. Just looking at your CapEx for the quarter, I guess if I sort of add in kind of your total spending on some of the infrastructure as well, you guys are at about $1.72 billion. Just of kind of on a run rate basis if I were to sort of multiply that by 4, I think that gets you between $6.8 billion and $6.9 billion for the year. Just curious as to whether or not you had disproportionately high infrastructure expenses in the first quarter and any comments on cost creep that may have hit you and kind of how you think CapEx plays out for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we still believe the CapEx number mid-range is roughly $6.5 billion for the full year. Part of what we'll see in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, is the impact of some of our self-sourced sand, particularly in the Eagle Ford division on our frac. So we'd expect our well cost to go down. So the first quarter run rate isn't, you can't really multiply that by four to get there.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost creep, we're seeing cost creep clearly in the service sector, and you heard that from practically everybody who has done an earnings call. The biggest proportion of cost creep is the frac jobs, as it was last year. So it's incumbent upon us to move to the self-sourced fracs where I think we'll have a differential advantage relative to others in the industry, and we are moving that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Mark, just first question is in terms of the new PRB play and also in the horizontal Niobrara play, what are your current costs per well and where do you expect them to be when you get into development mode? And then what's your best guess in terms of EURs per well now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the cost on the Powder River, the Turner, yeah, we started out there. It was right at $6 million per well. We're getting those now down to $5.5 million. So, yes, we would expect maybe to trim a little bit more off of those costs in a program mode. And in the Niobrara, we've got a couple of plays there within the Niobrara and more in the fracture play our cost is around $3.6 million per well. And when we get into the matrix play, it's in the $6 million. We would expect to be able to bring that down in the $5 million to $5.5 million range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the EUR per well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Turner itself, it's a little too soon to tell. We've given you a pie chart I think in the IR slide that went out last night that shows that it's about 45% liquids, 55% gas, but that's for the full reserve life of the well. And obviously we've had to do an internal model to come up with those numbers. It's a higher liquids yield in the first couple of years. And as in all these retrograde condensate type plays that yield will come down over time. But we're modeling a variety of EURs per well, but something in the 350 to 400 per well gross is our walking around number right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and on the Niobrara, we just, it's a bit too soon to give you an estimate on per well reserves on there. The Niobrara is clearly a more complicated play, and I'd say our degree of understanding is not yet sufficiently strong where we feel comfortable giving either an overall reserve estimate on our captured acreage or a per well basis. That's probably going to have to wait until the end of the year</p>

          <p>Hey, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, as you highlighted in your comments, you are implying a big ramp-up of oil production in the third and fourth quarters. That can certainly make sense if there is a weather impacted wall of oil offline waiting to come back when those weather issues subside. Can you try to quantify the impacts that the weather issues in the Bakken and Waskada are having on your current production in terms of what may be shut in or the extent of the potential that would be in backlog by the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A wall of oil, that's a good way to characterize it there. You know, specifically I'll give you a little color as to what's happened to us particularly in the second quarter. The second quarter we had flooding that affected us both in the Waskada and in the Bakken, and this was just simply high water where we couldn't have our pumpers access wells to physically maintain them. And then last weekend, we had in North Dakota a very severe late season ice and high wind storm that snapped literally hundreds of thousands of power lines in the area of Williston as well as our field area. And so we're pretty much without electricity. The power companies are trying to restore it, but obviously, they're giving first priority to things like the city of Williston, the hospitals, the schools, the residential. And then we were kind of one of the later priorities to get it out into the field operations. So we don't really know how long the power outages are going to last.</p>
          <p>What's loaded into our estimate for the second quarter for our oil estimate is we're assuming that we're going to get hit for the entire month of May with some pretty significant power outages that are going to affect our North Dakota production. And I know if you just look at the ramp-up that we'll need in the third and fourth quarter to get us to our full-year target, it looks like a pretty steep ramp-up. And I don't want to give you a specific quantifications, but what I can tell you is that the third and fourth quarter, the ramp-ups in terms of where are they going to come from, in the Bakken you're clearly going to have a snapback of production in the third and fourth quarter relative to what we're going to achieve in the second quarter just as we get these weather issues and downtime eliminated.</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; but the biggest single driver of production growth is going to be the Eagle Ford. And, we have articulated a series of wells there in the Eagle Ford, and in our press release. But I would just say obviously the more wells we drill with 100% success, that turn out as we predicted, the higher our degree of confidence is getting that the production target in Eagle Ford is quite achievable.</p>
          <p>And then we also articulated in the Barnett combo play that we're having pretty good success there. And so that's going to be a driver also. So those three plays Eagle Ford first, snap back in the Williston basin area, Bakken area, and then the combo play, that's going to be our main drivers of the production growth in the second half. There will be contributions from the Permian basin, the mid-continent and from Canada. But because our pace of activities in those areas and the number of rigs we're employing is not nearly as high or the contributions there are not going to be, all that great in relative terms compared to the first three plays that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>So punch line is &#x2013; and I guess let me put it this way. We had a cushion on our oil estimate for the full year of 55% year-over-year going into the second quarter. We had a little bit of fat in our estimate. And this second quarter down time has pretty much consumed that little cushion. So we're still comfortable with our estimate, but we don't have the cushion that we once had due to these weather issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And &#x2013; that's very helpful. Thanks. Secondly you said last quarter regarding proprietary completion methods in the Niobrara. This quarter, you mentioned a new completion in the Marcellus. Are any of these related? Are you doing things differently in terms of completion technique across plays that's having a material impact on economics, and can you put that into context in terms of what that can mean both for the two plays and for the ability to unlock any additional plays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, what we can say about that is, yes, you're right. We are using different completion techniques, specifically, design for each play. And they vary widely from area to area. In the Marcellus, we have done one thing that's made tremendous differences in our wells, and we're experimenting with new techniques in the Niobrara, and we have multiple play types in the Niobrara. And so each play type has a specific completion technique that is proprietary to EOG and we can't really talk much about the details, but we work really hard gathering the data, analyzing the data and continuing to refine our completion techniques for each play. And so they're very specific and it's working out really good for the company</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, just to give a little more color on that, obviously, there's been mixed results from the Niobrara from various companies in the industry whereas, you heard fairly consistent results on EOG's results in the Niobrara. And then in the Wolfcamp, as I kind of read some of the earnings data that has come out here from other companies, you're getting, kind of, mixed results from other companies in the Wolfcamp, whereas, EOG, we're pretty well nailing it in the Wolfcamp. You know, every well is good, and we think getting better. And I really think this goes back to EOG being first mover in these plays.</p>
          <p>I continue to believe that we are number one in technology in horizontal oil plays. That means finding them before everybody else, and it means figuring out how to complete the wells and frac them most efficiently. And I just think the Wolfcamp example is just the latest in a long string of cases where EOG wells are better than results from other companies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I kind of want to drill down a little bit of Niobrara. I mean, from what I hear, it's a sorting out process and even you mentioned there are various sub-plays and the cost for drilling a fracture well versus matrix well is quite a bit different. So just trying to get a sense as to, number one, Mark, why do you feel optimistic as there's definitely different usage of adjective from before? And how can we look at this play? Is it going to be a core area, non-core? Is it going to be sort of patchy depending on the specific geology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's too early to say really about the full extent of the Niobrara. We're in the process of drilling multiple wells, on step out wells, on our acreage. Then the Hereford Ranch, we've had very encouraging results both in the fracture type play and in the matrix type play. And so that's what gives us the encouragement. And we see those characteristics really in many of our, much of our acreage. So we're in the process of gathering data. We have some very proprietary techniques to evaluate the particular play types, and we've got some techniques that we're trying on the completion side that at least at this point in the development of the play, they're getting really positive results. So that's what gives us the encouragement as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you &#x2013; it seems like the matrix plays are more expensive than the sort of fracture play. Is that correct? And if that's the case, would you favor the more fractured zones, or is it too early to tell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the plays are different in that the matrix plays will have a higher resource recovery. And so you're able to drill more wells per acre or per section. But the economics really on both play types we think are going to be very strong. So we want to pursue our acreage and our techniques and match all that together to maximize the reserve recovery of our acreage. So we feel positive and very encouraged about both types as we go forward</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Biju, we said we had 138,000 net acres in the Powder and we're really mapping and working up six independent targets. Four of those are sand stones including this Turner that we're doing most of our drilling on so far, and the other three are these upper cretaceous so called halo plays that others have talked about which we do think are a prospective of a portion our acres. And we have a couple shale plays and one of those is in fact the Niobrara. We are intending to test the Niobrara either late this year or early next year. Waiting on permits in a couple of areas. We certainly see prospectivity in the Niobrara in that basin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so can you talk about once you bring in the self-sourced frac solution how much you expect to save and the timing of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the self-source, the frac fleets, we have quite a number of the frac fleets in place right now. What we're doing is sourcing our own proppant, and generally we're doing that through contracts. We've got one sand mine in place, and we're working to bring another online. And that will be near first of year 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so if I sort of take this first quarter CapEx, it looks like the run rate is a little higher than the annual budget. Are you factoring in some savings or &#x2013; I mean, I would imagine the second half completion pace would have to pick up to meet the production numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just depends on which play. For example, in the combo, we're really going to be running less rigs in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. So all I can say on the CapEx is we expect to achieve the number that we're showing in the guidance last night.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last question on the rail line in the Eagle Ford. Is 20,000 the max capacity or is there plans to build that out further, and is there a CapEx number here too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we did in this rail line at Eagle Ford, it's &#x2013; I don't want to use the word makeshift, but it's one we put together in a 30-day period. It's realizing the criticalness of the take-away for crude oil in the Eagle Ford. We knew we couldn't basically take an eight or nine-month period to get a rail line &#x2013; crude by rail constructed as we did in North Dakota, so we just took our learnings from North Dakota and said what can we get together on a temporary basis that's going to cover us, and so it's not obvious to me that we'll end up with north of 20,000 barrels a day capacity by year-end. And whether we decide to permanently run that rail line or not is something we'll have to sort out.</p>
          <p>As you remember, what we're trying to do is bridge the gap between today and mid-2012. Mid-2012 is when enterprise is supposed to have that big inch oil pipeline going down pretty much the heart of our acreage position. So we're just &#x2013; in other words if we were to invest the capital right now and say let's build a real, true, absolutely permanent crude by rail facility there, it's not certain that we'd be needing it post mid-2012. So the amount of capital we spent on this rail system is pretty de minimis, less than $10 million. So it's not a big capital consuming item and it's really, it should be viewed, at least right now, as an alternative to the trucking that gets us to a higher price end user market &#x2013; refinery market, if you will.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've got a couple of unrelated ones. Mark, in terms of your total well count right now or rig count, rather, how much is horizontal in total that you're going to spud this year versus vertical</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We get currently 72 rigs, and as we mentioned last quarter, we'll be running probably the average 75 to 78 rigs. And of that, I would say 80% of that is going to be horizontal. Go head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pulling a number out of the air, I might even say 85% or 90%. It's pretty rare when we drill a vertical well anymore, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's what I thought. I was just confirming. What about lateral lengths are? Are you going longer or are your frac stages increasing? How have you changed your well designs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going with longer laterals. For instance, in the Bakken, probably 75% or 80% of those wells are going to be the 1280s or 10,000-foot laterals. We drilled as long as 14,000-foot laterals there. And that's just kind of been the trend in most of our areas. And, yes, when you go with the longer laterals, you have larger completions, additional stages, and additional proppant requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are your drilling time efficiencies offsetting some of the completion costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's how we are, in addition to us doing the self-sourcing and also us sourcing our own proppant, etcetera, for our stimulation jobs. But, for instance, in the Haynesville, we have reduced our days by about 20%, and we have also continued to alter our stimulations there. So we've reduced our well cost there from the start of the year by somewhere between 15% and 18%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last one from me. You had some of your competitors talk about being more integrated. You just mentioned that you're mining your own sand as proppant. Does that work for you, or just as a business model, it doesn't make sense to you to be more integrated on the services side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, we're certainly not going to integrate ourselves to the tune of buying drilling rigs. That's not at all what we're considering. On the frac side, what we have been doing in the Barnett both in the Barnett gas and the combo areas for the last three or four years is, we have been using our own mined sand and using what third-party contract pumping companies, not necessarily the majors, and going that route as opposed to building our own frac pumps and manning our own frac pumps. So we have a business model that seems to work for us. It's worked in the Barnett for the past four years. And that's what we're really looking at doing most everywhere is, not having the frac pumps owned by EOG but having a third party operate those, kind of contracting them kind of like we contract drilling rigs, and have us provide the proppant to those particular pumps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, I remember when you helped start some of the companies, you talked about that a few years back. I was just wondering if you were going to increase the scale just given how you're operating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I mean the scale in terms of the fracs, I mean, we're, the frac generally is roughly 50% of any of these resource play costs &#x2013; total well costs, 50%. And that's the piece we're really attacking to say we have to get control of our frac costs and not be dependent on the traditional service companies if we're going to be the cost leader in this resource play business. And I think we're quite a bit ahead of most everybody else on where we're moving on that piece of the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, we &#x2013; as I kind of stated in my editorial comment there, I don't believe the 900 million barrels is even remotely captured in our current stock price, and so if we were to say, wow, we have a new fault block and it increased our barrels from 900 to X, I'll consider doing that if and when I see the 900 million barrels that we already have reflected in the stock price. So don't look for us to make any adjustments to the 900 million barrels based on one well, one fault block, or anything like that. But obviously, it's an area that we hadn't given any credit to and then we found it on the 3D seismic and drilled it, and right now this Eagle Ford is turning out to be one of those things that you almost have to pinch yourself and say, you know, this is too good to be true. You know, 100% success rate across 120 miles is just phenomenal. So that's a good non-answer to your question, but that's the explanation I'll give you, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I'll take that for now. And then just over on the Niobrara, wondering if you'd be willing to comment. There have been some challenges discussed by industry participants between completing wells in the fractured area and the matrix area. Just wondering if you'd be willing to comment on any progress you've made overcoming some of those challenges or coming up with solutions to address those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, I think we're just not quite sure how much the two type of completion techniques are integrated and how they're competing yet. So we're just really gathering data on all that. We're doing micro seismic and other techniques to determine and figure out how those plays work. So I'd say we're just really too early to say much about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, I mean the one thing we will offer up there is that there seem to be a couple different play types, fracture versus matrix, and it's really leading us to two distinctly different completion types, depending on where we are in the Niobrara. So that's what's made it a little bit harder and slower for us to really kind of get a handle on what kind of an oil field we really have captured here, because it's &#x2013; we kind of have night and day completion techniques depending on which particular type of rock we are attacking with that particular well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you able to understand the type of rock you're going to be completing based on seismic or some sort of mapping? Or how do you determine going in which completion technique you're going to be able to use on a well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just say right now we think we have a proprietary edge on our understanding of the Niobrara, and we really don't want to give any more of it away on this call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>And next we hear from Richard Dearnley with Longport Partners. Mr. Dearnley, your line is open. Please go ahead. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Hearing no response, we'll move to David Tameron, Wells Fargo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Couple questions. If I just look at the acreage positions, it looks like you have sold down your Niobrara, you're at 220 net now? Is that the right number? And then similar in the &#x2013; you sold down 70,000 or so in the Eagle Ford. Is that accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in the Eagle Ford, that's not accurate. When we talk about the 520,000, that's how much is in the oil window. And then we've got roughly another 70,000 that's in either the wet gas or the dry gas window. So there's been no change in our aggregate Eagle Ford acreage position. In the Niobrara, yeah, we have sold a bit of acreage there, and that's &#x2013; really didn't want to, but this is part of what we need to do to raise the $1 billion in property sales for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then if you think about the Wolfcamp, can you talk about from our perspective modeling etcetera, what decline rate should we be thinking about? I know it's early, but what have you seen from these wells? Can you just give us some color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we have so far in Wolfcamp are six wells with completions, and five of those we have online long enough that we can do good 30-day averages with some confidence. Of those five, we actually talk about four of them on the IR slide, I believe, and they averaged about 350 barrels of oil per day. The one that didn't make the slide was an earlier, shorter lateral that averaged about 190 barrels of oil per day in its first 30 days. The decline rates are kind of similar to what we're seeing in a lot of these oil plays. They're fairly steep in the first few months, and then they tend to flatten out. We've given you in the past I think 270 MBOEs or 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty per well is the number that we're working with right now. And I'd say that based on these first four wells, we're pretty confident that we can hit at least that. In fact, they're a little bit above the curve at present.</p>
          <p>And then we've also given you a breakdown that shows about 55% oil and 23% NGLs for a total of 78% liquids over the life of that, and only 22% gas. So I would say in terms of decline curves, they're not dissimilar to our other oil plays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, I'd give a little more color in addition to what Loren said on the Wolfcamp. We're particularly enthused about the Wolfcamp, our 120,000 acres, and if you look back, I believe it was our previous quarter's IR presentation, we quoted kind of a direct IRR on that after tax of roughly 25% I believe. And if you just looked at the numbers, you'd say, well the Wolfcamp is a lower return play than the rest of our oil plays. What that 25% represents is stage one of optimization on the Wolfcamp. We think that we can easily beat down the costs on the Wolfcamp play, particularly with self-sourced sand in that particular play and probably get higher reserves. So I guess what we'd say is we're in the first half inning of the Wolfcamp. If we're in the first inning of the Eagle Ford game, we're in the first half inning on the Wolfcamp, and the data we see today tells us that we can turn this into a rate of return play that's probably similar to the Bakken or the combo, once we get into some kind of optimization mode on it.</p>
          <p>But for the rest of this year what we're going to be doing in the Wolfcamp is exploring so that we've got at least one well down in pretty much all the portions of our 120,000 acres. Right now we're only concentrating on I believe it's 47,000 of those acres. And so we're going to be working on that, and then working on what can we do with both well costs, length of laterals, optimization to fracs? For example, the well I mentioned on the earnings call, the last well I mentioned there, we tried a completely different frac style than we had done on the first several fracs, and it looks like we have a better result based on early times. So I would say we rank Wolfcamp pretty high on our priority list. But it's really as far as a contributor to EOG volume growth and really getting into a drilling mode, that's going to be a 2012 event for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And operational update. We appreciate it. On the returns in the Eagle Ford, you mentioned the returns are 95% to 140% at the strip, but at a $6 million well cost. If well costs come down to $5 million, what does that do to the returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they're almost sinful to repeat. They're consistently north of 100% is what we can say. It makes a big difference to knock it from $6 million to $5 million. So that's why I'm so excited about the play, David, is we're looking at a play that at least on a direct basis is going to yield us north of 100% rate of return for $10 billion to $15 billion of investment. And if you think across every other single E&amp;P company in the world, I can't think of one who has got this sort of investment opportunity, particularly in a, let's say a relatively benign climate like Texas and the United States as opposed to some foreign country. And I really think that it's just people just haven't realized exactly what EOG has captured here. And again, I'm sorry I'm going off on an editorial comment, but you led me into it there when you said what happens with when the well cost gets knocked down $1 million a well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds like it could be its own company there. The self-sourcing and you mention the Wolfcamp wells, how much could well costs come down in your other plays self-sourcing fracing? You've talked a lot about how you're going to do it in the Eagle Ford. How many different plays can you self-source, and how much could costs come down in those plays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could &#x2013; we're looking at all of our large resource plays where we have got pattern drilling in completion. Right now we've got about 50% of our frac fleet that are the self-sourced or dedicated or day work sort of fleet. And we'd probably rather not say right now. We're still putting our interim sand in place, and then we've got the large mine that will be coming on late this year, first of the year. But it makes a significant impression on our cost. And when Mark mentions going from $6 million to $5 million, a big part of that is associated with the dedicated fleet and our own proppant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the same range of numbers roughly $1 million reduction is what we're envisioning for the Wolfcamp, for example, and right now our priorities for the self-sourced sands are first the Eagle Ford level. First of all, I mean, all of our Barnett stuff is currently self-sourced. But then in terms of new fields, Eagle Ford is first priority. Wolfcamp is probably second priority, Marcellus, probably third priority as we would see it today. And these will get melded in beginning late this year and then hopefully by mid-2012 we've got them all, all three of those areas working with the self-sourcing,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And can you remind us, it sounded like you didn't want to compare the trucking cost out of the Eagle Ford versus the new rail costs. But as we go from trucking, rail to ultimately pipeline, what's the approximate improvement in the costs per barrel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the first part of that, I mean, we'll give you a general number. You know, the rail versus the trucking current conditions, we're probably in Eagle Ford, we're probably gaining $4 to $5 a barrel versus trucking on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's cost and realizations combined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's cost and realizations combined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we're not getting full LLS price right now. We're having to share that with some terminal operators you know at the terminus of the line over there. Ultimately, the pipeline cost is going to be I guess a very pleasant relative to either the current rail or certainly the current trucking cost. And right now the pipeline terminus is basically the Houston area. So we'll be getting into the Houston ship channel, which &#x2013; oil prices today delivered at Houston ship channel are about midway between LLS and WTI on there. So at this juncture, the rail is &#x2013; it's not obvious the rail is going to be the long-term answer once that pipeline gets in. It looks like the pipeline will be the cheapest, David.</p>
