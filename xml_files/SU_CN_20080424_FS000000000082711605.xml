          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Suncor Energy Inc.'s First Quarter Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded today, I'm sorry Thursday, April 24, 2008 at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Rogers, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Good morning everyone and thanks for listening into our first quarter of 2008 conference call. In the room with me is Rick George, our President and CEO; Ken Alley, our CFO; Brenda Cherry, our VP, Controller; and <mark type="inaudible" /> from the Controllers' Department. I will follow the normal format. Rick will give a bit of an update how he is viewing the business. Ken will give an update on the financial side. I will give a short update in terms of the few modeling questions and then we will open to your questions. So Rick why don't you kick us off with the -- your update.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much, John. And I am very pleased to join you this morning and as we announced our first quarter results, earnings obviously just a little over $700 million, which is an all time record for us in terms of quarterly financial results, generated nearly 1.2 billion of cash flow. So obviously the big story in the quarter is oil prices. And of course these cash flows important to us over the next three years, next 36 months, as we use that cash flow to fund our very large Voyageur project, which I will talk a bit more in a moment.</p>
          <p>And although the financial results are satisfactory, we still obviously need to work very hard on our operational issues and particularly around the oil sands. The rest of the business on operations basis looks very steady. And by our standards, by anybody's standards, production of the oil sands plant in operation was less than expected in the first quarter. And obviously, we've been talking now for a pretty time about how important our operational excellence is, and we are working these issues very hard and do feel like we have a good feel about where we are. And we are kind of working ourselves out of a hole which I will talk about in more in a moment.</p>
          <p>One of the issues is of course as we bring on new assets trying to get all the components to work at exactly the same time is challenging, and even a little bit more difficult to predict on a go forward basis. And that does not take away from our base strategy. I am convinced, our strategy given the worldwide environment, we are in here for oil is still a great strategy. Execution has not been flawless. But on the other hand, we've got a team of people who are up for the challenge and that are ready to perform at a much higher level here after we get though the turnaround in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, if you take a look at our current situation, we certainly have the upgrading capacity. So we have the plant capacity. Our challenge here in the first quarter has been around bitumen supply. And you know we got hit in December 1st with the environmental control order on Firebag. And so we were capped at just over 40,000 barrels a day for Firebag. And you know, it has been very steady at Firebag. So, we have been very pleased with the operation there. It had a few small challenges, but in terms of -- I'm not concerned at all about that reservoir performing. We are averaging over 2000 barrels a day of bitumen per well pair. So it looks very solid. And as we move forward here, and I'll talk about it more in a moment as we're convinced that we'll continue to see higher and higher volumes from Firebag as we go forward and once we get the controller lifted.</p>
          <p>I think one of the key issues in the first quarter, I'm not trying to use this as an excuse, but we've had one of the coldest winters we've seen in a decade. And I was thinking about driving into work for those of you in New York, Toronto and other sunny climes, it was a minus five this morning in Calgary, snowing. And actually this week wasn't any better. Fort Mcmurray, they had half a meter of snow. And so this is one of those winters that just kind of won't go away. We are almost in May and still very much a winter scene around here.</p>
          <p>The winter was so cold during the -- up North this winter that we actually had a couple of shovels that actually cracked, so they were taken out of operation. So obviously doing a lot of juggling as you go through that. The mine wasn't a bottleneck, it was actually our extraction plant. And there we had a number of key issues. We had one or two supply -- that's steam supply disruptions from the power plant. And of course once you lose steam on these very tough conditions, it takes a while to come back.</p>
          <p>We've got some issues around the tailings lines and we've had higher erosion than we would have expected levels of, in the tailings pond which were quite high through this period. And a couple of other issues, really all centered on our extraction business. So, it's not in the mine, it's really not in Firebag's state of the control order and it's certainly not in the upgrade. We've had plenty of upgrading capacity, upgrading has actually just been pacing bitumen supply.</p>
          <p>So, just now, we've got a plan in place to correct these issues. You will not see a lot of this in the second quarter. April has not been a month that has seen a huge increase in volumes either. And of course we're heading here on May 16th, into a 28-day turnaround -- a planned turnaround on Upgrader Number One. And as you know, we have to take these units out every three or four years, do our maintenance and then bring them back up. This is a very routine turnaround and we will get a lot of the very final stages of our Millennium Coker Unit project done as well as a couple of other things done during this turnaround which will be key to us. But I'm not concerned about plant capacity, it's really around getting these extraction plant issues.</p>
          <p>So, this will be very much a year for Suncor where the third and fourth quarter will be our key quarters. We do know that, we will see increasing production as we go into the third and fourth quarter. We will certainly have an upgrader capacity as we go through the third and fourth quarter that goes up to 350,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>The question, and the big question for us, can we get enough bitumen to feed it? So, first of all on Firebag, we have been having very good, meaningful discussions with the government to end this control order. We've actually not had any exceedances except for when we had a power outage. We had two exceedances in one day since the controller's put on, so we've been in compliance since December. And, so we expect to -- there are hope to have this result soon. We should get these extraction plant issues behind this here in the next 60 to 90 days. And, then of course in the third quarter, we should get Petro-Canada volumes also headed across the plant. As we get all three of those, then our bitumen supply problems should ease. And we can &#x2013; then we can run this plant at full capacity. So, that's the game plan on a go forward basis, now out of a relief, expect the second quarter, third and fourth quarter, should look much, much stronger.</p>
          <p>So, let me just turn to our capital project side. And we got a lot going on in this company obviously with the Voyageur announcement on $20.6 billion. It's still early &#x2013; our early days on that, but the Voyageur Upgrader portion of this project is proceeding great, very nicely to-date. We are &#x2013; we have a site cleared. We're driving piles on a portion of the unit. Some of the deep undergrounds are actually already done. We've already spent $1.4 billion on that upgrader project alone. Engineerings at almost 50% complete, and it's very early days but, the site construction itself is about 4% complete.</p>
          <p>On Firebag, we have spent about $1.8 billion to-date. Stage 3 which is of course, is the first of four stages is 24% complete and obviously stages four, five and six to follow after that. There's lots of duplication in these stages as we go forward. So, that is very much on track. I was up at Firebag last week, and the activity levels there are quite high. So, everyone is good there. We're actually expecting first oil from Firebag Stage 3 right for tail-end of 2009. So, this will start to happen relatively, quickly compared with the Voyageur Upgrader.</p>
          <p>There are a number of other projects that are outlined in the capital portion of the quarterly report, you'll see those. I guess, the other one I'd note is the MCU project is coming to a close. That was one of our big questions over the last of years. Could you get that bigger project? That now looks like a small project. But could you get it done? It's largely done on time and within budget. So we are largely within budgets. So we feel very good about that. I'll just show you that our plant here around developing our major projects group supporting them well, the work they have done is paying off for us in a significant way.</p>
          <p>And so overall I'm very pleased with where we are on these capital projects. The start of Voyageur and the Firebag is off to a good start very early days. So don't count your chickens, but feel very good about where we are. So that's kind of it on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>Ken, I'll turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure and thanks Rick, and good morning everyone. As Rick said from a financial perspective it was a strong quarter and for us a really good start to the year. I mean clearly the driver here was strong crude prices with WTI averaging close to $100 for the quarter. We also did see some improved financial performance from our natural business with higher production and higher natural gas prices, so good to see a turnaround in that business.</p>
          <p>In the refining and marketing business, we have seen a softening of demand in the quarter and margins weakening throughout the quarter. That the underlying fundamentals of that business are masked somewhat by the required accounting change from LIFO to FIFO. So if you actually look through that you will see the underlying fundamentals of the refining marketing business not that strong in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As Rick mentioned cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion, capital spending at about 1.5 billion, is very much in line with expectations which put our net debt at $3.9 billion, once again much in line with our expectations for debt for the quarter and an increase during the year as we ramp up capital spending.</p>
          <p>We have talked in the past about using a hedge strategy as a form of insurance for the balance sheet through the Voyageur expansion period and we would look to future crude oil markets to buy inexpensive insurance when we saw the opportunities. And we did take advantage over what we saw as an opportunity in the first quarter to put some hedges on for 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>We now have 55,000 barrels a day hedged for both of those years, with the put structures. So the floor is $60 with puts and very much in the form of clear insurance and in our view an inexpensive insurance program for the balance sheet. So we have some of those hedges in place going forward. And we will continue to look at hedges that we said in the past, we will continue to look at hedging up to 30% of our production in 2009 and 2010, if we continue to see opportunities to purchase what we call inexpensive insurance for the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So that's all I was going to cover, John. I think with that I will pass it over to you for the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Ken and thanks Rick for your update. The outlook for the quarter has been just tightened up a little bit given I think the first quarter production, the two areas that which actually changed where the production numbers, 248,000 produced during the quarter, kind of let us to think we should have probably taken up the range a bit. So we've gone from 275 to 285 for the remaining part of the year, and we'll watch how that goes along. Not too much change in terms of the various mix that we are going to get coming out of the operation, you will see it as noted.</p>
          <p>I think the one really good news is the realization. Now it's a little tighter, a little better than we had originally projected that we are now thinking that going forward, we will be more like 350 to 450 off of WTI versus what we had expected earlier. I know the cash operating costs were higher than we had expected in the first quarter, than many of you had expected in the first quarter. A lot of that was volume related obviously and as we get increasing volumes, we should be able to bring this down more in line with what we had expected. So for the year the cash operating costs turned to 26 to $27 range.</p>
          <p>Natural gas, I think there is a good new story there, obviously with the production where it was. We're feeling pretty good about it, and we've left the outlook for the year to be the same. One final piece in that system is share based compensation. The total for this quarter was 33 million, so you can use that in the adjustment in your model.</p>
          <p>So, operator with that I think that's all we had to say. And we are certainly open for questions from the participants.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Your first question comes from William Lacey of FirstEnergy Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, just two questions. First one is on the sulfur unit. And I was wondering, if you could just run through a little bit more detail on the key hurdles that we should be looking for here, and how it reflects back on to your production limits for Firebag. And then second thing would be on the hedging front, you did do the puts. Just wondering, if you're willing to talk a little bit more about maybe the costless collar strategy in this sort of market we're seeing oil for the next five, six years around $105. So wondering what that looks like in terms of your overall strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, let &#x2013; Will, this is Rick George. So let me just take care of the first one and I'll pass the second question over to Ken. This sulfur plant is important, but not a huge project for us, about $340 million. We expect it to be done in the second quarter of 2009. I was out at the site yesterday things are moving along fine. And so, it's just the normal kind of project stuff for us, is not particularly large project. Then you will see, you'll note on page 10 in the first quarter report, we're about $130 million spent on that, so it's about the third construction about 15% complete. So, the foundations are done, the equipment is being delivered. And this will be a key summer for us on that particular project, but it's not &#x2013; it's not a particularly huge project.</p>
          <p>I do not expect that we have to wait for that to be completed, to get the controller lifted. This is -- the controller is around ground level exceedances and, I mentioned, we've been in compliance since December. And so as long as we stay in compliance there I don't think that will be the limiting factor. Now when we get the sulfur plant up it will just to make sure it ensures us that we will be able to stay in compliance. So, that's how we captured it's -- we're putting it in, very necessary that will handle all six stages in Firebag. So, it's not just for stages one and two. Ken, why don't you get the second part --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the hedge strategy, I think, I'll just reiterate we really do view this as insurance for the balance sheet. We're not trying to optimize or making a call on the crude market. And so, that kind of puts us in a position today, as we look at the markets, of thinking a put structure makes more sense. I mean we don't know where crude prices are going, but we believe that there is potential for a significant strengthening here. So, we're focused very much on buying puts at a price that's reasonable, gives us the downside protection, and gives us the confidence to fund our capital program going forward, and preserve all the upside. So, that's how we're thinking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Will.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" /> of Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Rick, in the past you've commented on earnings calls about your thoughts on the downstream, M&amp;A market and, what Suncor might think about doing there. And, I was just wondering if you could mark us to market on what you're seeing in terms of downstream M&amp;A right now, in multiples and whether you're seeing multiples come down to an area where Suncor might be more interested?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks <mark type="inaudible" /> absolutely. Yeah and so obviously, we watch this very carefully. And you are starting to see a number of assets come on the marketplace here, now since by Valero and a few other assets that are available. Yeah, so we're coming back counting the range that it's getting more interesting for us. It's still about the right assets, is still about price. And, you know what I &#x2013; my belief is, because of a number of things, because of the biofuels we're seeing coming in, because of the dampening demand on the customer side. And because we're seeing some very large refineries built in other parts of the world, in Middle East and on the west coast of India. I think you're going to see more product on the water here. And so, my expectation is and although we are seeing -- the first quarter is very week on refining margins, there are two refineries. But we are seeing strengthening as we go forward into the second quarter which is normal at both of those refineries. They tend to be weak first quarter, much stronger second and third quarter refineries.</p>
          <p>And so, you know what, I don't think this is a train that you have to rush to. I do think we are going towards the bottom, I think as there may be some refineries that still have stars in their eyes on these asset values. But, I don't think these asset values are going up anytime soon. And so, I think there will be plenty of time, and patient money is always key for us. I would say again on refining purchases for us is nice to have, but not a must have. And that always leaves you in a very comfortable position, so then you're a value buyer, not an urgent buyer, And we've been very consistent with that. But, yeah the valuations we're starting to see and you just have to look at the sector, you'll know as well as I do that valuation will come way off. And, I think a little more realistic about what that business probably looks like on a go forward basis.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Rick. Your message to the shareholders is all about driving operational excellence, and you certainly focused that on the call this morning. How are you, or what steps are you taking to deliver that message into the rank and file?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's a great question. So, Steve Williams, who had a means, when he is not here on the call with us, but Steve and I have been across the entire company in the first quarter on what we called straight talk lives and talking to the employees as well as senior management team. He has been very clear about laying out the priorities and what the emphasis is. And operational excellence cannot be a quick fix for us. It's about getting very digital on operations. It's about moving to much more plant maintenance and much less kind of emergency and reactive maintenance. Virtually everyone in this company including SAP people have operational goals around &#x2013; around operational excellence in 2008.</p>
          <p>This does tie back somewhat also to -- we implemented over the last three years an SAP program. And so &#x2013; and a totally installed SAP. That is driving efficiencies, it is driving us much better on the supply chain management side. You'd have seen an announcement we outsourced IT. And so there is a series of steps here. What I can't promise you is a quick fix. What I can promise you is, a very solid piece of work very steady. And we've had some successes in the past with this kind of program. Safety would be a good example of an area that we've had great success. Our safety statistics over the last four or five years have dropped steadily to now -- we're re not quite at a DuPont standard but very close. And so it is that kind of a methodical program that we are putting in on a go forward basis. So this is a work that I would say Suncor has been really focused for the last decade and a half on growth, on strategy, on putting steel up. And that's kind of &#x2013; that's what we love to do but is obviously a company that it is making a transition where we know that we have the value reward and celebrate the operational value that can operate these assets in an excellent way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. I just have -- you may have mentioned in your release regarding your maintenance turnaround and that during the plant maintenance Upgrader 2 was going to be producing at about $200,000 barrels a day. And, I am just wondering that's not seed,) that's synthetic output or output. And how does that relate to -- it seems like that capacity number is high and I'm just trying to rationalize taking U1 down and producing 200,000 barrels a day, could you --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, it's John. It actually, and I'm glad you brought that up because I think it brings the attention of the total capacity of U2, which we really haven't got to yet. If you remember U1 actually has capacity in the neighborhood of 115 to maybe a maximum of 125.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rest comes out of U2. When we talk about U2, we also mean the MCU. So you have to remember that you have U2 plus the MCU within that number. So, we are actually going to get there, a really good chance to begin to test that out and speak to the higher levels that can be produced out of it. So, we are talking about an upgraded volume absolutely, and we are looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 out of that, which is &#x2013; what it has to produce. Going forward, it actually has to produce a little more than that going forward, as we get to the 350. So that's why we kind of have the confidence of where we are looking at in terms of producing out of that, but thanks for identifying that because I'm not sure that everybody is aware of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Rick I wondered if I could get thoughts -- latest thoughts on the natural gas business. We've got some deep gas royalty relief in place now $10 gas, and do you still view that as a key strategic element of Suncor corporate or is this just an opportune time that you would look at perhaps monetizing those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew thank you very much for that question. No, I still see a very much of the key asset for us. And the recently announced government changes around deep royalty gas, it does help. It's not really the total solution, and it doesn't kick in until 2009. So, it's not an immediate help for us. But -- and we are doing a lot of work as other players are in BC and not it's in scheduling for us. But we see -- I still see it is a very key part of where we are going on, on a go forward basis this natural gas business. It is a good natural hedge for us. They had a very solid first quarter. And we are expecting a very solid year from them. Exploration success over the winter period was above the expectations, and I am not saying that it's a huge part of Suncor, but a very important part and we'll continue to invest there.</p>
          <p>I think that there may be an opportunity for some acquisitions only because the playing field is now level. Our problem over the last virtually eight maybe even 10 years has been that competing on acquisitions has been difficult against the income trust guys, either that or  the cost of capital. So, given the long term nature of this -- given our opportunities, I think there will be an opportunity here to continue to develop that business. Again, I don't see it as an area that we see huge expansion out of us but a key part of our overall company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you still see some sort of rough proportion of natural gas production relative to oil sand production in output? I mean, obviously you've moved from a surplus to sort of close to balance. But if you think about out five years, would you want to be 75% covered or 85% covered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd love to be 100%. But I think you got to be realistic. We'd probably be lucky to be 70% covered in terms of natural hedge. Ultimately where we're going to go is pet-coke gasification. And what we're working hard on there is the technology, and that's always been a real challenge. And the two biggest providers of technology on gasification is GE, who purchased the old Texaco gasification technology, and Shell has a water -cooled system. I do think, you'll see some breakthroughs over the next four, five years on gasification. And this is not an area that I think, that Suncor necessarily has to lead. And, so continuing to look for and trying to nurture development of new technology in gasification, ultimately that's where we've got to go, in terms of energy balance up North, so that will tell you a lot about where we are going.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Robert Plexman of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Brian's question about the operating excellence theme. There have been a -- I guess a series of nagging operating issues, Rick. And so I guess the question is can you talk about the integrity of the asset base. If you wanted 60,000 barrels a day in the installed capacity, I mean is there a risk that you're going to have to spend a lot more money to maintain or rebuild that asset, that base asset going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are seeing &#x2013; we are starting see an escalation on operating costs. And as you do your sustaining capital, we're certainly seeing that normal industry inflationary rates, we're seeing here. But there's not a really a long-term integrity issue here. What is really strange about this is business, what makes it very different than the rest industry is the variability at the front end, particularly on the mining side is actually much bigger than people assume. And so, one of the problems we had in the middle of this winter as we went through an ore seam that was actually too rich. And that created a few problems with erosion and also, and created problems in the extraction process, where because we had such a light column with such rich ore it actually carried sand over into the secondary part of extraction plant.</p>
          <p>And, so we'd actually never seen that in four years of operation. So, it is just the variability on the front end of this, this operation, can be so large compared to a refinery or a normal even E&amp;P business, that's that variability in geology and conditions and an extremely cold winter that makes this business extremely difficult in the front end. And, I'm not making excuses, but if you look at all oil sands players everybody had a rough winter. Part of that's weather conditions, I can promise you. It's tough, it's tough to operate this equipment at a minus 40.</p>
          <p>But, no long-term integrity issues. In fact, I like some of the technologies that we are coming on whether it's <mark type="inaudible" /> based. We're doing a lot of work on dry tailings technologies. We're putting in <mark type="inaudible" /> pipe on the tailings. Now this is over a three year program, that <mark type="inaudible" /> pipe has had to-date, virtually very, very low wear rates compared to carbon steel, which we've used the last 40 years.</p>
          <p>So, again technology is the key to this, but I don't see long term vulnerability to some kind of an issue of long-term integrity. The problem is the variability at the front end. And as Suncor gets to six stages on Firebag on a more third party bitumen on two mines and as we go to North Steepbank, you should see less of that volatility because you got more bitumen sources coming in. John, if you want to pitch on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one of the ways that we would encourage you to think about this, as we thought through this whole piece around operational excellence, is the bitumen delivery is a bit out of balance today. And part of it is, and the main reason is the controller that we have in Firebag really put a lot of pressure on the mines. So, we're putting a lot of pressure on the mines that really wasn't expected to be there, and we were quite ready to pick that up. So, some of the issues that we have are going to be -- begin to slide away as we get more and more Firebag volumes on. But, there is not doubt about, we're putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the mine and the extraction plant today, that's putting the operation a little out of balance. So, these things got to sort itself out over time, but right now given the amount of pressure and the people we are putting on the mining operation, we are getting a little more &#x2013; little more difficult than we had expected.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, more of a bigger macro picture question, that's obviously going to be a pretty big component of your expansion going forward. Can you talk a little bit about the debt markets and what you are seeing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's a great question. Well because, we do expect to increase debt as we go through the Voyageur expansion. I think it's important to understand, Will, it's not just to fund Voyageur, I mean as the company grows, we expect to have a bigger balance sheet. So, a lot of debt that we put on in debt capital markets will be a core debt for us going forward. As I guess everybody knows this is probably the most difficult time in credit markets in the last 30 years as a major shift going on. I'd say from a Suncor perspective though that, we see good access to both bank credit markets and debt capital markets. We did increase our syndicated bank facilities during the quarter. We increased from 2 billion to about 3.75 billion. So, good access to bank credit, and good support from major financial institutions. And we see at this point that the debt capital markets are open to Suncor. So, despite all the term loan credit markets, we feel that we are in a position to access the debt requirements that we need.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about the cost of that debt Ken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what everybody seeing here is that credit spreads are widening as risk is revalued, but what we are seeing is those credits spreads on top of some still very low Bank of Canada and Treasury rates. So, all in financing costs, Will, still look very attractive to us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I want to circle back on the downstream question that was asked earlier. Valuations have come down and as far as from your perspective, what's more interesting looking at single assets would it be &#x2013; would you think about some corporate action as public valuations have come down. Just trying to gauge from your perspective in light of the recent downturn in the downstream market in general and stocks have come off a lot. I just don't know if asset valuations have done the same thing, so I am just trying to gauge from your perspective JV preferred method would you do something corporate to be more focused on the single assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it's a good question. As you know, the way I would frame that up is, we haven't done any of these joint ventures like the Husky, BP deal or the EnCana, Conoco deal. And that's probably because my fundamental belief is the assets in the ground are going to be worth more than refining the assets. And I've been on that page for a long period of time, very consistent on that philosophy. Obviously, I would prefer single assets only because to me it's about fitting into strategy. And the trouble with the corporate one and that may be in end of the day what you have do. And I'm not ruling that out. But the trouble is, then you're going to get hodgepodge of assets that may not fit the strategy, and then you would end up selling off part of the assets or doing something else. So that's, this is the &#x2013; a little bit more risky, lot more work at a time when this company is stretched from a human resource management viewpoint. So we would prefer, but I will tell you, I mean, you got to be very careful to...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The assets are going to come on and not necessarily be the best assets. They may not be a good fit for us. Again once we look at this stuff, but as you can tell, not in a big rush, so it's got to be the right asset, it's got to fit the strategy. If it doesn't -- very patient -- the strategy works without it that's being the nice thing.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could be, yeah there could be. There is not many assets there to look at, but maybe if you look at a Wyoming refinery or Salt Lake City. I think once you get into eastern Kansas is where you're kind of beyond the reach. So, I don't see that as a huge barrier but because there wouldn't be many refineries you'd be in conflict with, because the markets are very different, but so don't see it as a big piece.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, there are two questions. I guess, first is on the tax side. I guess in your Annual Report you started talking about cash taxes being 30 to 50% of total for the next I think 3 to 4 years. That seems quite a bit higher than what you were indicating, I think kind of mid to late last year, is the change there just commodity price related or is there something else? And second question, just wondering, if you could maybe give a little bit of color on when we'll hear more on the post Voyageur plans?  My understanding is that maybe as early as late this year we might see some color there, but just wondering if anything is changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Andrew, it's Ken here. I'll addresss the tax question. So, I think, the main piece here is, I think as you know, we do get a deduction for growth capital investment from current taxable income. The uncertainty here is around the availability for use. So I mean there are tax rules that say once assets are on the ground, then you can make the deduction. It's really around the timing of that. So, it's the uncertainty of that and a clear definition of when the money is spent and when the assets physically meet the test for tax purposes that's led to that change. As we get out past 2010, we anticipate that with the timing schedule of Voyageur and the level of spending that, we would have the full coverage for taxable income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Rick here. So, on the issue of strategy both through 2012, Mike Ashar and his team are, and myself, and the executive team are working hard on this issue. I would say it gets clear to us, what our options are. We have a lot of options on a go forward basis, in terms of what we do. I would say building a fourth upgrader for Fort McMurray is not on that list. I think, we're kind of getting to the capacity at Fort McMurray, in terms of upgrading. You would have noticed, we bought some land outside of Edmonton. We're going to put some assets, some tankage in line in Hardisty, and then look at our whole system. So, we have a lot of options, I don't anticipate that being a problem. I would think, we will get a lot more definition on this in the next year to 18 months. I don't think you should expect a lot this year, as we continue to work those down.</p>
          <p>One of the issues you will note is that of course getting environmental permits and your regulatory permits to get any of these projects done, gets longer and longer. And, so we're very well aware of that, but I would say also not a big panic, in terms of as we bring Voyageur on in late 2011 and into 2012. As we've learned through this last huge expansion, it takes you time to bring that up. We will be very interested in repairing the balance sheet, get to a steady state of operations. So, you don't have to feel like you got to be in the immediate investment point.</p>
          <p>The real thing that, we're measuring against is the investments that we look at on a go-forward basis, certainly have to exceed what is our base alternative, and this is increased dividends, or do share buybacks to return cash to our shareholders. And so that's the fundamental base path that which any investment would have to exceed. So, not we're necessarily giving the direct answer except if you give us another 12 to 18 months, and if you get a lot more of definition around what that looks like. To the extent we can, I mean there are competitive issues here because, obviously lots of people are looking at what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure and just one last question on the post Voyageur. I mean, I think most of the talk is on, whether or not you're going to buy a refinery or build another upgrader I guess in Edmonton. Is it possible you'd consider just a non-upgraded strategy? I mean just being bitumen producer selling into the Gulf of Mexico, does that seem attractive at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, absolutely. In fact, I think once you are at 550,000 barrels a day, even if you had 100,000 barrels a day, bitumen, that is certainly not the same risk profile that you would have had at 50 or 100,000 barrels a day bitumen you are much smaller. I think the other thing that's you changing around the world -- you've got to look at both the environmental challenges whatever happens in North America, not just in Canada, but U.S. also around carbon and the taxing our cap and trade system for carbon worldwide into this time period. And of course you see Mexico and Venezuela in decline. So, I think there will be &#x2013; there will be a real pull from those Gulf Coast refineries on bitumen. And so, certainly that's one of the options that we're looking at.</p>
