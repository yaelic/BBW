          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to the Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico Central America Earnings Call for the second quarter of the year 2010. Here with me is Scot Rank, our President and CEO of Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico Central America; Mariana Rodriguez and Paulina Clark.</p>
          <p>I am happy to report a strong quarter with double-digit EBITDA growth of a sales growth for both Mexico and Central America. As you know this is the first quarter where we fully consolidate Central America operations. As in last quarter, we only included one month of operation. First, we will cover Mexico results, which include the retail and banking operations, then we will look into Central America numbers, and finally the consolidated numbers. Results for Mexico were very good.</p>
          <p>I will leave you now with Scot, who will go into more detail of our numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rafael, and good afternoon to everybody. I agree with you, Mexico had a good performance. Total sales were up 9.5% and 2.7% in comparable stores, outperforming the industry. Gross margin had a very good performance increasing 50 basis points to last year, despite the investment in prices.</p>
          <p>Expenses were the greatest challenge in the quarter given the low sales growth in April. We maintained our discipline in cost control and if we take out utilities that included electricity, tariffs increases of almost 24%, expense would have grown less than sales. Finally, we had a strong 14% growth in EBITDA for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Second quarter was a quarter with mixed calendar effects. We started with a very challenging April with 2 negative effects; a less favorable Easter calendar and the comparison with swine flu last year. Total sales increased 4.6% and comp store sales declined 1.9% in April.</p>
          <p>Then we had the World Cup in June, which we capitalized well in categories such as electronics, had excellence performance especially at the end of May and the beginning of June. We took advantage of the Soccer World Cup to create excitement at the stores and increased traffic in ticket, though by the end of June we felt a fall in consumer sentiment as Mexico was out of the game. A similar behavior as the one we perceived 4 years ago.</p>
          <p>We continue to grow faster than the market both at comparable stores and for total stores. Despite the fact that Walmex had much tougher comparisons versus last year. For the first 6 months of the year, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats in Mexico grew 3.1%, more than double the rate of growth of the industry as measured by the National Retail Association or ANTAD, which increased 1.2% excluding Walmex.</p>
          <p>In the terms of total sales, our self-service formats in Mexico grew 10.1%, which very positively compares with the 5.4% growth of ANTAD, excluding Walmex. Key to our continuous profitable growth strategy is our focus on the customer and our constant search to improve our value proposition.</p>
          <p>Low prices are very relevant to our customers and we continue strongly investing in prices and increasing our price differential. This quarter our average price gap versus our competitors measured with AC Nielsen data increased compared to last year's second quarter. We compare store by store every week and against our most relevant competitor. This effort has certainly been very well received by our customers, as reflected in comparing Walmex sales growth versus the rest of the market.</p>
          <p>Now let's move from Mexico into Central America, where we also had some very strong results to report. In Central America, total sales were up 3.9% and 2.1% at comparable stores. Average installed capacity versus last year increased only 3.3% compared to the 11% increase in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Gross margin had a good performance increasing 50 basis points from last year. Expenses were challenging, increasing 5.4% above sales rate of growth. It is important to mention that this year is a year of investment, but synergies will drive mid and long-term improvements, allowing for continuous profitable growth. Central America's EBITDA grew a strong 10.3%, much faster than the 3.9% increase in sales and reached 6.1% of total income.</p>
          <p>The main driver of total sales growth in Central America is currently comp sales growth. Sales in April were strongly affected by the negative Easter calendar, decreasing 5% at comp stores and 3.4% total stores. In May and June, comp sales had a much stronger performance with 5.9% and 5.3% growth, respectively, and the total sales increased 7.7% and 7.2%, respectively.</p>
          <p>We have made considerable inroads in the integration process for Mexico and Central America with 3 main objectives; number one, generating value. This year is a year of investment, and we have identified and are implementing processes and synergies that will drive mid-term value. Second is to maintain business focus. We focus on the customers to drive continuous profitable growth for the benefit of all of our shareholders. And, three, to operate as a single company. Corporate governance has been unified and channels of communication have been established between functionaries in Mexico and Central America.</p>
          <p>Some examples of the key synergies on which we are focusing are, improve assortment and drive synergies and procurement, add new departments and categories, improve formats value proposition, increase store productivity and inventory efficiencies, and improve logistics and increase cost efficiencies of our logistics network.</p>
          <p>Now let's move into consolidated results for Mexico and Central America. Total income reached 81 billion pesos, 70 billion for Mexico and 11 billion for Central America. Gross margin is 20 basis points higher in Central America than in Mexico. Expenses as a percent of sales are 410 basis points higher in Central America. As a result, Central America's operating margin is 390 basis points lower than in Mexico. Operating margin and EBITDA are higher in the Mexican operation than in Central America. Operating margin is 8.2% for Mexico, 4.3% for Central America, and 7.6% for the combined Walmex in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>EBITDA is 10% for Mexico, 6.1% for Central America, and 9.5% for the consolidated Walmex in the second quarter. Consolidation of Central America reduces EBITDA margins, but it certainly has a positive effect on absolute numbers and growth rates.</p>
          <p>This chart shows how the consolidated numbers versus last year look like with total income growth of 27%, 25% EBITDA growth, and 24% net income growth. Consolidated gross margin grew 29% and went from 21.3 to 21.8%, driven by stronger gross margins in both Mexico and Central America. The toughest effect of consolidation is reflected in general expenses as a percentage of total income that as we consolidate both regions, increased 70 basis points compared to last year's level that only include Mexico.</p>
          <p>Now, Rafael, why don't we move to comment on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Scot, our balance sheet continues to reflect the financial strength of our business. As of the end of the second quarter, our cash position amounted to 14.1 billion pesos, 3.1 billion pesos more than last year. Our cash comes from the operation. 11.1 billion pesos corresponds to Mexico retail, 913 million to Banco Walmart, and another 2 billion to Central American operations.</p>
          <p>Inventory days increased 2.1 days in June versus the previous year. They went from 34.6 in 2009 to 36.7 this year. This increase was mainly a result of the consolidation of Central America, which had 31.1 days in June versus 35.0 days in Mexico. If we consider only Mexico, inventory days increased 0.5 days in June, but they decreased 0.4 days for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>So far this year, we have opened 77 stores and restaurants and we are on target to meet our expansion program for the full year. During the quarter, average in-store capacity increased 11% in Mexico and 3.3% in Central America. As of today, we have 2067 stores and restaurants in Mexico and Central America.</p>
          <p>This quarter, our customers were challenged by Hurricane Alex and I am very pleased with the response of all our associates. The devotion to the customer has allowed us to guarantee supply of basic products. So far, we have channeled 626 tons of food, 510 received out of 237 locations that we set up for the stores and 116 stores donated to the Fundacion Walmart de Mexico.</p>
          <p>Banco Walmart opened an account so donations can be deposited from 1 peso on. These donations will be channeled through the Mexican Red Cross.</p>
          <p>With this, now we are ending this earnings call. Thanks again for joining us today and I remind you that the presentation we just finished is available at our website. And as always, we are available to receive calls with questions that you may have. Thank you.</p>
