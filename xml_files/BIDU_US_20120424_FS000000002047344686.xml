      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone and welcome to today's call. We're pleased to begin the year with a strong set of results. As always, our excellent performance was driven by our team's relentless execution. In particular, we achieved a robust expansion of our SME customer base despite a seasonally slow quarter with huge opportunities to develop both our SME and large customer bases. And, we have been working hard to capture these opportunities. Across a variety of product platforms, our user experience indicators grow strongly this quarter as well, underpinning this progress in customer base expansion and user experience is our sustained investment in talent, infrastructure and marketing.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we continued to push forward with our box computing initiative. Box computing embodies our mission for the future of the Internet. As part of this, we've made good progress on our open data and open application platforms. In March, for example, searches for trending topics and breaking news on Baidu began returning results from all of China's major Weibo platforms.</p>
          <p>The market has responded well to our ongoing improvements. As of now, we have tens of thousands of registered developer accounts on the open application platform. These developers have created over 70,000 applications that are available to Baidu users and traffic patterns demonstrate clearly that users are enjoying the easy access to these apps from our platform.</p>
          <p>Since our personalized  home page feature was launched in September of last year we continued to make it more convenient for users to enjoy, feedback has been great and is translating into improved user stickiness on the personalized home page.</p>
          <p>The daily clicks number has grown very nicely since the launch last September. Mobile search traffic maintained a strong growth trajectory in Q1, mobile search is of course central to our overall strategy, mobile search traffic now accounts for close to one fifth of the total web search traffic on Baidu. In Q1 we continued to leverage our advanced technology as well as investments in R&amp;D and engineering talent in mobile to make solid improvements here. As mobile usage has grown we have started to explore monetization opportunities, for example we have started to work on mobile Phoenix Nest account management, mobile ad display presentations and mobile back-end monetization technologies. As a result we have seen encouraging progress in CPM for mobile ad, mobile monetization is still at a very early stage but we are excited about this tremendous opportunity over the long term.</p>
          <p>We are also very pleased with the reception of Baidu's iOS and Android apps, these apps not only offered the standard Baidu search experience optimized for mobile devices, but also enable many innovative new features like voice activation for both search and maps. Box computing is especially well-suited to mobile users because it brings dynamic up-to-date information straight to the results page. Mobile users are able to search and access information, content and apps directly from search results. We're also seeing a significant uptick in both Mobile Pulsar and Mobile Notes usage. These are just some of the mobile products that have experienced year-over-year usage growth in the triple digits. Ultimately our focus remains consistent to ensure that mobile users get the best possible Baidu experience across all devices and operating systems.</p>
          <p>And these are some of the many great examples of how we're leveraging our leading position to capture opportunities in the mobile arena. The success of our mobile offering is built upon our industry-leading cloud infrastructure. Since mobile devices themselves have limited processing power and optimal mobile experience depends on powerful cloud-based backend technology. Baidu's leadership in cloud technology gives us a real competitive advantage allowing us to deliver data, content and apps from the cloud to mobile devices.</p>
          <p>In March, we hosted our first ever developers conference to promote our open platform and raise awareness among developers of Baidu's large and effective traffic distribution platform, reliable cloud computing service and strong user behavior analysis and monetization capabilities. And I'm pleased to say that turnout was much larger than we expected.</p>
          <p>At the conference we showcased three of our most exciting cloud-based initiatives. These include the Baidu Application Engine, BAE, which enables developers to create and develop new apps for our open platform at lower cost than was previously possible.</p>
          <p>We also introduced our Mobile Test Bag, MTB, a cloud-based environment for developers to test the performance of their apps across dozens of operating systems and handsets. Both of this will significantly lower the barrier to entry for more of &#x2013; for small-sized developers who don't have a lot of capital or manpower. And we've rolled out an exciting new storage initiative we're calling Personal Cloud Service, PCS. As I said, mobile internet usage needs to be backed up by good cloud support. Under the PCS umbrella, we will gradually rollout many useful cloud-based products and services.</p>
          <p>As a first step in March, we launched a Baidu WangPan or Baidu Net Disk, currently in beta testing. WangPan will allow users to store, manage and share vast amount of data for free across all terminal devices and virtually with no storage limitation. We look forward to building out one-time functionality and capability, and we expect to become the industry leader on this front as well.</p>
          <p>As I've mentioned before although cloud computing is still at an early stage in China, it will become an integral part of the internet ecosystem and therefore represents a vital element in Baidu's growth strategy.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our work on the customer front, we have made it a priority this year to better leverage the enormous opportunity with the SME market in China. Our sales and marketing team pushed hard into the second tier markets. Implemented in the latest sales method and optimized an employee incentive scheme that ties conversation more closely with cells. These efforts have resulted in significant expansion of our SME customer base against a seasonally slow quarter. This is a good start and we want to continue pushing hard to educate smaller companies about the power of search engine marketing.</p>
          <p>We also focused on enhancing existing customer satisfaction with innovative new products and tools. One example from Q1 is the intelligent account optimization system. This tool automatically provides suggestions to customers regarding account optimization. This includes better key word selection, better page search relevance, matching choices, display time slots and much more. So far the system has been well received by our beta testing customers and we plan to open that to all customers in near future.</p>
          <p>We are also continuing to build awareness among the large customers of the unique advantages of Baidu's platform. More and more of this large customers are now leveraging our innovative ad products to meet their sophisticated performance-oriented marketing requirements. We are excited about the progress we've made here already and about the tremendous opportunity to win even more of our large customers ad budgets going forward.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to our important investment initiatives. I'm pleased to tell you that our investment in ITE continue to yield encouraging results. In March, ITE had more than 230 million unique visits from traditional PC users alone. In terms of time spent on-site, ITE is now ranks second in China among the online video service providers, according to both iResearch and comScore. This is a real indication of the strength of the ITE user experience. We believe that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand among users for online video content.</p>
          <p>We know that today's internet users create visual information and people are much more inclined to look at photos than to read text. In light of this, in Q1, we revamped and re-launched PhotoWonder, an easy to use photo enhancement app for IOS and Android devices. PhotoWonder allows users to modify smartphone pictures with a huge range of preset filters and frames to easily create collage and to upload this to popular social media sites. In the short time, we've seen exponential usage growth on both Android and IOS platforms.</p>
          <p>PhotoWonder now has more than 14 million activated users, and is well on the way to becoming another hit product for Baidu. We're very excited about the opportunity here as social networking enters a more image-intensive age, and we're confident that PhotoWonder positions us well.</p>
          <p>We started the year strong. We made great progress across most crucial aspects of our core business that position us well for future growth. We see tremendous opportunities in fast emerging sectors such as the mobile web and cloud computing, and our team is working hard to capitalize on all of this growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call to Jennifer for financial highlights.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. We started 2012 with a productive quarter. In order to maintain our leading position in the industry, we sustained a rapid pace of investment in talent, networks and office infrastructure while managing operational efficiency. This investment strategy is building a solid foundation for our future business progress.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we'll continue this aggressive investment strategy in the quarters ahead. This month, for example, we have embarked on our annual nationwide search engine marketing tour, and in the coming quarters, we also expect office construction and network infrastructure spending to ramp up.</p>
          <p>Now, let me go through some of the financial highlights for the first quarter of 2012. All amounts mentioned are in RMB unless otherwise noted. For the first quarter, total revenue was RMB4.3 billion representing a 75% increase year-over-year. During the first quarter, Baidu had approximately 321,000 active online marketing customers, a 17.2% increase from the corresponding period in 2011 and a 2% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenue per online marketing customers for the first quarter was approximately RMB13,300, a 49.4% increase from the corresponding period in 2011, and a decrease of 7.6% from the previous quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 was RMB331 million or 7.8% of total revenues compared to 8.2% in the corresponding period in 2011 and a 7.9% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue in Q1 were 5.2% and 5.5% respectively compared to 5% and 5% in the corresponding period of 2011. As I mentioned just now, the increase was mainly due to an increase in network infrastructure capacity.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses in Q1 were RMB479 million, an increase of 43.9% year-on-year primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses in Q1 were RMB443 million, an increase of 85% over the corresponding period in 2011 primarily due to increased head count reflecting our continued strategic investment in R&amp;D talent. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items increased in aggregate to RMB35 million in the first quarter from RMB31 million in the corresponding period in 2011. Operating profit from Q1 was RMB2.1 billion, an increase of 75.1% over Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>Total head count as of March 31, 2012, was about 16,500, roughly 400 more than the previous quarter. Income tax expense was RMB331 million for the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.1% compared to 14.5% in Q1 2011. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB1.9 billion, a 75.9% increase from the corresponding period in 2011. Basics and the diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS, for the first quarter of 2012 amounted to RMB5.39  and RMB5.38 respectively. Net income attributable to Baidu excluding share based compensation expenses a non-GAAP measure for Q1 was RMB1.9 billion, a 74.1% increase year-on-year. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS excluding share based compensation expenses both non-GAAP measures were RMB5.49 billion and RMB5.48 billion respectively.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, 2012 the company had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of RMB16.1 billion. Net operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2012 was RMB2.4 billion. Capital expenditure for the first quarter of 2012 were RMB298 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you with our top line guidance for the second quarter of 2012. We currently expect total revenues for the second quarter of 2012 to be between RMB5.335 billion and RMB5.46 billion in RMB which represents a 56.2% to 59.9% year-on-year increase. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. My question is on the guidance, I wonder if you can share some assumptions on the second quarter guidance maybe first, within the second quarter, is the management assuming that May and June will be weaker versus May compared to prior years? And maybe secondly maybe you can share some thoughts on the spending SME versus the large advertisers on Q2, that will be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dick, good morning. We have always made our best to make projections. In Q2, we think the sequential pattern is normal, as we have &#x2013; what we have demonstrated in Q1 is, we added quite a number of customer accounts and these accounts are primarily SMEs and what that really demonstrate is the market potential is huge and our sales team, the kind of work that we have done in the past year is bearing fruit. We continue to work a lot with the large advertising customers and bring in traditional customers and their ad allocation &#x2013; ad budget allocation onto the Baidu platform. And a lot of work is on the &#x2013; in the pipeline. I think, both on the SME front and the large customer side, we continue to see tremendous opportunity. Months over months, between May, June and July, we do not anticipate different patterns as we compare to the prior years. Last year in Q2, obviously, it was a very special quarter and you would recall in last Q2 there were particularly hot sectors such like group buying sectors and a lot of hot money is getting into the sector. So, Q2 last year if you recall we provided sequential guidance in the range of 32% to 35%. The actual performance exceeded our expectations and came in at 40%. So, if you look at the normal pattern of 32% and 35% that was kind of the ballpark range that we were looking at last year and building on the second quarter, third quarter outstanding performance and in line performance in Q2 &#x2013; Q4 as well as this past Q1, I think on a very solid high base this second quarter guidance is a very solid guidance. So, this is pattern that we do not &#x2013; we are not seeing anything different and this is the pattern that that we are currently projecting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just to follow-up on the revenue guidance question, if I look at year-over-year growth of slightly below 60%, I think this is you haven't seen anything less than 60% since end of 2009, I was wondering other than a higher base could you talk about the visibility currently you have in the advertising and in particularly in the search based advertising demand in China? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we continue to see tremendous opportunity as you just currently noted, year-on-year comparison we do have a large base last Q2, but as we are seeing into the market segments, whether it's for SME or large customers that we have billed, obviously we see continued momentum in these people, <mark type="ph" /> look at the nice thing (23:45)  the search engine marketing platform as a very effective promotional platform for them.</p>
          <p>So, our sales team is very focused on executing, educating and developing the market as well as servicing the customers. So, I think the market potential is there, the execution that we have demonstrated a pretty good track record all along and we continue to think that we have a very, very significant potential in developing the market. In terms of I think visibility and all that, we do not feel there is anything that much different. Obviously we have a very diversified portfolio and many, many more business and business factors and customers to add on the platform. So, I think the outlook for us is continued tremendous potential and we're focused on execution.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone and thank you very much for taking my question. My question is about your cloud computing strategy. Can you share with us your thoughts on the commercial perspective of the cloud computing strategy and also how should we think about returns on those investments in terms of the cost structure, which would be generated from these initiatives. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Cloud computing is a very important infrastructure play with our technology competitiveness, we compute very large scale infrastructure that allows developers to build apps upon that. Once &#x2013; so we are in basically an ecosystem play instead of trying to bet on any of the specific apps. In the future, I think, the best model for this would very much like a commission-based structure. We will take a cut from all the apps running on our platform. Although this is a relatively longer-term picture, we would be able to &#x2013; we would want to invest in the <mark type="ph" /> standup (26:21) bringing all the users so that their behavior, their data can be used by all kinds of different applications. In the future, we think this will pay off based on our infrastructure and our monetization capabilities, we have viewed over the past, like 10 years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And how will this impact the cost structure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all built in or it's been planned. It's not going to be a sudden rise or a sudden change for the cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, I think, the way to think about it is, if you look at the past two years of the investment pattern, and I have stressed that we will continue this investment strategy, so the approach will be consistent and this is a part of our core business. As Robin mentioned it is very important for us to set this solid foundation as we develop forward and to really solidify our position in the marketplace. And this is part of overall core business and the investment or related costs if you're thinking about it, you can look at the patterns from the past two years and that pattern will sustain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that. Couple of questions. Your traffic acquisition cost as a percentage of revenues, it looks like it declined a little bit this quarter. Has there been any material changes in how you allocate cost to, how you share revenues with your traffic partners again or is just the function of the fact that contextual ads are probably not as growing as fast. How should we look at that? And second of all, just talking about customer deposit have been relatively strong indicator of revenue is pretty strong this quarter. Does that mean that we should be growing stronger going forward after these new SME customers specifically ramp-up after this quarter? I'll stop there. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question related to TAC, where you are seeing Q1 is a normal fluctuation. As we have indicated in the past, the TAC expense that we are deploying today has more to do with a new product promotion that we are pushing through the network of union partners. The composition of the TAC is shifting more towards the new product promotions rather than the traditional traffic acquisition cost, and we are, as you know, we have been working on the contextual ads product and the product itself is making good progress, and obviously this is not a overnight product that you should see significant differences, and therefore I would point to the TAC as a normal fluctuation compared to the prior quarter's patterns.</p>
          <p>And your second question with regards to customer deposits. Yes, as we have recruited more customers and these people would be putting their deposits with us, it does show that the customers are having confidence in our platform, are willing to spend with us. Obviously as we execute on helping them spend on their promotional dollars, we help them along the way to generate the kind of the ROIs that they desire. So, it is a good indicator, it does not directly correlate with revenue projection, and &#x2013; but this is definitely a solid cash base and customers confidence in us that we're having. So, that &#x2013; this is a solid number and that's good to have.</p>

          <p>Our top sectors &#x2013; five sectors for Q1 are namely medical, healthcare, machinery equipment, education, travel and software and games. And they are because Q1 is a seasonally special quarter so there is a slight changes in the top five sectors. And that the other normal players that would typically show up here are business service and franchising. And there is some seasonal patterns as you know as Q1 comes in the picture. So, the mix of the top sectors are not really changing. I think particular on the B2C side we continue to see very strong growth. And because the fact that we're seeing these sectors continues to be the top, you can expect that they're all enjoying very strong growth. And obviously as I said B2C is stronger than B2B.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is about your user traffic. So, in terms of search query growth have you guys seen the impact from a slowdown in Chinese Internet user growth. And then my second question is related to the contribution from Qunar, could you discuss a little bit about the change in contribution to your top line throughout the past couple of months from Qunar?

          <p>Eddie, on the user traffic growth we've seen very strong traffic growth over the past few quarters. It's very &#x2013; it's been very consistent. So, although the Internet user base in China is quite large and the growth could slow down, but our traffic, not only depend on number of new users coming in everyday, it also depends on the time spent by its user because information or search is so fundamental, so essential to everyone's ordinary life, I think people are increasingly depend on us to find information, that's why we're seeing very healthy growth in terms of user traffic or in terms of queries over the past few quarters.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the particular innovative marketing efforts you mentioned in the opening remarks, which has accelerated your SME customer base growth, given I think you have regularly organized these marketing events to the Tier 2 cities over the past two years. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We do this kind of nationwide marketing tour every year, what's different this year is that we implemented certain incentives for the sales to signing more customers. We implemented a structural change in our sales force last year, which means we separated the inside sales from outside sales, people would &#x2013; there is certain dedicated team, who would go to the customer site and do on-site visits and the other team would do calling. So, this kind of structure allows us to sign up new customers more efficiently. Last year, because the large customers grow so rapidly, we were not able to spare a lot of resources to take care of the smaller customers and starting from this year, you have seen that we were able to sign-up a lot of new accounts from the second Tier and third Tier cities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning Robin, Jennifer and Victor. And can you elaborate a little more on your mobile search initiative, clearly there has been very fast growing and likely going to be a key <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:39) going forward. When should we expect to see some meaningful revenue contribution and can you also comment on the potential margin profile and for the mobile search relative to a PC-based search?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, what we are saying in that mobile search traffic have been growing much, much faster, especially for those smartphone-based mobile searches. We are aggressively investing in improving the user experience for our mobile search, and we have seen very good results. What's different from the mobile is that at this stage, we need to probably share some revenue with the handset manufactures or other distribution channels when we ask them to preload our search, in most cases it's a default search on those phones. The monetization capability on mobile is relatively low, it's still much lower than PC-based on search queries, but we started to work on the monetization capabilities for our mobile traffic, we have seen very encouraging results.</p>
          <p>So going forward you can expect that the revenue contribution from mobile will continuing to go up but it's probably the rest of the year  it's still going to be a very small percentage. It's kind of early to talk about the margin difference because the overall traffic or overall revenue rather is too small. Once we have established that the dominant vision in mobile search we may not need to pay out a lot of channel distribution costs in the longer term, so I don't think it's so important to focus on margin right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Also questions related to mobile internet, <mark type="ph" /> it has been some (39:29) third party companies that track sort of a Baidu market share in the mobile internet it seems lower than the PC-based. Can you explain a little bit the reasons behind why there was some discrepancies between PC and mobile side, is it related to say Baidu strategies in the mobile browser as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are a number of reasons. First is that I don't think there is an incredible market intelligence on the mobile search market share. A lot of those numbers are really based on number of bytes transmitted to a certain mobile search sites. Some of the sites actually host some very large files such as music files on their site. So the traffic share or number of bytes is really misleading when you think about the mobile search market share.</p>
          <p>Our current estimation is that we should have over 50% of the mobile search market at this point. And of course as I mentioned before mobile search is growing very, very fast and we just started to invest aggressively to improve the user experience. That brings up the second reason which is that we were not so focused on mobile before because we started &#x2013; it's kind of early before there was no healthy competition among the carriers and since the mainstream phones were feature phones, which was very hard for users to use, to surf the Internet and search. This has changed, so we'll now start to focus on that too.</p>
          <p>Certainly, I would like to point out that users would spend &#x2013; would search more, given that they have a phone that can have access to Internet too, so we do expect the vast and majority of our existing users on PC, China has more than 500 million users, and we have a very large reach or coverage for this kind of users. When they have certain type of information need, it's very natural for them to pullout their phone if a PC is not in front of them to find the information. So net-net we expect to see faster growth because of the mobile search phenomenon.</p>

          <p>I really don't know, we don't have any creditable third party data and it's very hard for us to get the number from other players, what we have seen is that mobile search has being growing much faster than PC and smartphone traffic is growing much, much faster than the mobile search &#x2013; the overall mobile search traffic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you very much for taking my question. I've got a question about your vision for the personal cloud service that you spoke about in your opening remarks. I was wondering what your view is of how broad that cloud service will ultimately be in terms of the user experience, whether you see it encompassing as well as photos, music, video and another types of &#x2013; other types of data storage in sharing. Secondly wondering if that would encapsulate a streaming service. And when you talk about sharing with friends for the personal cloud service, I was wondering if that is around sharing with people who are already registered or additional integrating with other social networks and social sites in China today. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, like I mentioned before, personal cloud service is really a infrastructure play, we have a very large infrastructure that can enable users to store their data content or apps on the cloud side at a cost, I mean, cost to us then because in most cases, it's free to the users, very cost effectively. This kind of infrastructure can support a lot of apps, for example we recently launched a Net Disk or Baidu WangPan that give people virtually unlimited storage for them to store whatever they want. But there are a lot of other apps that can pick up advantage of this infrastructure, for example PhotoWonder when people will take pictures using their phone, they can actually store the data on the cloud side. There are a lot of other Baidu services, from Baidu Knows to Post Bar, a lot of user-generated content, anyone can choose to store certain part of the content as their personal content, so that they have a sense of owning some data. There're a lot of other developers &#x2013; third-party developers who can develop apps and taking advantage of the storage, infrastructure and including sharing this kind of data amount the social networks, they prefer it could be a Baidu social product, it could be any other popular product that's available on the Internet. So, PCS is really an infrastructure play.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And a quick follow up somewhat related to that around mobile and the pre-installation of the Baidu range of apps including search. I was wondering if you could update us on the percent of Android handsets as well as the development you have around IOS for the preinstalled Baidu search and other apps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now Android is growing much faster, I think, it's &#x2013; the installed base is much larger and will become even larger because we &#x2013; based on the market &#x2013; current market analysis we expect a lot of &#x2013; on the order of probably 100 million new Android-based phones becoming available this year. Right now, about 80% of these Android phones, branded Android phones come with pre -- with Baidu search preloaded. So, we are very happy about the growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you and good morning. Robin, can you talk a little bit about customer ads, they're better than expected ARPU is a little bit weaker, maybe a little bit about the trend going forward as you bring on more advertisers, are these small businesses that might have a lower revenue opportunity or in general how should we think about ARPU relative to customer as over the next year or two? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that over the past couple of years, large customers generally grow faster than SME as we talked about during the past few conference calls. That's because all of a sudden a lot of the traditional advertisers and plus some of those hot sectors grew buying  -- they all came in and spent a lot of money on us. Starting from this year, we think that the customer mix will become more normal in the sense that a lot of the SMEs continue to sign up and we were able to spare a lot of resources to take care of them.</p>
          <p>ARPU had a slight drop, it's pretty much because of seasonality, Q1 is always the slowest quarter for us. So, over the next couple of years I think we should see a very healthy growth in a number of  customers and as well as ARPU is just the customer mix may shift a little bit, those larger customers, existing larger customers may not be able to double their ad spending on us every year. So, that's &#x2013; what we do expect both that the customer numbers and ARPU to grow very nicely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions. Number one is related to ITE, is the RMB46 million loss from equity investments mostly from ITE, and can management give the outlook for the next few quarters. We also would like to hear from Robin your view of ongoing online video consolidation and what do you think this has implied to Qiyi related loss, will that &#x2013; will Qiyi loss narrow. The second question is related to Baidu's strategy on the operating system. We read from recent news that Baidu is cooperating with Dell and also Foxconn to manufacture handsets based on the OS &#x2013; in-house OS. Can management give some more color on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have the question related to the loss or gain from the equity cost accounting method. What's included in this quarter's number are &#x2013; mainly are two items, ITE is part of it and there is also an element related to the Baidu Youa spinoff. If you read our 20-F, we obtained funding for Baidu Youa, and we recognized a gain related to the transaction. So, on a going-forward basis if the entity is loss generating, we will pick up the related loss items. This quarter the total amount is in the range of RMB45 million and I expect this to be the range going forward on a consistent basis for the remaining quarters, may be slight variations quarter-over-quarter, but not largely the range that I'm looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the outlook for online video, I have mentioned this before, we see tremendous amount of user demand for video content, a lot of users come to Baidu and search for video content. Our main goal is to satisfy this type of user needs. We invested in ITE so that they can bring us very high quality professionally produced license to content to our users, and we will continue to support that. We are also open to other type of &#x2013; other sources of online video content, in my mind since this online video business, it's not really a winner-take-all business, a lot of players have chances to benefit from this. On the one hand demand is huge, on the other hand a lot of people have the capability to bring high quality content online. So we are very optimistic about the future of online video. On the operating system thing, we continue to work on Baidu Yi which is a platform for mobile handset manufacturers to preload and it comes with a lot of Baidu-flavored products and look and feel and we worked with Dell before and we are working with other manufactures for future release of mobile phones.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I have a follow-up question for Jennifer. Jennifer, you said the RMB45 million loss per quarter is the estimate for loss related to Youa, I assume this does not include Qiyi related equity loss and if it doesn't, can you give some guidance as to what we should expect on Qiyi related equity loss going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what I said included in the line items are mainly two things, one is Youa and one is ITE. As I indicated last quarter with the cash contribution we put into ITE, going-forward basis will pick up our share of the financial results related to Qiyi so included in this number also has ITE's number but I just wanted to highlight that there is a new item related to Youa, that's also included in this number. And going forward, largely if business patterns is holding constant, this is the general range. You might see some variations quarter-over-quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. First, why you are pushing into Tier 2 cities and modify your sales incentive systems? What kind of measures will you put in place to avoid risk and prevent medical errors from happening again? And secondly the capital expenditures seems to have come down dramatically in Q1 on both the year-over-year basis and the sequential basis, how should we view this trend going forward? And lastly when you booked mobile advertising revenue, I wonder if your bookings net revenue after distributing cost or your record the gross revenue? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take on the first and Jennifer will answer the rest part of the question. For the customers in the Tier 2 cities, as the vast majority of SMEs in China resides in the Tier 2 or Tier 3 cities and they start to realize that the power of Internet, marketing or search engine marketing, and we are just trying to satisfy their needs and help those SMEs in those regions to really take out, manage off our platforms. So it's very natural that we start to shift to come off with resources to the Tier 2 cities. Another point worth noting is that the growth rate for the Tier 2 areas actually faster than the Tier 1 cities. So, it's only natural that more and more customers come from those areas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, on the question related to CapEx. I mean CapEx typically becoming pretty choppy quarter-over-quarter, so do not, as I indicated, we are having consistent patterns when it comes to infrastructure investment and I also highlighted that other than datacenters, we are also investing in office space. So, you should expect the CapEx to pick up in the upcoming quarters. Typically, what's included in the CapEx as you well know is servers related and I think additional spending will occur this year related to constructions for infrastructure as well office space. Related to your question on the mobile revenue it is a very small part of the overall revenue picture today and today we're recording the mobile revenue on a gross basis and any revenue sharing is going through the TAC line item.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is actually on the general advertising outlook for 2012, since advertising overall in China had a pretty slow start with some soft macro and political uncertainty, I think, I would say what advertisers seem to suggest to <mark type="indiscernible" />  (59:13) could be second half- loaded, I just wonder whether you see similar trend with your business, also it'd be extremely helpful you could &#x2013; if you could comment on the <mark type="ph" /> partly (59:27)  allocation trends for your big advertisers first half versus second half. It seems that you had a pretty good start on the small and medium enterprises, so again will want to get more color on the big advertiser side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say that things are kind of different from the SME side to the large advertiser side. For SMEs, the &#x2013; not that affected by this kind of budget allocation, typically their main way of doing promotion &#x2013; online promotion is through Baidu and it's very much performance-driven. If we can deliver the right result, as they all spend on us. For the larger advertisers, and the story is a little bit different in the sense that they generally have an annual budget for advertising and then they allocate certain portion of that budgets to search or to Baidu, and we yearly sign a framework contract with them at the beginning of the year. We've seen a very good acceptance from the large customers or large advertisers, but what we have heard is that many of the traditional advertisers are not increasing their overall advertising budget, but they would like to increase the percentage of their budget allocation to online platform especially on Baidu.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I guess the question is it fair to say we might see some recovery or improvement overall when we had to work second-half of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our current read that it's very possible. As you know that Q1 is seasonally slow and we signed a lot of pretty more contracts with large advertisers. They're committed to spend a lot of money. I mean a very healthy growth year-on-year. So, the second-half should look better.</p>
