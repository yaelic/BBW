          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is Fab, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We'll be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the presentation over to Mr. <mark type="inaudible" />, Fixed Income Investor Relations Manager. Please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Fab and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who have joined us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. Our speakers this morning are Peter Daniel, Ford Senior Vice President and Controller; K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer.</p>
          <p>We do have some other members of management who have joined us for the call, including David Brandi, Assistant Treasurer; Scott Stewart, Assistant Treasurer; <mark type="inaudible" />, Director of Accounting; and Phil Horlock, Director of Corporate Finance.</p>
          <p>Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's investor website for your reference.</p>
          <p>The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix in the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, I need to remind everyone that today's presentation may include some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors are detailed in our SEC fillings including our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-Ks.</p>
          <p>With that, I would now like to turn this call over to Ford's Senior Vice President and Controller, Peter Daniel, Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dave and good morning. We will begin on slide one by reviewing the key financial results for the first quarter. Because Jaguar Land Rover is held for sale, we've excluded its results from continuing operations in 2008, although they are included in the 2007 data.</p>
          <p>As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales last quarter were over 1.5 million units, down 119,000 from the same period in 2007. This reduction includes 68,000 Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin units and 51,000 at other operations. Ongoing company revenue was 39.4 billion; excluding Jaguar Land Rover, revenue was up slightly with favorable exchange offset by lower volume and lower net pricing.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax results from continuing operations were a profit of 736 million, an improvement of 669 million from the same period in 2007. This included about a 900 million improvement in automotive operating results, largely offset by lower profits in financial services.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter net income was 100 million, including 416 million of pre-tax special charges; and we ended the quarter with 28.7 billion of gross cash, down 6.5 billion from year ago levels. This reduction was part of our plan and largely reflects implementation of the initial part of our VEBA agreement with the UAW. Overall, as I said before, our plan is working and we continue to show progress.</p>
          <p>We go to slide two, we will cover our special items which were a pre-tax loss of 416 million in the first quarter. This included a 223 million charge associated with separation programs in North America, largely related to <mark type="inaudible" /> separation programs in the U.S., and associated <mark type="inaudible" /> benefit plans.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have taken a 108 million charge related to the reduction at dealer price including a write-off associated with our investments in U.S. dealerships. We recorded a 70 million charge as a result of the restructuring of our investment at Ballard, which we announced last November. Additional charges in the first quarter totaled 13 million which was largely associated with personnel reductions in all of Europe and Asia-Pacific; and as I indicated, given the pending completion of the sale of Jaguar Land Rover, we are treating their results as a special item because they are no longer a part of our ongoing operations.</p>
          <p>At the end of the fourth quarter, we classified Jaguar Land Rover operations as held for sale. At that time, book value of Jaguar Land Rover approximated the net cash proceeds we expected to receive upon sale. At the end of March, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Jaguar Land Rover for approximately its year-end 2007 book value.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Jaguar Land Rover's positive operating results were essentially offset by an impairment charge. The recently announced sale of our ACH Glass Business will result in a largely non-cash special charge during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide three, we will show you our automotive cash and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with 28.7 billion in gross cash, down 5.9 billion compared with year-end 2007.</p>
          <p>Our operating related cash flow was 1.5 billion negative in the first quarter, reflecting an automotive pre-tax profit of 700 million; capital spending during the quarter of about 100 million lower than depreciation and amortization. Changes in working capital and other items of 1.3 billion negative, reflecting mainly timing differences and non-cash items and profits and payments of 1 billion to Ford Credit reflecting a change to upfront payment subvention.</p>
          <p>Excluding the upfront subvention payments, our operating cash flow was 500 million negative. The separation programs resulted in an outflow of 100 million for the quarter and we contributed 600 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our UAW agreement, we reclassified 1.9 billion of VEBA assets to our cash and contributed 2.7 billion of cash to a temporary asset account. We received a tax-related payment from financial services of 900 million. Ford Credit did not pay Ford a dividend during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide four summarizes our liquidity on March 31st. Total liquidity including available credit lines was 40.6 billion. Automotive debt was 27.1 billion. Upon implementation of the independent VEBA, debt will increase by about 6.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Onto slide five, we are showing our planning assumptions and operational metrics for 2008. Total industry sales during the first quarter were equal to a <mark type="inaudible" /> of 15.6 million units in the U.S, and 18 million units in the 19 markets that we track in Europe.</p>
          <p>Based on the decline in economic conditions, we now expect the U.S. industry to be in the range of 15.3 to 15.6 million units for the full year and that includes medium and heavy trucks.</p>
          <p>European industry loaners could be above 17.6 million units for the full year. On the operational metrics, our current model quality continues to improve. And based on the latest surveys, Ford's initial quality in the U.S. was amongst the best in class. Automotive cost will reduce by 1.7 billion, consistent with our plan. Market share was down slightly compared with last year in the U.S., <mark type="inaudible" /> on track with our plan.</p>
          <p>Absolute operating cash flow was 1.5 billion negative. This also was consistent with our plan, and we continue to expect operating cash outflow and personnel separation payments to be in the range of 12 to 14 billion for 2007 through 2009. And capital expenditures were 1.4 billion, also consistent with our plan.</p>
          <p>Slide six shows our 2008 outlook by sector. We still expect the automotive full year pre-tax results to be a loss, but equal to or better than 2007 when you exclude Jaguar Land Rover from the results.</p>
          <p>First quarter results were aided by several positive factors that are not likely to continue to recur. These factors included recognition of market-to-market hedging gains as related to commodity price increases that are expected to be incurred from cost to sales and not offset by hedges in future quarters, reductions in warranty reserves and the increase in U.S. dealer inventories.</p>
          <p>In addition, we expect that the industry volumes will weaken somewhat from first quarter levels and vehicle segmentation will continue to shift away from areas where our share has been high.</p>
          <p>Financial services' 2008 pre-tax results were expected to be worse than 2007 but profitable for the full year. Total company pre-tax operating results excluding special items are expected to be a loss and worse than 2007, reflecting the expected decline in financial service results.</p>
          <p>We also expect special items to be less than 2007 with full year personnel related restructuring cost below 1 billion. And total pre-tax results are expected to be a loss, although improved compared with 2007, when you exclude Jaguar Land Rover from the results.</p>
          <p>On the slide seven, we provide an assessment of where we stand on achieving our key business metrics and financial goals. The profit improvements we are seeing in our ongoing automotive operations 1.2 billion this quarter and over 3 billion last year &#x2013; largely from our restructuring efforts and a strong flow of new products coming later this year give us added confidence that we will meet our 2009 profitability targets in spite of the economic conditions worse than we initially envisaged.</p>
          <p>We are committed to returning to profitability in 2009, and we see achievement of our 2008 cost reduction target as a key element in that plan. We will continue to focus on cost reductions in 2009 and the full benefits of the UAW agreement should be achieved by 2010. We expect the U.S. market share to be at the low end of the 14 to 15% range and we are still planning to be in the range of 12 to 14 billion cash outflows for 2007 to 2009 to fund operating losses and the restructuring of our business.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to K.R.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Slide eight shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the first quarter of 2008. We are reporting our Japan and Philippines operations as discontinued operations for the first quarter and prior periods reflecting our recent sale of these affiliates. Our Ford Credits results do include Jaguar and Land Rover financing profit as we will continue to own the present receivables and will provide financing for Jag and Land Rover dealers and customers during transitional period which can vary by market of up to 12 months.</p>
          <p>Now to the results of Ford Credit &#x2013; as shown in the left box our first quarter pre-tax profit was $36 million, which was down $257 million from a year ago. Shown below the box, excluding the impact of net losses related to market valuation adjustments from derivatives, pre-tax profits were at $195 million and that's down a 134 million from the first quarter of 2007. The net loss is related to market valuation adjustments of 159 million in the first quarter of 2008, 123 million worse than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>You can see in the right box our March 31st, 2008, managed receivables were $146 billion. That's about equal to a year ago and about a billion dollars higher than the fourth quarter 2007, which is not shown.</p>
          <p>Japan and Philippines receivables of about 2 billion are excluded from these numbers for both periods. As I mentioned during our fourth quarter earnings call, subvention related payments on contracts originated beginning January of this year are being made to us on an upfront basis. At the end of the first quarter the unearned portion for upfront subvention payments on finance receivables itself was about 700 million, and for managed receivable reporting we are going to exclude this 700 million and there's an appendix that gives you a little bit of walk.</p>
          <p>Charge offs for managed receivables in the first quarter of 2008 were 242 million and the world wide managed loss receivables were 66 basis points.</p>
          <p>On March 31st, the allowance for credit losses for on balance sheet receivables was 1.2 billion dollars or 84 basis points of receivables. This was up about 100 million from the fourth quarter 2007 which is not shown, and up about 200 million from a year ago. At March 31st our managed leverage was 9.4 to 1, compared with the 11.1 to 1 at March 31st, 2007.</p>
          <p>As discussed in our year end call we had planned to pay regular distributions in 2008 given the present credit market conditions, and to maintain greater flexibility in the execution of our funding plan, we have elected for now not to reinstate the distributions until market conditions improve. Managed leverage is not expected to reach the 11.5 to 1 by year end 2008 as was previously forecasted.</p>
          <p>Slide nine explains the changes in Ford Credit's pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. As previously mentioned the pre-tax earnings at Ford Credit was $36 million in the first quarter, $257 million lower than in 2007. The decrease in earnings primarily reflected higher provision for credit losses, higher depreciation expenses for leased vehicle and higher net losses related to market valuation adjustments from derivatives. These factors were offset partially by lower expenses primarily related to non recurrence cost associated with our North American business transformation initiatives and higher financing margin.</p>
          <p>Before quarter end, Ford paid us around $100 million under the terms of our Profit Maintenance Agreement. This first quarter cash payment did not impact our profit. It was recorded as a liability for FMCC and was eliminated in Ford's consolidated financial results. Consistent with our outlook of Ford Credit's profits and the terms of the Profit Maintenance Agreement, it is planned that we will repay Ford before the end of the year. Additional information concerning the profit maintenance is included in appendix 13.</p>
          <p>In summary, the continued weakness in the U.S. and Canadian used vehicle auction markets has adversely impacted the value of offbeat as well as repossessed vehicles. Delinquencies and repossessions have increased since last year in the U.S.  Ford Credit's financing margins have improved year-over-year.  Underlying market interest rates, especially in the U.S., have declined. However the repricing of risk is a partial offset.</p>
          <p>Finally I'd like to mention that Ford Credit's North American transformation to the business center, which continues to improve our operating efficiency and costs, was completed in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows quarterly trends of charge-offs and loss to receivable ratios for our on-balance sheet and managed portfolios. The top left box shows loss to receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio; the top right box shows loss to relievable ratios for the U.S. Ford Lincoln and Mercury retail and lease business. Both the on-balance sheet and managed loss to receivable ratios are up in the first quarter 2008 from a year ago levels, reflecting primarily increased severity per unit in the U.S. retail and lease portfolio.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2008 worldwide loss to receivable ratios shown in the top left box were also up from the fourth quarter. That primarily reflects lower recoveries in international regions. Offset partially by lower losses in North America. Shown in the top right box, the lower loss to receivable ratios in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 for Ford Lincoln and Mercury in the U.S., primarily reflects fewer <mark type="inaudible" />, higher recoveries and fewer other charge-offs, offset partially by the higher severity I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Consistent with this, managed charge-offs for the first quarter 2008 were $242 million and that's up $119 million from a year-ago levels, reflecting primarily increased severity per unit, higher repossessions, and other charge-offs in the U.S. retail and lease portfolio.</p>
          <p>Not shown on the slide but worth mentioning is that the worldwide loss to receivable levels in first quarter 2008, about half of what we experienced in 2002 and 2003 reflecting the improved quality of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 11 shows the primary drivers of the credit losses in the U.S. Ford Lincoln and Mercury retail and lease business. Repossessions in the first quarter 2008 were 20,000 units, up about 1,000 from the first quarter in 2007 and equal to the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Loss severity of $8,800 in the first quarter is $2,200 higher than last year and that primarily reflects auction value deterioration in the used vehicle market, an increase in the amount financed as well as the higher mix of 72 month contracts. Loss severity is $500 higher than the fourth quarter 2007 primarily reflecting the same factors I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Over-60-day delinquencies totaled 22 basis points in the first quarter 2008.  Although still within our expectations, delinquencies are up about 6 basis points from last year and down 1 basis point from the fourth quarter 2007. Bankruptcy filings totaled 8,000 in the first quarter, which is up about 2,000 compared with the first quarter of 2007 and up about 1,000 from the fourth quarter of 2007.  Bankruptcy filings continue at a very low level.</p>
          <p>In summary, the quality of the portfolio is very good. We continue to closely monitor our key loss metrics for any additional deterioration related to broader trends in the economy.</p>
          <p>I'll move to slide 12 it shows the lease residual performance for our Ford and Lincoln Mercury U.S. brands. Lease return volumes for the 48,000 units in the first quarter 2008 were just flat compared to the first quarter of 2007. Return rates however were up 2 points to 86%, consistent with the auction values that were lower than expected at the time contract was purchased and a general shift in the consumer preferences away from trucks and sport utility vehicles.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008, auction values for 24 and 36-month leased vehicles at constant mix were down about $1,270 and about 1,500 per unit respectively from a year-ago levels.  Primary reflecting the overall auction market value deteriorations in the used vehicle market.  For the same reason auction values were also down for both terms compared with the fourth quarter of 2007.  During the quarter, with our worldwide net investment in operating leases at 29.3 billion was down about 400 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>And with that I will turn it over to Neil.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks K.R and good morning everybody.  Slide 13 shows the trends in funding for our managed receivables. As K.R. mentioned, at the end of the first quarter managed receivables were 146 billion, up slightly from year-end 2007. Our year-end 2008 managed receivable forecast remains at 130 to $140 billion.</p>
          <p>We plan to continue holding a large cash balance.  We ended the quarter with 15.9 billion in cash including 5.7 billion to support on-balance sheet securitizations. Our year-end forecast for cash remains at 13 to 16 billion which will provide flexibility to us in the execution of our funding plan. Securitized funding was 54% of managed receivables at the end of the first quarter. We expect that securitization levels will remain at the high-end of the projected range of 49 to 54% through year-end.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14, Ford Credit funding strategy includes maintaining strong liquidity to meet near term funding obligations, by having a substantial cash balance and committed funding capacity with eligible assets available for funding. We plan to continue to diversify our global asset-backed funding capabilities and renew global asset-backed funding capacity. This includes maintaining a diversity of liquidity providers. We may access the unsecured debt market and we will continue to explore and execute alternative business arrangements in those locations where we lacked diverse funding capability, while also insuring that Ford has continued support in these markets if needed.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, shows our terms funding plans for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs, asset sales to our on balance sheet, asset-backed commercial paper programs or proceeds from revolving transactions. For 2008 our public term funding plans are in the range of 8 to 16 billion consisting of 8 to 14 billion of public securitizations and the potential of up to 2 billion of unsecured debt. Through yesterday we have completed about 4 billion of public term securitization funding transactions in the U.S. and Germany, including 1.5 billion U.S. retail transactions, we completed this week.</p>
          <p>As shown at the bottom of the page, we have substantial private funding sources in addition to our access to the public markets. These are largely asset-backed securitization programs for retail, lease and wholesale assets in various countries around the world. This private funding provides us flexibility in the execution of our funding plan.</p>
          <p>For 2008 we are forecasting 15 to 22 billion of private funding. Year-to-date we have completed 8 billion including lease, wholesale and retail asset-backed securitizations.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, details our liquidity programs and the utilization against those programs. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity in our liquidity programs which include unsecured credit facilities, our FCAR program and unrated notes facility and conduit capacity. As of March 31st, we had 71.9 billion of capacity in cash. As of March 31, liquidity was 62.8 billion, of which 38.9 billion was utilized, leaving about 24 billion available for use, given our present level of eligible receivables. Most of our available liquidity is in bank-sponsored conduits which is generally accessible within two days. Additionally, our cash that is not related to securitization is also available immediately.</p>
          <p>In addition to the 24 billion of liquidity available for use 3.4 billion of capacity, excess of eligible receivables, provides an incremental funding source for future originations. Not reflected in the liquidity numbers for the first quarter, are 1.5 billion of proceeds from the April 1st sale of PRIMUS Japan and the 1.5 billion public retail securitization transaction completed in the U.S. this week. About half of the 56 billion of committed capacity is up for renewal before year-end.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date we have renewed about 5 billion of bank-sponsored conduit capacity including the renewal of most of our 364 day wholesale funding commitments.</p>
          <p>Also, given the nature of the asset-backed committed facilities, we have the ability to obtain term funding up to the time the facilities expire. At that point, any outstanding debt at expiration remains outstanding through the term of the underlying assets.</p>
          <p>So in summary Ford Motor Company was profitable in the first quarter led by strong results at Ford Europe and Ford South America. Ford North America pre-tax results improved by nearly 600 million compared to last year. Automotive gross cash at quarter end remained strong at 28.7 billion. Cash together with available automotive credit lines provided liquidity of 40.6 billion.</p>
          <p>For Ford Credit pre-tax profit was 36 million and net income was 24 million. Excluding the net losses related to market valuation adjustments for derivatives, pre-tax profits in the quarter were 195 million. Ford Credit's North America business centre restructuring was completed in March of this year. Ford Credit completed 12 billion of term funding year-to-date, about one-third of our plan. Ford Credit's liquidity remains solid with available liquidity for use of 24 billion, and committed asset-backed funding capacity beyond our present needs.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to <mark type="inaudible" /> to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Okay, great. And your point too was on that, even if they hadn't been renewed there's backup conduit, so the assets would just roll off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the point I was making to the extent that the &#x2013; we have up until the day they mature to fund them in a term format, and at which the point the assets would stay and just liquidate from there. So even though they are 364 day facilities, we have the ability to fund them up until the day before they mature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and then the liquidity available for use on that slide, slide 16, where you have 24 billion. That doesn't include though an incremental 3 billion from the proceeds in Japan and the securitization that you just included?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then in terms of the profit and maintenance agreement, that 109 million. I was just looking at the actual document, is the pre-tax income measured with derivative for the 36 million what's reported?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You don't back up derivatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Monica it's fairly straightforward from the standpoint &#x2013; it is measured on an annualized basis. And it measures Ford Credit's PBT has to be at least 2% of an invested capital, and that is effectively our equity level at the end of last year. Little adjustment for a minority interest &#x2013; or the other one is net income of at least 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I use the 36 then, as a pre-tax for this quarter? You wouldn't back out the derivative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you do not; it is our bottom low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And in terms of severity, I mean obviously frequency seems to not really be picking that much. It's the severity that you must be watching fairly closely, and given what Manheim and use prices have been doing, can you talk to us a little bit there about what trends you're seeing, what do you think things are going to get materially worse there? Are we closer to the bottom, and how do you think about forecasting on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question Monica; the issue that's really floating around is, one is gas prices, oil prices, and what that will do to the market in general; and then the overall U.S. economy I think is the other big piece. What we have been seeing, if you look at the Manheim Index itself, comparing this year first quarter versus last year's fist quarter, the index itself was down about 5%. But that is the total used car market. Our lease portfolio is much more weighted toward trucks and SUVs, and we &#x2013; we actually saw auction prices down about 8% on a constant mix basis. So we are actually have seen a little bit worse than what the Manheim Index would indicate based on the mix of our portfolio. As far as going forward, it really depends on where the economy goes. I &#x2013; I can't go in much more than that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of April delinquencies, can you comment a little bit on what you are seeing there, and then I am done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure' on April through yesterday, basically tracking what we saw on the first quarter, as far as delinquencies go, compared to last year, up a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Up a little bit, sequentially or year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year-on-year, sorry. Usually there's a seasonality component that goes with delinquencies and repos and comes off little bit; it's not up sequentially, but it is up versus last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Mark Altherr with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. Could you &#x2013; it looks like Ford might drill back on paying you dividends depending on how the year goes. Part of that was an offset to the subvention payments. Are those still on track to be pretty much cleared up this year and next year? I think it was 6.3 billion at the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let &#x2013; let me address that. The upfront subvention payments are for all the new business that's placed after January 01 of 2008. The old subvention that wasn't paid upfront which was roughly the 6 billion from before, that will take several years for it to roll off. I think it finally ends up being gone by 2011. There is a very small piece left, I think at that point. But it is over the life of the original contract, so if you did a 72 month contract Ford is still paying the credit company a little bit of that subvention on a monthly basis. So that will take a little bit of time to roll off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so at the current run rate, you could probably expect to see that billion dollars repeated each quarter, is that &#x2013; would that be a good estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you spike up at first but then it will slowly &#x2013; it's kind of like the reverse of the subvention rolling off. It won't be as high as a billion a quarter, it will be maybe half of that by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In response to I guess the, a little uptake here in delinquencies, have you tightened up FICO scoring or anything else in response to the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not changed our underwriting standards at all; we are still buying a full spread of business and continue to support the automotive brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you that, you know one of the things that comes up is what are we doing on the collections side of the equation because we do have a &#x2013; I think &#x2013; a world class service in operation. And compared to last year, we have increased our collections staff a little bit. But then again, you know we tend to utilize our behavioral scoring models to predict the probability to default &#x2013; and it continues to allow us to prioritize and focus our collection efforts, which I think are really paying off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess the last question on the loan loss reserve as a percentage of the outstandings, it picked up a little bit but you are still sort of keeping track. Is that how we should look at that as you will respond in the quarter to what you were seeing in loss severity in the quarter to keep it sort of somewhat under 1%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no target like a 1% or target like that but there is something that we continually focus on and we do watch the LTR's &#x2013; loss to receivables &#x2013; as well as we have a model that also does a little bit predictive on the reserves as well. Its basically a look over time to see how the market is moving and what the impact should be to the reserve.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now what we have seen year-to-date is a weakness, we would have expected &#x2013; normally at this time of year we would expect an improvement versus say the end of last year. I will give you an example, last year for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of '06 it was our auction guys were up about 5%, this year they are down 4% versus the fourth quarter. Normally you get a seasonal uplift in the auction market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that this reflects basically the overall weakness in the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. How about the vehicles coming off leases, is that something that could be a factor going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned, we have a fairly sizeable portfolio of Trucks and SUV's right now, and that's what's been rolling off, like in the first quarter I think roughly 74% of our vehicles that came off lease were trucks and SUVs. Now what we got going on in the auto company is that we've been selling a lot more of the crossover vehicles, and a lot more cars, and that's going to slowly move to the cars and crossover which are holding up much better in the auction market, then what the trucks and SUVs are, and I think lot is driven by gas prices, fuel costs and the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Now are you noticing that the Fed funds rate decline is translating to lower auto loan rates for captive finance subs like Ford Motor Credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a competitive basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In other words, how are auto loan rates behaving, given the fact that the fed funds rate have been coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can talk about the credit company itself. If you think back about since when I guess August or so, Fed funds are down from five and a quarter to two and a quarter. At the same time, there is a bit of repricing of risk that's going on in the market, and I'm talking here retail U.S. markets, the largest and easiest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now compared to &#x2013; we did a retail ABS transaction last August and we just completed one last week. Total, it's down a little bit, but not the three points that the Fed has reduced on Fed funds, maybe fifty bits or so, and that does translate into lower rates in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All Right. To what do you attribute the lack of a direct correlation between the Fed funds rate decline and general auto loan rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of it is the underlying funding cost of the institutions are combined with not only the underlying rate but also spreads, and I think as non-captives are feeling the pain of some of their other business lines, they are also reprising some of these assets as well and/or not originating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think the amount of competitors out there and the size at they were is less and credit spreads have offset some of the reduction in borrowing rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right; do higher costs in the ABS market have to do with the stickiness in rates despite the Fed funds decline or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in other words are our asset back transactions costing us more today than they were a year...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, is that having an impact on the stickiness in terms of lower auto loan rates in the face of substantially lower fed funds rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think its kept auto rates from dropping lower than they would have dropped, <mark type="inaudible" /> been the credit spread problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right where do you see 60-day delinquency rates trending moving forward? Are you noticing credit standards not Ford Motor Credit but in general industry being timed given higher the delinquencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really always comes back to the same thing it is where is the economy going to go I mean right now we have seen deterioration versus last year if &#x2013; whatever by doing in the market place the Fed as well as the government has this stimulative effect hopefully it wont go up any higher and may be come down a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does vary by originator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean if you look at different participants in the market place the delinquencies do vary and so a lot of the reports that have been issued that tries to combine the industry together doesn't give you as much clarity as if you look at the individual originators which will have different asset performances.</p>

          <p>I think we are working hard. We have made a lot of &#x2013; progress over the years with our relationships and with consistent asset performance that these are still very valuable assets for a lot of our bank providers of this types of facilities, it will cost us more there is no question. But we are pretty confident that we can get the majority of it matured or renewed.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good, the banks aren't doing that well right now and it looks like they are tightening out their lending, but you feel confident with that, that's good. On the ABS side, the deal you recently did looked like, it was like, swaps was 200 and for the lowest AAA tranche I think. If you would have issue that swaps of 350 or 400 would that so work &#x2013; that will be economical to do? Because people were fearing that we were headed that direction. It's hard to know what's profitable funding and what's not.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Andrews [PIMCO].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys. Yeah, still a little confused on that &#x2013; on that motor company question. I understand the hedging &#x2013; I was trying to move out &#x2013; outside of the hedging, what was causing that commodity year-over-year improvement, that wasn't hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean you're looking at a full year number of eight-tenths negative right, which is &#x2013; primarily the commodity increases and comparing that to a one tenth favorable in the first quarter. So it is a full year comparison versus quarter one. So you can't make that comparison, you got to look at it on the basis that, we are roughly running at about 200 tens negative a quarter. In the first quarter, because we had the hedging gains, we had a positive, because the &#x2013; the underlying commodity cost increase was about 200 negative. The gain was about 300 positive, so we had a slight gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm with you. I got you. Sorry about that. Okay and then the credit company question I had was the <mark type="inaudible" /> vehicles you have mentioned, 74% trucks and SUV's. Presuming those are all of the vehicles that were sold two to three years ago, at least primarily most of those are. And any reasons why that mix will shift over the next two to three or four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. I need to correct myself, I said 74 but it was really 76. I was going off my memory. What's really going to start happening I'll give you an example. What came back in the first quarter of that total 100%, 4% were crossovers and that's the Edge, the MKX, the Taurus X. And you're right, these are all two-three, three and a half year old vehicles coming back off lease. Now as the auto company has been selling more of the crossover vehicles as a percent of their total as well as the smaller cars are doing much more, much better in this environment. It is going to switch over, over time. I am not trying to imply that it is going to switch over immediately. It is going to take a little bit of time to work through the portfolio itself but it will start to switch over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; that I understand. It seemed like more logically the next at least quarter or two, will probably going to be pretty close to that type of mix and then as you said over time that it will slowly start to migrate back into the product just for selling for the past years since oil prices have changed. But it sort of gets me back to that 1.8 billion run rate of depreciation for the quarter. Sounds like, we are probably going to be pretty close to that range in the next couple of quarters now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I don't want to really give a forecast on it because a lot of it depends on where the market goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but nothing else going on in the market that we can see in terms of the used market that's either a secular shift or a short-term cyclical shift that did not play on the first quarter, that you expect or the second or third?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I don't really think so; I did look at before this call I usually try to gather what's going on in April so far to make sure we are up on top of everything and so far through April it has been pretty much in line with our forecasts which wasn't a material change from what the run rate has been for auction values.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just a couple of questions, first of all wanted to keep on the theme of leasing margins and since and I guess just to make sure that I understand &#x2013; when looking at the margin is it simple as taking the lease revenue and taking up the depreciation or are there some other factors that we should consider in thinking about the leasing margins, maybe there is an interest component for example that would play into the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is a small piece. There is some rental income in there, so that's small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But essentially it's &#x2013; I mean it's a negative margin business right now if I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I'm not trying to imply that at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The lease business, it is a portfolio. The vehicles that came off lease in the first quarter, for example, they were not &#x2013; I would say not positive from when we originally placed the business two to three years ago. However, as a total portfolio perspective, and as you place the new business obviously, we believe that we've placed it profitably, but you get caught in these spikes and downturns on residual values, sometimes in the past we've had some really good quarters where the auction prices are very strong, much better than what we had expected and some quarters you get into where it's a deterioration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Overall...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if I helped you on that, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the reconciliation may be as it &#x2013; in the quarter, it was negative margin. If you look at the financials but maybe over the longer running you're proposing that that what others would be positive...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other I think should point out is you would also get some depreciation is, something on the depreciation where you are depreciating the vehicles that are in your portfolio over time. It's a straight line basis from a point in time. So you can get into a quarter, for example, first quarter is actually a good example, where we were depreciating vehicles but at the same time &#x2013; to where you think they're going to end up at &#x2013; but at the same time, you ended up on the vehicles that came back, got a little bit larger residual loss. At one point in time, that we were not expecting when we had previously depreciated those vehicles up to the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just, while we're on that topic, may be an administrative question on slide 12. It seems that in the bottom left panel, the return rates, seems that some of the historical numbers, for some of the previous quarters that have changed from previous disclosures. Was there a change in what's reflected in those numbers or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good point; maybe I should have pointed it out earlier. But what this shows now is Ford Lincoln, Mercury U.S. and what we were showing before was North America. We decided to switch it over to U.S. to be consistent with the rest of the chart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So previously, those numbers were lower so the return rates are actually higher in the U.S. versus I guess non-U.S. but I would think that's a significantly smaller slice of the puzzle outside the U.S?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Its also &#x2013; this is again, Ford, Lincoln Mercury, so it didn't include jags and Land Rovers and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other non-Ford Lincoln Mercury vehicles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Now, I also &#x2013; I wanted to follow-up on some of the previous questions regarding the conduit capacity, and I think it's been fully addressed that of the 30 billion in capacity that you have about 5 billion of that has been renewed and that that was primarily related to wholesale. So the first question would be does that imply that the remainder is related to retail or is there another component? And then secondly, can you talk about the maturity profiles of what's remaining in the conduit bucket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the majority of what's left in the conduit capacity that's up for renewal is retail oriented. So I think you're correct with that, and I think the calendarization of that is pretty well even throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you &#x2013; of the one-half of the 56, which I guess is 28 billion, is there &#x2013; can you characterize for us how much of that incremental, let's say 25 billion in conduit capacity is due for renewal this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say, from the standpoint of &#x2013; if you just walk across the slide 16, the top of the bar, you &#x2013; and I'm not going to be overly specific, but I would say about a third of the unsecured credit facilities mature, about half of the FCAR facility comes due; the unrated note program, the majority of that matures in 2009 or 2010; and then, the conduits about half. And those were sort of full year numbers, so there's been a little of that done, the 5 billion of that's been done in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I have a question on the receivables. It looks like your manage receivables estimates for 2008 are lower now than they were on the last conference call. And I'm just curious if you guys are changing things because funding is more difficult or if that's reflective of what you think is with the sales rate for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not <mark type="inaudible" />. In the last call itself, we were at the 135 to145 level. And we actually changed that when we get to the 10-K and took that down to 130 to 140, and we've been at that level since that point in time. There's no effort to slow down or stop receivables at this point in time. There is some natural things that will happen this year such as &#x2013; as I mentioned earlier, we sold the Japan affiliate, for example. And I also mentioned Jaguar and Land Rover, we'll continue to support them up over the next 12 months but some of that could happen this year as well, where it starts to go away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, this is mostly divestitures. It's not necessarily having anything to do with funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not with funding, I would say it has to do with the economy as &#x2013; when it has an impact on the automotive industry. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's not funding driven, but it is the economy driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you guys &#x2013; I know you sound pretty confident about your ability to renew the facilities that are maturing but if they &#x2013; if you were not as successful in that, how do you &#x2013; just strategically, how do we think about you managing that lack of funding capacity and still trying to support Ford in their auto sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think part of it is the fact that we're going into it with more capacity than we have assets available for it, so that 3.4 billion that I mentioned of capacity and excess of eligible assets, so I'm starting with more than a 100% so there is ability to lose some. And I think from the standpoint is we really &#x2013; the diversity of our funding sources, the different institutions, not just in the U.S. but around the world gives us a lot of flexibility and ability to fund the assets in the markets where they are funded.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we're continuing to work on alternative business arrangements in some of the smaller markets. I don't want to be overly specific there but there is some in the works and we will continue to work toward renewing all these capacities. So I think we have a lot of flexibility around losing some. Obviously, if you lost a lot of them you would have to rethink which markets you are doing business in.</p>

          <p>Not really. Not on the ones we've done so far this year. I think it's been &#x2013; and it's been across all asset classes as well. So I mean it's lease, retail, wholesale and so I think the assets still talk &#x2013; I mean, the quality of the assets, the way they are &#x2013; the way they perform, the consistency of how they perform, we haven't changed the filters on what we're doing from the standpoint of how the pools are selected.

          <p>And I think from the &#x2013; from the auto side, I think there's been a very big strategic push to continue to right size inventories and keep the day's supply at a level that is manageable, so we haven't flushed a lot of vehicles into the dealer system, which would create additional financing requirements for the dealer, which would create additional financing requirements for Ford Credit. So there's a concerted effort to balance what's on the dealer inventory.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then you look &#x2013; looking at the derivative adjustments, what was the big cause of the year-over-year swing in that derivative adjustment? Was it because of the drop in LIBOR? Is that kind of what we should look at modeling that going forward?</p>

          <p>What you get it &#x2013; I know &#x2013; the problem is &#x2013; we said last year that we wouldn't have had no designated hedges, so this &#x2013; in 2008, we got back into designated hedging. The concept behind that is to minimize the profit, accounted profit volatility, and has nothing to do with the economics underlying why we're doing the swaps. But what you end up getting into is you have the capability to manage your portfolio and designate a portion of it, so you can offset a parallel shift in the yield curve, the complete yield curve from one month all the way out to ten years. And if it's a parallel shift, you end up getting no news. However, when you get a twist up or a twist down, you get news, and that's basically what it is or the twist up in the U.S. LIBOR curve; was a big chunk of it. And again, this is more than just the U.S. LIBOR curve, it's the Canadian LIBOR curve, it's EURIBOR, it's all the pieces. So when you get that model put together, let me know.</p>
