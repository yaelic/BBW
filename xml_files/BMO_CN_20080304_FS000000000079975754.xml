          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the BMO Financial Group's First Quarter 2008 Conference Call for March 4th. Your host for today is Viki Lazaris, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Lazaris, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today. Presenting today are Bill Downe, BMO's CEO; Tom Flynn, Treasurer and Acting Chief Financial Officer; and Bob McGlashan our Chief Risk Officer. The following members of the management team are also with us this afternoon, Yvan Bourdeau and Tom Milroy from BMO Capital Markets; Gilles Ouellette from the Private Client Group; Frank Techar, Head of P&amp;C Canada; Ellen Costello from P&amp;C US and Barry Gilmour, Head of Technology and Operation.</p>
          <p>After our presentation the management team will be available to answer questions from pre-qualified analysts. To give everyone an opportunity to participate today, we ask you that you please ask only one or two questions and then re-queue.</p>
          <p>At this time, we'd like to caution our listeners by stating the following on behalf of those speaking today. Forward-looking statements may be made during this call and there are risks that actual results could differ materially from forecasts, projections or conclusions in the forward-looking statements. Certain material factors and assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusion or making the forecast or projection in these forward-looking statements. You may find additional information about such material factors and assumptions and the material factors that could cause actual results to so differ in our caution regarding forward-looking statements set forth in our news release today or on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>With that said, I'll hand things over to Bill now to start off the call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Viki, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today from Quebec City where this morning BMO held its 190th annual meeting with shareholders. As noted, my comments may include some forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Tom is going to take you through the financial results in a few moments but clearly the quarter was dominated by charges we announced in the environment in which we're operating. I'm going to address these issues upfront including steps we've proactively taken and will be taking to manage our businesses in this challenging environment. That said, I want to continue with the theme prevalent in recent meetings we've had with the investor community around momentum in P&amp;C Canada. I can tell you we're addressing market difficulties and maintaining a focus on our core businesses simultaneously and most importantly a focus on our customers.</p>
          <p>We recognize that the US market is already slowing and we're cautious with respect to the impact that, that may have on the Canadian market. Since last fall, we've taken prudent actions to build excess liquidity to further diversify our funding sources and to extend the maturity of our obligations. Despite these actions, our NIM is only down two basis points, quarter-over-quarter. From a credit perspective we've supplemented our general allowance this quarter. Given concerns about the slowdown in the economy, the increase has been allocated entirely to the US and we've been highly vigilant with respect to our specific provision.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Operating Groups, let me first address BMO Capital Markets where our overall results have been disappointing even in the context of recent capital markets. While a number of our businesses in this group have been performing well, in particular equity underwriting and some trading operations, our objective to produce a consistent and stable 20% return on equity has been undermined by credit market loss. We're coming out of a period where banks have not been fully compensated for risk taking. We expect the re-pricing of risks will have a positive impact on our business in the future.</p>
          <p>And as I described at our AGM this morning, our efforts to de-risk the business are continuing. More specifically, we're reducing the size of our off balance sheet businesses and seeking a better balance between risk and return. In order to reduce volatility, we are ensuring that our trading activities are supporting clients with whom we have broad and valued relationships. We will reduce capital allocated to other trading areas as well. We'll also reduce capital allocated to certain lending portfolios where the returns are not sufficiently attractive. The business represents the first line of defense in risk and are accountable for ensuring they remain in line with our risk appetite, and this has been reinforced.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our Risk Management Group will have increased direct corporate oversight into risk return decisions made by the businesses. In line with the commitment we made last spring, we've succeeded in significantly reducing the risk in our commodity business over the past nine months and I have confidence in BMO Capital Markets ability to de-risk other businesses and generate consistent and strong returns.</p>
          <p>BMO's been making every effort to complete the restructuring of Apex. This included investing $705 million in the vehicle to support it despite not having an obligation to do so. In order to support a successful restructuring, we may provide additional support. The problems with Apex are primarily due to a widening of credit spreads not due to the underlying quality of the assets. The asset quality is very good and if we hold these assets to maturity we can avoid crystallizing the mark-to-market loss that exists today. If a restructuring can be achieved, we believe this course of action is in the best interest of shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the SIVs, as you're aware, we announced on February 19th our decision proposing to provide senior rank support for the lending of Links and Parkland. Although the SIVs have been very successful to-date in their plan to reduce the size of the portfolios, and that's been via asset sales and capital note swaps, the capacity of the credit market to absorb MTN maturities without impacting price levels has slowed. These new facilities will bridge the retirement of MTNs, which will occur a little bit faster than the maturing assets or asset sales. And it will provide them with supplemental funding, permit them to continue to sell assets in an orderly manner, and facilitate SIVs' access for their senior funding.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we're now in a better position to provide this support, given the significantly lower size of the SIVs, and the reduction in the ABC inventory on our balance sheet. The rating agencies recognized this fact when they confirmed our ratings. The maintenance of the SIVs ratings was very important, because investors facing a significant downgrade could have been required to sell their notes due to investment restrictions. We're satisfied by our team's progress to-date, and will continue to keep you updated. Since we announced our intention to provide senior rank support to the SIVs on February 19th, we've had asset reductions of $1.5 billion in Links, and &#x20AC;250 million in Parkland. Bob is going to make some further comments in his remarks, but as of this morning, Links is below $10 billion, and Parkland is below &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the other operating groups, there was solid performance in our retail business. We've seen positive momentum from the investments we've made. In P&amp;C Canada, core revenues were up 1.6%, quarter-over-quarter, while expenses were held essentially flat. As a result, earnings of 302 million were up 5% versus Q4 2007. We're encouraged by the quarter-over-quarter market share improvements in personal deposits, and are very pleased to see continued share growth in both personal and business loans. This quarter, we saw improved mortgage growth and spread, and branch originated mortgage growth outpaced the impact of our exit of third-party and broker mortgages last year.</p>
          <p>In fiscal 2008, we've implemented individual scorecards to provide a clear indication of performance against expectations. It's showing up in accelerated balance sheet growth. In addition, we're encouraged by improvements in Net Promoter Score across most of our operating districts in the last three months. As you know, we've made significant investments in customer facing initiatives, such as 22 new and 31 redeveloped branches last year, and we're going to stay the course on our strategic initiatives. At the same time, we're going to manage discretionary expenses, and we'll slow hiring where necessary, until we have greater clarity on how the economy is going to unfold.</p>
          <p>In P&amp;C US, cash net income of 33 million for the quarter was up from 30 million in Q1 '07, although down 5 million from Q4 when, as I said at the time, the stars had definitely lined up for the Group. Yesterday we announced the completion of the acquisitions of Ozaukee Bank, and Merchants and Manufacturers Bancorporation, both based in Wisconsin, and that will add 41 full-service branches to our network. The US remains highly competitive. There is -- that we are facing soft-housing markets and lower economic growth, but management is focused on effectively managing expenses, for example slowing new-branch openings and shifting investments to faster pay-back opportunities like business banking. Our marketplace has been somewhat disrupted by a large transaction by one of our competitors, and this has created opportunity. In both P&amp;C and Capital Markets we've successfully recruited teams, and in the commercial marketplace we're converting clients.</p>
          <p>In PCG earnings were down 5% to $98 million as revenues were up 2% and expenses up 3%. Year-over-year net income, however, was up 8%. The first quarter includes expenses that will not recur for the balance of the year, and this was solid performance in the current environment. Based on this management team's track record for managing expenses, I'm confident they can deliver positive operating leverage for the year. And the Dalbar Mutual Funds Service awarded in January for the best overall customer service confirms our commitment to our customers.</p>
          <p>This morning we announced the second quarter dividend of $0.70 per share, unchanged from the prior quarter. This was a prudent decision given the uncertainty of the economic outlook in the next couple of quarters and what the impact of the US recession might mean to Canada. Our current dividend is the mid point of our payout range of 45 to 55%, the highest among peers and over the last two years we've increased our common share dividend by 32%.</p>
          <p>Further to that, I would like to speak about our revised economic outlook. While we hope the US will still have slightly positive growth in the first two quarters, it's unlikely we'll see the full benefit of fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts until Q3 and Q4. Looking at Canada, while the situation is better and the economy is continuing to grow, growth is slower than when we announced our 2008 targets. There's still a significant amount of uncertainty in the market and all of our businesses will clearly be impacted by future events.</p>
          <p>While we continue to believe the conditions in both countries will be better in the latter half of the year, we do not expect to achieve our original financial targets. However, we still intend to measure our performance against them.</p>
          <p>And now Tom will now walk us through the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bill, and good afternoon. Certain of my comments may be forward-looking so please note the caution regarding forward-looking statements on Slide one. On Slide three, and as Bill mentioned, you can see that reported earnings were 255 million, or $0.47 per share, down 30% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>These earnings reflect the challenging capital market and economic environments. There were a number of significant items in Q1 that lowered earnings by 362 million, or $0.72 per share. These items are noted on slide four. Excluding these items, earnings were 617 million and cash EPS was $1.21. The tier one ration remained strong at 9.48% based on Basel II capital and 9.05% based on Basel I capital.</p>
          <p>Slide four shows the significant items taken in Q1 and they make up the $362 million charge I referred to. The first five items on the slide relate to the capital market's environment. First we recorded a charge of $158 million related to exiting positions we had hedged with the monoline insurer, ACA Financial Guarantee Corporation. The next two items relate primarily to the impact of widening credit spreads on a number of our trading portfolios.</p>
          <p>We had a charge of $99 million due to trading and structured credit related positions, preferred shares and third party Canadian conduits, and a charge of 78 million for counter party credit risk on our derivative assets, approximately half related to monoline insurers other than ACA and credit derivative companies.</p>
          <p>Finally, we took a charge of $130 million on our investment in Apex/Sitka Trust, a structured finance vehicle to which the bank does not provide backup liquidity and a $23 million charge related to the capital notes at the Links and Parkland SIVs. In addition, we increased our general allowance by $60 million this quarter and Bob will comment further on this item later.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six, you will see that revenues were down about 8% quarter-over-quarter, revenue was down 1% excluding significant items. Year-over-year revenues decreased 2% on a reported basis and 2.4% excluding the significant items.</p>
          <p>Turning to the components of revenue starting on slide seven. You can see that net interest income was 1.2 billion in Q1, up slightly on both comparative quarters. Looking more specifically at the margins, total bank margin declined by a modest 2 basis points from Q4, margins increased in P&amp;C Canada quarter-over-quarter due to an improved prime to BA [banker's acceptances rate] differential and a positive impact of product mix from growth and higher spread products.</p>
          <p>Margins in P&amp;C US declined 15 basis points excluding the impact of the transfer of a small client driven investment portfolio from corporate. The decline is attributable to competitive pressures and shifting client preferences in both consumer and commercial.</p>
          <p>The total bank margin has also been impacted by items that lowered corporate net interest revenue. On slide eight, we look at non-interest revenue &#x2013; non-interest revenue was impacted by the capital market charges reflected in trading revenues. In Q4 '07 we increased our liability for future customer redemptions related to our customer loyalty rewards program and recorded a gain on the sale of our MasterCard shares, which is shown in security gains.</p>
          <p>On a quarter-over-quarter basis NIR in P&amp;C Canada was flat as higher insurance and securitization revenues were offset by lower cards and investment products revenue. PCG's NIR improved due to higher fee based revenue in private banking.</p>
          <p>BMO capital market's revenues were lower due to lower M&amp;A, debt underwriting and lending fees, with some higher trading revenue and equity underwriting fees.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide ten, you can see that we remain focused on managing expenses in this environment. Expenses have declined both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. I would remind you that in Q1 of each year, we expense performance based compensation for employees eligible to retire. This amounted to approximately 49 million in Q1 of '08 compared to 42 million in Q1 of '07. While we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses to support future growth, we will be cautious with our level of spend in this environment.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide eleven, you can see that our capital ratios on both Basel II and Basel I remained strong and Basel II our tier one capital ratio was 9.48% and that is well above our target, minimum of 8% on a Basel I basis our tier one capital ratio was 9.05%.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets were up approximately 10 billion under Basel I with this primarily due to the affect of foreign exchange and higher loans and acceptances under Basel II our requited asset were 179 billion and Bob will make some comments on RWA and Basel II.</p>
          <p>As a result of the Basel II implementation obviously measures of risk-weighted assets, capital and capital ratios are not fully comparable relative to Q4. Looking ahead, the balance of the year will be challenging given the weaker economic outlook and the capital market environment. We remain consciously optimistic that P&amp;C Canada will build momentum through the year. Our private client group will be impacted by markets, but is well positioned and will continue to manage expenses well.</p>
          <p>In Capital Markets, the performance of our trading businesses will be impacted by the environment in which we operate, and in corporate Services we expect that a number of individually small items that affected Q1 will not recur in subsequent quarters. And with that I'll turn things over to Bob.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin I would like to draw your attention to the caution regarding forward-looking statements on slide two. Slide three identifies that a further deterioration in the credit environment resulted in Q1 specific PCL of $170 million, as well as increase gross impaired loans and formations. Total PCL of 230 million included a 60 million increase in the general allowance. This increase reflects portfolio growth as well as some negative risk migration related to the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>Slide four shows an increase in US consumer delinquencies, reflecting the current credit quality issues associated with the US housing market. Elevated US delinquency levels at 41 basis points compared favorably to our US peer group at 71 basis points and our Canadian consumer portfolio at 32 basis points is in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>On slide five specific PCL has trended upward notably in Q1, driven in part by deterioration in the US real estate development sector. Our US real estate development portfolio is not large at 1% of total bank loan book and is a smaller proportion of our US book than our peer banks. However, we continue to pay close attention to this portfolio.</p>
          <p>In addition, a single transaction accounted for a $38.5 million. We expect volatility to continue into 2008 given current market conditions. New specific provisions are also trending upward, as expected at this stage of the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>On slide six, on a comparative basis, Q1 '08 specific PCL represents 31 basis points of average net loans and acceptances, and remains below our 16 year average of 33 basis points and our Canadian peer group average of 54 for the same period.</p>
          <p>As seen on slide seven, both gross impaired loan formations and balances have increased, reflecting deterioration in the economic environment. The transaction referenced on slide five however, accounted for $459 million of the increase. This US company is in the business of purchasing troubled mortgages at a discount and asset coverage has declined along with US housing prices.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide eight and looking forward, we're now anticipating the current market environment will produce a weaker credit environment in fiscal 2008, with additional pressure provided by continuing high energy prices, a strong Canadian dollar and further softening in the US economy. As a result, and in light of Q1 PCL, we're unlikely to achieve our specific PCL target for fiscal 2008 of 475 million or less. A better indicator would be to use our Q1 specifics of 170 million as a run rate for the year.</p>
          <p>As shown on Slides nine and 10, SIV assets are less than half the amount they were on July 31st,'07. Our position in the SIVs is outlined in this slide. We currently have an investment value of $32 million in capital notes after Q1 write-downs, previously mentioned by Tom, and US677 million and &#x20AC;72 million in outstanding senior notes.</p>
          <p>We've finalized an agreement to provide senior rank support for the funding of Links and Parkland. Under the terms of the agreement, the amounted facility is senior notes, less cash capped at US11 billion and &#x20AC;1.2 billion respectively, which will back stop the repayment of senior note obligations to facilitate access to senior funding and support the continued management of the SIVs, together with continuation of the strategy of selling assets in an orderly manner.</p>
          <p>Our analysis, after extensive discussions with the rating agencies, was that the SIVs would get downgraded to such an extent that a defeasements process would kick in. This process would likely result in our losing control of the pace of the wind down, which we felt would place the SIV senior investors at potential risk of loss. The facility has an 18-month term and given recent asset sales, the effective cap for these facilities has been reduced to US10 billion and &#x20AC;950 million.</p>
          <p>The asset quality of the SIVs remain strong, 94% of the assets are rated AA or better by Moody's and over 80% by Standard &amp; Poor's. To further substantiate asset quality, cumulative discounts on asset sales to date have been 238 basis points for Links and 267 for Parkland. And our recent sales have been in the 431 basis points and 493 basis points range respectively.</p>
          <p>For a loss to be incurred by the senior debt holder, a discount of 664 basis points for Links and 1,253 basis points for Parkland would have to be incurred on the sale of the remaining assets before the capital notes were reduced to zero, thus providing a still significant margin, protecting the senior debt from loss.</p>
          <p>There's not been a material increase in concentration risk to date. And as asset dispositions have been largely well spread across all risk categories. If the underlying assets are held to maturity we're confident any losses would be small and well within the remaining capital note holder's amount. Our liquidity facilities will effectively allow Links and Parkland to avoid the liquidity discount the market currently has built into the NAV by providing us the flexibility to sell assets for full economic value as the market is prepared to absorb them.</p>
          <p>On Slide 11, the next five months maturity schedules are provided. Based on the maturity schedules, 2 billion cash on hand, our expectation of asset dispositions and the possibility if new senior notes given a support provided by our liquidity facility. We do not expect draws under our facility to exceed 50%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the subject of Apex and Sitka, as described previously by Bill and Tom, our current exposure net of accumulative valuation adjustments of 210 million is 495 million. As noted on Slide 12 and 13, Apex/Sitka are standalone funding vehicles setup to underwriter credit protection. To secure and fund the CDS obligations, Apex/Sitka issued 2.1 billion of ABCP and MTNs. Premium income received from the swap counter parties is partially used to fund interest on these debt instruments.</p>
          <p>Apex/Sitka CDS portfolio was structured by the swap counter parties with BIMO administering the trusts. BIMO does not provide backup liquidity lines, those being provided by the swap counter parties in the event of a market disruption. The portfolio quality remains high. ABCP and MTNs were rated R1 high and AAA respectively by DBRS.</p>
          <p>The CDS portfolio is comprised of 443 names, diversified by name, industry and geography. The average credit rating of the 443 names if BBB. Credit default swaps are traunched for different levels of risks and Apex/Sitka's portfolio consists of super senior tranches which are rated and continue to be rated AAA. There is no exposure to US subprime mortgages.</p>
          <p>When the August 2007 market disruption occurred, Apex and Sitka were unable to sell more notes to cover collateral calls from the swap counter parties which resulted from increased CDS spreads. Stand cell arrangements were put into place with swap counter parties to stay collateral calls and have now expired.</p>
          <p>Ratings for ABCP and MTNs were cut to R-5 and CCC on February 28th, as a result of restructuring not being finalized with swap counter parties and failing to roll over notes that became due that day. The two day cure period expired yesterday. However, discussions with the stakeholders relative to restructuring are continuing.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 14, our exposure to monolines is not material. We've disposed off our positions related to ACA at a total cost of $160 million and the mark-to-market exposure for the remaining monolines in aggregate is only $244 million for direct exposure.</p>
          <p>As shown on Slide 15 the large trading and underwriting losses on November 30th, January 23rd and January 31st, were driven by the valuation adjustments addressed in Tom's remarks.</p>
          <p>You'll note that I've not included a slide in this presentation on commodities. Risk reduction remained the key objective for the commodities portfolio through Q1 and we're now comfortable with the progress to date and are operating within an acceptable level of risk on a go forward basis. Accordingly, this will be our last specific update on commodities.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to touch on our new Basel II disclosures in our sub pack. As you know, we formally implemented Basel II this quarter. We've disclosed our capital ratios, capital for Basel II assets classes and information on securitizations. For this quarter we've also disclosed Basel I data to enable a smoother transition.</p>
          <p>Basel II risk weighted assets are more indicative of underlying risk in the bank's portfolio. Although, as you are aware, each institution developed their own methodology based on risk management strategies, processes, portfolio characteristics, and historical loss experience.</p>
          <p>We recognize the challenge this creates for you in understanding the new disclosures; however, as subsequent quarters reporting accumulates useful trend analysis will be possible and components not yet disclosed on a Basel II basis will become available, such as exposures by probability of default basis.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Bill Downe.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Bob. I'd like to comment briefly on the leadership change which is our -- the leadership changes rather, that are effective tomorrow. After this meeting Yvan Bourdeau will be turning the investor conference call over to Tom Milroy who has been appointed CEO of BMO Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>Tom is an experienced banker with a strong sense of markets, high regarded by clients in both Canada and the US, and possess the strong management oversight of the business. Vaughn will continue as Vice Chairman of BMO Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>After 35 years of dedicated service to BMO, Bob McGlashan will take a well deserved retirement. I want to thank him for the important contributions he has made to our company's success. I want to convey how much I appreciate the tremendous commitment he has shown to BMO, especially over the last 12 months. After this meeting Tom Flynn will be relinquishing the roll of acting CFO and has been appointed Chief Risk Officer. Tom has built a track record for success and has gained tremendous experience in the most complex aspects of the market and our business. Most recently, as Interim Chief Financial Officer, Tom worked directly on the significant risk issues that BMO has been managing. Timing of Tom's appointment is excellent. He'll lead the implementation of a renewal of our risk practices with a focus on ownership and accountability both in the business and at corporate, on transparency and on risk return optimization.</p>
          <p>And finally I'm really pleased that Russ Robertson has joined us in the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer, from Deloitte &amp; Touch&#xE9;, where he served as Vice Chairman since 2002. He brings extensive financial institution experience role; he will lead a strong and very capable finance team. As I said at the outset, we faced difficult issues this quarter, but we're confident that we can continue to restore momentum in our businesses.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator and we can begin the Q&amp;A session of the call.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Bill, in your opening comments, you've talked about basically a new type of BMO Capital Markets, de-risking a number of businesses, eliminating long tail risk and another such type of risks. Can you talk about how this BMO Capital Market's earnings profile will be going forward? I mean, it sounds to be coming a little bit more plain vanilla than it has been in the past, but what does that mean in terms of what you look at this organization and what it can contribute in net income for the year?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jim, I'm not going to put a number on the year, obviously the environment is a little bit unpredictable. I think you have to start with, what are the strengths of BMO Capital Markets? What are the things that really stand out? And we have built a tremendous business around clients. Our reputation in the investment business, based upon high quality research, really strong equity underwriting business, very good debt underwriting business, a large corporate banking business, it's tied into those businesses and a strong operating service business. These are all built around client relationships and they constitute a very, very significant part of the earnings of BMO Capital Markets. I think the focus on the management of risk really relates to making certain that where we're engaged in trading activities, where we're using our capital, it is in support of client business. And there has been a period of retrenchment in the last six months where the risk return of a number of trading businesses have just tightened right down, and I think the rationing of capital in those areas is a prudent thing to do. We're really focused on return on equity, and it's really a question of the deployment of capital within BMO as an enterprise. BMO Capital Markets is an important part of the company, it does use a significant portion of capital, and I think in this environment there's opportunities to make better use within BMO Capital Markets and within the organization of some of that capital.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. If I can just follow up on that then; perhaps, I mean I was really looking for the potential earnings power of the Bank in the wholesale division on a normalized basis, but maybe looking at it, would it contribute to the Bank's total earnings? Are you looking for, perhaps more of a percentage basis closer to 20, 25% rather than plus 30%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know the one thing about the wholesale business, Jim, is that it does have larger swings in it than some of the other businesses. If you go back and listen to the conversations that we've had over the last couple of years, I think I've pretty consistently said that I think our wholesale business ought to be somewhere between a third and a little bit more of the Bank, and that's a good place for it to be; and similarly with the allocation of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks very much, Bill. My second question relates to the retail bank and the efficiency ratio. Obviously, we saw a tick-up to 57% coming from the higher investment spend versus the 50 to 55% run rate of several quarters ago. And my question to Frank is do you see the softening, given the softening in the Canadian retail and economic conditions here in Canada, can you foresee getting back to that deficiency ratio based on revenue enhancements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jim. We've obviously been investing in the business, and as Bill mentioned earlier, we're going to continue investing in our strategic agenda going forward, but also recognizing some of the pressures in the marketplace, in particular on the spread side, we are going to be looking at our tactical spend much more closely as we go through the year. So my expectation is that the spend levels on a year-over-year basis are going to moderate as we go through the year, and when you look at the NIX growth on a linked basis, we are relatively flat, and we're going to try to manage the remainder of the year on that basis.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Darko Mihelic of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a couple of questions as well. Maybe the first place to start is, if you could provide a little more information on Fairway and why was there a decision to write down the drawn facility and is it capable of fully drawing the facility down to the 10.2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darko, I'll just try to make sure I got your numbers straight. You're talking about Links and Park Lane I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about Fairway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fairway. So the backup liquidity facilities of, $10 billion, is that your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much of that might we expect to be drawn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And why did you take a provision against the drawn amount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so what we actually did was we removed a facility from Fairway and put it under our balance sheet so that it wouldn't have a negative impact on Fairway as the aggregate asset quality. And that facility is the one, I was referencing throughout the comments. It was $459 million deal and we took a $39 million provision against it. That company is in the business of purchasing at a discount troubled mortgages. For the current market swings in the US just pushed the house prices down through the discount that they purchased. So, we're not expecting further draws.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are not expecting further draws, but what &#x2013; okay, see your language however suggests that there is a $10.2 billion back up facility to Fairway. In your notes, I mean if you like we can follow up on this after, I suppose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="inaudible" /> I'm wondering if we are confused between the SIVs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess my second question is in respect to Apex and Sitka. I guess, which is it? I mean, it looks as though you are willing to, if you are not able to restructure, you'll have to write-off 495 million or around $500 million. But then there are those others components where there's disputes with note holders and with swapped counter parties. So am I to look at that and say to myself that the worst case scenario here is at least a $1.5 billion loss for BMO plus law suits? Is that the way I should look at that? Or, I mean, what would you comment on that, or what your comment be on that, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to comment on Darko, on, we have basically two issues that they were outline, one amounts to 400 million. It's really an operational issue between two professional funded parties, and the other one is the 600, is an issue that is related to the convert itself, and basically it will be resolved once the restructuring is in place. So given the situation that we're in at this point in time, I just would like to mention that, based on the facts that we have reviewed so far, and the discussion that we've had with our counsel, in fact we are confident in our position. But, as you can appreciate, these matters may result in litigation. It is very difficult for us to comment on this point, and in fact, we're not in a position to comment any further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Darko, on your first question, I'm going to put it back to Tom Flynn. We were looking to the place you had made that reference from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we were thinking of the SIV amount, which is a comparable amount, but Fairway is our US commercial paper conduit vehicle, and that vehicle is similar to traditional bank sponsored asset-backed commercial paper vehicles that exist in the Canadian market, and likely backup to traditional Canadian conduits. We have provided normal, global-style backup liquidity lines for Fairway, and those backup lines, approximately $10 billion. And we talked about this I think on our last call, but Fairway paper has rolled consistently throughout the market conditions that we've been experiencing since August, and all of the paper rolled throughout the entire disturbance that took place on the market. And as Bob mentioned, the draw that was made against the liquidity lines related to one credit that was within the vehicles that had some credit issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, okay. So, I guess, I mean, if I could just follow up with all this, with just a broader question for Bill. You know, with difficult times, new battle to treatment, worst case scenario looks like I'm calculating on the back of the envelope, it could be between 1.5 to $2.5 billion. How bad does it have to get before you raise equity, and or consider cutting your dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the current situation, it's not something that we have contemplated, given the pieces that we're working with. We have a strong Tier I capital ratio, but also, we have pretty good visibility to those exposures. And I would say that, six months ago there was a lot of uncertainty about where the markets were going, the size of Links and Parkland and what would happen with the larger universe of non-bank sponsored commercial paper in the United States and Canada. And so, I actually have a higher degree of confidence in the way that things are working out that, with the position we have, we can put these things behind us in the next while. And I think Yvan will have some comments specifically on the number that Darko was asking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The item that I would like to mention Darko its basically reiterating what was said earlier. But I would like to stress it in a case of Apex and Sitka, I think we are giving you a very good description as to the quality of the underlying asset and also our position in term of the CDS and we are not only the only one realizing to what extent the quality of the asset is very strong, but also all of the stakeholders with whom we are actually in discussion and because of that there's no question that we're having constructive discussion with these stakeholders and therefore I would not in my own estimate anyhow, have a similar potential range, as you have just described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh sorry, well I was throwing a few other things into the mix but I appreciate that. So basically, Bill I guess, your position is that you haven't contemplated an equity issue yet and the dividend cut is simply not even on the table at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's totally consistent with our estimates of what our exposures are and the reason why we had a press release on February 19th, in which we identified approximate $500 million of exposure with respect to Apex was to make it clear of the magnitude, the order of exposure that we were talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. That's very helpful. One last question, if I could squeak one in for Bob. One of the things that helps me out is credit protection that you might have on single name exposures in the portfolio. Do you have -- is that number been released at this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is, I don't think it actually was, but I'll tell you it's a 1.1 billion in aggregate and 100 million of that is specific to those mandated by the credit decision process so the answer is that it's very small and hasn't changed very much from last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Andr&#xE9; Hardy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question's for Bill, did I hear you say in your introductory remarks that you would look at reducing non-core lending relationships?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did. This is a process, Andr&#xE9;, that we do on a fairly regular basis. We go back through the portfolio and we look at accounts where we may have extended credit, let's say 24 months ago, participation in revolving credit where we have been working on the development of ideas, things that would move us either into an advisory position or an underwriting position. And those commitments are predicated on a belief that a bigger or a broader relationship will ultimately develop, and it is a discipline that I have to say is recurring. But this is a good time to go through that discipline, and particularly because I think that we're right on the edge of an increase in pricing in segments of the market, and those conversations with a number of those clients will be towards the visibility of other sources of income other than lending income, or perhaps price renegotiations, or in the case that neither of those is visible, then we would reduce our commitments to those names. It's a pretty standard process of discipline, but I think this is a really good time to do it, because I do believe there's some pricing power going to come back into the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any sense of how big that non-core portfolio may be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't. Yvan may jump in with an estimate of what he thinks can be achieved; although, I think it's early days. You recall that five or six years ago we reduced our assets very materially in that regard, I think from about $90 billion to about $65 billion of risk-weighted assets. My guess is in terms of the kinds of relationships that we could optimize, Yvan, maybe it's 10% or 15% of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So approximately, I can only give you a range at this point in time Andr&#xE9;, just because we are beginning into investigating more specifically into that initiative. But I would say, looking at the preliminary estimates -- and I'll speak not so much in terms of risk-weighted asset, but in terms of capital, because then it's -- because of Basel I and Basel II, it's been more difficult to talk in risk-weighted assets. But in terms of capital, I would think that a potential reduction between 250 and 500 is possible. Now this, like the same thing that we did in 1999-2000 when we reduced, as Bill was saying, structurally our balance sheet, it takes time. But I would say over the next 12 to 24 months, as we go through this exercise and as our facility are rolling over, and if indeed we're unable to increase the pricing associated with facilities that are actually not meeting our hurdles, nor do we think that we're going to be able to achieve the hurdle in looking forward, then you could see that kind of structural adjustment in our capital allocation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my other question is probably for Bob. And you've increased dramatically your guidance for loan losses this year. Is that because you're seeing specific names pop-up on your watch lists, or are you seeing a broader deterioration? And you mentioned the US, but I would say US and Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Andr&#xE9;. Canada is actually not too bad. I expect that it may start to surface some deterioration in the back half of the year depending on how things unfold in the US. In the US, it's where we are seeing most of the activity. And I mentioned the real estate development portfolio we have. Although not large, we've been seeing some reservations come out of that shop. Looking at the flow of accounts into watch list category, and into impaired category, the early indications of deterioration are certainly there. It would be -- it's not going to be very much of a stretch to get to the $170 million number for each of the remaining quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it sounds like you're talking about a fair amount of accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's not to layer or layer in more of our clients, this is not 3 or 4, or some specific names that we see coming down the track at us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Robert Sedran from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up on Andre's question. I guess we're just three months from the original guidance on the loan loss side, and it looks like the run rate is about 40% higher than the high-end. Is Bank of Montreal just a higher credit risk bank than it was in the past or was your conscious decision to move out the risk curve in an effort to out met revenue vote?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, I want to start on that question. I know Bob has a great deal of pride in the way these numbers come through and what to comment, but this is a little bit reminiscent for me of 2000 when our discipline, our consistent discipline to reviewing the portfolio had a similar effect, and the question was raised, well, have you changed your lending standards? And I -- upfront, I'd like to say before Bob comes in, that the discipline we use around evaluation of credit, the speed at which we move assets into special assets or onto a watch list, I mean identify them. That's one of reasons why our recoveries tend to be superior through the cycle. And from my perspective, it's the right way to approach the recognition. In the last 3 months, there has been a change in the economy and in the environment, and it's being reflected in the behavior of a small number of customers. And the time to deal with the emergence of those issues is right at the front. Bob, I know you'd like to make some specific comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to reinforce actually, two comments and respond specifically to the question about whether or not we are a high-risk credit bank and/or house, chosen to shift position on the risk curve. We are not and have not chosen to move up the risk curve on our credit portfolio. The historical relative performance, I would fully anticipate, will continue to unfold over the course of this cycle. We do, and quite with intent, move early at identifying a deteriorating account. As a result, the number of times they actually end up turning into a loss is somewhat less for us. It's a material part of the reason through the cycle we perform better. In addition, why the change quarter over quarter? A lot of things happened in the last quarter, during the last quarter in the marketplace, and the depth of the challenges that the marketplace are experiencing are certainly more than what we were anticipating when we first set the number. And then you look at the first quarter actual number, you don't have to stretch very far to get to the suggested guidance I'm giving you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up on the credit again. I guess the second question is about the general. I guess, theory, the way I look at the general is that you add to it in the good times, and at least in theory, draw it down in bad times. And this is the second straight quarter you've added to it. I would have thought in this environment that every little bit of capital would count, and so I guess I want to know why you're adding to it and if, perhaps, the regulator is recommending that you add to your general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The position we're taking on our general is our own position. We are not being influenced, directed, or otherwise relative to what we're doing. Our approach relates to coverage of our expected loss, and as you move through the credit cycle from the best part of it, where we were, to the worst part of it, which we're on our way to here, the amount of EL coverage you require should, in fact, go down; however, if your portfolio is growing, and/or you have some negative risk migration, your EL goes up. Then clearly, the amount that you're required to cover your general goes up. So, the coverage rate is coming down, but some of the other drivers are going up &#x2013; on balance, it's a relatively small upward adjustment in the general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a -- I guess it's a compound question in that case and it relates to the Apex/Sitka situation. So, maybe I'll just go through them and you can answer or follow-up. First of all, why sponsor conduits only with levered credit default swaps in them, rather than just plain vanilla typical securitizations. And secondly, once you saw the problems in these types of conduits back in August, why did you not get Apex and Sitka included in the Montreal Accord. And, you have no obligation to back stop liquidity in Apex and Sitka, your own sponsored conduits and so you're not doing so, that being the case why would you participate in the Montreal Accord to back stop liquidity on conduits that you didn't sponsor. And finally, commercial paper in medium-term notes that you don't own, I guess it's about 1.4 billion in these two conduits, how much is commercial paper? And how did you continue to sell this paper to investors, even as a market maker, with the potential that &#x2013; of the uncertainty in the liquidity of the conduits?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

          <p>So, let me try to answer the several points that you raised, Michael. The overarching decision on our part not to link Sitka and Apex with the Montreal Accord, was from the outset something that we stress again today. That, the type of underlying assets that we have in Apex and Sitka are definitely of a very different quality than the Montreal Accord had certainly at the beginning in August and September when the dirty shoe effort surfaced. And therefore, we felt that it was not appropriate for us to actually be linked, given the quality of our assets with the Montreal Accord. In terms of the other points and you had several, I think and, why levered, I think the question is I think it was a normal structure we had in place and that was prevalent in the marketplace and therefore that's why you had the type of leverage in the conduit that we have at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any other conduits that only consist of levered credit default swaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this isn't a typical conduit, these aren't typical conduits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, typical to other conduits if you wish, where you would have leverage sometime even greater than the one that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so if you're not going to back stock these conduits why would you participate in the Montreal Accord to backstop liquidity on conduits that you did not sponsor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think on that front it is a situation where we did have some exposure to the ABCP from third parties as we were entering the marketplace, so that is one aspect. And the other aspect is at this point in time, I think we are considering, given our role as a financial institution in the marketplace, as to whether or not we should actually participate and bring a solution to this issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What does that mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that means we feel that we are part of the overall Canadian financial system and there is an issue out there and we have some exposure to that type of paper and therefore, I don't think we can just step on the side and not try to bring a solution to that issue that is actually affecting the Canadian financial system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, we wanted to stay to single questions and your three or four part question had a lot of elements in it, if I might just try to sum it up. I think, that the structure of Apex and Sitka, with respect to leverage is similar to credits in the Montreal Accord. The reason why we didn't take Apex and Sitka to the Montreal Accord, as Yvan said, it was consistent corporate credit portfolio, typically BBB obligation. And so it didn't match up with the asset mix. But the type of solution that we will &#x2013; we're pursuing for Apex and the type of solution that the Montreal Accord is pursuing is very similar. And in that case the original providers of paper backup have fallen away. They were there in the original case. BMO wasn't. The restructurings involve additional investments, as I understand it, additional investments in those portfolios. So to the extent that there are high quality assets, and the leverage is required, additional capital in order to cover margin calls at any expectable level of default, that's what makes the solutions work. As far as the Montreal Accord goes, we have been on record from the outset that we're supportive of an orderly solution supported by the Canadian banks, because we think it's in the best interest of the market, and it's in the best interest of the country, and that's why we're prepared to be supportive.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Brad Smith from Blackmont Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. I just wanted to revisit the US ABCP, and the impaired loan. Want to make sure I'm clear on what happened there. It strikes me that you, basically acquired an impaired loan for about $460 million from this sponsored conduit, and that the credit in question related to a distressed mortgage financial institution purchaser. And you established, I believe, a $50 million allowance for that position, roughly 11%, which is kind of a lower level than your overall allowance relative to your impaired loan portfolio. Two questions, could you explain what gives you the confidence that your recovery is going to be as high as the 11% allowance makes it appear? And how did that credit, like, what happened with that credit that caused it to go back in an otherwise highly rated conduit collateral pool? I'm just wanting to get some assurances, there aren't other credits like that in that ABCP conduit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with the last part of that. Brad, there are not other credits like that in those conduits. This is a company that was buying distressed paper out of the subprime market, but not only that. The way made it sense to them was they would buy it at a relatively deep discount, and it would provide some reasonable loan-to-value coverage on each of the mortgages they would acquire. And that worked, and as this is a model it had operating for many years, it worked very successfully. And they typically recovered, they would divide at a 30% discount, and they would recover at additional 10 or 15%. So it is very profitable business for them. As the subprime market deteriorated, and with it housing prices, the discount of 30% that they would buy this paper at was burned up as a result of the reduction in the values of the underlying properties. The amount of reservation that we've taken on this transaction is 39, 38.5 actually million dollar, and we've taken it with a view to what we believe the underlying real estate values were supporting those mortgages, and we did a fair bit of work on that, and as to where we thought those things might go. So a couple of things, one that's the nature of that particular entity. It was, it is in difficulty, and we didn't want it to mess up the view of the asset quality in Fairway, which is otherwise excellent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So again, I'm correct, you actually just paid cash for the asset, for the credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we understand we are providing global style liquidity back-up facilities for our conduits in the US, always have. So in the end, that was going to back into the global style liquidity facility in any event. So there was no point in having this occur, as well as impacting the balance of the funding, the access of the funding to that conduit. So we pulled it out and put it on a balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a plan to actively exit that position, or is it a hold till maturity type position now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which, the 495?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll absolutely work on every angel we possibly can to minimize whatever the loss impact in the end may turn out to be. Some of that paper has -- none of that paper has an immediate maturity. So in some cases it has maturity over 18 months, in other cases you may be able to sell the paper into the marketplace, but we're working our way through it as quickly as we can.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, my question is for Bill. Bill, when we look at what's gone on here, the start of 2007 was, you know, the problems on natural gas, and commodity trading. Late in 2007 the problem was structured credit, and that carried over, and now we're starting to see credit deterioration that certainly by any metric appears to be worse than any of the other bank peers. I guess, it's hard to associate all three of these things of the bank that used to be described a high return low risk institution. I guess from a macro point of view what has changed to put the Bank in the harm's way on so many fronts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I actually don't see the connection. It is clear that we had a significant problem in our commodities business. Last year we see it as a discrete circumstance, we've taken steps to address that business directly. And we've seen immediate benefit from that. It was a significant risk exposure even after it was identified and we worked the risk down very quickly inside the time that I thought it would take to get it to its current level where we're back in ordinary operating parameters, and de-risked without a great deal of cost, it could have been very expensive to move out of those positions quickly. So I think the underlying capability of the organization was actually demonstrated in that regard. With respect to the structured credit market, we were one of the first banks to establish multi-contributor conduits in Canada. It's a natural extension of our commercial banking business. And not only was it a very large business globally, but it's a large business for the Bank of Montreal, and it continues to perform well.</p>
          <p>And similarly I would say, with the two SIVs in the UK &#x2013; Links and Parkland &#x2013; they have been problematic because of the fact that the market has been so difficult from a funding perspective. But if you look at the underlying assets in Links and Parkland, and the size of those programs, we were at $27 billion at the end of July. We have done exactly what we said we were going to do in the reduction of them. We've done it in an orderly way and we've protected the investors, the capital note holders and the senior note holders, in those programs as well as the small amount of capital participation we had. So we protected the interests of the Bank and of the shareholders, as well, as its customers. And at the last quarter end, I know there was commentary about how difficult it would be to continue to reduce these programs in the environment when they were sitting above $15 billion. But once again, the quality of the assets and the quality of the people managing the business resulted in a reduction, so that, at the time, February 19th, when we said that, there were now small enough that we felt that it was appropriate for us to provide backstop, they had come down once again significantly. And where we sit today, with Links at $9.9 billion, is once again in a very short period of time confirmation of the strategy, and I think Parkland this morning was &#x20AC;880 million.</p>
          <p>And so I guess I would -- not to dispute the risky or non-risky nature of the business that the underlying quality of the assets and our strategy has proven itself. With respect to credit risk, it's hard to say whether we're in a complete credit cycle, the part of a complete credit cycle where defaults are going to escalate rapidly across the whole system. But if you go back over the last 16 years and look at the credit cycle, BMO has, as defaults have ramped up in the system, has been early to recognize in its own portfolio any credits that require extra supervision. And, as Bob said, in periods of benign credit, we've had recoveries, significant recoveries, because of the way we manage it. So I think the characterization needs to be accurate. And we take full responsibility for the first item that you mentioned &#x2013; the commodity trading business was not something that was consistent with the way we operate. The structured products business we're working on our way through, and the credit cycle will be what it is. But as Bob said, we have not changed the people in the key credit granting jobs in the company, and we haven't changed the discipline. And as a consequence, we stand by the beliefs that we will continue to have superior performance.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Bill, when I think about all the actions you've detailed, every one you've detailed has come after a fair amount of pain inflicted on shareholders. So, I mean isn't it the job of risk management and the senior executives to ensure you don't take the $800 million loss before you fix the problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not to prolong this discussion. We could carry on for a long time, but with respect to the $850 million, you're absolutely right. With respect to the other items, I believe that we're in the process of putting them behind us and when we do, I would expect that the revenue generating capability of the core businesses, which is very, very strong will be reflected in the share price of the stock once again. We have time, I think, for one more question. And then I think, we'd probably run out.</p>
