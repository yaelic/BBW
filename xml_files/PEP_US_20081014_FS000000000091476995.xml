          <p>Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived for 14 days. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Mike Nathanson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nathanson, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I know that all of you had a chance to review the press release we issued this morning and on this call we will be focusing our remarks in five key areas, which should leave ample time for a robust Q&amp;A session. So let me outline the key points and cover each of them in more detail. First, we have solid business results for most of our portfolio. PepsiCo International and PepsiCo Americas Foods performed very well and they did so in the context of a challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment. As we indicated on prior calls, the third quarter represented our most difficult commodity cost comparison versus prior year. And so it is especially encouraging to see solid volume growth in our snacks businesses around the world, which reflects clearly the strength of our brand, the positive impact of innovation and the successful execution of our price <mark type="inaudible" /> strategies. We also saw strong performance across both our snack and beverage portfolios in key developing markets.</p>
          <p>The second point I'd like to make, too, is that our North American beverage business was soft, reflecting in large measure category challenges. Regaining growth is a major priority for us and I'll be talking in a few minutes about the actions we are taking.</p>
          <p>Third, it's no news to you but the macroeconomic climate is turbulent and there are uncertainties and volatility in every part of the environment. The constants, however, are the basic strength of our business model, our terrific management teams and our ability to execute at the fee level. We will be agile in our planning and in our operations. Fourth, we are implementing a productivity for growth initiative, which we expect, will produce $1.2 billion in pre-tax savings over the next three years. This will enable us to invest in our businesses to further improve our competitiveness and to give us breathing room to respond to changes in the marketplace. And fifth and most importantly, we continue to have robust, free cash flow, which provides a sound financial base for us at a time when the financial markets are uncertain. So let me go into detail on each one turning first to Q3.</p>
          <p>PepsiCo International delivered solid performance in Q3 while lapping 20% revenue growth in the prior year period. PI's diverse brand portfolio continued to benefit from growing demand across most markets outside of the Americas despite significant pricing actions to offset the impact of commodity cost increases. Revenue increased 20% and operating profit increased 18%. Growth across the Middle East, Africa, Asia segments was broad based with revenue up 22% and operating profit up 18%. Snack volume increased 9% led by high-teens growth in the Middle East and double-digit growth in China and India. On the beverage side, volume increased 10% driven by a combination of mid-teens growth in China, double-digit growth in the Middle East and high single-digit growth in India. In the UK-Europe segment, PI performed well despite increased inflation, macroeconomic challenges and unseasonably cool weather during the summer months, which particularly impacted beverage results.</p>
          <p>Revenue and operating profit each grew 17% benefiting in part from the weaker dollar. The soft spot in Q3 was beverages. The UK-Europe volume growth of 13% entirely reflects the benefit of two acquisitions, Sandora, the Ukrainian juice business and the expansion of the Pepsi-Lipton joint venture in Europe. Excluding M&amp;A activity, volume was down slightly with a mid single digit increase in the UK entirely offset by category softness across the Continent and Russia. In part, related to poor summer weather. Note, however, that in September we saw an improvement in volume in the UK-Europe -- as volume in the UK-Europe segment was up high single digits on an organic basis. Snack volume in Q3 was largely in line with expectations and reflected visual pricing and weight-outs across the category to address inflationary pressures. Snack volume grew 4% on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding a calendar reporting change in Iberia that excluded about three weeks of performance versus the year-ago period. Russia led the segment with high-teens growth. Overall, Q3 was a good quarter for PI and at the end of the quarter, PI closed with Marlboro snack acquisitions in Serbia and the <mark type="inaudible" /> juice acquisition in Russia. We will report the financial performance of these two businesses in Q4.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to PepsiCo Americas Food where revenue is up 12% and profits were up 9%. Frito-Lay North America snack brands grew volume 1.5%, even as we realized net price increases from weight-outs and visual pricing to offset inflation. Revenue growth of 9% was broad-based. In addition to growing across all major brands, Frito-Lay North America sales also increased across all retail channels and gained dollar market share in measured channels in the savory snack category. We are pleased that the brand equity and pricing power of our brands with continuous response to our pricing coming in about where we expected. In Q3, we fully realized our 2008 pricing initiatives for the year and, as is customary, we plan to implement another round of judicious pricing in Q4 as we prepare for 2009.</p>
          <p>Quaker Foods North America experienced significant reduction in shipment disruptions from the quarter as a result of flooding at the beginning of Q3 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where a major Quaker plant is located. The extraordinary efforts of our teams enabled us to restart production within four weeks and we're now operating at about 85% of capacity, but we were not able to ship some products normally during Q3, which resulted in volume and revenue declines versus prior year. Nevertheless, profitability was up 7% in the quarter, largely because we received business disruption insurance payments related to the flooding.</p>
          <p>Latin America Foods reported revenue growth of 23% and profit growth of 22%. Organic revenue growth was driven by net price realization, both in the form of weight-out and visual pricing across all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Pepsi Americas Beverages. It's clear that this business is not performing where we would like it to be in large part because the economic slowdown continues to pressure the North American liquid refreshment beverage category. In measured channels, category volume was down 3% and overall category revenues were flat. In part, as a result of significant discounting in unflavored water. The C &amp; G channel remains soft but consumer shopping in items purchased per trip both down and Beverages have been particularly hard hit. In this environment, PAB volumes declined 2.5% reflecting a full percent decrease in North America partially offset by an increase in Latin-American beverages. Net revenue was flat for the quarter and operating profit declined 11% largely due to a combination of higher input costs, particularly higher fuel costs, deleveraged from the soft volume and expenses related to the implementation of SAP.</p>
          <p>Now, revitalizing this business is a huge priority for us, and I want to assure you that over the past several months, we have been busy at this and we've lined up initiatives we are going to launch in 2009. We have completely revamped every aspect of the brand proposition for our key CSD brands, how they look, how they're packaged, how they will be merchandised on the shelves and how they connect with consumers. You will see more over the next few weeks and I think you're going to be very impressed. We are initiating similar upgrades for the entire Gatorade line which will have an entirely new contemporary identity, and there will be exciting innovations for both G2 and Tiger and a renewed Propel platform. Tropicana will also be differentiated, enabling us to reengage consumers with this iconic brand, and we will be supporting all of this activity with increased investment in innovation in A&amp;M using savings from the productivity-for-growth initiatives that we announced this morning.</p>
          <p>It is our belief that, especially in this economic downturn, we should be investing in the category to get consumers to stay with and some to return to the packaged liquid refreshment beverage category and to our brands in particular. This is the beginning of a multifaceted effort to restore growth and profitability to the North American beverage business. It will take a little while to realize all the benefits of these changes, but I'm confident that you will see significant progress during the course of 2009. So overall, solid results for most of the PepsiCo portfolio in Q3, particularly given the challenging macro economic situation and commodity cost overlaps. And please note that our guidance for the full year implies currency neutral, high single digit divisional operating profit growth in Q4.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to take a couple of minutes to provide our perspective on the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business outlook going forward. The incredible turmoil we've seen in the financial and commodity markets over the past month has given us a vivid reminder that the world is in a very uncertain place right now. We are uncertain about how the global economic situation may evolve, how it will differentially impact countries, how the forex markets will move and ultimately how consumers around the world will respond as they digest these events. The impact of all this is now as much about Main Street as it is about Wall Street as consumers in many parts of the world are indeed feeling the pressure. One of the trends we're noticing is that the impacts are not uniform. In the Middle East and eastward, growth continues to be robust and our expectation is that it will remain so. The absolute growth rates may come down as the developed economies slows. But their GDP growth differential versus the developed countries will probably remain at the mid to high single digits. Turning to our neighbors in the south, Mexico is expected to increasingly feel the impact of the slow U.S. economy and the rest of Latin America is beginning to feel the pressures, too.</p>
          <p>East Europe's outlook is mixed, and you're all aware of the unfavorable outlook for GDP in both the U.S. and the Euro zone. Now, we do not control these macroeconomic forces and our portfolio is not immune to their impacts, but at PepsiCo, we are confident in the fundamentals of our business model and the agility of our people and in our ability to execute on the ground in each country in which we operate. We are able to drive growth in the categories in which we participate in. We provide simple pleasures at affordable prices to consumers across the world, and consistent with our experience during the last two economic downturns in the U.S. as consumers economize by eating more at home, they tend, for the most part, to consume more of our products, particularly snacks. In addition in many parts of the world, per capita consumption of our products is still relatively low which gives us the opportunity to drive sales ahead of GDP growth.</p>
          <p>Our wide product portfolio within our categories and our broad geographic footprint helps us balance out the ups and downs in any given market and even as the economic turmoil progresses, we are seeing our business maintain its volume momentum with consumers around the world. Overall volumes for September, for example, were pretty consistent with what we've been experiencing all year. For all these positives, there is no certainty about how this current economic crisis will play out. While we are quietly confident about our ability to execute, we're being sober in our planning. So for the past several months, we've been looking across all our businesses to ensure we're doing everything we can to enhance our operating agility and financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>A major outcome of our detailed work is the productivity-for-growth program. It's a broad-based set of initiatives that cuts across the entire company with the objective of improving cost competitiveness, simplifying decision making, and upgrading and streamlining our product portfolio. We expect it will produce pre-tax savings of more than $1.2 billion over the next three years, enabling us to make significant investments in our future growth. A primary focus is investment in our North American beverage business, in A&amp;M to support the restaging of our key brands and in stepped-up product, package and process innovation.</p>
          <p>We will also be investing to drive additional growth in key developing markets across the world in both snacks and beverages. We also are making targeted marketplace investments to further secure our competitive position in developed snack markets. And we are increasing our investments in R&amp;D with particular focus on long-term innovation to sustain our long-term growth. Taken together, these actions are intended to position the business for success into the future in support of our long-term strategies. They will also enable us to better handle the marketplace surprises that are inevitable in this volatile environment. I also want to emphasize that in our planning for 2009, we have a focus on balancing premium product innovations with a corresponding emphasis on our value offerings. We are maintaining a finger on the pulse of our consumers' reality and we will not allow private label or discount brands to exploit this economic downturn at our expense.</p>
          <p>You know, there's nothing normal about what we're seeing in the economy or in the market. Whatever volatility in commodities, whatever uncertainty in the credit markets and financial markets, whatever uncertainty in consumer behavior we have seen for the first three quarters, it simply pales in comparison with the gyrations that we've experienced globally over the past couple of weeks. We normally talk about the coming year's guidance on the fourth quarter call at the beginning of February. Advancing the timing given the current turbulent conditions is simply not prudent. There is no clear base for forecasting currencies, the impact of the evolving financial crisis on GDP growth rates or the effect all of this will have on consumer spending patterns.</p>
          <p>Please make no mistake, however, we have full confidence in the fundamentals of our business, the capabilities of our exceptional management teams across the globe and, most importantly, the breathing room we have created for ourselves with our productivity-for-growth initiative. We are working with the highest level of urgency on the things we can control and leveraging PepsiCo's operational agility to succeed in this changing environment. The steps we are taking will position the business to maintain our competitive edge in the near term and to sustain leading performance over the long term. With that, let me turn it over to Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Indra has covered the line of business results and so let me focus on the below-the-line items, provide some additional information about our productivity-for-growth initiative and discuss cash flow. As we have previously discussed, our approach to commodity coverage has evolved over the past year to provide increased predictability in our cost structure for the coming year which enables us to proactively manage our pricing and price-pack architectures so they work well with consumers as well as retailers. That approach means we have higher levels of coverage for next year than we would have had in the past.</p>
          <p>Most of our purchases receive hedge accounting treatment. The forward coverage that does not is largely related to energy and we have to mark those positions to market each quarter. In Q2, we reported mark-to-market gains of $61 million as energy prices significantly increased. This quarter we reported mark-to-market losses of $176 million as energy prices reversed course. This mark-to-market loss compares to a $29 million loss in the previous year for a net change of $147 million versus last year. Let me remind you that over the duration of our contracts, the mark-to-market impact on corporate cost nets out to zero with hedging impacts ultimately reflected in division cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>That's why we focus our discussion and our guidance on EPS and EPS growth excluding the impact of mark-to-market in both the current and prior year. We believe this provides a better perspective on our ongoing business performance. Setting mark-to-market aside, other corporate unallocated costs were up $19 million primarily due to higher investments in R&amp;D and the company's global SAP implementation. Our tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%. That was down 150 basis points versus last year's comparable rate of 27.4%, a rate that excludes a $115 million one-time tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters, which we reported in last year's third quarter. We expect a 2008 full-year tax rate of about 27%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to cash flow, I want to emphasize PepsiCo's ability to generate cash. Cash provided by operating activities is expected to be approximately 7.3 billion and capital expenditures about 2.5 billion, excluding the productivity-for-growth costs. Our management operating cash flow is expected to be 4.8 billion. Clearly in the current environment, we are placing even more emphasis on cash management, both in terms of working capital and capital spending. I also want to point out that we maintain a strong credit rating, A+ from S&amp;P and AA2 from Moody's which is a major asset in the current environment, our commercial paper is A1P1 and has continued trading very well even amidst the turmoil of the past several weeks. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased $4.2 billion of our shares. As a result, our weighted average diluted share count declined by 3.5%. Given the volatility in the credit market, it is prudent to maintain financial flexibility and so any further repurchases during the balance of the year will depend on our assessment of market conditions. Turning to productivity-for-growth, total one-time charges in Q4 are expected to be between 550 million and $600 million of which about 60% are cash and 40% noncash. The effort is across the globe.</p>
          <p>Of the charges, approximately 45% relate to our North American beverage business. 25% in North American snacks and food, 25% to our international businesses, both PI and in the Americas, and the balance at corporate. To improve cost competitiveness, Pepsi Americas Beverages is increasing its capacity utilization and distribution efficiency by aligning North American hot fill capacity. PAF is continuing to focus on supply chain efficiency and superior execution through plant rationalization and equipment upgrades. And to simplify decision-making, Pepsi Americas Beverage is creating a unified beverage structure to eliminate redundancy and increase spans of control. PepsiCo International is continuing to evolve the organization's organizational structure to empower regional leadership. Over the past five years, our global employee base has increased from about 142,000 to over 185,000 employees as our businesses have expanded.</p>
          <p>Our productivity actions will result in the elimination of about 3,300 positions with the impact felt across all of our business segments globally. Relative to its employee base, a higher proportion of managerial positions versus plant and other supply chain related positions will be eliminated as we move to streamline decision-making. Productivity-for-growth is expected to generate pre-tax savings of about 350 to $400 million in 2009 an accumulative pre-tax total of over $1.2 billion over the next three years. In total, the productivity-for-growth enhancements will enable us to invest in our businesses as Indra described earlier and also maintain the flexibility we will need in the current environment.</p>
          <p>We are confident that these initiatives will position the business for sustainable, long-term growth and that we will benefit disproportionately when the market turns. We have established a program management office to ensure that the individual initiatives are flawlessly executed, that we embed the organizational changes quickly, and that we realize all of the anticipated savings in the appropriate timeframes. As you may remember, we were very successful in doing all of this during the Quaker integration and we have every confidence we can do so again. One final word on the 2008 guidance, full-year 2008 guidance, the dramatic appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus just about every currency in the world will have an adverse impact on our Q4 results. At current spot rates, that translates to a potential 4 to $0.05 downside in our prior full-year 2008 core EPS guidance of $3.72. We do continue to expect full-year volumes of between 3 and 5% and low double-digit net revenue growth including acquisitions and forex. And, please note as Indra mentioned that our guidance for the full year implies currency neutral, high single digit division operating profit growth in Q4. With that, let me turn it back to Indra.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard, and before I open it up for questions, let me just reprise my opening comments. Both Pepsi Americas Foods and Pepsi International delivered solid performance in Q3 in a very challenging environment. We are taking major actions to restore the vitality of our North American beverage business. We believe the macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging, but we have confidence in our basic business model and our ability to navigate through turbulent times. Productivity-for-growth will give us the ability to invest in key areas and provide breathing room in this uncertain environment and our businesses continue to generate strong cash flow. PepsiCo remains a great operating company and our biggest assets are the strength of our brands, our go-to-market capability and the enthusiasm and talent of our associates across the globe. We know what needs to get done. Operator, we'll be glad to open it up for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Our first question comes from John Faucher from JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. So quick question on the long-term impact of the restructuring program. As you look at the extra investment that you're getting, how should we look at this relative to the organic top line growth you guys have been delivering over the past couple of years and it sounds like it's mostly going to be investment in the short term. Should we expect a big ramp up in investment in '09 and then maybe a little bit more leverage off that higher level of investment as we look out over the next two or three years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John. As we mentioned, a lot of the savings from productivity-for-growth is going to go into North American beverages, selective investments in key developing markets and then snacks in developed markets from market-based investments and then R&amp;D. Now when we talk about investments in North American beverages, you start seeing some of these benefits, especially in the second half of 2009 because we have to make the investments and it takes a couple of quarters before they start really working their way through the system. So you should start seeing the benefits in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>In the case of developing market initiatives, these are not one-year bets we're making. We're reinvesting to grow our noncarb position in certain developing markets and that's going to, again, take the second half of 2009-2010 before they really play out. Increased investment in R&amp;D, especially our big bets, right now, the little that we invested in 2008 is showing great promise, and that's why we are stepping up our investment. I don't believe you'll see the benefit of that increased R&amp;D savings -- I'm sorry, investments in 2009, but I think if things turn out the way we think they're going to turn out, starting about 2010, you should start seeing some of the benefits from this reinvestment. Again, a lot of this is subject to how the economic situation plays out, but we're doing our part and we feel comfortable that as the economic situation improves, you should see a big ramp-up in our own performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. An, then, if I could just follow up with one other question for Richard. You know, Richard, you talked about an acceleration in divisional operating profits for Q4, which you guys have kind of hinted at when you gave your conference call after Q2. So, if we look at it, $0.02 below consensus this quarter. 4 to $0.05 from currency implies sort of a 6 to $0.07 reduction. Yet you're only taking the full year down by 4 to 5. So, it seems like your expectations for the fourth quarter have at least relative to consensus are higher. So what drives the confidence that you can accelerate the organic divisional operating profit number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question, John. You know, we didn't -- we don't govern the consensus. We had indicated on a prior call that we expected Q3 to be lower and Q4 to be higher and excluding the impacts of the recent changes in the currency, that's where we would have been and so if you do actually simply do the math, you'd wind up with currency neutral, high single digit LRB growth, and that's what we've been expecting all along to take place. So the only real change in our guidance has been the change in the forex, and we expected Q3 to be lower and Q4 to be more robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, everybody. First, it seems beverages are a lot more economically sensitive than your food business is. Can you maybe offer some thoughts on why you think that is and then also what your expectations are for overall LRB growth in North America assuming a normal economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kaumil, good morning. We talked about this in our last call, and I think the situation is exactly the same. In North America, in particular, beverages is a much more penetrated category than snacks and so what we're seeing is really the fact that it's so well penetrated some throwback. I think the second reason liquid refreshment beverages are impacted is because there's a free substitute called tap water which doesn't exist for snacks and that's why you are seeing the beverage category more impacted than the snacks category. Now, coming to your second question in terms of projection, the normal growth rate that we expect for LRB given population growth rates should be somewhere between like a .8 to 1.5%. That's what we would expect the LRB category to grow. The last 12, 18 months have been unprecedented for all the measuring periods we've had in this category. We've never seen a decline. This is the first time we're seeing a decline, and it's very hard to predict from the trough what the shape of this category is going to be. But since we are such a large portion of the category we're going to do our part, we are going to reinvest heavily in this category. We're going to give people a reason to come back to the category or stay in the category by providing more interest, more excitement liquid refreshment beverage category and that's really what we're going to do in 2009.</p>
          <p>Based on everything that we've done so far, that we've shared with our bottlers, we feel very, very optimistic about what 2009 could bring.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, we had some-- if you go through the statistics, we had some timing issues. Some of our international business is actually wound up closing on a Sunday, which changed some of the patterns so we did have both payables and receivables both went up slightly. So, I think almost all of the changes that we saw this quarter really are simply timing changes. There was some VAT things. There were some other things that were really temporary stuff that we would expect to -- that we know will actually reverse in Q4 and we should see much more normal levels there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Question on pricing, Indra, you were quite clear on volumes and volume patterns around the world but in looking at the top line and stripping out currency, there's a couple of regions that to me are unclear whether or not pricing was successful, clearly Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods and even Middle East, Africa, appears to have got some good pricing. Can you comment on Latin America and the UK or any other regions and how those trends are shaping up both in the third quarter and going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, you want to take UK and, then, John, maybe you can talk Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, good morning, Christine, actually, the UK has been terrific. I mean, we had solid, low single digit volume growth in the quarter and our revenue growth in local currency grew well ahead of that, and so we've had a lot of revenue management strategies in place to get more productivity out of trade spending in the UK, and we've been very successful at that this year. So actually in terms of revenue flow through, in the UK, we were fine. The issue in the UK is just the magnitude of the commodity cost impact, has impacted our profit results just a tad in the quarter but, actually we're right in line with expectation and I couldn't be more pleased. We had a very strong summer with the pre-trips promotion in the UK from a top line standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Christine, this is John. In Latin America, the two big countries, Mexico and Brazil, we were able to get our pricing through the rise in commodities relative to our pricing. We're fairly much in balance. In Chile, Venezuela and Colombia the inflation spiked up pretty quickly and we weren't able to price as fast in the quarter as we had hoped but we've now since corrected that so it was really just those three markets within all of Latin America that had an impact on us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, great. That's helpful. And, if I can follow up with a question, Richard, on SAP, there was a comment about SAP costs hitting the profit growth at Pepsi Americas Beverages, I believe. Is that done now in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the-- what we saw in-- as we begin to implement the modules from SAP, then the amortization costs and the running costs transfer from being a corporate cost, development cost to actually being an actual operating cost. And, we're seeing that as the roll-out all over in both Pepsi Americas Beverages as well as in the Quaker, Trop, and Gatorade businesses, those costs are beginning to hit the P&amp;L. So, in 2009, you saw the first impacts of those costs. The good news is that the SAP implementation has been doing extremely well, that the execution has been really basically flawless both with our customers and internally as well. But yes, the costs are beginning to hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, there's no way to quantity for us what kind of margin or how many basis points we might see due to that SAP amortization?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're not going to get into that level, but it did -- it did obviously begin to delever the P&amp;L slightly in those businesses. At the same time, we're increasingly being able to get the benefits of those, both on the top line and in other parts of the middle of the P&amp;L.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. My question is on the '09 cost outlook which I know is highly uncertain but you had mentioned on the last conference call that you had some meaningful coverage in place for '09. So, if we look at the first half of '09 is it reasonable to expect mid to high single digit input cost inflation and, then, you had said that a majority of the savings are going to be reinvested so should we assume you'll take incremental pricing to cover a hundred percent of that input cost inflation or will some of the productivity savings be used to help offset that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, yes, your assumption is correct. We have been taking, as I mentioned, we have been lengthening out our coverage and so we have a good deal of coverage in place both in the United States and outside of the United States for 2009. Obviously, more in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year and so we will -- we will have inflation during the course of the year. We haven't finalized on exactly what that amount is because we don't have all the coverage. But yes, that will be the case and we will have -- we will be taking pricing, starting at the end of the fourth quarter in order to be able to offset the inflation. What you wind up really with the inflation is it's sort of like it's a rolling inflation. Some of the benefits that we had from early purchases in 2008 were favorable in -- that we had done in 2007 helped us cushion 2008. Some of the purchasing that we're doing now will impact us in 2009, but by the second half of the year, we should be closer to market if you will.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, then, two thoughts on that so the big fall we've seen in some of these commodities will be more flow through your P&amp;L in the second half of '09 and, then, just on the pricing, do you worry about the snack category with the weak consumer, any regional snack companies are more discount brands taking share as you roll through that extra pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bill, one of the things we mentioned on the script was we will watch private label and regional competitors very, very carefully and one of the reasons we wanted to keep some breathing room in our productivity-for-growth savings is to be able to reinvest in the value equation if we ever felt that that was going out of kilter.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Bryan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, so now, looking at the or question relative to the implications to long-term growth objectives, you strip out the volatility in the economy and in commodities and foreign exchange for a minute. Assuming that the long-term growth objectives haven't changed, is the primary objective here to sustain the growth in International and stabilize the slide in profitabilities in the Americas as we're watching the effectiveness of this and we're looking for, being able to mark whether or not the long-term growth objectives are still intact? Is that the right way to think about it?</p>
          <p>Is the primary objective to improve profitability in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the long-term objective of our company remains unchanged, Bryan, to repeat what you said and there's nothing in our portfolio that indicates that that long-term objective needs to change. Let's just come back. In the past, the reason the portfolio worked very well is because if there's been a problem in one part of the portfolio, something else has picked up the slack and that's why this combination of beverages and snacks, investments across developing/developed markets has all worked very well, and I don't believe that that's going to change going forward. What we're doing right now is we're seeing an incredible opportunity to streamline our internal operations to reinvest. One, to revitalize this North American beverage business because we're one of the largest players in that business but more importantly, we're seeing opportunities in developing markets that we think we ought to invest in now. We're finding ways to double down investments in developed markets and snacks, but more importantly, we're seeing promising areas in R&amp;D that we believe now is the time to invest in. So, more of this productivity program is to reinvest. Often offensively as much as it is defensively. So, overall, the portfolio is still working. Long-term objective remains unchanged and we just want to make sure the portfolio works the way we want it to and we want to make sure that we create the breathing room to be able to cover any challenges that happen because of macroeconomic volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then, as a follow-up, just as, we're looking over the medium term, without really knowing how the volatility in the economy and commodities, how long it will last, is the objective internally different now in terms of, are we looking at targets that will be sort of excluding those items or somehow just looking at maybe different growth objectives than the long-term growth objective given the volatility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, that's a tough question, Bryan, because what we do every year, let's take FX for example. You know, we set goals for &#x2013; or the plans that are set for next year, budget numbers are set based on some number that we think the FX rates are going to settle out the next year. And, then, everybody goes off and that's their planning based on some forecast of FX rates, but if FX rates wildly vary from those as it did the last couple, three weeks. It forces us to stop and rethink how we want to manage the year and so we pick a number and we engineer the whole company around that number, around that set of numbers, and then we leave ourselves some breathing room for volatility. It's when it goes way beyond that volatility range that we have to stop and ask ourselves the question, is it prudent to do something radical to deliver numbers in that extreme volatility, and the answer is no because we're running the company for the long term. You never run a company where you burn the furniture for the short term. That's the wrong thing to do. So that's how we set our plans.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Marc Greenberg from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Indra. I hate when furniture burns so good we're not doing that. My question relates to the chronic weakness in U.S. beverages and specific steps you might take to turn things. I guess, first, any sense that pricing particularly in take home may have gone too far and perhaps lower prices are needed to stimulate demand?</p>
          <p>Do you feel comfortable that the portfolio is where it needs to be and if you start to see some benefits on the cost side as a result of lower commodities, how readily can you share those savings with the trade if you felt that you needed to bring down retail prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Marc, you ask a great set of questions because you're right in saying that pricing has gone up significantly in North American beverages but then don't forget, input costs have also gone up, so in many ways, the bottlers are taking pricing to cover that input cost increase. Now, would we like as a franchise company, would we like prices for end products to be lower?</p>
          <p>Of course, we would like it to be lower but we also have to make sure that the bottlers make a fair return. I think the real challenge for all of us is how do we figure out how to make our overall system more efficient by stripping out all of the redundancies and additional costs in the system so we can then take that extra cost and reinvest it back to provide more value? And, then, from PepsiCo's perspective, the additional arrow we have in our quiver is how can we leverage our Power of One programs to provide more value to the consumer through some sort of bundled deals, which is what we've done very effectively. So you know this is a work in process, and I wouldn't use the word chronic weakness in the U.S. beverages. I'd just say that the U.S. beverage business is going through some interesting times, and as a leader in the business, it behooves to us to do our part to figure out how to revitalize it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank Indra. Richard, one follow up please, the credit crisis is obviously top of mind for a lot of us. Can you speak to whether or not you, PepsiCo or any of your bottlers are having any challenges there with regards to lines or banks and do you still feel as though you've got enough dry powder if the right M&amp;A opportunities were to arise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the current circumstance, our commercial paper and that of our bottlers have been trading very, very well. Obviously, we have a high credit rating. We have cash in a number of different locations that we can access and we have credit lines as well. So, in the current circumstance, neither us or our bottlers has experienced any issues so far. As far as M&amp;A -- as far as M&amp;A is concerned, obviously, most of the deals that we do are relatively small deals and those are both very attractive and usually very accretive and we have the ability to continue to do those, and larger deals, you know, we just closed on a very large deal in Russia and have been able to-- and that just happened at the beginning of the-- beginning of the fourth quarter and we were able to finance that. So, I think we feel pretty good about our ability to maneuver, recognizing that obviously, life has changed over the last couple of weeks out there and we'll see how recent bond offerings and other things are going to fare in the marketplace. Hopefully the intervention that we've just seen from some of the governments to provide liquidity is going to settle the markets and make it easier for all of us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just going back to Marc's question about your efforts to revive the U.S. beverage trend, and if I look back at your common intra about the total LRB category both outlook, I think you're now expecting growth to be more in line with the population growth rather than getting a &#x2013; some lift by shifting from tap water, et cetera to commercial packaged beverage categories so first, whether that assessment is correct? Secondly, as you emphasize reviving also your carbonated soft drink part of the business, I'm just wondering, sort of your confidence level in increased A&amp;P, kind of restaging all of your brands, et cetera, how confident you are that this time around that you are actually going to see improvement in the carbonated soft drink categories as we look out six, 12 months out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll make a couple points and Massimo, if you want to add something, please do. You know, Judy, for a couple of years now we've been saying that the underlying growth of the LRB category has come down to population growth. Either they shift from tap water to LRB, that existed when the category was growing 2, 2.5, 3%. When the category growth slowed down to .8 to 1.2, 1.3 that shift from tap water was gone. It's just population growth. So, let's just say that's the underlying category growth rate.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to confidence in CSDs. Let me be clear, CSDs are declining between three and 4%, all right, and we're not talking about beginning to have the CSD category grow at one or 2%. That's not what we're talking about. We're saying goal one is to stem that decline and make it decline maybe one to 2% and then get it to flat. If we did that, that would be enormous because we're talking about a 20 billion, 8-ounce case LRB business, of which ten billion eight ounce case is CSDs, most of the bottlers' core assets are committed to CSDs. So, it's a critical source of profitability and it's very very important that we don't let the slide get out of hand so that people completely switch out of the assets that are really in the ground.</p>
          <p>So what we are trying to do, step one, slow down the decline from down three to 4% to down one to two and then to get it to flat. To really get it to grow requires a breakthrough and we've talked about this many times. We said CSDs is a combination of caffeine, bubbles and sugar. People love the caffeine. People love the bubbles. We have to address the sugar. There are people who like the non-nutritive sweeteners like aspartame and Splenda and there are others that want a natural low-calorie sweetener. Once we have a breakthrough in a natural low-calorie sweetener that can be used in colas we have a reason to talk about this category growing again. So, I think we have to take this in steps. Meanwhile, the focus should be on the overall LRB category without taking our eyes off the cold CSD business. Massimo, did you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Judy, the only thing I can add to what Indra said about our confidence in reviving CSDs, I can tell you that last week we had a major convention of all our bottlers, there were over 500 beverage experts with us, and the overall energy was very positive. Their confidence was very high and many principals said that they'd not seen plans as strong as this for a long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a follow up, following up on that. As you think about then -- I mean, obviously, your clear focus is to improve the systemwide profitability, but is there any changes to your thinking in terms of sort of how the profit, systemwide profit gets split up between you guys and the bottlers and whether you're thinking about taking higher concentrate prices up or anything of that sort?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, even if we took up concentrate prices a lot, it's going to go through to bottler pricing increases, volume will go down.</p>
          <p>This is a loop that continues on. So, I think the fact that there's a bottling system and there's a franchise company and both of us are independent is in a funny way, a system that keeps the whole beverage business in equilibrium. So, we have no issues with the core break-up between the bottling system and the franchise company. All that we have to do is step one. Not fight for a larger share of a shrinking pie or a constant pie but we have to talk about how to increase the pie. Obviously, the elegant way to increase the pie is to grow the volume, but when volume growth is not robust, we have to increase the profit pie so that we can then use the savings to fund higher volume growth so I think we have to change our mind set and we had a brilliant bottler meeting last week as Massimo just explained and we talked about how to increase the profit pool in that last meeting. So, I'm optimistic about where we are with our bottlers. We have an outstanding group of bottlers, a great partnership with them, and I think we will make progress in this area.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, and then just my final question, Indra, I think you said in September you saw a better volume growth for some of the international markets in your beverage business. Can you talk about what you think drove that improvement in September?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Judy, as we mentioned in both the release and in the script, the European business including Russia is very seasonal with the summer and in the weather this summer in Europe and in Russia was quite poor. And, so frankly, when you work your way through that and you get to September, the weather was fine in September, so I mean, a big part of it is that we saw a stabilization of our volume growth rate in Russia. We're still not growing at the rate I'd like to see, but we stabilized it and Europe came back quite well. So I'd say those are the biggest drivers in September. The rest of the businesses are performing pretty much in line. China's performing similarly. India had a terrific September. So you know, Middle East is still strong. When I look around the world, both in, frankly, both in snacks and beverages, the trends are still very consistent with what we'd seen really year to date as opposed to the quarterly trends, I'd say.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I guess as a follow-up to Mike some of your comments on the international business. A lot of consumer products companies are talking about a slowdown in trends, I was just curious obviously you're benefiting from acquisitions for brands, territories and whatnot. But, I was just curious as far as just general trends here, why you're not seeing that? I mean, it seems like you're very optimistic here and I'm hearing some rather negative comments from other companies is kind of what's the difference here, and where is that upside coming from?</p>

          <p>I think Indra said it in the script, Lauren, that the trends are not uniform. I will give you a good example. Take CSDs in the UK. Our CSD business is up double digits. We're really having a terrific year with Pepsi Max in the UK. Clearly, I would say, in Australia where there has been some significant macroeconomic issues, I'm not saying we're immune to anything going on in the external environment by any means. I would say Russia has seen some softness. Although our snacks business has held up very, very well in Russia so I think, again, you got to remember the categories outside the United States, CSDs in the U.S. is unique. You got 858-ounce per capita per person, the highest in any country other than Mexico outside the U.S. is probably 300 and in most emerging markets, it's less than 50. So the penetration levels are much, much lower and we are still, as Indra said, an affordable treat both in snacks and in beverages. Certainly I'm keeping a close eye on private label trends in Europe, particularly on snacks, but again, continue to find that our brands are holding up very, very well. So, again, I'd say we're not without some challenges in a few pockets, but I don't think you could call it by any stretch of the imagination uniform and, as Indra said, the Middle East and Asia in particular are still very, very healthy growth rates.</p>

          <p>And, I know you didn't want to get too involved with respect to next year's outlook, but in the past, you've talked about division operating profit around this 8 plus percent level. Seeing what we're seeing here in the U.S., maybe versus what you're seeing in your international business, do you feel that a lot of the weakness here can still be offset by your international business, or is that number at risk?</p>

          <p>Mike? Well, you know, the international business as Mike said, and again, we all look at international as Mike's business is in PI as well as our Latin American businesses, and I think taken together they continue to perform very well, and our outlook for the future, again, let's be very careful. We don't know where these macro economies are going, but given what we are seeing today, we still feel bullish about our outlook for our international businesses. We are also feeling good about our North American snack business and believe me, going forward, we are feeling better and better about our North American beverage business, too. So we're not providing our guidance for 2009 as yet because we want to see where the FX lands and the macroeconomic situation lands up and at this point, we feel pretty good about our future.</p>

          <p>I'd just echo, I spoke to investors in early September at a conference, and I think I was pretty clear and I think I was the only person who said be careful about the forex rates. Now, even I didn't predict how much they would change in the last two weeks, but excluding forex, I feel very good about our plans for next year in our international business and I think we'll have another very strong year.</p>

          <p>Thank you all for participating in our call today. Let me just close by saying we feel very confident about the fundamentals of our business, and we're facing challenges that are really out of our control that affect others as well. But we feel strong -- we feel very confident about the capability of our people, our brand, the investments we are making, our go-to-market systems. We feel very, very good about all of that. Our snack business globally is performing exceedingly well. Internationally, our beverage business is performing very strong, too. Our North American beverage business is our only work in process and based on the plans we have in place, the reinvestments we're making, we think that's going to be a great success story next year, too. Our portfolio balance is a great asset and we think our productivity-for-growth program is far-reaching and gives us the breathing room to reinvest in the business. We are focused on sustainable long-term growth and we've created the flexibility to weather any short-term challenges. So, we remain a great operating company and our biggest assets, as I said, are the strength of our brands, our go-to-market capabilities but most importantly the tremendous people we have in PepsiCo and we know what we need to get done going into the future. So, thank you.</p>
