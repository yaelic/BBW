          <p>Good day, everyone and welcome to the EOG Resources 2008 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us on Election Day. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2008 earnings and operational results.</p>
          <p>This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.</p>
          <p>This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.</p>
          <p>The SEC permits producers to disclose only proved reserves in their securities filings. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken, may include other categories of reserves. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. An updated Investor Relations presentation and statistics were posted to our website last night.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP, Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP, Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>We believe our third-quarter results can be characterized as another consistent quarter. We hit our volume projections and all of our costs were in line or lower than predicted. We filed an 8-K with fourth quarter and full-year guidance yesterday. These 8-K projections are consistent with the guidance we provided earlier in the year, and I'll discuss them in a minute when I review operations.</p>
          <p>I'll now review our third-quarter net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow, and then I will provide an operational review, including directional thoughts regarding EOG's 2009 plans. Tim Driggers will then discuss capital structure, and I'll close with a hydrocarbon macro overview summary.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $1.6 billion, or $6.20 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $588 million or $2.34 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>I'll now address our ongoing strategy and operational highlights. In current energy sector and indeed all industries, we are currently transiting through a vexatious period. In times like these, solid company fundamentals matter more than never. On the last quarterly call, I noted the five components that we believe constitute a premiere independent E&amp;P company, all of which have been longstanding goals at EOG. Four of these components are measurable and one is subjective. The measurable components are ROCE, debt-adjusted production per share growth, low unit cost, and debt coverage ratios. In 2008, we believe we'll score number one in the peer group in three and possibly all four of the measurable categories. The fifth and more subjective category involves being an early low cost mover in new horizontal resource plays, and we believe we score well in this category also. More importantly, in 2009, we expect to achieve the same rankings in all five categories.</p>
          <p>Looking out to 2009, there's a large degree of uncertainty regarding future natural gas and oil prices. So let me provide some guidelines regarding EOG's 2009 strategy, starting with our volume projections.</p>
          <p>We believe that 2009 North American gas prices will primarily be a function of winter weather severity. If 2009 gas prices average more than $8, we expect to grow total company production 14%. If we have a warm winter and we average $7 Henry Hub price, we'll curtail our gas drilling activity and total company production will grow 10%.</p>
          <p>In either case, the governing factor in our CapEx budget will be the balance sheet. We will target a CapEx program that is approximately in line with cash flow, providing roughly flat year-end 2008 and year-end 2009 net debt. We'll provide a specific 2009 CapEx number on our next earnings call, when we have a better definition of winter weather.</p>
          <p>In short, we don't intend to dramatically grow North American gas volumes at prices below $8. The different growth path between $7 and $8 Henry Hub does not imply that our gas investments require $8 to be economic. Simply put, we don't intend to cram gas into an oversupplied market if prices average $7.</p>
          <p>In either growth scenario, there are three items in common. First, in 2009, total company crude oil condensate and NGLs are expected to grow 33% from this year's 60,000 barrel a day level, to 80,000 barrels a day next year. Of this increase, total company crude and condensate production is expected to grow 43% year-over-year, and natural gas liquids production is expected to grow 10% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The primary growth engine of the liquids will be the North Dakota Bakken, with a lesser but increasing contributions from the Barnett Oil and other plays. I'll remind you that even at $65 a barrel, oil was still selling at a $11 per Mcfe BTU equivalency, making our oil investment still attractive.</p>
          <p>Second, we expect only a small year-over-year increase in natural gas production from Trinidad, Canada, and other international, so most of our gas increase will emanate from the U.S. And third, it's unlikely that EOG will pursue a merger, significant acquisitions, significant dispositions, or chase high-priced acreage in 2009. This is consistent what I believe that organic growth yields intrinsically superior reinvestment rates of return, compared to growth through mergers or acquisitions. In hindsight, we're pleased that we didn't participate in the high-priced acquisition acreage or merger game during 2008 or previous years.</p>
          <p>Addressing 2009 CapEx, what's the logic behind our capital allocation? Simply put, we've got enough natural gas and crude oil drilling inventory to last us roughly 15 years. In 2009, we'll give first priority to oil investments because even at $65 a barrel, they're high ROR, hence 33% year-over-year crude oil condensate and NGL growth. Roughly 40% of our 2009 North American capital budget will be devoted to oil projects.</p>
          <p>Regarding gas, if we have a moderate or cold winter, we'll pursue a high level of drilling activity to generate 14% total company production growth. If 2009 gas prices disappoint, we'll defer some gas drilling till a more propitious time and target 10% total company production growth. The key point here is that we don't intend to run up our debt taking $7 gas, so the production growth numbers I've provided are debt adjusted per share. One likely positive we'll have in 2009 is lower per-well cost, as we're already seeing some decreases in service company pricing.</p>
          <p>Now let me refocus you on 2008. In the third quarter, we beat our 8-K mid-point volume guidance, despite hurricane-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico and in Southeast and West Texas. In the fourth quarter, we curtailed 70 million cubic feet a day of Rocky Mountain gas for most of October, due to low wellhead prices and will currently anticipate experiencing an unanticipated curtailment of 80 million cubic feet per day net for approximately six weeks in Trinidad, due to mechanical problems at a methanol plant. In spite of all that, we expect to increase 2008 production 15.1%, which is consistent with the target we announced in February.</p>
          <p>I've covered a lot of conceptual ground with you today. For brevity, I'm not going to recite a lot of individual wells' results, but I will cover most of our highlight plays. Our North Dakota Bakken play continues to yield consistent overwhelmingly economic results and has overachieved this year versus our forecast. Three recent highlight wells are the Austin 21-28H, 18-21H, and 10-34H, which posted corresponding peak gross production rates of 2847, 3029, and 3477 barrels oil per day.</p>
          <p>Our overall average well results continue to be outstanding. In the IR presentation that was posted on our website yesterday have a slide showing the quality of EOG's Bakken wells versus offsetting wells drilled by other companies. Generating efficient horizontal completions that maximize the productivity per acre of rock is an EOG strength, and I'd urge to view similar charts in this same IR presentation relating to Barnett Johnson County completions. These comparisons, in my opinion, are shockingly stark, and are one reason why we generate such strong relative ROCEs, and, in a time of low hydrocarbon prices, why we'll retain better economics than other companies.</p>
          <p>Returning to the Bakken, we now have 370,000 acres captured, and last quarter, we told you that our 80 million barrels net reserve estimate was contained in the core area and we hope to extend this play into the non-core area, where per-well reserves are 250 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent, versus 850 MBO in the core. Outside the core, with 250 MBO and $65 flat oil, the economics still yield a 30% direct after-tax unlevered reinvestment rate of return, while the core area still generates 100% direct ATROR at $65 oil flat.</p>
          <p>We've now drilled two successful wells outside the core with initial production rates of 500 to 700 barrels of oil per day, extending the reservoir size above 80 million barrels of oil sent. However, additional drilling is required to determine how much larger this accumulation will become. Additionally, we've started a pilot CO2 injection program in the core area to see if we can increase overall recovery above the 10% primary level. Results from the CO2 trial won't be available until mid-2009. We still have several years of drilling inventory in the core area, and then multiple years outside the core.</p>
          <p>Another horizontal oil play that we mentioned in our February Analyst Conference was our Colorado North Park play. We've recently drilled a step-out to our discovery well and the early results indicate it's better than the discovery well. Development of this North Park asset will be slow due to sensitivity to surface use and pipeline take-away issues, but we're optimistic regarding this accumulation. We're currently drilling another well and should have these results by the next earnings call.</p>
          <p>In the Horn River Basin of British Columbia, you may recall that earlier this year, we reported encouraging results from two short lateral horizontal shale wells. We've now drilled, completed, and tested three full-length lateral wells and the results comport with our earlier optimism. These wells IPed at 16, 12, and 9 million cubic feet per day, respectively, and have performed well during the first period of sales, ranging from 30 to 60 days, confirming our estimates that we have at least six net Bcf captured here on our 150,000 net acres.</p>
          <p>Another reason I focused on the well quality issue in the Barnett and Bakken before is that our early data in the British Columbia Horn River Basin suggest a similar trend. We believe our three wells are among the best wells completed by anybody to date in the Horn River Basin. We still think it will be 2011 before significant pipeline take-away is available from this area.</p>
          <p>In our Barnett operations, our results continue to be consistently good. For the total play, we expect to average around 460 billion cubic feet equivalents for full-year 2008 from this asset, slightly less than the 470 target we articulated in February. This slight shortfall is a result of gas and natural gas liquid pipeline restrictions we noted on the last quarterly call.</p>
          <p>In the Barnett gas areas, yesterday's press release highlights several new Johnson County monster wells with IPs ranging from 6.5 to 10 million cubic feet a day. I would again call your attention to the Johnson County well completion chart on our website. Simply put, as is the case in the North Dakota Bakken, we're making better wells in Johnson County than other companies, hands down.</p>
          <p>The importance of this Barnett well completion outperformance isn't limited to Johnson County. We're also consistently making respectable wells in Hill, Palo Pinto, and Erath counties, and have found acreage competition and cost to be much lower than in the core area, because other companies are having difficulty making economic wells in these counties. In Hill County, we're averaging 1.65 net Bcf per well, and our results in the Western counties such as Erath and Palo Pinto, while not as spectacular as in Johnson County, are similar in terms of finding cost to what's been reported by others in the Fayetteville and Woodford plays.</p>
          <p>Regarding the North Barnett oil play, our natural gas processing plant should be on line in February, so volumes from this play will begin slowly ramping up late in the first quarter of 2009. Because these oil wells are not high volume like the Bakken, now we're talking here about initial rates of roughly 250 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas, compared to roughly 2,000 barrels a day in the Bakken. The liquid's contribution from the Bakken oil play will provide only a modest portion of our 33% liquids increase in 2009 with an expanding role in later years. We're still working on optimizing the well completion rest of the year, since we have a time window because of the current limited gas pricing capability in the area. We'll provide more specific data regarding this play once we get our gas plant up and running.</p>
          <p>In the Pennsylvania Marcellus play, we can now report that we've achieved success on a portion of our 220,000 net acres. We've now drilled a couple wells and delineated about 40,000 acres in Bradford County that we believe will generate 2.0 gross Bcf per well for a $2.25 net finding cost. Net reserves on these 40,000 acres for EOG are likely 600 Bcfs. As you know, we've been cautious regarding this play and will note that reports by others regarding reserves per well are considerably more optimistic than our estimates. During the next six months we'll be attempting to prove up more of our acreage, and will believe &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; will begin a one-rig development program on our 40,000 acres in 2009. I continue to caution that, because the infrastructure and regulatory issues, the Marcellus won't have an impact on the macro gas supply picture until after 2012 if indeed it develops into an area-wide play.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Haynesville play, we're currently fracture-treating our first horizontal well on our 115,000-acre position, so we can't add to the Haynesville body of knowledge at this time.</p>
          <p>The primary reason why we were able to hit our 15% volume target this year in spite of voluntary curtailments, hurricane interruptions, pipeline restrictions, and plant downtime, is that simply put, we're consistently making good wells, both oil and gas, across the board in North America. Although we highlight the Barnett and Bakken, the rest of our North American inventory is generating great results that will be replicable in 2009 and subsequent years. Our mid-continent horizontal Atoka and Cleveland plays continue to perform well. In the Uinta Basin, in an area that previously had been drilled with only vertical wells, we recently drilled our first horizontal well with production of 5 million cubic feet a day with 1800 PSI flowing tubing pressure after one month, which is much better that we expected. In South Texas, we just completed two wells that were directionally-drilled under Nueces Bay near Corpus Christi. They're producing at a combined gross rate of 28 million cubic feet a day and 1800 barrels of condensate per day. We have an average 80% working interest in these wells. We think this will be a 100 net Bcf field. The bottom line is that EOG has a smoothly running North American oil and gas engine.</p>
          <p>Switching to Trinidad, I mentioned earlier that we're currently experiencing a curtailment of 80 million cubic feet a day net for approximately six weeks due to an unexpected mechanical problem at a third-party methanol plant. In the North Sea, we expect to drill at least three oil and gas exploration wells commencing in the second quarter 2009.  In China, we'll spud our first horizontal gas well in January, and it will likely be late 2009 before we know if this program is successful.  Between Trinidad, the North Sea, and China, I expect we may surprise some people with 2009 positive results outside North America.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss CapEx and the capital structure.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter 2008, total exploration and development expenditures, including asset retirement obligations, were $1.6 billion with $74 million of acquisitions.  In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property plant and equipment, were $124 million.  Capitalized interest for the quarter was $10.6 million.  Year-to-date total exploration and development expenditures including asset retirement obligations were $3.8 billion with $109 million of acquisitions.  Total gathering, processing, and other expenditures were $321 million.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we did a bond offering to effectively term-out our short-term commercial paper borrowing.  We issued five-year notes totaling $400 million at 6.125%, and ten-year notes totaling $350 million at 6.875%.</p>
          <p>Our credit ratings are A3 and A-, and our game plan remains consistent, to stay very conservative on the financial side.  In terms of liquidity, we have a $1 billion revolver which has never been drawn.  We have no exposure to Lehman.  Also included in the IR presentation this morning is a summary slide taken from the sell side.  It shows 2009 estimated debt to cash flow &#x2013; cash flow ratios using $75 oil and $7 gas.  Using these metrics and these particular estimates, EOG could pay off its debt in just over three months.</p>
          <p>At September quarter-end, total debt outstanding was $1.9 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 17.5%.  At September 30, we had 886 million dollars of cash, giving us non- GAAP net debt of $1 billion, for a net debt to total cap ratio of 10%.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%, and the deferred tax ratio was 80%. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K with fourth quarter and full-year 2008 guidance. We also filed the third quarter 10-Q. For the full year 2008, the 8-K has an effective tax range of 33 to 37% and a deferral percentage of 65 to 85%.</p>
          <p>Using the midpoint of the updated 8-K guidance, our full-year 2008 unit cost for leasing wells, DD&amp;A, G&amp;A, total exploration, net interest expense, and excluding transportation and taxes other than income, are forecast to increase 3.7% over 2007.</p>
          <p>Estimated exploration and development capital expenditures for 2008 excluding acquisitions are $4.55 billion. Estimated gatherings, processings, and other expenditures were $400 million.</p>
          <p>Now I'll now turn it back to Mark to discuss the gas macro, hedging, and his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim.</p>
          <p>I continue to believe that the primary determinant of 2009 gas prices will be winter weather. A cold winter will likely generate $8 to $8.50 average prices, and a warm winter, $7. I believe the 2009 North American net natural gas supply will grow at most 0.6 Bcf per day year-over-year, which comports well to the likely electricity demand growth.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 hedged position was articulated in a 10-Q filed last night. We are about 30% hedged at a $9.71 gas price, and are unhedged regarding oil. We also have 60 million cubic feet a day of 2010 gas hedged for collars at attractive prices, and have added some <mark type="inaudible" /> basis hedges for 2009 to '11.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are five important points to take away from this call. First, with a focus on the balance sheet, we're going to let the 2009 gas price determine what our overall CapEx and total company production growth will be. We've easily got the organic capability and high rate of return inventory to grow total company production 14% next year and subsequent years, but we'll only do so in a high natural gas commodity environment. Low debt is still a very important criteria.</p>
          <p>Second, we expect to continue to lead the peer group in ROCE, and based upon our current inventory quality, I don't see that changing in the future. The most important criteria that gives us consistently higher than peer ROCEs is our ability to grow at high rates organically and not rely on acquisitions or M&amp;A to generate growth, and that won't change in the future.</p>
          <p>Third, we've now verified reserve upside above the 80 million barrels net to the Bakken, and have confirmed Marcellus reserves on a portion of our Appalachian acreage. Fourth, we're continuing to work on new horizontal ideas, and will disclose them whenever we've got acreage positions locked up. And fifth, our Trinidad, North Sea, and China components may surprise on the upside in 2009.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&amp;A. Cindy, can you queue the Q&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we will take our first question today from Tom Gardner with Simmons and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Mark -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, this is &#x2013; you've been pretty clear on your CapEx comments on the call. So in line of that, can you discuss if you see the current environment as an opportune time to increase your resource play inventory? It sounds like you're just not going to go there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you what we are seeing right now, Tom. I mentioned on the call that we're not &#x2013; we're not really going to be making high-acreage acquisitions or making mega-producing property acquisitions. That's just not our style. But we think that what's going to come out in 2009 are a lot drill-to-earn opportunities on other people's acreage, companies that either don't have the horizontal expertise or are so strapped for capital that they can't &#x2013; they've got expiring leases and can't go that route.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't be surprised if we see in 2009 that we shift some of the drilling that we do away from some of our core areas, to maybe some acreage that we don't really have captured at this particular time, that belongs to somebody else.</p>
          <p>In terms of overall resource play focus, we're continuing to be quite aggressive chasing new horizontal ideas, both gas and oil, but our game plan is to be the first in where you can get cheap acreage, as opposed to being the second or the tenth in, where you're paying big dollars for acreage. So I expect that we're going to have some upside surprises during the year on some of the resource plays that we haven't disclosed yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on that subject, given these large IPs and Johnson County horizontals, does this change your average outlook for Johnson County reserves, per well reserves? I mean, you were guiding to 1.8 to 2.2 Bcf at the Analyst Day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm &#x2013; we might be tending toward the high end of that size. I don't think it's going to change it up to 3 Bcf or so. But I think the key take-away, Tom, for the Barnett gas, is that the Johnson County is very competitive, every acre's leeched there. But the western counties and the southern counties, Hill County, have been pretty much left wide open for EOG. People who were competitors out there just haven't been able to make good wells, and you can look in that Johnson County chart and that's the reason they haven't been able to, whereas we have been able to. So we've been able to have a fairly wide-open field there without much competition.</p>
          <p>So that's what really changed in the last year, is that we now view the Barnett, particularly in the western counties and the southern counties, as more of a growth opportunity than we would have viewed it a year ago. In Johnson County we're doing better than we expected, but growth opportunity in terms of adding acreage there is very, very minimal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. And one last question. I'd must get your view on sort of a gas growth information that we get. In the past, you've indicated some skepticism over 914 data. Can you give us a view on &#x2013; your view on accuracy of that data, and perhaps your view on base declines in North America, ex-drilling, and what it's going to take to balance the natural gas markets going forward with respect to rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean we have been skeptical of the EIA-914 data, and we've devoted a fair amount of effort to analyzing the IHS data versus the EIA data. I do believe EIA data is directionally correct. I just don't believe it's absolutely correct. And what we've found, for example, our comparison indicates that in the state of Texas, the EIA estimates may well be overstated by about eight-tenths of a Bcf a day versus IHS.</p>
          <p>In Michigan, unusual state, the IHS data can't replicate EIA and it's indeed about six-tenths a Bcf a day lower, and then if you look at the other states, we think there's about a six-tenth of a Bcf difference there. So if you add all that up, it comes out to, we would say perhaps production growth in absolute terms this year, is maybe about 2 Bcf a day less than what the EIA stated. It's still up considerably.</p>
          <p>And then I think the surprising thing that we've kind of come up with is that the &#x2013; our estimate is total U.S. supply growth, including LNG, including Canada imports, '09 versus '08, is 0.6 Bcf a day, and that's comprised of just a quick run through the numbers. We think Canada imports will be down about nine-tenths of a Bcf a day. That's a combination of demand growth in the heavy oil plus the production declines. We think Gulf of Mexico next year drops off 0.5 Bcf a day, because the rig count there has really fallen versus a year ago. Rockies goes up 0.2, limited by the Rex take-away capacity. Barnett, only up 0.3 Bcf a day next year, and we still believe the Barnett will plateau in '09. And then remainder U.S. onshore, up about 1.1, and then LNG or course is about up 0.4.</p>
          <p>So I know everyone's looking at the &#x2013; and dreaming, oh my gosh, there's a terrible supply glut and gas prices are in bad shape, but we think, with the slowdown in drilling particularly, that the big surprise next year will be that the supply growth to U.S. is considerably lower than probably anybody is predicting today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're estimating around &#x2013; we're estimating that the rig count goes down somewhere between 200 or maybe 3, 400 rigs overall. And like I say, we've already seen rigs being moved out of the Barnett. In fact, we're going to slow down a bit in the Barnett and probably remove about three rigs from our fleet in the Barnett.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had one question, and it sort of goes around how you look at farm-in agreements. Arguably your balance sheet, your financial position is obviously a lot better than especially some of the small caps and microcaps who have paid high prices for acreage. How do you view farm-in agreements? Are you seeing a lot of those in the industry, and would you consider those, especially if you are more constructive on gas going into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; we've already seen some farm-in opportunities and I expect we'll see a plethora more of them pretty soon. And the way we would view it is, and I'd just give a simple example. If we were going to spend, let's just say $50 million in our Vernal, Utah, Uinta Basin area, that the acreage is locked down and held kind of forever. We may say, well maybe we'll slow down drilling in the Uinta Basin area and spend that same amount of money earning into a new position in a farm-in through somebody, and in that instance, what we've done is, we still got all of our PUD reserves and potential in the Uinta Basin, but we've now accreted additional potential and it's</p>
          <p>So I would say that, look for us to be doing some of that at least, maybe a lot of that in 2009, as opposed to taking advantage of a company who's &#x2013; needs to sell assets badly and trying to get into a competitive bidding war to buy producing properties. We just don't think that's a good reinvestment rate of return way to go.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, nice quarter. Mark, can you talk about &#x2013; just specific to guidance, it looked like oil differentials, the guidance widened in the fourth quarter? Is that a function of trucking out of the Barnett, or can you &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; out of the Williston, out of Bakken. Can you talk a little more about that? Or what was driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the answer to your question is yes. Clearly the biggest growth area we have for oil production and it will go into next year is the Bakken, and what's happened up there is, I don't have to remind you or anybody else, that not only is EOG having success in the Bakken, but a lot of other companies are having success up there. And the oil pipeline infrastructure, the oil take-away infrastructure, has just been subsumed by the EOG volumes plus other companies' volumes.</p>
          <p>And so as a consequence, we're piping about half our oil out, and then we're having to truck about the other half of our oil out, and I expect that that's a similar case for most other companies who are up there. We expect to get that problem fixed by mid-year of next year by expanding the pipeline capacity, the oil pipeline capacity, out of there. And &#x2013; but there will be some trucking differentials that will probably last until mid-year '09.</p>
          <p>And I'll also note that we're currently looking at a dense phase gas pipeline to get the very, very rich gas that we are stripping out of the oil up there, to get that into Alliance Pipeline and get it to a Chicago market, and we hope to have that project in sometime late in '09. So.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that your pipeline? Or who's building the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The gas &#x2013; this dense phase gas pipeline will be built by EOG. On the oil side, we're in discussions with several other companies, but &#x2013; and it's just &#x2013; we're not sure whether we'll take an interest, equity interest in it, or other parties will. That's still open at this point. But it's a very, very high priority project for us and for other companies that are producing oil up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is that &#x2013; trucking it's somewhere in the 12 to $15 range?</p>
          <p>As far as left to differential, when all's said and done? Is that a good number to use?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it's probably even a little bit higher than that right now. It may be up to $18.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One more question and I'll let everybody else jump in. Getting back to the Barnett oil. How many wells have you drilled? I know you'd initially targeted 60 to 80, back in February, but how many wells have you got down? And can you talk about &#x2013; when you start running that &#x2013; the sensitivity as far as oil prices, what kind of number do you need, as far as oil, to make this thing work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't have a count right now exactly of how many wells we've drilled. We've done a lot of experimenting on a lot of those wells. But the question is, how low do oil prices have to go before we get into a situation here that doesn't look all that good. And the answer is, at today's oil prices and $7 gas prices, we're generating about a 30% rate of return, based on our typical wells that we expect, which is 100,000 barrels of oil gross, about 0.35 million cubic feet of gas, and about 45,000 of barrels of NGLs. So if oil does drop to $40 a barrel or something like that, it's not obvious that this project's going to be economic. On the other hand, if it goes back up to 90 or $100 a barrel, we think it's going to be tremendously economic.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are your current thoughts on the 320-acre downspacing potential in and out of your core Bakken properties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. At this juncture, we've drilled one 320-acre downspace well and we're monitoring it, and where we sit at this point in the core area is that we would say that if that the CO2 injection turns out to be a viable opportunity, then it's a slam-dunk that we go to 320-acre spacing. If we find that we're not improving the recovery above that 10% with 320-acre spacing in the core area, then it's more of a close call, and it's not obvious that the 320s are necessary for draining the wells. In other words, you put in the capital, but the incremental reserve you get are not all that much.</p>
          <p>As you go outside the core area, in some of this &#x2013; this area that we've said is now made the reserves bigger than 80 million barrels, because of the well quality, the rock quality is not quite as good there, it looks like that will pretty well certainly be on, spaced on 320-acre spacing. That give you some direction on that, Brian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does. Thanks. And then in the Marcellus, what would you say changed over the last few months that's given you are more confidence, at least on that I think 40,000 acres you mentioned?</p>
          <p>And when you think about the $2.25 an Mcfe  cost, you see that as a starting point from which you would expect decreases, or do you feel that's a firm number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now that's a program number. I mean, it may improve with time. We haven't drilled a large population of wells there. The biggest thing that's changed there and gotten us over the hump is kind of the completion efficacy there. We think now that we're getting a higher degree of our fracs focused in the Marcellus Shale, as opposed to going outside the Marcellus Shale, in the Marcellus, as opposed to the Barnett or the Bakken, the risk appears to be greater, just on relative rock strength, that you can frac out a zone and waste your frac energy.</p>
          <p>But doing some tweaking to our fracs, we think at least on this 40,000 acres, we'd get that pretty well resolved. But it is fair to say that, so far, we haven't been able to replicate the numbers that some other companies have put up. We have seen numbers of 4 Bcf gross, 3.5, 4 Bcf gross, for a typical Marcellus well. I'll be a little surprised if that turns out to be the number across a wide area. But our numbers are more like the 2 right now.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Mark, could you talk about &#x2013; you mentioned that you're planning on dropping maybe three rigs in the Barnett Shale. Could you talk about the reasons for that? And could you just talk about whether or not you're slowing down anywhere else at this point? And are you transferring rigs to another location?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're kind of concerned there activity to our planned budget for 2008. And we're more efficient with the number of rigs that we have. So we're drilling more wells with less rigs, and we've just reduced there in Barnett thus far. We're dropping a couple of other rigs. We've declined from 80 rigs down to a 71, just throughout EOG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also that's just the efficiency. You'll probably see on a couple of the charts in our presentation, where, yes, we reduced our days substantially. For instance, in the Bakken, we were requiring about 37 days in 2006. Now we're down to 25 days for the average of 2008, record wells' down in the 15-day range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; is economics a factor here? Are you seeing any areas where, giving the NYMEX prices, given wide wellhead differentials, the economics just don't work out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh it's &#x2013;  I think almost everything we have is economic down to $6 or 6.50 an Mcf, it's just kind of a case of do we want to put our drilling in 40% projects, or in 15% projects. So it's not a case where anything has gone underwater economically today, but it's just a case, as we said, that if we really have $7 gas and a warm winter, we're not going to bust our butt as a company to go pushing a lot of gas into a $7 gas market. So we'll just sit on some of our ideas and wait for better gas times.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen some decline in just the drilling rigs. Quite a number of our rigs are not long-term committed. Some of the completion units, directional surveys services, some of that. Overall probably just a 5% decline. We're talking to quite a number of service providers and expecting to see fees reduce And of course fuel's gone down quite lot as well. There's the particular inventory is increasing, and there's several that are saying that gas will be seeing declines here, at least first quarter '09.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're still studying the Three Forks/Sanish outside the partial areas. We've said in the past, in the partial area, we really don't see too much prospectivity there, but we have 370,000 net acres in the total Williston Basin, of which about 110,000 are in that partial/Austin area. And so that big slug of acreage outside of that, we think it's highly prospective for particularly Three Forks.</p>

          <p>Morning, Mark.</p>

          <p>Gil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would the change &#x2013; or your sort of variable capital spending budget, between 7 and $8, I guess the question I have is, on one hand, if you slow down, does that free up spare capacity among your people? And what happens &#x2013; and where &#x2013; what do those people end up doing? On the other end, if you accelerate, so to speak, does it &#x2013; and you're &#x2013; I guess you're already seeing this in the Bakken, does it tax the infrastructure, either on your people, or on the &#x2013; in the take-away infrastructure? And maybe you've sort of addressed this already, but how do you deal with the accelerating and decelerating downstream impacts to infrastructure, both people and the hard infrastructure, in those areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The four areas where we're seeing infrastructure-related issues, around Williston Basin, Bakken, where we're being proactive, and in a lot of cases, building our own infrastructure, and the Barnett oil, where there was essentially no infrastructure for the rich gas processing and we're building our own plants and infrastructure there.</p>
          <p>And then up in Canada, in the Horn River Basin area, where infrastructure is pretty limited and we think pragmatically that we'll have a third party install that infrastructure as opposed to EOG, but it's probably going to be '11 before that happens. And then in the Marcellus, that is highly, highly infrastructure challenged, and we're not sure how we're going to address that, really, but it will probably be third party there.</p>
          <p>So as you find these resource plays, what really source out of these is that many of them are in areas where you never had higher significant hydrocarbon accumulations, and the resource plays in aggregate have turned out to be bigger than anyone expected. I think if you just take the Bakken, for example, or the Barnett, and what people thought it would be four, five years ago, and then what it is today, and I'm talking about not only for EOG, but for the rest of the industry, they've turned out to be considerably bigger, and hence, we've got those issues.</p>
          <p>So, what we've had to do as a company is devote more effort than we have in past years to infrastructure work. And on the people side, I'd say that for 2008, we were probably operating at about 120% of capacity on our people side. If we go for $7 gas and 10% production growth, maybe our people will only be working at 95% capacity or so next year. But it's not the &#x2013; it's still a people-short business, in terms of engineers, geologists, land men, et cetera. And we think we can flex easily with our staff between the 10 to 14% volume growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not like there's going to free-up capacity to move them onto other things, necessarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say, it's not obvious that we can say, okay, if we're going to grow 10%, we can reallocate people to something else. No, I don't think that's anything we can do with these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think I know the answer to this second question, but your interest in maybe taking an interest in some of these farm-outs -- potential farm-outs, does that in any way suggest that all of the &#x2013; or many of the important new resource plays have already been discovered in North America? And that you need to go back and look at these farm-out potentials? Or do you still see that there's a nice pool of undiscovered resource potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You were right in you know what the answer to that question is. We still think there's a considerable more resource potential attacking each plays with horizontal drilling and so we're focused heavily on that. The drill to earn things, the farm-ins, they will be niche things that come up. But the way to view it is, we have a chance to capture acreage that a year ago we would have never had a chance to capture, where someone else has perhaps paid a high price for it or maybe they just intended to drill it themselves and they can't now. And so those are pretty good opportunities for us, and what gets us into those opportunities are those well completion charts that I have referred to in our &#x2013; what's posted on our website in the IR presentation. We can show people that for an acre of rock, we'll make a better well than our competitors. And we've proven that clearly in the Bakken, clearly in the Barnett, and early time in the Horn River, and people are aware of this, and they say, well if I'm going to farm out, I think I'll do it to the one that's going to generate the most production from that acre of rock, and that certainly appears to EOG.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning here, folks. Quick question on your CapEx plans for next year. Could you guys kind of go ahead and sort of try to prioritize your key plays, in terms of what you would drill? Just curious as to how some of your gas plays prioritize next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, the first priority is that we'll be looking at the oil side, and we said that 40% of our CapEx, North American CapEx, will go to oil. That's up from probably 30% of our CapEx, North American CapEx, this year that was devoted toward oil. So we'll be shifting a significant movement there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the gas side, the way we'll prioritize things, the difference between the 14 and 10% volume growth, is one, we'll look at areas that &#x2013; where we have no lease termination or lease-life issues. And those would be areas that we would likely throttle back most readily. And just a couple that come to mind, our Uinta Basin area, we've got our leases secured, and so we could accelerate or decelerate drilling there and not lose any acreage. Our Mississippi Chalk play is another one that's pretty much in the same state. So a large determinant will be &#x2013; and really, to some degree, our Barnett is now in pretty darn good position, where we don't have to drill a zillion wells to meet lease expiries. We've now got that pretty well locked down. So those are just some examples of where we &#x2013; if we cut back drilling, it would be more on the basis of how do we hold together all of our acreage, as opposed to turning loose some of that and ranking in some other <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just jumping over your Ootla play. Obviously you've had some wells on stream for a little while here. Could you just give us a sense of what type of decline rates you guys think you could see on those wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've &#x2013; I mean, we've had wells on now for &#x2013; we've got two categories of wells. We've had a couple wells that we mentioned in February that were short laterals. We say short laterals, maybe they were 1500-foot lateral length. And those wells kind of gave us a tantalizing hope that if we could get a lateral length about twice that long, we'd end up with pretty good wells. And indeed, that's what's happened. We've now got wells &#x2013; the best well there, where we have had on now about 60 days, for the first 30 days, it averaged over 10 million a day average rate for the first 30 days. That's probably translates to a well that's roughly a 10 Bcf well.</p>
          <p>So if you go back to what we articulated in February at the Analyst Conference, we gave a matrix and said the economics would be X and Y under cases of 4 and 6 Bcf per well. And from what we're seeing now, we think those reserves per well estimates are probably going to be extremely conservative and we're going to be able to beat those pretty readily.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that, our experience from the Bakken, our experience from the Barnett is, it takes about 20 or maybe 30 wells to get the frac recipe right before you have something you can kind of rubberstamp. And we're getting these pretty darn good wells up there in Canada which just roughly our fifth &#x2013; fourth and fifth wells. So we think there's probably going to be a lot of improvement coming from that.</p>
          <p>So net-net out of all that, I think it strongly reaffirms that &#x2013; we've said we probably have minimum of 6 net Tcf on this acreage, back in February, and I think the data that we've generated subsequently strongly reaffirms that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess, just given that backdrop, what are your drilling plans there this winter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll be &#x2013; Gary, you want to address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to go ahead and contract 1, probably 1.5 rigs. We'll drill 13, 14 rigs here 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>13, 14 wells in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or wells, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2009. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason for that, too, is we're just watching our capacity. We've got a firm capacity of somewhere around 35 million a day, and there's 45 to maybe 50 million in capacity available on the line. So we'll drill and complete to fill available capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question here, on the Haynesville play. It sounds like you guys got you first well, you're going to frac it pretty soon here. Can you give us a little bit of color in terms of where your acreage is located in the play, and maybe what your potential plans are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, really, our 115,000 net acres, it's pretty &#x2013; relatively evenly split, maybe a little more heavily weighed towards Texas. And probably about 40% of it &#x2013; maybe 45% of it's HPP. And it's spread throughout what others and we have mapped as the core area. It's a pretty big core area, I would say, and we're pretty well represented in all parts of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess, any thoughts to drill any follow-up wells or you want to kind of analyze your first results first before you move forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are drilling follow-up wells as we speak. We have our second well drilling now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Just a &#x2013;  first a macro question, thinking about LNG and Asian weakness. What are your thoughts going into next couple months around LNG imports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, going into the next couple months, David, I think the only way to incremental LNG would come here is if there's just absolutely no capacity in Asia or Europe for it, so I'm not &#x2013; we're programming, just guessing, that LNG '09 versus '08 goes up by about four-tenths a Bcf a day, and that's just on the assumption that these Qatari trains come on and that there turns out to be a little bit extra LNG. But I still foresee that the &#x2013; unfortunately the lowest priced net-backs for LNG all through 2009 is going to be North America, and so we would only get whatever the &#x2013; whatever the other markets absolutely cannot digest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then onto the Bakken, your gas plant and gas line capacity, is that 30 million a day, or do I have my notes wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we &#x2013; the gas line that we're going to be installing, it's going to have a capacity for, oh goodness, 80 million a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one that we've got installed now, in that plant, is good for 20 million a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Still have a cume of 100 million a day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We'll go ahead and retire the 20 million a day plant -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-and just go with the 80 million a day dense phase refrigeration unit and pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason for this dense phase, again, is, one of the issues we have is that this gas in the Bakken is extraordinarily rich in propanes, butanes, and heavier components. And right now, we're stripping it out basically on location there in western North Dakota, and that's just not a good place to sell that product. I mean, again you suffer a location differential, and so the game plan there is to get that &#x2013; all those rich liquids to Chicago, where you have a much more pleasant market price and you don't take a big ding on the differentials. So again, it's just a lead time issue there, but that's &#x2013; as in the oil, you'll notice our NGL differentials are not as great as we'd hoped, and the more NGLs they bring on in North Dakota, the more we have to get this problem fixed, and we expect we will by mid next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you think about NGLs, a little bigger picture, both southern region and what you have in the Bakken and Mid-Continent is, you've had this blowout and big drop-off in NGL realizations. What do you think about going into fourth quarter and then into next year as far as where NGL prices will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've penciled in that they're going to be about 55% of crude oil -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>55.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; on a kind of dollar per barrel basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 40% we're seeing now in Mid-Continent, that's anomalous?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think so, but we can't purport to be NGL market experts, so we can't even purport to be natural gas market experts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Neither can we, so that's all right. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our last question today will come from Ray Deacon with Free Trade Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey Mark. I was wondering if you could talk about your plans for Bradford County next year, and what kind of wells will you be drilling, horizontal or vertical? And then maybe some thoughts about Horn River and what your CapEx might look like there next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the Horn River, we said previously that we're going to average probably about 1, 1.5 rigs next year. So we'll have, I'll say a modest level of activity, and it's really more of kind of a learning curve activity, to fill up what gas pipeline take-away space there is. So it's definitely not going to be in a hyper ramp-up phase.</p>
          <p>In the Marcellus, it'll be fairly similar. We'll probably have one rig running year-round in the Marcellus. Most of the time, it'll be spent on that 40,000 acres, and then the rest &#x2013; that's proven up, and then the rest of it will be drilling on some of the other acreage, trying to prove it up. But we're, in our 10% or 14% volume forecast, neither the Marcellus, certainly not the Marcellus, and to not much degree the Horn River, are we really counting on significant volumes in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you said you thought that volumes wouldn't be meaningful in the Marcellus until 2012, did you mean you felt like for industry, or for you specifically, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'd say, Scott,  what I meant was for the macro industry. The &#x2013; it's clearly the most complex logistical area that we've had to deal with anywhere. It makes British Columbia look simple in comparison. And some of the recent, let's say legislation or regulations that have been proposed in Pennsylvania are likely to slow down things even more. So we just can't be saying we're into that market, we're going to have a ton of gas macro coming from Appalachia anytime soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more real quick one, I guess. I've been watching Waha mid-week prices drop over the last five or six weeks, and what &#x2013; is there anything you're doing specifically that protects you from some of that basis issue in &#x2013; with your Barnett gas, and does the sort of demise of these midstream MLPs affect any projects that you would have liked to as soon gone forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Barnett gas we've got pretty well covered with firm transportation to get it out of the Fort Worth area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're not really prone to getting beaten up on the differentials there, because we really get it moved out of the area. Where we are &#x2013; or at risk is in the Rockies, and in the Rockies, we've got &#x2013; I'm talking about now plus the next four, five years. We've got firm transportation on about half our volumes there, on CIG or Kinder Morgan's lines. But the other half, we are exposed on the differential, and that's why we are putting some Rockies basis hedges in place for 2009 and 2010.</p>
