        <plist>
          <p>Good morning for those of you in the U.S. and Latin America and good afternoon to all of you in Europe. This is Vera Rosi. And on behalf of Morgan Stanley, we are pleased to be hosting Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil first quarter '09 conference call. Speaking today will be Daniel Hajj, CEO of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, Carlos Garc&#xED;a-Moreno, CFO, and also with us is Daniela Lecuona, Head of IR. I will turn the call over Daniel Hajj. Thank you. Daniel?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you, Vera. Good morning everybody. Thank you for being on the call. Carlos Garc&#xED;a-Moreno is going to make a summary of the first quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning everyone. Thank you, Vera for hosting the call. In accordance with the economic situation was quite bad in both the U.S. and Mexico and it was &#x2013; there was a clear tendency for the economies of these main South American countries to deteriorate as well. Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil posted solid revenue growth helped by data services and strong EBITDA growth helped by the deterioration of subscriber growth in some of the main markets.</p>
          <p>We added 3.9 million subscribers in the quarter, bringing our subscriber base to 186.6 million. In North America both in U.S. and Mexico operation did pretty well in terms of net additions, which exceeded half a million subs in the U.S. and 1.2 million in Mexico. In South America, Brazil obtained 855,000 subs, which were up 28.9% of the markets net adds and Argentina 436,000. Ecuador and Peru maintained a high pace of subscriber growth both sequentially and annually.</p>
          <p>Colombia maintained a fair pace of gross additions, but a clean-up of our subscriber base led to a net reduction of 440,000 subs in the quarter. We have continued to make good inroads in the postpaid market in various countries supported by our investments in capacity and 3G network. In Mexico, our share has risen to 46.3% over the postpaid market.</p>
          <p>Total revenues rose 15.4% to 93.8 billion pesos. Equipment revenues were down somewhat, but service revenues grew rapidly, 18.5% year-on-year. They were well supported by data revenue growth of nearly 50% in annual terms, mostly on account of 3G services as helped prop up ARPUs in several countries. EBITDA was up nearly 13% as were operating profit. EBITDA margin at 40.8% of revenues were just slightly lower than the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense is down 11.2% year-on-year on lower debt and interest rates, while non-interest financial costs are rising for the most part from FX exposure and its hedging were roughly flat.</p>
          <p>We had a net profit of 16.4 billion peso in the quarter, which was almost up 19% from a year-ago. Our net debt came down by 8.9 billion pesos, but in gross terms it represented a reduction of 12.8 billion pesos. And the debt balance in peso terms rose because of the depreciation of the peso and it came back on the non-peso debt, that during the quarters the peso depreciated vis-&#xE0;-vis all exchanges in the region.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures totaled 10.6 billion pesos and share buybacks 6 billion, with the free cash flow totaling 15.8 billion pesos or 18.8% of service revenues. With our debt paid off completely all dollar denominated obligations will make our model pulling due this year including a prepayment of $300 million we made two days ago and have ample liquidity to one, committed credit lines, we have $3.5 billion including 1 billion just subscribed with the China Development Bank, and two, our chain cash position of just under $1 billion. Our remaining short-term debt can be fully paid with cash at hand.</p>
          <p>The average life of our debt stands at 9.7 years today with small amounts coming due both next year and 2011. With this, Vera, I would like to pass it back to you, so we can start the question-and-answer session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Carlos. Tony can you go ahead and open up for Q&amp;A now and while you organize the queue, I will ask a couple of questions. Daniel and Carlos could you talk about the sustainability of the trends in Mexico and in the other countries in Latin America, what you are seeing in terms of ARPUs and also net additions here during the second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vera, on sustainability well you &#x2013; everybody knows that Latin America is behind Mexico in this crisis and Mexico is behind U.S. in this crisis. So we are entering in Latin America, we are dealing this slowdown at this moment and we can &#x2013; what we clearly we can see is that the number of net additions that we are having in this year is going to go down. We forecast in October with some indicators on the economy that are totally different right now and we are lowering our net additions number of 19 million subscribers and we think it could be less about 10 to 15%, so we think that this 19 million is too high at this moment and we think that it could go down by 10 to 15%.</p>
          <p>In the other hand we are focusing a lot on postpaid and data revenues and I think this will help a lot, there is not going to be &#x2013; the net additions that maybe we are not going to get are the low income, the lowest spending subscriber, so I think this side of the additions maybe we are not going to get it. So in terms of ARPUs, Vera, well it's what we are seeing is that this crisis is hitting us on number of subscribers than in usage and if the crisis is more or less at this level, I think we can maintain the ARPUs if the crisis &#x2013; or follow the trend that we're having, if the crisis is getting more and more difficult, hard, bad, so, I think we're going to have less ARPUs.</p>
          <p>But it's very difficult to forecast everything you know that with this flu that it's happening in Mexico, moving to all America, so it's &#x2013; at this movement it's very difficult, but we're more on the idea that it's going to hit us more on new subscribers than on usage, but well, it's going to depend a lot on how those economies are going to develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Daniel just a follow-up question. If you see this scenario that you think it's going to hit you more on new subscribers than on usage that will be good for your EBITDA margins, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, it's what you're seeing this first quarter and, well it also &#x2013; the EBITDA depends a lot on cost control that we're making a big, big effort there and, also the exchange rates subsidies and the exchange rates moves, it's moving a lot all around. So, if we're going to depend a lot on that, but all overall if we're going to get less additions, but with the same trends of ARPU, well it's going to help a little bit the EBITDA yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will open now for the Q&amp;A.  Tony could you go ahead please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And we'll take our first question from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.  Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brilliant. On the net adds and the ARPU, can you talk about maybe how the competition is playing out in this new economic environment in Mexico and Brazil, now that you've mentioned that the economy might affect as negatively.  What are you seeing in the competitive marketplace in the different markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well talking about Brazil well it's, I think we have a lot of competition, we have four competitors, it's Vivo, TIM, Oi, Anos , and last year we saw Vivo really aggressive. At this moment I think TIM is the one that has been leading the aggressiveness in the market. Oi has been always looking for customers.  So while Brazil is always very competitive and I think it's going to still as competitive all this year because nobody wants to lose market share, nobody wants to lose postpaid customer, there is coming all this new data revenues that are coming fast, so everybody wants that so.</p>
          <p>While I think in Brazil, is going to maintain very competitive in this market.  Mexico, well Mexico is with also Nextel, is more segmented the competition in Mexico.  Nextel is doing very strong on postpaid subscribers.  <mark type="inaudible" /> is going for the postpaid subscribers, also on Telef&#xF3;nica, and us are looking for both.  But as you can see we are growing very good our postpaid base.  We are growing very good our data and that's why our ARPU is in this level.</p>
          <p>So all in crisis all overall that you are going to still see big competition in all the markets, not only in Mexico and in Brazil, I think all the markets has been very competitive and I think they are going to still be very competitive.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; we do our job last year and we &#x2013; the last two years we put a lot of money on CapEx, on 3G, on coverage, on quality.  And I think that's something that can help us a lot this year in terms of competitions, in number portability, by an example in Mexico and in Brazil, the two first countries that enter number portability, we have been gaining as the subscriber so that means that we are &#x2013; we have a good brand, we have good distribution, we have very good quality on the network, good coverage, good capacity and that is going to help this year and the next year.</p>
          <p>So I think we are in good shape to pass this &#x2013; this slowdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my second question is on the balance sheet. You produced a lot of nice cash flow, you paid down pretty significant amount of debt in the first quarter &#x2013; as you think about your use of cash proceeds for the rest of this year, can you talk to us a little bit about your stock buyback program and the pace with which you might execute it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have &#x2013; I think nobody has visibility on what is going to happen this year, when does this crisis is going to end.  What's going to happen with the debt.  There is a lot of uncertainties in the market today, and what we are seeing right now is we're being very careful on the &#x2013; on our working capital.  We &#x2013; we're working on reduced inventories, we are working on cutting cash flow.  We're trying to pay &#x2013; I think we already pay all the debt that we should pay this year.  We don't have anything else to pay this year.  So, we have been financially &#x2013; we want to be very careful and at this moment we don't know exactly if we're going to give another extra dividend or how much we're going buyback on shares.  But, as we told you &#x2013; we think we could be at least as the same amount that we do last year.  So it's where &#x2013; in buyback or in extra dividend, but we think we could be around the same amount of money that we do last year, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds very prudent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we want to be prudent in this moment, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, very good thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And our next question in queue that will come from the line of Rodrigo Villanueva with Merrill Lynch.  And your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning.  I have a couple of questions.  Given the drop in travelers a as result of swine flu, I would like to know if you could share with us the proportion of revenues coming from roaming and if possible also the margin on roaming minutes versus domestic and long distance?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the international roaming, because we have national roaming and international roaming, I think the international roaming it's not a big part of our revenues. I don't have exactly how much is it the share, but it's not big and I think this flu is going to hurt us more as I told you on the new subscribers, people is not going out to buy things, so those people it needs to be communicated. So I think this flu is going to hurt more on the new subscribers than on the consumption. And what's the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's regarding of margins on roaming minutes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey I don't have that; I don't remember exactly the margins...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roaming is all around the world, so I think we have different margins from U.S. and from Europe, and from Asia, so I don't have it at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I will follow-up with Daniela.  Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, the next question in queue that will come from the line of Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse and your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Daniel and Carlos.  My question is on the large increase in data revenues that you saw in the quarter and you mentioned the percentage growth. Perhaps you could also tell us how much now data represents of total service revenues and then I was also looking for just a little more color on where you are seeing the demand for 3G, if it's coming more from the data cards or is it smartphones or what's really driving that demand in data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we don't disclose the amount of data that we have on our service revenue, but what I can tell you is that we have a very good 3G network, with good coverage, it's very important to have coverage.</p>
          <p>And the two things that we're selling more, three things we're selling more is first, the PC cards, it's where you put the PC in your computer and you have broadband all around the country.  So that's the first thing.</p>
          <p>Second, we're selling lot more of the smartphones and these smartphones are coming with, let's say, unlimited data or with limited data, but we're having a new rent in those smartphones, so plus the rent of voice we're having the rent of data.  So, these are the main two things that we're selling.</p>
          <p>And the third one is in the prepaid. In the prepaid we're starting to give our prepaid subscribers data and it has been working a lot. It's not a rent, but they are using and they are consuming a lot of this type of value-added services.  So, I think we're happy, people is &#x2013; one of the things is people is very happy with our products.  So, I think these products can grow a lot and we're having a good amount of subscribers with data packages all around Latin America now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And within the total data revenues is the 3G contribution now meaningful as a percentage of total, or is it still essentially all SMS with a very small contribution from 3G?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all of the increment for the most part, Andrew, is coming from our 3G.</p>

          <p>Next question in queue that will come from the line of Chris King with Stifel Nicolaus and your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you.  Two quick questions for you, first with respect to usage trends in Mexico, a very strong minutes of use number during the first quarter. I was just wondering what you are forecasting for the rest of the year for general minutes of use trends, given the macroeconomic environment in Mexico? And then secondly just was wondering if you could provide us with the number of subscribers that you disconnected in the first quarter in Colombia, so we could get a cleaner kind of growth rate for your subscriber trends in that market?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the minutes of use on Mexico you could see that it's one of the biggest in Latin America and it's much higher than some of the countries or much of the &#x2013; a lot more countries than in Europe. If you compare Mexico than in Europe or the rest of Latin America we have &#x2013; having big, big minutes of use. And we have been growing for the last three years because the competition is tough in Mexico, and what we are giving is more minutes, more usage to all the people, more SMS, more minutes, more data and they are spending more or a little bit more than what they should spend without that. So we are doing that in an intelligent way, so people is having lot more of benefits or they are paying a little bit more on what they used to pay. So that's mainly &#x2013; it's incredible, the amount of minutes that we do in Mexico. It's around 180, I don't have the number exactly, but it's around 180 and I think it's a very good indicator that prices and competition is hard and tough here in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, the thing that I can tell you is that &#x2013; and I don't have the number, but the thing that I can tell you is that, the net disconnections were 440.  But the gross adds are under &#x2013; are in our budget.  The gross are less than &#x2013; a little bit less than last year, but they are still on what we think.  So, we're still seeing good sales in Colombia, but we decide to clean-up the base because we have been growing so fast the last year on December that maybe some of the people change, instead of giving the handset to his son or to his wife or to anybody, they decide to change and they don't use the handset anymore.</p>
          <p>So that's why we decide to cut it; that could be one thing.  The other thing would be that you know that we have big penetration in Colombia, 95%, and we have the best coverage and we are all around Colombia. Maybe some of the subscribers that are low-income subscribers, they are &#x2013; they decide to because of this slowdown they decide not to use any more the handset.  So, maybe it could be the first or the second thing or maybe both, but I'm happy because I'm &#x2013; we are still selling &#x2013; the gross additions in Colombia are still inside of our budget, and our forecast that we have.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.  Question on the 55.5% margin in Mexico, that's the highest margin you've reported there ever I believe.  Just wonder if there are any unusual drivers that might explain it and whether we should see that dip back down or is this really a truly a sustainable kind of level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  Well, you saw that margin because the first thing is we slowed down a little bit our subscribers, so that's why the &#x2013; this.  Second, we're being very careful on cutting all the costs and we have been very, very strong on the cost control.  And third it will help us a little bit, in some countries it doesn't help, but in Mexico, I think we have a little bit of benefit because we have some inventory of handsets and with the exchange rate, we move a little bit the prices and that give us a little bit more on profit instead of subsidy. Maybe if &#x2013; we have some profit when we sell some of our handsets.</p>
          <p>So we have special things, but I think we can have good &#x2013; still we can have good margins in Mexico.  I don't know if we can maintain this margin, but we can have good margins in the next months still in Mexico.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just a quick follow-up also in Mexico, I'm wondering if you might consider sort of selling netbook PCs with embedded Internet capability and subsidizing them and sort of competing with Telmex in that fashion or is it &#x2013; well if you'd just comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I didn't &#x2013; I don't understand the question, can you repeat it please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, low-cost netbook PCs, I think for instance AT&amp;T is selling them for $50 in the U.S. and subsidizing them if people sign on to a longer-term contract. I just wonder if you would consider that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's something very interesting, we're looking at that.  We are &#x2013; we are selling a lot the PC card, and the PC cards are what to &#x2013; what we are looking is to put 1,2 or 3 different netbooks in our customer care center, and start to sell this type of product.  So, I think it's &#x2013; you are right, in U.S. is very &#x2013; has been doing very good in the U.S.  And I think in all Latin America I &#x2013; we already start to do that in Brazil, very soon we're doing that, we already negotiate all these products for Mexico and we're going to move that to all the countries.  I think it's very important, we want them to have the SIM included in the PC and with a contract for 12 or 24 months.  I think we can make good prices for our customers in these netbooks.  $50 is really cheap, either they are subsidizing, but well I &#x2013; what I'm reading in AT&amp;T is that they are subsidizing also a lot the iPhone.  So, well maybe it's something similar than what they are doing on the iPhone.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all, great results.  My first question is on Brazil.  What's the issue there with ARPUs, why have we seen an accelerated decline versus the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the rest of the year?  Is there anything changed and is that the new level that we should expect through 2009?  And my second question is on CapEx, it looks like it's much higher, sort of looks like you spent nearly a quarter of your budget or your guidance in the first quarter.  Is this a new sort of Carlos Slim group wide policy of smoothing CapEx or do you think you actually need to take up your guidance?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And over to Carlos from the CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.  On the CapEx, I think there is really nothing &#x2013; nothing special.  I think it has to do with &#x2013; last year it was an unusually low level of CapEx because we hadn't taken delivery of some of the equipment that had been ordered.  It's not because we had somehow made any adjustments to the budget.  This year it happens that a lot of things were already in the pipeline and we have effectively taken delivery earlier than was the case in 2008.  But we are not yet making any &#x2013; I mean it's not like we made something specific to try to bring forward the investment.  I think we may come back to you with the &#x2013; with numbers on CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And another thing is that, I think it's a very good idea to try to do the CapEx, as we reduce our CapEx, you know the number is going to be around 3 billion more or less.  So what's happening, so we decide to put hands on and do the CapEx for the let's say first eight months.  So, if traffic is going okay, if usage is going okay and then maybe we need a little bit more of CapEx then we put it because traffic is growing and we need more capacity.  So that's why we are trying to put all our CapEx in the first, let's say, eight to nine months of this year.  So, if we need something else, we can put it.</p>
          <p>I think at this moment, we don't have anything saying that we're going to make more CapEx than what we need in any countries so the &#x2013; it's, everything is under our budget.  And it's mainly why you see a little bit more of CapEx this year against last year, but doesn't change anything, okay.  I think, we decide to do the CapEx on October instead of January and that moves a little bit faster the CapEx.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, what you could see in Brazil is, we are the biggest network in 2G and 3G, all of our subscribers are right now in 2G and 3G. So, we have been cutting all the TDMA subscribers, moving all these TDMA subscribers, and that's why we're having a little bit more of costs than &#x2013; and I think these costs &#x2013; we need to reduce those costs for the next months.</p>
          <p>And on ARPU, it's because we've had big growths last year, and then people need to start what always Carlos has been explaining to you, that when you have big amount of &#x2013; big amount of new subscribers, they start to use, and then you are going to see, in the future, more usage of all these subscribers. It's what we're seeing, and there is nothing else that I &#x2013; any other explanation that I can see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, just to follow-up on that, I mean, that the fact that in the first quarter, I think from my numbers, if I've got them correct, you only saw a 5% year-on-year growth in usage, and quite a big fall quarter-on-quarter in Brazil, I mean, is that purely the carnival effect or is, is maybe Brazil a slightly different market to what you are seeing everywhere else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Brazil has been really competitive, and we have also been reducing prices fast and that's another issue that maybe that's why ARPUs have been reduced a little bit, but I think, ARPUs are going to stabilize, I don't know if that's the level where they are going to stabilize, but I think ARPUs are going to stabilize, as they are stabilizing in all the other countries. No?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Daniel, my two questions just go back to the original question from Vera, about the net adds and ARPU. When you talk about the 19 million being 10 to 15% lower, are there specific markets that reflect that, or is it pretty much just a kind of blanket statement of all the markets? And then the second question on ARPU is, when you say that the economy looks like it's affecting our subs, but not our ARPU, does that &#x2013; are we did take to mean that for example in Mexico, our ARPU was 168 pesos in the first quarter, that it should stay, in your view in that range of &#x2013; in the high 160s, throughout the course of all of 2009, or just that, it will continue to decline, but just not at the type of rates that we saw in previous years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, well, the second quarter in Mexico, it's different than the first quarter in Mexico; second quarter in Mexico, we have Easter vacations, they are two weeks in April. So that does not show up a lot on the ARPU, but as I told you, if we feel &#x2013; and we see that the economy is going to maintain like this, then the usage, I think, is going to be around 160 is what you said the ARPU is now &#x2013; 100, low 160s, 160. But if the economy is going worse, then while we can see also a reduction on the usage of the people, it's really going to depend on the develop of the economy in Mexico and also in Latin America.</p>
          <p>I think it's very important.  But in the other hand, we have good things that are, all of that data revenues that are coming so, well, we need to play with these three things and that's mainly what we're going to see, it's very difficult for us to forecast that. But that &#x2013; those are the three big issues where we need to understand and to check very closely, it's going to be develop of the economy, the develop of the data of new subscribers, data ARPU, new subscribers, new usage, and the new subscribers that we are having.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you just, you had mentioned that previously you're thinking 19 million and now, excuse me, that would be, you might think that it might be 10 or 15% less. Are there specific markets that reflect that? Because the 19 obviously goes across all of your markets, or is it just kind of a blanket statement saying everything should be kind of 15% lower than may be what we are previously expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, all-over-all, it's going to be 10 to 15 in all the markets, maybe some markets are going to be higher, others lower, but I think it's &#x2013; yes it's around that. Latin America is behind this crisis. So, we need to understand specifically, as somebody said, Brazil economy is in better shape than in Mexico right now, but well, everything &#x2013; all Latin America is behind Mexico, and Mexico is behind U.S. So, let's see how these economies are going to behave in the future now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have two questions, the first relates to the trends of contract additions in Mexico, which I noticed that's improved a lot this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics of that market, is it the change of strategy of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, or is it softening of the competition in that sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are more &#x2013; I think, what is happening is we are more focusing in the &#x2013; in the postpaid market in Mexico, and it's helping us all the data, the revenues. We are having &#x2013; a lot of our subscribers are using more data, and I think it's very good news for us. All our &#x2013; all subscribers are using new value-added services, and we are getting new subscribers on postpaid. I think that's mainly it. We are focusing more on that, that's really what is happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a second question, can you talk a little bit about the core &#x2013;  the evolution of the core margins,  like say, I noted that's handsets sales, as a percentage of revenue, was down, which helps the overall margins, but could you talk a little bit about the evolution of the core margins in your services?</p>

          <p>Okay, the core margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the core margin is going up everywhere. In most places, basically the change in margins is being driven by, I mean the total EBITDA margins is being driven by subscriber acquisition. But as Daniel said, we may have some short-term extraordinary costs in some countries. They have to be probably be participating in of the 3G network, and probably will be taking out of the, all the TDMA clients in some operations. So, there is a little bit of phasing in of 3G and phasing out of TDMA. And that's sort of a temporary factor, but other than that, basically what you see most, most everywhere it's a tendency for margins, for core EBITDA margins, to rise, and so the evaluations in total margins to be driven for the most part by changes in subscriber acquisition costs.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have two questions please, the first one is regarding the new loan that you've been able to take out from the China Development Bank. Is that potentially indicative of you then now looking to source more of your network equipment out of China, and if so I was wondering if you could help us with thinking about how future CapEx might develop, does this mean you can source cheaper CapEx, going into 2010, 2011?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just regarding 3G and data take up, I was wondering if you could help us with some understanding of the take up of that in Mexico. I mean roughly what percentage of your 3G customers &#x2013; sort of your postpaid customers are now actually taking a 3G service and what percentage of your revenues in Mexico are actually now coming from data?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as regards to China, one possibility, it's, we had been setting up facilities <mark type="inaudible" /> credit agencies. Towards the end of last year we set a couple to <mark type="inaudible" /> of financing source from Sweden and from Finland.  And now it happens that we are getting something from the Chinese. As you know the network vendors that we are really relying on today are, the three big ones in the sectors which are Ericsson, Nokia and now Huawei which are making inroads, we started working with Huawei last year -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the one that we're buying from, 3G, those are the only three vendors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are basically the only three vendors that are supplying 3G to us, and Huawei for, has been doing another job last year, so we will carry that. But we need to get some funding, to basically help us. The 3G platform is &#x2013; we're not really disclosing at this stage, how many clients we have specifically on 3G. I don't even have the numbers here with me.  But, I think that basically we should be able to update the impact by looking at the growth of data revenues. As I was explaining earlier, substantially, all of the growth of data revenues is being driven by 3G.</p>
          <p>It is not being driven by SMS; SMS subscriber base has remained flat for some time. So basically the boost in data revenues is coming from 3G and that's really what is important.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From data &#x2013; no, no, I think that we had said last year that we were maybe as high as 15%. I think that's still the case, it is going up. But it's moving very fast up everywhere, no? So, we don't want to talk too much about, what is the share. But, again I think that you're having a good idea when we provide you the overall aggregate rate of growth of data in all the markets.</p>

          <p>A quick question on your CapEx guidance. You mentioned that the 3 billion, you were spending that in an accelerated fashion. Does that mean that the 3 billion is really a minimum guidance, and we should look at it as a range of 3 billion to something above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the 3 billion is what we think, and we're on forecast on that. The only thing is as we &#x2013; the usage and the capacity, this crisis is &#x2013; we're not going to know exactly what's happening with the usage on this crisis. So what we want is to have a small margin that, if we need to put a little bit more capacity, because in September things are better than what we expected, then we have a little bit of time to do that.  But that's the only thing that we are thinking. So, we want to have a little bit of margin if things are better than what we expected, so, and we need to put a little bit more.</p>
          <p>But you know that capacity is really cheap. What is a little bit more expensive is coverage and it's 3G coverage and that &#x2013; so, if we need &#x2013; what we are doing that is only, we need a little bit more of capacity then we have the time to put it.  We want to still have the best network in Latin America in terms of capacity, in terms of quality, in terms of data. So that's where we're investing in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. A question with regards to the longer-term effect of migration towards more postpaid customers, and what that affect would have on your equipment cost. Do we find most of these customers receiving smart phones, higher-end equipment that's going to actually cost more? Presumably their ARPU is higher. So how do we see the dynamic between pulling them in and profitability, including the hardware costs or whatever you would include for subsidized phones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you &#x2013; what we do and the way we saw the things is each segment of the market &#x2013; the prepaid has to have their own profitability, postpaid has their own profitability and smart phones in postpaid has their own profitability. So we have like a formula and in that formula is where we are selling and doing nowhere. As you are saying, exactly, we have more ARPU, then we can have a little bit more subsidy. In the other side we have a less ARPU, so we are reducing a lot of subsidies.</p>
          <p>But, in the other hand, one very good news is that smartphones are getting cheaper and cheaper.  And that's something that we like a lot because, then we can sell smartphones with data inside to a lot more people, okay?  So you could see smart phones in 100, sorry $200, something like that.  One year ago you saw smart phones in 350, something that's more or less average. So, I think smart phones are also going down, the prices of the handsets are going down and that will help us a lot to enter in new segments in this market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just the final there is &#x2013; your equipment cost rose 5.4% on these results. Is that a representative trend, or does that reflect the fact that you had big inventories, and you weren't really buying much despite movements in currency? So, what do we think about the change in equipment cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, one of our, we're &#x2013; one of the things that we are looking very closely is the subsidies on the handsets.  And we are trying to give less subsidies to all of our customers. So in that case, we &#x2013; the acquisition cost is &#x2013; if you could see the acquisition cost in all the countries, it's getting lower, it's getting better for us. And that's the trend that you are going to see all around Latin America. We are trying to, as we're reducing a lot of rate, then we need to reduce also some cost, some big cost on our companies are subsidies and we're being very careful on that.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And our next question in queue, that will come from the line of Richard Dineen with HSBC. And your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, yeah. I guess it's related to the last question and Colombia, the clean-up of the subscriber base. Firstly, maybe you could explain what you identify as the reason behind the low usage of customers in that market that saw you disconnect them. Is that just the result of late stage adoption of mobile from lower-income segments, or maybe, you know, were you too aggressive with promotions and you sucked in some kind of marginal users who weren't necessarily loyal to your network? And either way, does that change your thinking about the value of subscriber growth, or indeed your subscriber acquisition strategy in terms of subsidies or indeed other selling expenses?</p>
          <p>And maybe just as a quick follow-up, are there other markets where you think you may have to conduct similar subscriber base cleaning exercises, maybe &#x2013; I don't know, Brazil, where you saw very strong growth also last year?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Colombia, we're not changing any strategy. I think the strategy that we have been doing for the last two, four &#x2013; three, four, five years has been very successful for us. And we're not changing any, as you are saying, maybe some of the promotions, maybe low-income people or other things are making that we clean-up the base. But at the end of the day if you see that in a quarter where it doesn't make a lot of sense, but, if you saw that in two years or three years, then it make a lot of sense, this strategy that we are taking, and we're going to still maintain this strategy all around Latin America. I think, prepaid for us is very important, postpaid for us is very important and data it's becoming also very important.  So, we need to segment these three different products, and we want to focus in each one. Each one has their own profitability and each one has their own importance.  But I think it's still very important, the strategy that we are doing in Colombia.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, well, at this moment we are not seeing anything that tell us that we need to clean-up the base. And in the future if we have to clean it, well, we're going to clean it. But at this moment we don't have any indicator that make us think that we are going to clean the base there.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question is in queue, that will come from line of Will Milner with Arete Research and your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, just a couple of questions. I wonder if you can talk in a little bit more detail about any changes you've made to your commercial offers in Mexico, specifically designed to I guess cope with the downturn. I mean, I'm asking really because as I look at the trends in Mexico, it certainly doesn't look like they're particularly affected by the macroeconomic slowdown, which suggests it maybe further down the line. So if you could talk about any specific changes there, that will be useful. And secondly, just a sort of housekeeping &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I don't get the question. Can you explain it a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you talked about the macroeconomic impact in Mexico. But, as I look at the trends, there hasn't been much of a negative effect so far, which suggests you're either coping with it very well or it's further down the line. And I just wanted to understand what specific changes you've made to any of your commercial offers to cope, I guess, with lower disposable income or any economic changes that we might be seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that what Daniel has pointed out early in the call is, one thing that has been helping us in Mexico and other places is a) that we have data and b) that we are becoming much more competitive in the post-tech market. So we are talking a different subscriber base. And all of those things have helped us mitigate the effects of the downturn. Now, the downturn is very much for real, but we have essentially been managed, manage that &#x2013; being able to manage that by selling something that we didn't have before, which is data and by tapping a wealthier segment of subscribers. That has helped us.</p>
          <p>But I think, you know, the end &#x2013; we don't really know how prolonged the downturn will be. And I think that to the extent that this is prolonged, we will increasingly feel the effects of the downturn in overall spending. If, for whatever reason, we see a recovery relatively soon, then we may very well indicated that we do not see any increased spending down the road. But if the economies do not recover then, and as  you will feel increasing the effect of having, spending that, probably that will happen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I have one quick follow-up, just as a sort of a housekeeping exercise? In which of the markets you're operating in are you are expecting regulatory changes this year to impact revenue and profit trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regulators, you never know, so &#x2013; I don't, I don't, I think we are going to see a lot of changes in the regulations in all the countries in during the next year or two years. But I don't see any big changes at this moment that will hurt us in big revenues or in profitability. So there is new things that are coming, but they are not coming in the short-term, and there's not something that I could see that it will have a big impact in our companies in the future.  But regulators always change and different things are coming, of course, in all the countries.</p>

          <p>I think, we're doing much better in Central America. We're putting the house in order. I think we do big investment, then we consolidate a lot of companies there. So I think we're in much better shape, and you are going to see improvements in revenue and in EBITDA in the next quarters. I think, I'm &#x2013; I think the company is, right now, it's in much better shape than last year. We do a big effort, we're making huge work on these companies and you are going to see good improvements there.</p>
