          <p>Hello, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's conference is being recorded. If there are any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Mr. Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dorian . Good morning, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners conference call to discuss earnings for third quarter. Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's, General Partner will lead the call, followed by Randy Fowler, the company's Executive Vice President and CFO. Also included on the call today from Enterprise is Dan Duncan, our Chairman and Founder, as well as other members of our senior management team. After Randy Fowler's discussion we will have a short discussion of Duncan Energy Partners' results led by Hank Bachman, the CEO and President of Duncan Energy Partners, General Partner. Afterward, we will open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management. Although management believes that the expectations reflect and in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid, operating, and financial results supported by our NGL and Pipelines &amp; Services segment, which posted a 77% increase in gross operating margin this quarter over the third quarter of last year. And our natural gas Pipeline &amp; Services segment, which had a 17% increase in gross operating margins this year versus the third quarter of last year. We transported 8.8 trillion BTUs per day of natural gas and for the fourth consecutive quarter, 2 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids, as our pipelines continue to benefit from strong demand and access to some of the most prolific supply regions in the country.</p>
          <p>While it's difficult to follow a record period like last quarter, natural gas transportation volumes this quarter were 3% higher than the previous quarter and our NGL, crude oil and petrochemical transportation volumes were only 5% lower than the last quarter despite the effects of two major hurricanes on our Gulf Coast operations. Excluding the effects of the hurricanes, gross operating margin -- net income and earnings per unit for the third quarter of this year would each have been new records for Enterprise. Our diversified business mix and broad geographical footprint has served us well as we continue to benefit from our energy value change strategy.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow increased 42% to $316 million this quarter from $223 million in the third quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow this quarter was reduced by approximately $64 million from hurricane effects and our reimbursement to EPCO for sustaining CapEx in prior periods. Our strong cash flow enabled us to increase the quarterly cash distribution to our partners 6.6% over the third quarter of last year and provided 1.2 times coverage of the distribution.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow would have provided 1.5 times coverage of the distribution on a normalized basis, excluding the $64 million of non-recurring charges. Year-to-date distributable cash flow would have provided 1.65 times coverage on a normalized basis. As a result we have retained $261 million of cash in the first nine months of this year, strengthening our liquidity and providing cash to fund growth projects, to reduce debt or to satisfy working capital needs while limiting our need to issue equity.</p>
          <p>We've also raised $51.5 million so far this year through our distribution reinvestment plan and we expect to raise an additional 67 to $68 million next month, including the $50 million of distribution Dan Duncan expects to reinvest though the plan. Our retained distributable cash flow together with our distribution reinvestment plan, will have provided about $380 million of equity capital with respect to the first nine months of this year.</p>
          <p>Our practice of balancing distribution growth with retaining distributable cash flow has provided us additional financial flexibility, which has been particularly beneficial in light of the current state of the capital markets. We have three large capital projects that are expected to be completed over the next few months. Meeker II, which is an expansion of our Meeker cryogenic processing facility and the central treating facility for Exxon near our Meeker complex, are both located in the prolific Piceance Basin in Colorado and should be completed this quarter.</p>
          <p>The third project is the Sherman natural gas pipeline extension in the Barnett Shale that will connect with our Texas intrastate gas pipeline system and provide shippers valuable access to eastern markets via interconnects with interstate pipelines. The Sherman extension is expected to be completed in January ahead of the completion Boardwalk's connecting Gulf Crossing Pipeline. Although, we have been flowing some gas on the Sherman extension since August.</p>
          <p>Given recent market events we expect next years growth capital expenditure program will be lower than our recent run rate of 1.5 to $2 billion per year. We are evaluating all of our potential capital projects in light of today's capital markets, and we are focusing on those investment opportunities that will give us the best returns. We currently have approximately seven to $800 million committed to our 2009 capital program. Part of this reduction includes a passed under pipeline project. While we believe this is an attractive project and certainly a very valuable natural gas export solution out of the Rockies, we have several other projects under consideration that we believe will generate higher risk adjusted returns.</p>
          <p>If the capital markets become more attractive we have other investment opportunities. But we expect to maintain financial discipline and not get ahead of our abilities to prudently fund our growth while maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. We continue to mitigate potential increased cost for our new projects. For example, we've locked in a significant portion of the steel cost and pump and turbine components of the Texas Offshore Port and pipeline system that we recently announced together with TEPPCO and Oiltanking. And we have certain escalators in those contracts that provide additional protection.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to discuss a few business highlights from the quarter. Gross operating margin from our NGL Pipelines &amp; Services business increased 77% over the third quarter of last year. The primary driver of this improvement was our gas processing business, which recorded gross operating margin this quarter of $238 million, a 145% increase over the same quarter of last year. A 70% increase in equity NGL production and increased marketing volumes were the major reasons for the improved performance.</p>
          <p>The increase in equity NGL production was primarily attributable to the Meeker and Pioneer processing plants, which were not yet in commercial operation in the third quarter of 2007, and they are currently extracting a combined average of 63,000 barrels per day. The design capacity of the Meeker facility is currently at 35,000 barrels per day will double to 70,000 barrels per day upon the completion of Meeker II this quarter.</p>
          <p>We've taken steps to preserve these attractive processing margins by hedging approximately 85% of the NGLs we expect to extract from our Rocky Mountain plants during the remainder of the year. And about 58% of the expected 2009 NGL production from these plants. NGL demand for petrochemical production was very strong in July and August with ethylene crackers operating at 92 and 89% of nameplate capacity.</p>
          <p>As you would expect, September was significantly lower due to facilities along the Gulf Coast having downtime as a result of two hurricanes. According to the Hudson Report, US ethylene crackers operated at 47% of nameplate capacity last month; the lowest operating rate in history or at least since 1988. The US ethylene industry suffered a large loss of production last month following the double hits of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and that was larger than the loss of production in 2005 following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p>
          <p>36 units experienced unplanned downtime in September. All but three of those are now -- all but three of those were due to hurricanes, and of those 36, 34 have now returned to service.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and storage business increased to $75 million in the third quarter of 2008 from 71 million in the third quarter of 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $6 million improvement in gross operating margins in the Mid-America and Seminole Pipelines due to 138,000 barrel per day increase in NGL volumes and higher tariffs that went into effect July 1st of this year. Volumes associated with our NGL pipelines and storage business totaled 1.8 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2008 compared with 1.6 million barrels per day for the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported a 17% increase in gross operating margin to $88 million for the third quarter of this year, compared with $75 million for the same quarter of last year. Most of our natural gas pipelines reported improved results this quarter. Gross operating margin for the San Juan system increased $17 million this quarter, primarily due to higher transportation fees, indexed natural gas prices, as well as from NGL and condensate sales. And the Texas Intrastate System was up $3 million due to increased volumes. Total onshore natural gas transportation volumes increased 15% for a record 7.6 trillion BTUs per day for the third quarter of 2008. Natural gas storage reported an increase of $3 million in gross operating margins, primarily from new capacity and pipeline fees at our Petal storage facility in Mississippi.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the off shore Pipelines &amp; Services segment was $17 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with $47 million in the third quarter of last year. Included in gross operating margin this quarter are $35 million of expenses for storm related damages, $3 million of expenses to complete repairs to the flex joint flange on the Independence Trail pipeline and $16 million for lost business associated with the hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Independence contributed net $41 million to gross operating margin this quarter and that consists of $28 million for the hub platform and $13 million on the pipeline. The platform and the pipeline were down for eight days for repairs, to the flex joint flange in July and another 12 day in August and September for hurricanes. After Hurricane Ike, Independence was up within a matter of days flowing 900 million cubic feet a day of natural gas.</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical Services segments, reported operating margin of $37 million in the third quarter 2008, compared with $51 million in the same quarter of last year. The primary reasons for the decrease in gross operating margins were $10 million of lost business due to the hurricanes and 26% decrease in detained summarization volume and octane enhancement facility downtime due to hurricane Ike and repairs that were completed in September.</p>
          <p>This facility has now returned to normal operations. As for the hurricanes in summary we have incurred approximately $4 million in actual repair cost and have accrued an additional $42 million for property damage or repair expenses that we will have in the future. In addition we estimate our gross operating margin was lower by $43 million for lost business bringing the total negative impact to $89 million for the quarter. We estimate the impact of lost business related to Hurricane Ike will be &#x2013; a decrease of about 25 to $35 million in gross operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the extraordinary efforts of our employees in responding to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. They worked tirelessly around the clock to return our assets operations, so we could provide critical logistical services to our oil and gas producer and refining and petrochemical customers. I believe they are the best in the business, and I'm proud to be a part of their team.</p>
          <p>In closing I'd like to say again that we are very pleased with our performance this quarter despite the impact of the hurricanes, we were able to generate solid gross operating margin of our NGL and natural gas businesses, raise the quarterly cash distribution by 6% year-over-year, and retain distributable cash flow to provide us with additional flexibility.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that our strong fundamentals distinguish us, particularly in this market environment. The quality of our assets, our large diversified footprint, our portfolio of organic growth opportunities, our management's focus on creating value for our investors, our lower cost of capital, our investment grade credit ratings and strong balance sheet, together with our consistent increases in quarterly cash distributions to our investors are important factors to consider.</p>
          <p>We will continue to manage our business for the long-term view and we believe our investors will be rewarded for our consistent performance, solid results, and financial discipline.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call over to Randy Fowler for review of our financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to start the review with the income statement below the gross operating margin line. For depreciation and amortization expense in operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2008 increased to a $138 million from $134 million for the third quarter 2007. Primarily due to increase property, plant and equipment from the additions of the Meeker processing plants, Koch's fractionator, the expansion of the Mid America pipeline, the Pioneer natural gas processings plant and the propylene fractionator that we put into service in the third quarter of last year at Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense increased $22 million this quarter from 19 million in the third quarter on a year-to-date basis. G&amp;A expense this year is about flat with G&amp;A last year at about $66 million. As far as interest expense is concerned we've reported $103 million of interest expense for the third quarter 2008, compared to 85 million for the third quarter last year. Average debt outstanding was $8.1 million this quarter compared to $6.5 billion for the third quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>Interest expense for the current quarter also included a charge of $3 million to write-off the fair market value of an interest rate swap that we had with Lehman that actually extended out to 2014, so again some of this was mostly the future value of that swap.</p>
          <p>Capitalized interest decreased $1 million quarter-to-quarter as a result of the decrease in the amount of construction work in progress. As far as provisions for income taxes, it was $7 million for the third quarter 2008 versus 2 million for the third quarter 2007. This increase was primarily due to higher accruals for the Texas margin tax.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditures, we invested $464 million in growth capital projects, including 61 million in sustaining capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2008, the majority of the growth capital spent this quarter was attributable to the Sherman Extension pipeline, the Meeker II cryogenic plant, the Mont Belvieu well utilization program and then smaller amounts for the Pioneer plant in the Exxon central treating facility in the Piceance Basin as well the Shinti oil pipeline. For nine months of 2008 we've invested approximately 1.4 billion in growth capital expenditure and about $129 million in maintenance capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>At September 30 2008, we had $8.5 billion of debt outstanding, this includes 100% of our 1.25 billion of hybrid securities and 212 million of debt down at Duncan Energy Partners. EPD had liquidity of approximately $700 million at September 30 2008. September generally represents a peak in working capital usage for us with our inventories of NGLs and natural gas at their highest associated with our forward sales program. Today liquidity has improved to approximately $800 million.</p>
          <p>Our floating interest rate exposure was approximately 22% at the end of the quarter and the average life of our debt was approximately 16 years with a average cost of debt of about 5.8%. A key credit metric for Enterprise of our consolidated leverage ratio of debt to the last 12 months of EBITDA and in consolidated, that means that also includes the debt obligations of the DEP.</p>
          <p>We do exclude 50% of the hybrid debt principles, which is so, if you would, the minimum amount of equity credit that the rating agencies give that security.</p>
          <p>After making those adjustments at September 30, our debt balance was $7.8 billion and when if we come in and look at EBITDA for the last 12 months after adjusting -- deducting equity earnings and adding back the actual cash distributions that we received from unconsolidated affiliates, that number was approximately $1.9 billion. This resulted in debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months at September 30 of about 4.1 times. If you exclude the $89 million of a hurricane effects debt EBITDA would have been 3.9 times. We have improved this ratio from 4.3 times at the end of 2007, and from 4.5 times at its peak at September 30 last year as construction projects have been completed, and any operations started generating cash flow.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Hank to discuss Duncan Energy Partners.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Randy. Duncan Energy reported solid results this quarter. Despite the impact on our businesses from hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Net income was $3.8 million or $0.18 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008, compared to $4.5 million or $0.22 per common unit for the third quarter of last year. Third quarter results were negatively impacted by an estimated $1.8 million or $0.09 per common units of property damage repair costs, lost business from downtime of some of our assets related to the hurricanes. We generated distributable cash flow of $7.6 million in the third quarter of this year, which provides 0.9 times coverage of the third quarter distributions we pay to our limited partners in November.</p>
          <p>We believe that lost business due to hurricanes reduced distributable cash flow for the quarter by an estimated $1.2 million. Even after taking to account the effect of the hurricanes, Duncan Energy's year-to-date distributable cash flow provides 1.1 times coverage of the distributions declared by the partnerships for the first three quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>On October 15, 2008 the board of directors of Duncan Energy's General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.42 per common unit. A 2.4% increase from the quarterly distribution rate for common unit paid in respect of the third quarter of last year. Not withstanding the effects of the hurricanes, Duncan Energy's businesses were able to generate increased revenues in gross operating margin this quarter compared to the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased 46% to $321.4 million from $220.6 million for the third quarter of last year. Gross operating margin for the quarter increased to $20.9 million from $19.1 million for the third quarter 2007. Our NGL and petrochemicals storage business reported increased gross operating margins this quarter versus the third quarter of last year, primarily due to measurement gains reported this quarter compared to a measurement loss recorded in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>After adjusting for measurement gains and losses neither of which are received by or charged to Duncan Energy, gross operating margin was down slightly this quarter compared to the third quarter of  last year. Increased storage revenues from excess throughput storage fees and volumes were offset by higher operating expenses, which included $600,000 for property damage repair costs resulting from Hurricane Ike. Gross operating margin this year was also impacted by an estimated $900,000 of lost business due to lower volumes as a result of Hurricane Ike. The onshore natural gas pipeline business reported a 37% increase in gross operating margin this quarter up $4.5 million from $3.3 million reported in third quarter of last year. This increase was due primarily to improved natural gas sales margins on the Acadian Gas Pipeline system.</p>
          <p>Natural gas volumes, which include both sales and transportation volumes, decreased to 693 billion British thermal units, or BTUs per day, this quarter from 761 billion BTUs per day in the third quarter 2007. Operating expenses in Acadian also included approximately $300,000 for repair expenses due to damages incurred for both Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.</p>
          <p>In summary, the total impact on gross operating margin this quarter for damages and lost business due to hurricanes was an estimated $2.7 million. When calculating the effect on Duncan Energy's net income, you would multiply these by Duncan Energy's equity interest of 66% or $1.8 million. Sustaining capital expenditures were $3.3 million this quarter and $9.1 million year-to-date. This compares to $4.4 million and $10.6 million of maintenance capital expenditures spent through the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 &#x2013; seven (sic) [September 7, 2008], excuse me.</p>
          <p>Interest expense decreased $2.9 million for the third quarter of this year, compared to $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2007 due to lower average interest rates associated with the Duncan Energy revolving credit facility. We have total liquidity of approximately a $100 million at the end of the September, which includes availability under the partnerships credit facility and unrestricted cash.</p>
          <p>We remain confident in the partnership's ability to consistently deliver strong results and distributable cash flow. And we expect these businesses to continue to perform well for the remainder of this year and for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Now we are ready for the questions Randy.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hank. One more item that we would like to discuss, before we open the call up for questions has to do with rumors that have been circulating concerning margin loans of Dan Duncan and his non-public affiliates, secured by common units of Enterprise products and/or TEPPCO. While we normally do not respond to rumors, we think that in view of the current uncertainties in the equity markets and the reported forced sales by executives of other companies, we need to set the record straight.</p>
          <p>While, Mr. Duncan and some of his non-public affiliates do have margin loans secured by an immaterial portion of his and his affiliates' common unit holdings in Enterprise and TEPPCO. Such loans are on economically favorable terms, are well over collateralized and there is no risk of any forced sale of any Enterprise or TEPPCO common units.</p>
          <p>Additionally Mr. Duncan and his affiliates have sufficient liquidity from their own resources to pay all of such margin loans in full.</p>
          <p>Now we are ready to take questions Dorian from our listeners.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of questions. First, what is the basis for your lost business estimates and should we have a pretty high degree of confidence in their precision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark. What we've did is have our guys take a look at the contracts we have in place and the items that were lost -- its pretty simple math. But we are not looking at that as business that we, speculative that we might have had. It was pretty common stuff</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then second, in terms of the growth capital going forward, you mentioned in the release about taking a more disciplined approach or a disciplined approach and looking out I think in the past you had mentioned 1.5 to 2 billion and seven to 800 million in 2009. I was just curious if there is any other projects that similar to Pathfinder that may have been announced that maybe you've decided not to go forward with or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Mark, we don't have anything that we've announced that we've decided not to go forward with. Pathfinder was one that certainly we were working on. We had not completed negotiations, and I think with respect to our prudence in developing our capital programs over the years, we've always tried to stay within the bounds of the capital markets in our own financial resources. What we've got right now is about 700 to seven, $750 million of capital projects that we've committed to for 2009. We can slow down some of those if we need to, but frankly we've got the resources to handle that with no problems. If the capital markets come back in 2009, which we fully expect they will, in fact we're already seeing signs of that. We frankly have several billion dollars worth of projects in the wings that we could select from. So we have the ability to ramp up our capital spending, but again we want to do it within the bounds of our financial means.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And is it primarily, I mean are you looking say that differential between the 1.5 to 2 billion and the seven to 800 million. Are some segments of your business more likely to have projects deferred than others, or are you looking at it just pretty much on a project to project basis?</p>

          <p>Let me answer that and then I'll turn it over to Jim Teague, our Chief Commercial Officer. I think what we're looking at in this kind of market Mark, is that there may be some opportunities that we haven't seen in a number of years. Certainly we're kind of active in looking at opportunities across each of our business segments, but unlike last couple of years there may be opportunities in 2009, 2010. Actually due to acquisitions at more reasonable prices there may be less competition for some of the projects that we have considered, so I think it's really across the board. We have a pretty open mind, but again across all of our business segments and Jim I don't know if you have anything else you want to add.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No other than as we look at things the way we measure them and what we're interested in, is it has to have two things. It has to be a good return, we're seeing that become, in this environment we feel like we are better positioned to realize that than others. Secondly, it has to be strategic in other words it has to fit what we already have, that's where we see we get upside beyond the return of the project itself. We've got a large inventory of projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I want to leave questions for others. So just lastly, if you could provide just your outlook for -- at the NGL market and NGL prices, say over the next 18 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I am not sure what next week is going to hold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, what we're seeing is as a result of the hurricane, when you have, and Mike mentioned in his comments, the number of petrochemical plants, that went down. So we have a short-term issue in that production continued to flow while demand went off, consequently inventory is built and prices reflect that build in inventory. As that -- and we're in fact seeing that the impact of that, because we are seeing some plants, not ours, but we're seeing some plants for example in ethane rejection. Where we are, where we're advantaged is if you look at our Rockies position, we continue to be in full extraction, get the benefits throughout our value chain, because we've got a very strong basis advantage up there in the Rockies that we benefit from.</p>
          <p>If you look at our situation in Louisiana, we have margin bands and RPs and our percent of proceeds, so that we're not hurt like a pure keyhole contract provider would be. And if you look in South Texas by and large those are percent of proceeds and fee based contracts that we have as are the ones we have at Jocko and San Juan.  So yes we're seeing over in the short term, we're seeing reduced prices. We're seeing people, others suffer from reduced margins. We're not seeing any of our plants cut back, primarily because we feel like we're advantaged either, basis or the way we structured the contracts.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are seeing through this last year and we expect that it will continue and there will be months where maybe ethane isn't preferred but by and large we see ethane as much a preferred feedstock in petrochemicals. We've seen traditional heavy crackers move to the -- move so that they have the ability to consume  more ethane. And if you look at that map we've have shown many times in many conferences our connectivity to petrochemicals can't be duplicated. So consequently we're the guys that are there making the deliveries and to those traditional heavy crackers making those deliveries at some pretty attractive fees. So in the short run, the hurricane had an effect on demand inventories built. In the longer term, we're still pretty excited about our position as it relates to prices, margins and petrochemicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mark, if you remember we do have about 85% of our NGL production hedged through the end of this year, about 58% through next year. So, that ought to helps us through the shakeout as the remaining effects of the hurricanes kind of work their way through the system.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Mike my first question is on the retained cash flow, just building off the nine months to date. If we take that, and we build in what we expect excess cash flow to be the fourth quarter, we get a number where you could be ending the year with about 350 million of excess cash flow. Obviously it will be higher than that, if you look at the total equity capital retained and include the dividend reinvestment but, with that as a backdrop how do you look at balancing the excess cash that you use for repaying debt versus CapEx funding on a go forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where we are right now is that we think, consistent increase in our distribution is important but we don't want to be heroes about it. But we are not intending to distribute all of our cash flow. To the extent that we can keep a reasonable distribution increase going -- 5.5, 6.5% that's a pretty good track record. And then being able to use that cash and not having to rely on the capital markets, that's very important to us. We've been talking about this for several years, maybe more than several and have actually been criticized in prior years because we haven't distributed more of our cash flow out.</p>
          <p>I think people are starting to realize now the reasons that we're trying to preserve some of our capital. Frankly, this gives us the ability to rather than distribute all of our cash out retain some of it, reinvest in these higher return projects and this kind of environment the projects that we're seeing today are going to yield higher returns then they would have a year ago, simply because of the capital markets. A lot of people can't invest because they don't have the capacity to invest. So we think this positions us pretty uniquely and will give us a tremendous opportunity. And remember, as we invest these retained cash flows in new projects that generates additional cash flows for future distribution increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Now, if I'm doing my math right, and bake in the midpoint of let's just say that guided range of 6% I look at the excess retained cash, I look at how much financial flexibility you have on the debt side. Am I thinking about it correctly that you guys don't need to access the capital markets through the duration of 2009 to fund your growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that from the equity side given what we've committed to that that's correct. We do have a debt maturity coming up in the fourth quarter of next year. So I wouldn't say that we wouldn't have to go to back to the debt capital markets, but in essence, I think you're right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my second question kind of building off that financial flexibility theme. When you look at the challenges out there in the marketplace that a lot of others face in order to fund their capital programs. How do you look at the inorganic growth opportunity either from a consolidation standpoint or possibly a joint venture potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from a joint venture potential, if other parties are having difficulties funding their growth they may have difficulties funding a joint venture. Typically our strategy has been to team up with parties that bring something to the table other than just cash. So if there is somebody that has a business incentive for us to join up with them, certainly something we've considered and we have kind of build the business on joint ventures over the years. Or for rollups for a consolidation. MLPs have always been very difficult, although you are actually starting to see valuations separate now and we've been waiting on that. A bit frustrated that we've tended to trade the MLP universe as a pack rather than looking at individual MLPs and being valued on our merits.</p>
          <p>That may lead to an opportunity for consolidation at some point. But remember as Jim said, when we are looking at a transaction whether it's an acquisition, whether its an organic project, it has to be something that's provide benefit to our value chain that's, that actually does something other than make us bigger. So I wouldn't hold your breath too long, waiting for an acquisition, but I do think there's some exciting opportunities that will unveil in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I appreciate it. Then just one final question, when you look at your backlog and you look at prioritizing your backlog and the composition of that seven to $800 million in committed projects. Can you give us a sense of the targeted rate of return from a cash on cash perspective? And how that targeted rate of return has evolved over the past 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, Mark. Darren, I mean, I would tell you that for us to do a project, we're going to have to have a return that reflects the risk in today's markets. And if anything what we're saying even on our existing assets is that fees are going to go up because there just isn't as much competition. Money is not as easy to come by as it was. We need to get compensated for our investments. So I think that one of our projects is our Texas Offshore Port System that we're working on, and that won't go into service until 2011. But I think that some of the competition that we may have been expecting will not there as a result of today's capital markets and resulting those fees will go up and the returns will be higher.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick ones. Most of my questions were answered. Can you just review for us given the big pull back in commodity prices, you talked about the NGL market a bit, but just maybe review the different gives and takes as it relates to the impact of lower natural gas prices on the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well remember, Michael, we've got -- what we refer to as this natural hedge in the past and what we really look at are the fees that we get from some of our gathering pipelines that are indexed to natural gas prices. So those tend to offset the cost of gas that we use for our fuel and shrink at the various plants that we have, so we're relatively insensitive on that basis to natural gas prices. The natural gas prices related to our NGLs, our equity NGL volumes are pretty much hedged. So not that much of an impact on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing or expecting to see any reductions in volumes come through your gathering systems and plants given &#x2013; we've heard a lot of announcements from producers about curtailing production and cutting back on rigs et cetera?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a &#x2013; where our assets are located, we're in traditional basins that have been not subject to a whole lot of drilling expansion other than the Barnett and our Sherman extension is fully contracted for on a demand basis only, so whether the gas shows up or doesn't show we are fee based driven up there. So we're not really subject to the slowdown. Although, we would like to see it participating and grow, we are comfortable with our position.</p>

And some of those costs include IT, the building and things of that sort. What has happened was EPCO was funding that and not passing those costs down to the various partnerships, so we threw that out in the third quarter. So you shouldn't see that continuing.</p>

          <p>Yes, Sharon. The short answer is no. We formed DEP with the long-term view to facilitate among other things the growth of Enterprise, but we also think it's a good investment vehicle in and of itself.

          <p>Good morning guys. Just out of curiosity one other thing have you seen any reduction in the cost of organic growth in terms of labor as we see people kind of backing away from some of their growth projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we've seen a lot in the way labor yet, I think we have some expectations as time goes on we will see some reductions on the labor costs. It's kind of too soon to tell here, it's only been few weeks since we've seen this impact. We have -- I think seen some of the commodities markets softening a little bit, particularly on the steel side, I think couple of issues there, one just the outlook for the future and due to the strength of the dollar we have seen steel cost staring the trend downward and we expect that I think to continue here for the next few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with regards to possibility of making some acquisitions, where do you guys see the multiples running at this point. I mean, has it come down 2x versus EBITDA or what is that change been in your alls opinion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all we're not actively looking at any acquisitions but if we where yeah, the multiples would be down pretty significantly from market multiples maybe not down quite as much from our expectations. We do think that companies are going to get more rational in valuing acquisitions. Certainly the proliferation of MLPs that had easy access to capital in the past are not going to be as big of players. But frankly in today's markets rather than looking at the 10,12 even 14 times multiple of EBITDA, in today's capital markets right now you might be looking at five times. When the markets come back to a more reasonable where you actually have access to the capital markets you may see something return to more of an eight times multiple.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last and that is we've had the past five years I guess two really major hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region where you guys are -- is this affecting the outlook for insurance costs following this one as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We do expect that the insurance costs will be affected. And we got Greg Watkins here, our VP of corporate risk to talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's a little early to tell following the impact of Gustav and Ike, but we do expect to see some increase in both the cost and the deductibles associated with the insurers. A lot will depend on how the reinsurance market sees this as the last quarter comes through and a lot of the reinsurance renewals were done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my first question is just to tie up some lose ends without piggy backing on other people's questions, regarding liquidity I really like Dan, what you've done as far dropping a big number into the DRIP program and everything. Curiosity, when I added the -- say $800 million of CapEx next year with what's left this year, cash-on-hand, some excess cash and everything. I kind of was getting the feeling that you might be close to &#x2013; if debt and equity markets don't come back next year and nobody knows what will happen. You might be fully tapped out.</p>
          <p>So I guess A) how concerned are you that at this time next year if the debt and equity markets don't come back you might not have the ability to expand going forward for the foreseeable future if you look at the magic eight ball. And then personal question almost to Dan is with the DRIP program, do you intend to lead those units within the DRIP program going into 2009, so that would if you get the $50 million pickup this quarter, we can take advantage of additional $200 million cash flow we'll see in Enterprise to next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Let me take a first to add to some of this. First of all, from our liquidity standpoint we've got at the end of the quarter $700 million or more of liquidity. As Randy mentioned in his remarks, September 30 is a high point in terms of inventory. We've got core sales that start rolling off working capital that starts unwinding, so we get cash back from that. But in your scenario where the capital markets debt and equity don't come back in 2009, the easy answer is we're going to be living within our means and we may not be investing a whole lot more in 2010 but I think that's a fairly Draconian outlook. We don't expect tin fact we are already seeing the debt markets come back. And we expect that they will come back more wholesomely in the first quarter of next year. And that the equity markets once things stabilize somewhat investor confidence is restored that you'll start to see equity investors come back in and when they do if you look at an MLP units that's yielding depending on the MLP anywhere from 7.5 to 9, 10% and the growth prospects that are there and the tax yield. That's a pretty attractive investments alternative.</p>
          <p>So we think that there's going to be a market for us. But the easy answer is we're not going go to out and spend a lot of money, unless we are confident that we have the funding sources for that. Now with respect to Dan's investment in the DRIP in November, that's largely because he sees it as such a value, our units have been beaten up so much that it's a great investment opportunity, and as you know Dan puts his money where his mouth is. He is not committing to doing anything in the future. That frankly is something that Enterprise isn't counting on for our funding requirements, we don't need it. If Dan decides, it makes senses for him in future quarters he will do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if that's the case in other words I guess the DRIP program doesn't work where you put shares in there and you leave them there and they come and do it. You do it quarter-by-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, yeah, our investors can make elections. They can do it recurring. They can do it quarter-by-quarter, whichever way they want to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. I guess.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Further to you give a little bit more color, the EPCO family economy has in excess of $400 million a year of cash flow coming in and that grows every year by all the dividends as they have been increasing on all of the companies. So basically, I mean under today's conditions, we could put forward $500 million a year back into the company or any of the companies that we would desire. If we look that as the best place, to not only to help those companies out but also as the best place for returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Make sense to me. I know we've had some discussions on this call regarding the NGL production and everything and the price volatility and hopefully that does turn out to be a short-term, but with a slowing and with a slowed economy going out forward, and a lot of the natural gas liquids going to the petrochemical industries that which are very economically sensitive. What type of impact do you see possibility on operations in volumes and everything. If we do go into a either short but deep recession or a prolonged recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim. We've run our some outlooks some sensitivities in terms of petrochemical operating rates down around 80%, which is something in the neighborhood that we saw back in 2003. And the difference this time compared to what we were faced within 2003, if you remember natural gas in 2003 we're selling on a basically BTU equivalency to crude oil consequently the NGLs were less preferred. And what we see today is even at an 80% operating rate much more preference for light feedstocks. Given that, we think &#x2013; we think that from gas processing on the low end you're going to see a demand at that run rate of about 700,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>We think there will be ethane rejection from those folks who do not have the value chain that we have. I'll refer back to the answer I gave earlier. We think we are very well positioned to continue to extract ethane at all of our plants and we're uniquely advantaged in our ability to deliver those light end feedstocks to every petrochemical company in the US, with the exception of one via pipe. So we are positioned on both ends. Secondly to the extent that some of our competitors are in ethane rejection, and some already are, we are -- this system is quite dynamic. It invariability opens up opportunities after margins that would otherwise not be available to us because the pipes would be fulled with the ethane. An example. Right now we've got NGLs in Conway selling at anywhere from $0.10 to $0.20 below Mont Belvieu, you can trust me we're fully &#x2013; we're very active in capturing that orb and frankly, would love to have a little additional pipeline space to fill it up with $.20 barrels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dan, let me add a little bit of color to Jim's deal. If you go back to the 2003 timeframe, when we was operating at 80% of the capacity, then I am going to break down capacity a little bit different way now. What we call heavy crackers that use heavy feedstock and what we call light end crackers, which uses light end feedstock. At that time when we was operating at 80% capacity in the 2003, four timeframe, the heavy crackers then because of the prices of crude oil and the prices of natural gas, the heavy cracker was running at a 105 to 110% capacity and you can do that probably for a 1 to 2 years. The light end crackers at that time was running 65 to 70% of capacity.</p>
          <p>So the capacity deal doesn't necessarily work across the board all the weight in the true equity of. If you look at 2007 and 2008 where we go into now and definitely 2009, we have the same capacity where 40% of your ethylene manufacturers probably is running on the heavies and 50 to 60% on the light end. Under today's deal, and Jim mentioned this, the preferred feedstock today is light end. So we can have the light end all their crackers, they can be operated in a 100 to 110% for the next couple 15 months to 18 months where the heavy cracker maybe down to 60% of the capacity. So when you're operating your chemical plants at 80% capacity they have a tremendous amount of flexibility on their preferred feedstock. So, what we're looking at now is that the essentially the crude oil ratio relative to gas is in the 10, 11, 12 times range where we call the normal parity is the seven times range.</p>
          <p>And what happened in 19, 2003 and 2004 it was about five range of crude oil over gas so, when you have this type of deal now the preferred feedstock is going to be light end and that operates until you get out of balance on your butanes and some of the heavy feed crackers of what they produce. But the ethylene itself, all your light end people are going to be running all out, plus the fact right not we've got a bunch of the major oil companies, every one of them, is backing off for they've all learned how to operate some light end in their heavy crackers. So they are all using record amounts right now, of ethane and propane in their feed plants. So that makes a big difference, the 80% capacity is always the same but 80% some time is different than 80% other times, if you understand what I've just spelled out.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Shomo Sadakan with Lotus Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi can you talk about what you see the effect of economic weakness being on natural gas volumes say over the next couple of years? If we go into a very significant recession here what might that do to your natural gas volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I will let Chris talk about that. But I am sure he will bring up the new gas supplies that we are seeing and kind of the proliferation of some of these basins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mike. Once again our main natural gas pipeline systems are 100% fully subscribed with firm reservation fees. So if production sits there for the next &#x2013; I don't think we have any major renegotiations of long-term contracts of any significant size that are going to impact us in the next 24 months. We're excited about our access into the Barnett Shale, we've got the Sherman lateral coming on here in first quarter which is fully subscribed going forward. I shouldn't say fully subscribed about a 90 plus percent subscription rate. We've got a lot of access. We're working with some people in the area there to further expand some of the laterals down into the basin to get us more at the retail level at the well head level within the Dallas Fort Worth metropolitan area.</p>
          <p>We're not going to spend that capital in those areas where we're hooking up with people that are spending that capital and getting it to our, what we call trunk line, to get our main lines to get out of the basin. We are looking at -- if we acquire these capital projects Jim and Mike have talked about we've got a number of projects that we like that are in the priority queue. We are looking at rates of returns. We're looking at the risk rewards and what value they bring to the company overall to get prioritized. So we are not too nervous about natural gas prices here we know, we do kind have a long-term floor in this five or $6 range. Because that's where the marginal production is for all these shales coming on it seems to be where our assets are located. So below $5 natural gas prices on the Nymex we get a little nervous, if it's sustained there for the long-term. But once again the pipeline is fully subscribed out for the next 24 months and we're in decent shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so even if we were to go below five you think that at least for the time being you're subscribed out, meaning, even if there is not production you get paid at least for a while, if we go below five. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give you. This is Dan again, let me give you a little bit more color on what Chris has said. It is also the $5 or the $6 raise no matter what price is, is similar to the petrochemical plants I just explained. A $5 price or $6 price in one area could be a real good deal where a five or $6 price in another area will not be a good deal. So not all five and $6 are equal, like to set up these shales. There's all these shale plays thats coming into play now, they are really coming in. There was a recent announcement in South Texas by the new shale play in South Texas that they've stepped out 15 miles and they've hit the same type of shale play there, that looks like similar to the Barnett Shale. But once a company goes into a shale play, they put a lot of free money into a lot of things that they do there. So normally after they put all that upfront money and they have to do this in every shale place, when they put that upfront money, they're not going to leave that particular shale play because of probably five or $6 gas. I mean, if they got down to $2 gas and I think that's what we've been told out in the shale play in the Jonah fields and the Meeker fields and those type of deals. Then they would start cutting back that particular field.</p>
          <p>But once you put all that upfront money into that shale play, those are the ones you'll keep developing and some of the new shale plays that they have not put all this lead money into, those would probably be the ones to cut back. But, I'm not trying to get into the EMP side of telling you which company may cut back and which won't cut back. I was just giving you some economics of what everybody going to be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's actually really helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I would add too that is there's been a lot of talk lately in the press in Washington about natural gas as a way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And lot of it is because of the relative attractiveness of natural gas relative to crude, because of the price. And so I think that you may very well see more of a demand from natural gas for new uses then you had seen in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I've been reading reports recently about driving demand &#x2013; demand for gasoline falling about 9%, is the last number that I had seen. Do you think that this trend could have an effect on your crude oil pipelines or your refined products pipelines? Maybe you could comment on that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll turn that over to over James Lytal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our crude oil pipelines are mainly support the deepwater, and the deepwater takes a very long term view of the prices, because you drill a well and it's probably three or four years before you get first flows. Our two major pipelines offshore, Cameron Highway and Poseidon, they are mainly supported by deepwater crudes and we continue to see strong drilling out there.</p>
          <p>Irregardless of price unless the producers really just took a tremendously dim view of the future, that's going to stay active. As far as our oil port, Motiva is moving forward with their expansion. We've got two major very long-term commitments from the two major refineries down there, Motiva and Exxon, so they obviously see a demand way out into the future and on top of them we see another 1.5 million to 1.8 million barrels a day of refineries that are bringing in waterborne barrels that are potential customers for us. So we don't see that reduction in demand impacting our positioning assets or our future projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think you would have to be pretty pessimistic to believe that a recession would last into early 2011 when TOPS goes into service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Okay. And I guess the last thing I wanted to ask about is, so one of two things will happen, right, the capital markets will open up some point early next year or if the capital markets continue to stay shut. You guys would probably reduce some growth CapEx next year. What's the lead time on that if you had to do that. I mean, I understand you're funded for while but if things got really bad and the situation were beyond your control, what's the lead time to scale you back or slow you down on some of these projects. Can you do it on six weeks notice, two months notice, three months notice. I mean, how does that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've got to do it the other way round. We don't start projects until we're confident we have the funding for it. So we're fine for what we've already committed to, we just won't commit to new projects unless we're confident the funding will be there.</p>
          <p>One of the things to think about. I mean, again just taking that doomsday scenario the capital markets don't come back in 2009. We still have some big projects that are coming online and we'll be ramping up, generating additional cash flow and the project that we've committed to, the seven to $750 million for 2009 are going to generate cash flow. So our distributable cash flow is going to continue to rise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Okay. Thank you I appreciate all the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add a little bit more color to that. I think from my side we don't feel at no time that we would ever be restrained on doing good projects. We think with the cash flow that EPCO can put into the equity side, we don't see at any time in the near future, well in the next three, four, five years that we wouldn't have a 1 billion to 1 billion two of capital expenditure every year if the right type of project comes along that fits into our value chain. Because the amount of cash flow that EPCO can put back into it, plus the amount of cash flow that we would probably withhold every year from distributions. We can come six to 700 million a year just about every year on our own without going out the equity market.</p>
          <p>So unless the debt market would just completely go away like it's going away in the last 60 days, and we do think the debt market is easing up as of last week and beginning to show promise. I mean even further down this week because the governments of all world right now is putting so much liquidity back into the markets that in theory the people are beginning to worry now from the financial side that it's too early in that side your countries in that side but then they're not saying we may be worried about inflation in 2010-11, because so much liquidity is putting back into the banks and the financial institutions. So I think if that liquidity going into everybody they have to start loaning money out. Otherwise they are not going to be paying government the rates that the government wants for it and just hold on to that money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Dan maybe you could comment on this, because this is really the fundamental issue that I see and then after this question I will drop off. But if we think about your company long term here's the way I look at the liquidity profile going forward. You have $800 million of liquidity right now and the uses that I see are, you probably have two to $300 million of CapEx in the back half of the year net of retained cash you would retained and then maybe four to 500 net of cash that you might retained next year. I mean then you have a $500 million debt payment that's coming due at the end of next year. So if I add all those number ups and you get to the point where you have to start repaying that $500 million of debt that's the trigger point. Meaning if the capital markets were to stay closed through the end of 2009 as to where, there would be an issue of having to  slowdown CapEx. And I just wanted to understand if that draconian scenario happened what the reaction would be from Enterprise. Would it be funding from EPCO, would it be slowing down growth. How would you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'll tell you. Basically the first funding that EPD would look for would be a funding from EPCO. So you start with that basis there. So if you went through the EPCOs excess cash flow, which is in excess of $400 million a year, then at that time we would be going into some other direction. But what we are really looking at is we will not make that excess capital program in 2009 is what Mike explained earlier. Until we know for sure the capital market has opened up. If the capital market is not open up in second quarter of '09, then we will not commit for anymore capital expenditures than we got right now.</p>
          <p>And so in effect if the $500 million of debt that we got to take, its in fourth quarter of '09. If the debt market doesn't open up then, or the equity market doesn't open up then. Then what would happen then is EPCO then would come in and basically fund the majority of that with the $400 million of excess cash flow they have in 2009. So we feel that we will not &#x2013; we won't commit to any other capital expenditure until we know there's something opened up. Either the debt markets open up or the equity markets open up. We will not get ahead of the game, and that's what Mike had been talking about. Until we know for sure there is an equity market or there is debt market we are not going to commit to any more capital.</p>

          <p>And our final question comes from John Edwards with Morgan Keegan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the commodity sensitivity, can you just give us a sense of the sensitivity to the change in commodity prices. I mean you indicate the 58% is hedged next year but can you translate that into a sensitivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I am not sure how to do that. I am not sure what's the question is. But if you look at 2009, for example and look at the fact that 58% of our NGL production is hedged. That is that 58% is weighted towards propane and heaviers not so much of the ethane is hedged. But as Jim said to the extent that ethane is rejected it frees up space in our pipelines, so we can take advantage of price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. There is a lot of moving parts and we have a lot of ways to optimize our system, so it's not as easy, as just changing the prices and it's not as linear as saying that if prices going down then this is the impact because it does create additional opportunities for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me add one. When we say 58%, we're talking about our total equity barrels from the Rockies, from our percent-of-proceeds and from South Texas. If you look at what we've hedged next year, where we have the largest part of our margin risk being ethane in the Rockies. We've done 58% of the total in terms of total liquid, most of that propane plus, but we've hedged 50% of our ethane thereabouts about in the Rockies, at probably double what the current margin quoted  up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the other thing that we have may have mentioned earlier in the call is to the extent there is ethane rejection. We believe that the Rocky mountain plants are going to be last ones to feel that, because of the gas differential that makes it so much more attractive to extract liquids up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So guess the bottom line is you have nowhere near the sensitivity to the collapsing commodity prices here that others may feel, although others are hedged too. I mean, what I was thinking about Mike, was just lot of companies, they'll say for a given dollar amount change in oil or translates to X in distributable cash flow for a given amount change in gas prices that will translate to a change in cash flow and it sounds like there is just no way you can simplify it to that in you system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not as simple as that John and we remember the day when we were exposed to fix winds of commodity prices back after the 1999,2000,2001 and we've done a lot of work to renegotiate those contracts to take that risk out of the business, the place where we do have to keep whole risks is up in the Rocky Mountains but we have it with plants that were specifically designed to be keyhole plants, where we have the ability to turn down the liquid extraction rates . So we've got a number of ways to mitigate changes in NGL prices and natural gas prices. Jim I don't know if you want to add something to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the biggest part of our exposure is in the Rockies. We've hedged close to 60% of it and Mike was right. We have the ability that draconian scenario we keep talking about exhibits itself. We can turn these plants back to virtually nothing to mitigate that exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I don't know I am not quite sure how to ask this question. Regarding any kind of impact from &#x2013; I know you have administrative services sharing agreement between Enterprise and EPCO. A lot of companies out there are going to be facing pension funding expenses, and I don't know if there's any administrative costs associated with that or if you have any kind of &#x2013; in terms of your benefits to your employees of EPCO or can you comment on that at all? I mean is that something we need to be thinking about at all or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly you can think about it John, but the fact of the matter is we don't have a defined pension plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have 401(K) plan with a matching, so we don't have any pension obligations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, the one thing there is a very &#x2013; in the grand scheme of things a very small pension plan as far from a EPD level, it's a pension plan down at Dixie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All that,...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a rounding error.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. It's very small and we speak to that in our Q's and our K's.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then as far as sustaining CapEx run rate then. Oh, I am sorry you already answered that question. And to the income tax leakage, this quarter it was -- it looks like it was running about 3.3% something like that, is that a good number going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John the good news is that the taxes are up because that means that Seminole made more money.</p>
          <p>So it really is a function of the taxable income for Seminole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen on that particular deal we got both the Dixie Pipeline as a C Core and the Seminole Pipeline as a D Core. So that's why your income tax is coming into play at. I think depending on what they do in taxes as we go forward then those may be converted from a C Core back to an LLC within the next two or three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John Jim's been sitting here telling me, telling me a lot of that has to do with the Texas margin tax, so that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's what I was getting at was the Texas margins tax. I mean, I was just doing the simple math of what the income tax paid was against the EBT and the math came about 3% change. We were modeling a little bit lower then that and I am sorry I was just trying to get a feel for is this higher level about where you expect to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Its ballpark. I mean, we refer to it as the Texas state income tax, but yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay. Great. That's all I have, thank you very much.</p>
