          <p>Good morning, thank you for coming this morning. Here is the agenda of today. I will first start going with the financial results and giving you an overview of the principal achievements for the last year. Then I will hand over, as always, to Andy for the detailed financial review and for the guidance for next year. And then I will get back and I will talk about how we are making Vodafone a stronger and more competitive company and how is this turning into better returns for our shareholders. And then I will be joined by the regional COOs &#x2013; Andy and I will be joined by the regional COOs for questions.</p>
          <p>So let's start with the overview of the results. Service revenues were &#xA3;14.7 billion, down 1.6% on an organic basis in 2010. However, in Q4, revenue declined only 0.2%, which is the best quarterly growth figure in the year and the second sequential quarterly improvement driven once again mostly by mobile data and by fixed line performance.</p>
          <p>Looking at our regions, you can see Europe, where revenue declined 1.7% in Q4, which is 1.5 percentage point better than Q3. In Africa and Central Europe, revenue returned actually to growth in Q4 at 2.4%, helped by growth in Vodafone and in Turkey. In Asia Pacific and the Middle East, revenue grew for the whole year at 9.8% with India as always being the major driver here and a slightly lower &#x2013; slower level of growth in Q4, as expected, as we went through the anniversary of Indus Towers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA reached 14.7 billion, increasing by 1.7% on reported basis with the group EBITDA margins slightly above 33.1%, declining very much in line with our expectations as we set them out last November. Operating profit at 11.5 billion was ahead of guidance as I will come onto in a moment, is down 2.5% reflecting the overall recession.</p>
          <p>In contrast, free cash flow was pretty good at 7.2 billion. This is our second highest ever cash flow level, ahead of guidance and up 26.5%. I think this reflects the focus that the company has got on free cash flow generation in the year and the benefit of the working capital program that I announced six month or one year ago.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS at 16.11 was down 6.2% on last year, but up 6.6 on an underlying basis. The board has recommended a final dividend of 5.65p, making the total dividends for the year 8.31, up 7%. We have also announced today a 3-year dividend growth target, which will mean that we intend to raise dividends per share by 7% in each of the next 3 years.</p>
          <p>So we have exceeded guidance. Guidance was set at 11.8 billion in terms of adjusted operating profit last May. We then upgraded it to 11.4 &#x2013; 11.8 in February and the actual result was 11.9 billion, once we restate for guidance FX and for 200 million of Alltel restructuring cost.</p>
          <p>And in terms of free cash flow, we have exceeded our range substantially at 7.3 on guidance FX levels. And I want to stress that this is after having invested 6.2 billion in CapEx again. So we have maintained our CapEx level and we are not producing cash flow by reducing CapEx.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Andy, I would like to very quickly go through the 5 key achievements of the year, which I will explain in more detail when I come back after Andy's presentation.</p>
          <p>So what have we achieved in the last 12 months? I think 5 important things. First, we have increased the group commercial focus, ensuring that our offers are competitive, investing in market share gains where we can make money and funding this through structural cost reductions and of course, also executing on the turnaround where we had to do turnarounds.</p>
          <p>Second during the year we have improved our revenue mix, reducing our reliance on what I would call mature European mobile voice, and increasing revenue from consumer and business data services, fixed broadband and lower priced emerging market voice.</p>
          <p>Third, we have used our strong free cash flow generation to maintain investment in network capacity and network quality, which we think is strategic for the future.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we have made significant changes, internal changes at Vodafone in terms of simplifying the organization, reducing overhead and redirecting rewards for management to reward appropriate customer oriented and market share oriented behaviors. And as a result, we have accelerated our transformation that will enable us to continue to generate good cash flow to support the dividend growth target that we have announced today.</p>
          <p>Now, these are the 5 key themes that we will review in more detail later. Let me now hand over to Andy for the financial review.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. Good morning and thank you, Vittorio. So, just to go through the numbers in a little bit more detail, first of all, the total revenue number 44.5 billion for the year, that was an 8.4% headline increase. And if you, within that on the chart on the right, you can see about 5 percentage points of it came from FX, about 5 percentages points of it came from M&amp;A, particularly the increased stake in Vodacom and that gave us an underlying reduction of 2.3%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the equivalent on service revenue, the numbers were fairly similar, the pattern was fairly similar. The underlying service revenue decline on the service revenue basis was minus1.6%. So, a bit worse than that at the start of the year but improving generally as we got through the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Included in those numbers is &#xA3;4 billion of data revenues, which is the first time that we have hit the 4 billion number on the data front. In terms of the EBITDA, as Vittorio said, 14.7 billion. You can see on the chart on the bottom right that is an underlying reduction of about 7%, but with improvements from foreign exchange and M&amp;A, has come to a reported 1.7% increase with margins around 2 percentage points down year-on-year, which is in line with what we had expected. Adjusted operating profit therefore at 11.5.</p>
          <p>Financing costs are &#x2013; I will come on to these a little bit more detail later, are down quite significantly year-on-year. The underlying tax rate is fairly similar year-on-year. Two big items down below just to focus upon those. One, an impairment charge, the 2.1 billion, but secondly a tax credit of roughly 2.3 billion in total.</p>
          <p>Impairment charge is in relation primarily to India, where in recognition of the increasing intensity in the market number of competitors and the recent pricing changes, we've decided that we should take a 2.3 billion impairment charge offset in part by a 200 million release of a previous impairment charge or part of a previous impairment charge for Turkey. So the net number is 2.1, of which 2.3 is India.</p>
          <p>The 2.274 number then below that is very largely, I think it's 2.1 billion of that, is the final resolution of one of the long-standing tax disputes. So this is one where we have agreed in Germany tax losses of &#x20AC;15 billion. That is meaning in accounting terms that we are able to take a credit here of 2.1 billion being the elimination of the provisions we previously held in actually setting up the small asset.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in a cash sense, what this means is that roughly 200 million a year of cash tax saving that we have been enjoying for the last several years, we will now continue to enjoy for many years going forwards. So overall, 8.6 billion profit for the period after those two items. The earnings per share at 16.11p is, if one reverses out another one-off tax item from the previous year and deals with them basically on equivalent basis, is up by 6.6%.</p>
          <p>So let's just move then onto the regions and first of all Europe. So top left chart here is showing the trend on service revenues over the 4 quarters of last year. You can see we started the period with revenues about 4.5 percentage point back. We have exited the year on published numbers at about a 1.7% run rate. There is a small benefit to do with some loyalty accounting in Italy in the last quarter. If we strip that out, the last quarter rather than being minus 1.7, will be minus 2.4 for Europe. But nonetheless even with that adjustment, the overall progression there is about a percentage point of achievement per quarter.</p>
          <p>That same accounting adjustment means that the group service revenue decline in the fourth quarter of minus 0.2, was actually minus 0.6. And it is entirely an impact in the quarter, we essentially slightly over-accrued in earlier quarters released than the last quarter. So there is no impact on the full year basis.</p>
          <p>So the overall trend is improving and I'll come on to this on the next slide, but broadly we're seeing this across most products, and we're seeing this across most customer segments. Data has been strong in Europe clearly as it has been across the rest of the group, so 19% increase in data revenues. I'm particularly pleased with the focus upon mobile Internet, where we've seen revenues up by 37% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Fixed line has also been an area of big focus with revenues there up about 6% and European broadband customer base now up at 5.4 billion. Chart on the bottom left shows the continuing change in the mix of the revenue stream within Europe, so 38% of the revenues now are coming from products other than the historic voice products.</p>
          <p>The drivers behind those revenues then, top left chart here is on outgoing voice. So in red on the top, you can see the total volume of minutes just gradually improving quarter-by-quarter up 4% fourth quarter on fourth quarter, against the backdrop in grey of prices still coming down about 11% per minute as we have experienced for many quarters.</p>
          <p>On the top right, you can see the roaming trends. So the roaming trends four quarters ago, we were about 17 percentage point back. That has improved considerably and was 4.5 percentage point back on the fourth quarter. And on the bottom left, the enterprise business about 30% of our European business, again was back 5, 6% at the start of the year and has exited the year at just under 2%. And then finally on the right hand side, data revenues at 19%, so increase has consistently being very strong in the period. And in fact we are now getting more data revenues from the consumer segment than from the business segment.</p>
          <p>Moving then on to cost, two slides here. The first &#xA3;1 billion that we announced in 2008, we have now delivered and there's a walk there at the top of how that's impacted the overall cost base. On the bottom left is the blue wheel circle, which shows that the costs have come out pretty much across the business, all the major operating businesses and out of the center as well. And just highlighted on the bottom right one or two particular features of this, head count in the European region is down 2,300 year-on-year, about a 6% reduction. Secondly, in independent benchmarking of the efficiency of our data networks of the top 10 most efficient networks, Vodafone has 7.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, in terms of what we've been doing over the last two to three years on supply chain, centralization of that, we're now again benchmarking very favorably in buying patterns against equivalent buyers. And fourthly, our focus in the network area of bringing more transmission in-house and getting the cost efficiencies there has changed substantially the profile of the transmission that is now under our own control rather than payments to third parties.</p>
          <p>So we are now onto the next billion that we talked about a short while ago. The good news is we have identified the target areas, we've got the teams up, they are mobilized and they are working on these broadly sort of 4 areas. One of course the streamlining, looking at things like the product launch processes and making sure those are ever more efficient.</p>
          <p>Secondly what can we either outsource or offshore, captive offshore a number of initiatives on that front. Thirdly standardization of sort of best practice, sort of going into new areas. Handset logistics, we're looking closely at in this point in time. And then finally, deeper integration of the network, which is an ongoing journey but there is more that we are doing on that front.</p>
          <p>So the intent here is that that billion, roughly half of it we think we need to do because it'll lead to offset volume and inflationary increases but the other half billion should be there either for commercial reinvestment or to flow through to the bottom line. So, news there is that is now in progress and underway.</p>
          <p>Moving then on to margins in Europe, the average organic revenues, service revenues down about 3.5 percentage points, the margin was actually contained to a 1 percentage point drop during the year, so 37.6 down to 36.6. And just doing very quickly the walk across the chart here, the biggest impact has been on our direct contribution.</p>
          <p>So the impact of the revenues has taken about 1.3 percentage points off the margin. But if you look at the next two blocks, you can see that the work we've done on taking cost out of the business has more than funded the additional investment we have made in acquiring or retaining more customers and we have put more money in, in the second half of the year which is pretty well getting us back to run rates we were at previously to make sure that we are really gaining market share as much as we can do.</p>
          <p>There is then a small impact from the changing mix between the fixed and the mobile businesses. So the fixed business with about a 14% margin, the mobile businesses with margins in the high 30s. That takes about 0.2 off the margin and then the small FX benefit and we get to the 36.6 full year number for the region.</p>
          <p>So change of regions, Africa and Central Europe back to growth, I think is the headline here. After three quarters with the year-on-year run rate being negative, we have now got a fourth quarter at plus 2.4. And really, I think, there are sort of 3 key things in this. First of all, Turkey, where the turnaround is definitely gaining momentum. In the fourth quarter, we were actually up 31% on revenues compared with the fourth quarter of a year ago, albeit with a slightly negative EBITDA overall, but the traction there is palpable.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, secondly, performance of the business there &#x2013; they announced their results yesterday, very strong and overall growth in revenues around the 7% level and with margins slightly improving during the period.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, the Central European markets, where I think the general macroeconomic environment has been as tough as we have seen anywhere in the group. The good news is there that despite the revenues being a bit weaker, the focus that the businesses have had on the cost side has actually held up the margins pretty well. And collectively including Poland, the free cash flow generation from those markets is still around 0.5 billion sterling.</p>
          <p>On the top right hand side, you can see the margin walk for the region which is down about two percentage points with some mix effects, some extra investment in Turkey in order to facilitate the turnaround offset in part by the improved margin in South Africa.</p>
          <p>So on to Asia Pacific and Middle East, continued growth here, so all 4 quarters we saw positive trends on revenues, slightly lower level in the fourth quarter, but bear in mind that the previous quarters had the benefit of no comparative for Indus Towers, whereas the fourth quarter is the first time that we have had Indus in the comparable numbers for the previous year.</p>
          <p>So the overall numbers here are quite significantly influenced by India. Vittorio will talk to this in a little bit more detail later, but essentially notwithstanding the very tough pricing environment, the business has been performing extremely well, has been gaining market share, is now over 100 million customers and is operating very well.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, the customer growth continues strongly, revenues fairly stable year-on-year and margin still holding up well at around the 50% level. And then thirdly in Australia, the integration of the joint venture business is going absolutely to plan and at the same time we are seeing the revenue growth happening there. So, overall good progress in Australia.</p>
          <p>On the margin, walk for this region on the top right, you can see about 2 percentage point of decline on the margin. The most significant feature of this actually is a mix effect because India is growing disproportionately and has a lower than average margin for the region, that is actually just mathematically taking the margin down a bit. And then the rest of it is just small changes in margin across a number of the other businesses.</p>
          <p>Verizon Wireless numbers were published 2 or 3 weeks ago. So this is largely in the public domain already. Key here I think is another strong performance with revenues growing 5 or 6%, slightly tougher pricing environment with all you can eat plans being prevalent but Verizon Wireless pushing very, very hard on the data products and now who's got a customer base of around 93 million customers.</p>
          <p>On the top right, you can see the sort of cash proxy of the EBITDA less the CapEx, which is now running at the rate in one quarter of $4.6 billion. So 1.5 billion per month and the debt levels in Verizon Wireless are now heading towards and down towards $20 billion with some proceeds due shortly from some of the properties that are being divested.</p>
          <p>So back up on to group metrics, adjusted operating profit broadly unchanged year-on-year, 11.8 for the previous year, 11.5 this year, reduction primarily from EBITDA in Europe, increase from foreign exchange and a slightly bigger contribution from Verizon Wireless.</p>
          <p>On the financing costs, as said earlier, we've seen a good reduction in financing costs. So the top line here we've seen, sort of what I call the pure financing costs, have reduced from 1.1 billion to 0.9 billion. And you can see down on the very bottom line here that the average cost of debt has now dropped below 4%, which we believe is the lowest of any global telco.</p>
          <p>In the second line on here, mark-to-market adjustments, we had a more cost to book last year, previous year I should say, and those have hence reduced and the dividends and interest on tax are fairly constant. So overall, the adjusted net financing costs are actually down by 400 million from 1.3 to 0.9 billion and we're very comfortable with our debt position going forwards and have largely fixed for next year.</p>
          <p>So the effective tax rate, there was at a headline level very little difference between the 2 years, the year we just finished was 24.0%, the year before underlying was 24.5. In the year before however, we had one tax settlement that gave us a one-off of 7 or 8 percentage point benefit. So we actually reported a very low tax charge the previous year, but that was because of a one-off item and the underlying, as I say, was very, very similar.</p>
          <p>We've talked about the big settlement in Germany, just on the other cases, the CFC case. We're now going through a process of actually going through all the details and having those compared with the various court rulings, so that is a process which is ongoing. And in terms of the India tax case, the ball at the moment is very much in the court of the tax authorities there, who have got to form a view as to whether they think they have got the jurisdiction on this matter. And we expect to hear back from them over the coming weeks on that so, there is no change at this point in time. And overall, it remains our intent to target about a mid-20 effective tax rate going forwards.</p>
          <p>So capital investment, this chart is done at constant FX, so 6.2 billion of investment in both years. Let me just draw out three things here. The investment in Europe is basically held at previous levels. We are very, very focused upon building out our data networks and given the prodigious cash flow from the rest of the business, we have absolutely continued to focus on that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the Africa and Central Europe region, you can see that the overall level of spend has increased. There are two primary reasons for that. The first is that in the previous year, we only had the Vodacom numbers in at a 50% level because of our ownership at that time, whereas in the most recent year, they are in at 100%. That is about a 250 million increase purely because of the accounting. Secondly, in Turkey we have invested year-on-year about 150 million more as part of the turnaround plan.</p>
          <p>The other one then finally on here is on India, where you can see the CapEx level has decreased quite markedly over that period of time. So we did spend 1.4 billion a year or ago and spent 0.8 billion last year. That is very much a focus upon sharing, using the tower company and is a focus upon network management and really making sure we're getting the most out of our networks. So overall, those sorts of levels we are believing will be similar to our levels in the year that we are now just entering.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, 7.2 billion up from 5.7 a year previously, the second highest I think we have had in our history in the middle of a recession. So briefly the walk on this, a reduction from the slightly lower EBITDA, working capital is on here at 0.9, we actually generated 0.7 of it in the year and the previous year we had a minus 0.2, which obviously doesn't reverse, so about 0.7 of benefit during year.</p>
          <p>The CapEx interest, the tax collectively, sort of broadly evened each other out. Dividends was up quite significantly and that is pretty much exclusively the U.S. three factors. One, we received some dividend in this last year that would otherwise have been paid in the previous year. We received secondly more dividend because of the agreement we reached at the time of the Alltel deal to slightly boost the level of tax dividends. And thirdly, the increased level of profitability of the business has increased the dividend so that we can pay the tax on it.</p>
          <p>And then finally on here, FX, which has nudged us up to the 7.2 number. So overall, 13.8p per share of free cash flow generation. Although to be clear, of that 7.2 about 0.7 is coming from working capital, 6.5 without the working capital and whilst we will do some more working capital next year, that is why we are more focused on the 6.5 number in our forward guidance on the free cash flow for the year we're just in.</p>
          <p>So on net debt, started the year at 34 billion, finished the year at 33 billion. The simple story there is we generated 7 billion of free cash flow. We paid 4 billion out by way of dividends. We paid roughly 3 billion for M&amp;A, particularly the Vodacom acquisition and we had a 1 billion benefit from foreign exchange. Overall, down 1 billion, which is consistent with our single A, low single A credit rating target.</p>
          <p>So looking forwards onto &#x2013; into the '10 &#x2013; '11 year, the two numerical guidance reference points, the profit we're aiming to have in the 11.2 to 12.0 billion range and the free cash flow to be in excess of &#xA3;6.5 billion. So within that, our assumption is that we will see some improvement in the economies in which we are operating, we'll be at still at fairly low rates. We will see continuing growth in markets like India, purely because of the penetration potential there.</p>
          <p>So if we look at our own business, we are saying at some stage during next year, more second half than first half, we would expect to return back to revenue growth. Secondly, we're saying that the margins which went down 2 percentage points last year, we would expect that rate in reduction to significantly improve next year, again more second half than first half, but as the cost programs come to pare and as the revenue trend improves, we would expect that to significantly improve. Thirdly on CapEx, we expect that to be at similar levels to last year and finally all of this is on the assumption, which is not easy to be accurate on, that the FX rates are roughly 1.15 for the euro and 1.50 for the dollar.</p>
          <p>So in summary, before I hand back to Vittorio, there are for me sort of 4 things that stand out here. One, we have got the revenue trends bit-by-bit heading in the right direction. Secondly, the focus we have had upon cost is absolutely gaining momentum and is now starting to show through in the numbers. Thirdly, the cash generation and cash conversion has been significant, particularly not just what we've done with the cost of working capital has I think been a big step forwards. And finally, our funding is very efficient and we have got very low costs of debt.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will hand back to Vittorio.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and now I would like to go back to my key theme for today, which is a stronger Vodafone. And I will do that just going through the 5 key achievements of last year. So let me start by looking at our key operating companies and how we have increased the commercial focus in all of them and of course conducted a turnaround where we needed to do turnarounds.</p>
          <p>Let me start with Germany. In Germany, our trends have improved 1.2 percentage points to a minus 1.6%. This is the second successive quarterly improvement in an economy, which is more stable than others, but also in a fairly aggressive market. Here we have voice still pretty weak. We have got an incredibly good performance as you can see in the chart, 27% in data growth, this is PC connectivity but also, as Andy have said, mobile Internet really going well, 500,000 SuperFlat customers. You might remember, I mentioned SuperFlat for the first time 12 to 18 months ago, and further improvements in enterprise.</p>
          <p>Total EBITDA margins declined a couple of percentage points to 39%, but mobile EBITDA margins remain in the high 40s. We had said that we would increase commercial spend in the second half of the year. We anticipated that in November. This has been funded fully by cost reduction. During the year, we have reduced the head count in Germany by 600 people and we have reduced OpEx by 2%. This increased spending has gone into of course higher ARPU services, smartphones, netbooks, the SuperFlat tariffs.</p>
          <p>In Germany, going ahead, we need to do more on the cost front and we need to do more on the commercial portfolio front. On the cost front, this year we have completed the integration of Arcor and Vodafone, now we have a fully integrated company, fixed and mobile. We are about now to start a second restructuring, which is meant to create a more efficient construction for the merged entity.</p>
          <p>On Italy &#x2013; in Italy the growth has slowed, again reflecting two things. A weaker economy but also price competition, which is being led by our main competitor in Italy, price competition to which we always respond in Italy.</p>
          <p>Looking at the revenue trends closely, you can see data, fixed line and enterprise revenue was pretty good but these, as you can see in the chart in the lower part of the chart, this has been partially offset by weaker revenues in the prepaid segment where we are firmly defending our market share in the market.</p>
          <p>In this context, I think it's pretty remarkable that our EBITDA has gone up 1 percentage point this year. The overall increased revenue and the good work done on cost has allowed us to invest in fixed broadband, in customer care and in advertising in the year.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we continue to push in Italy on smartphones. We will make more investments in online and customer care and we'll continue to bid of course on our fixed broadband and on our enterprise effort. I would say, in general, it seems to me that the performance in Italy has been pretty good in the year.</p>
          <p>Spain, Spain &#x2013; the Spanish economy as we all know continues to remain weak with rather high unemployment levels and also the competitive intensity in Spain has increased due to the fact that our main competitor has raise commercial spending in the second half.</p>
          <p>In this context, I cannot say that I am happy but I can say that I am somewhat satisfied that we have slightly improved our rate of decline in Q4 to around minus 6.2%, as you see in the chart, with very good fixed growth remaining at around 80% and that some weakness in data growth which is more linked to some regulatory change which is not allowing any more certain promotions that we used to do in the past. But I would say nothing substantial in the market other than this thing. In this context, the 0.8 percentage points decline in margin in Spain represent, in my view, a pretty good achievement by our local management in a year where revenues have declined 8%. We have taken strong management actions on overhead and on commercial efficiency and this I think has mitigated in a quite visible way, the margin decline in Spain.</p>
          <p>Going ahead, good success of Tarifas Planas. We continue to invest there. We continue to invest in fixed broadband and we will try to continue to drive converged services in Spain. Overall, a challenging environment in Spain for '09 &#x2013; '10, but Vodafone Spain is a performing unit.</p>
          <p>Moving to the U.K., in the U.K. revenue in Q4 declined 2.6%, which is a 2.3 percentage point improvement on Q3 and again the second successive improvement in quarterly growth trends.</p>
          <p>In U.K., we've got a very good performance of contract net adds, 256,000, pretty stable in the last three quarters &#x2013; in the quarter. We are generating in the U.K. benefits substantially out of better pricing, out of more &#x2013; better and more visible advertising, complete smartphone line-up, iPhone here clearly playing a role. And this has led us to be for the first time in 2 years MNP positive in the quarter.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margins declined 2.7 percentage points in the year. In the context of the revenue decline of 5%, the U.K. management team has clearly taken cost as a priority. We've reduced the U.K. FTEs by 1,400 in the year, which corresponds to about 14% of the U.K. workforce.</p>
          <p>Looking to next year, we need to continue in the U.K. to work on the turnaround, basically focusing on 3 things. Network advantage, which is I think publicly recognized as you have read in the press by a number of independent entities. Driving the smartphone take-up, it's not on the chart, I think in the last quarter the data growth in the U.K. was 33, 32.8%. Again the highest in Europe, so pretty good. And of course we have to work on efficiency and continue to work on efficiency. In the U.K., we will launch this year the Vodafone One Net, which is the converged service for enterprise.</p>
          <p>And one final thing that I want to mention about the U.K. because I'm very proud, we are working on the turnaround, but we are also working on innovation. We just got a deal with Centrica for 1 million meters machine-to-machine deal. This is probably the largest in Europe. So I'm confident the U.K. will continue on its turnaround and I'm also glad to see that we're working on innovation and the new important things for the future.</p>
          <p>India, now India, Andy have &#x2013; has said that we have made good commercial progress in the past 12 month in what I would call a dynamic or maybe more appropriately, a price aggressive environment. In Q4 service revenue increased 7%, which is more or less the same amount of the previous quarter. So we delivered 2 successive quarters of growth, sequential growth, after the price reduction have taken place and we have passed the 100 million customers mark in the same period.</p>
          <p>Market share trends, we have increased as you can see at the bottom, in the bottom part of the chart. We have increased our share of the top 4 large players by more than 1 percentage point in one year with &#x2013; and this is an important point for your consideration about the future in India &#x2013; with already 75% of our customers on the new tariff plans. So I think this is pretty good.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margins fell 0.8 percentage points. We absorbed in this period, the impact of the launch of the 6 new circles and Indus Tower. But more importantly, we have moved in India to be &#x2013; from being cash negative to being cash positive in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>And also EBITDA margins in the last part of the year have been better than in the equivalent period of the previous year. So in India, I would say that our strategy, which was really highly visible brand, good distribution and competitive pricing, is working.</p>
          <p>If I look back to the acquisition days, we &#x2013; I think we have achieved quite a bit since 2007. We have grown from a number 3 player in the market to a number 2 player in the market. We have created Indus Tower, which is the largest tower company in the world. And we have added 72 million customers in the period.</p>
          <p>In light of these achievement, clearly the impairment that we announced today that Andy has commented before, is what I would call, a disappointing but necessary and I would say almost inevitable step which follows the addition of 6 new competitors &#x2013; nationwide competitors. In reality, it's 8 new and 120 licenses, 1 year after our acquisition and the subsequent price reductions &#x2013; dramatic price reductions, which have taken place last year. But from an operational perspective and from a market perspective, India is a very performing unit.</p>
          <p>Moving to South Africa. In South Africa, growth trends have &#x2013; are improving but also the competitive intensity is improving in the market. Nevertheless, as announced yesterday, Vodacom continues to grow revenue market share in the market particularly focusing on mobile data. Elsewhere within the South African portfolio, competition and I would say economic challenges most noticeably in the DRC have slowed the growth rate of the company in Q4.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margins continue to be flat with benefits coming from cost savings and reduced license fees. Looking ahead, I would say, Vodacom will continue with the current strategy, which is strategy of leadership in mobile broadband, high quality data network. And actually will make some investments in fiber in order to reduce the cost of carrying this data and to of course improve the experience of the customers. Yesterday, also Vodacom announced a revised dividend policy, which recognizes the low gearing that they have.</p>
          <p>Now final case of the turnaround, Turkey. In Q4 as you can see in the chart, the revenue growth in Turkey was at 31%. In Turkey, we have gained about 2 percentage points of market share in 3 quarters in an economy, which today is improving again. EBITDA was roughly nil, which was expected. So, I would say that our turnaround strategy, which was really combining more price competitive offers, a better network and a controlled distribution, which I think I declared 12 to 18 month ago, is really helping us. We now have 50% &#x2013; we have got 50% net add shares in the market and we have been mobile number portability positive throughout the whole year.</p>
          <p>What can we expect from Turkey looking ahead? We expect, basically to continue with the same strategy, revenue growth in the, I would say high single digit for the year. And of course we want to return to profitability although it is likely that in this year, it will not be a very high one.</p>
          <p>In summary, having reviewed the first topic, I think that our strong commercial focus is generating improving strength across all the market, but also that Vodafone today is a stronger Vodafone than 12 month ago in both mature Europe and in emerging economies.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the second important topic of our strengthening Vodafone theme. In the past 12 month, we have continued to push voice data, mobile data, fixed broadband services to enterprise and of course growth into emerging markets. This is helping us to drive away the mix of our revenues, away from what I would call mature, relatively higher priced European voice into new services, data services, which in Europe tend to be priced lower than in most parts of the world and of course grow in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the chart, now today we already generate 58% of our revenues from these new services, lower priced voice market and 42% out of European mobile voice. This is strategic I think to portray and to have a Vodafone which has a mix of revenues more future proof given the trends in the market. How are we going to drive this? Well, first of all of course data, as you can see in the chart, data penetration today is about 34% with regular data subscribers, people who pay subscription at 14% of our base in Europe. Our goal is to drive this penetration north of 50% within 3 years including the replacement of old infotainment services with new data services.</p>
          <p>Smartphones are key in this migration. Smartphones today, you see in the second line or in third line actually, they represent 30% in the last quarter of our sales mix. We want to drive this to 70% so that we can go from 11% of people having a smartphone regular usage to above 35.</p>
          <p>Often I am asked, Vittorio, what is the profitability of the spend? And I have to tell you that we track the data shift profitability on a monthly basis and the average profitability of smartphones is absolutely in line with our average profitability. There is a higher initial cost but on a pre-post basis there is also higher ARPU and higher margins. And of course you have to keep in mind that the more smartphones are coming into the market and now the choice is becoming really rich, the more we can get deeper into the customer base, so drive those 70 and 35, with products that have a lower initial cost and better profitability for us.</p>
          <p>If you look at the other side of the equation, dongles, data card, as I would say in few &#x2013; in few minutes, they have different economics, so a small upfront cost almost nothing. And of course they use the network much more. But if you combine the 2 things, again the profitability is in line with the average profitability. So what I can say is that this strategy of increasing the 2 bottom parts of the bar is not coming at a cost or actually is delivering the same profitability that we have today.</p>
          <p>The second way we'll drive the shift is of course the fixed burden. I will talk about it in few moments, but clear &#x2013; here clearly the strategy is to go there where it makes sense from an economical point of view.</p>
          <p>We are working on services. Services for enterprise, the Vodafone One Net, international services through Vodafone Global Enterprise, consumer services, Vodafone 360, slightly less than half a million users today on Vodafone 360 and of course machine-to-machine and all the other innovation.</p>
          <p>Now in parallel, emerging markets continue to grow. Today they continue to grow mostly in voice, but data penetration is the next thing and data penetration today in emerging markets is only 5%. And if I have to judge from markets like South Africa, as soon as you create the right &#x2013; you have the right networks and the right smartphones or devices, there is an opportunity in data there.</p>
          <p>So, second point we'll continue to drive towards a total communication company and I would call it a more geographically balanced and future proof mix, 42% exposure to European mature mobile voice.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband, fixed broadband is a part of our strategy. I stated 18 month ago that we wanted to become a leading provider of total communication across Europe, where we could make economic sense of it. In order to assess whether we can make economic sense of it, we look at competitors and alternative providers. We look at price levels and we look at regulation. Whether we need to own or not own assets fundamentally depends on the competitors' openness to cooperation and on regulation. And so for example in Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, we own some asset and in U.K. and in Ireland we don't or in Greece in a different way, we don't. In the past 2 years we have integrated Tele2, we have integrated the minorities of Arcor and we have expanded our coverage in terms of central offices, in terms of geographic coverage to something, which is about 60% in the markets where we operate on average.</p>
          <p>I would say that our strategy today is working. As you can see in the chart, 5.4 million customers across Europe, 3 billion of revenues, brand has been successfully extended to fixed services where we have done it. Revenue growth 8%, margin more or less 14% stable. And I have to say, I'm glad that now we are in a cash neutral position after an investment of 150 million, which is about 15% of the European investment.</p>
          <p>What is this bringing other than the financial side o fit to us? Well of course it's bringing brand expansion, it's brining some lower churn that we start to see across &#x2013; with customers have services across fixed and mobile and it helps us also serving better the enterprise segment.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, we will continue to explore in a very country-by-country base, what we can do in terms of providing customers with better services and higher speeds and better more integrated experiences. In Italy for example, we have now a proposal and idea to do some joint investment with all the other industry players to push forward and go ahead in this area. And of course the short-term goal, from a financial point of view we were cash consumptive, now we are cash neutral. We want to turn the fixed broadband business into a cash positive unit for us.</p>
          <p>On enterprise, Andy has touched it, quickly 8.3 billion in Europe. I have to say a 4% decline last year across Europe but as you can see from the chart, minus 1.9 in the last quarter, so improving &#x2013; improving trends. We estimate that in enterprise we have about 35% market share in Europe. So, yes, Vodafone is mainly a consumer company, but we are also pretty big in enterprise.</p>
          <p>We do this through 2 &#x2013; we are pushing through 2 main units. One is Vodafone Global Enterprise, the unit that has a single point of contact, international managed mobility. Here I have to say it's a bit a like in operating companies. It's one of the best performing part of Vodafone. Growth in a difficult year where companies have cut costs, 2.1% growth. The business exceeds now 1.1 billion. We have now more than 550 customers that are managed internationally through this unit.</p>
          <p>The other one is Vodafone Business Services, which is the unit that develops the converged services for the other part of the market, SoHos and SMEs. Again, this is working pretty well. We launched in Italy, in Spain, the Czech Republic, in Portugal. We have 800,000 users today and we are about to launch, as I said, in the U.K. but also in Germany. So enterprise is another strategic choice that we made and is working.</p>
          <p>Moving to one important topic of our stronger Vodafone for the future, network investment. Again, I know that sometimes there is a bit of concern in some analysts and investors about CapEx levels and investors' levels. Our traffic across the network has increased significantly in the last year about 100%, which was expected and we expect this growth to &#x2013; essentially to continue.</p>
          <p>Now 85% of this growth is data card and 15% is smartphone. Data card PCC users are using about 1.5, 1.6 gig per month. Smartphone users are using on average about 100 to 200 meg per month. And this statistics are not substantially changing in &#x2013; across the period.</p>
          <p>In order to support it, we spent last year about &#xA3;2 billion in Europe on network CapEx, which is a similar level to the pervious year and as you can see from the bottom part of the chart, our average busy hour utilization has gone up only 3 percentage points from 35 to 38. And most important, the percentage of sites, which are fully utilized in the busy hour has been &#x2013; remained constant at 7%.</p>
          <p>So we regularly check our network performance. We actually see some improvements. We are pleased to report some improvements and we are also pleased to see that these are appreciated also publicly, by independent parties.</p>
          <p>In 2009-10 we have added 3,500 sites. We continue to add HSPA higher versions, which improve this type of efficiency and customer experience. We now have a 3G outdoor coverage, which is probably between 80 and 95% in each &#x2013; across the different European countries. We will continue to invest in this direction.</p>
          <p>So overall I would say I remain comfortable with our CapEx levels in Europe and I am convinced that this is the appropriate level for both the customers and our financial discipline &#x2013; internal financial discipline.</p>
          <p>Fourth element of work for the last 12 to 18 month, a change in Vodafone's pro-forma culture. My objective here has been and is very clear. I want to create a leaner, more competitive and more customer oriented culture within Vodafone and I want to reward the behaviors that are consistent with these things.</p>
          <p>So what we have done? We have made Vodafone leaner and simpler by sliming down the corporate functions by about 200 people if you count internal and contractors. We have changed about &#x2013; we just finished actually &#x2013; about 16% of the top teams across the top 300 of Vodafone.</p>
          <p>We have increased spans and reduced layers to make the organization flatter and quicker. And of course by doing this, we have reduced complexity and increased the efficiency. We also have simplified some responsibilities between group and operating functions, clarifying in a very punctual way, what are the responsibilities for delivery and of course avoiding and eliminating cost duplications across the group.</p>
          <p>In 2010-11, we also have increased more the level of which with which we can vary rewards for managers depending on competitive results and relative market share. So that to put it in a simple way, the full bonus can not be earned just by hitting a budget or a financial projection, but there is a large component which is really competition driven. And we have included 3 cash flow targets in the long-term incentives for all managers, so that yearly gains must be sustainable over the period.</p>
          <p>And finally in order to enforce the outward looking culture, we have adopted as major customer support, not to the customer satisfaction but rather the net promoter score which is a much more powerful measure that enables us to compare not just with the Telef&#xF3;nicas of this word but also with the new players coming from the IP space.</p>
          <p>So what does all of this mean for our shareholders? It means a company-wide focus on performance and a company-wide focus on generating a sustainable free cash flow that will enable to improve our shareholders return.</p>
          <p>In November '08, I set out together with Andy a medium term objective that Vodafone would generate between 5 and &#xA3;6 billion per year of free cash. In today's terms, this would be 5.5 to 6.5. Today, 18 months later, we have announced a new medium-term target. We now expect our annual free cash flow to be between 6 and 7 billion per annum over the next 3 years.</p>
          <p>Now, why are we confident that we can achieve this? If you look at the business in '09, '10 we have made an operating cash flow investment in 4 areas: Turkey, India, Ghana and Qatar and this is about &#xA3;600 million. And as I've said, we are cash neutral on the fixed business. As we move along with improvement in those businesses and in pushing them towards cash generation, this will clearly benefit the overall company position at a time where the working capital improvement after a couple of years should start fading out.</p>
          <p>So this growth will help us sustain higher free cash flow and higher free cash flow will help supporting growth in EPS of at least 7% per annum without cutting back on investments, which we do believe are strategic for the future.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, I think today we have a stronger Vodafone. We have strengthened Vodafone commercially. We have increased efficiency and we are executing on turnarounds. We're &#x2013; we've decreased our reliance and we continue to decrease our reliance on mature European mobile voice and focus more and more on new services and emerging economies and data. We delivered our financial performance ahead of guidance and we have increased our target for sustainable free cash flow generations. And this turns into an intention to increase dividends per share for our shareholders by 7% at least each year for the last year and for each of the next 3 years.</p>
          <p>I thank you for your attention and I would now ask my colleagues to join me. And Nick, if you just wait for me over there. I think Nick was very quick in raising his hand even before my finishing the speech. I am not sure I should reward this but -.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley. I'll do two questions, if that's all right. On the guidance, I just wanted to clarify the depreciation-amortization points because you've got a full year of Vodacom in FY '11, you've also got depreciation itself, the low CapEx, the one we've just seen that would go up. And you're saying that it would only go up slightly, so I guess that means 8 to 8.1 billion for FY '11. Could you just explain why it's not going up more than that and therefore why the &#x2013; how that ties into the operating profit guidance you've given? Because I guess I for one, had more like 8.3 for the next year which means the operating guidance you've given is a little bit less impressive than it first seems if you cut the depreciation. Secondly, on the dividend commitments. I can imagine you're not going to comment on India, but clearly you're going to have a bill of some sort this year of spectrum. How many years are you going to be comfortable with paying an uncovered divided for in terms of cash flow, because this in FY '11 the chances are the dividend will not be covered by cash flow given the fairly hefty bill in India, some back license payments, and also the bill for 800 megahertz spectrum in Germany which looks like to be more than a billion. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nick, I am afraid I cannot comment too much on spectrum for the two countries that you mention, because the auctions are actually working in these days and they &#x2013; I cannot do it. I think, and maybe Andy you take then the first question. I think we're pretty comfortable about our dividend for the three years, our dividend goals for the three years that we have commented. We, as I said, we have strengthened the company in the last three years. We are pretty confident that we have an ability with positive results in Morton's and Nick's countries where we are investing with improved returns from fixed broadband which is another important piece of the company and with more efficiency that we are drawing through the European piece that we can drive cash flow at a level which will leave some space between the new increased dividend level which if we do the 7% we'd end up north of 5 billion and our cash flow target. So it's not a lot of room but I think it's very good that we don't have a lot of room because that will force even more discipline and more focus on what we are doing. But we wanted to signal that we feel comfortable that we can have this goal. So I think it's a reduced headroom, you are right, but is not reduced to a level where we wouldn't and by the way this is not cutting CapEx. I want to stress it again. This is not cutting CapEx. We don't want to go there.</p>
          <p>You have comment on DNA?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the DNA, so without getting into lots of detail, last year we had essentially 11 months of Vodacom in at the 100% level, so there is not a huger distortion from that. What we are saying is that this next year we think will be similar looking, maybe 0.1 higher or something of that sort of order with the one exception that that would exclude the amortization effect of any of the spectrum that is being bought in the current year which we say because we don't know the quantum of it is difficult to put into the forecast at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think far from the dividend point, do you think you don't ever anticipate paying an uncovered dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what we are saying is that we have taken a view over a 3-year period of the cash flows of the business spectrum as best we can predict not the easiest of things. There might be a period particularly this year when actually we'll be uncovered but if we take the 3 years in total, that we are comfortable but we'd be covered.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. It's Robert Grindle from Deutsche Bank. In some markets it seems that you are just about to start charging people if they go over their bundles on mobile data and I just wondered if you know you've got people increasingly addicted to mobile data. If you charge people who went over their bundles, is there an amount you have in mind that you could potentially raise from doing that, all things being equal? And then secondly, you won an interesting contract in fixed managed data services, I think it's DHL, but I could be wrong on that. Do you see yourself expanding more in this space going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I say just a quick thing and then &#x2013; this is more of a European thing. So maybe, Michel, you want to get into. I mean clearly, data pricing has to be more dynamic that what has been traditionally and we are going there. The first thing we have done, we have enabled our networks to manage more dynamic data pricing, then what will really happen, market-by-market whether its going to be overage, whether its going to be differentiated quality of services, whether its going to be whatever, different packages. This is going to be driven by competitive dynamics. What we have done, we have enabled the networks and we have enabled the billing platform to really handle this. What exactly will happen I think it's more market-by-market thing. Michel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe on your 2 questions. On the first one I guess that what is important is transparency for our customers. So we have the billing platform which now allow to do it and so we just let's say give a real view to the customers of what they are awarded and what they can get. So that's true that market-by-market we are doing things different. We have just announced and probably that's what you are referring to &#x2013; some of your tariffs in the U.K. where we have made it clear, let's say the allocation depending on the tariffs that the customers are taking and how they will be charged for extra consumption. So that's the first piece and we have done that in, let's say, major European countries.</p>
          <p>On enterprise, what Vittorio referring to those fixed managed contract, it's &#x2013; let's say our total telecommunication strategy that's for sure that in the enterprise space, we want to embrace fixed and mobile. We believe that our customers more and more integrate fixed and mobile. So for <mark type="inaudible" /> we have integrated platforms with the One Net platform that Vittorio refers to. We are let's say, also launching additional services in order to able to deliver fixed and mobile integration. So that's really our focus right now.</p>

          <p>So just mentioned, maybe you're saying South Africa, we have uncapped data usage. So there people are paying for the all the use and in South Africa, we had a 32% growth in Q4 and 1.1 million users. So this shows that users don't have to have capped solutions to go data.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I am John Karidis from MF Global. I just wanted to ask two questions please. Firstly, in view of what is about to happen in the U.K. what's your assessment of the need for Vodafone's fixed broadband assets to start offering basic or premium content? And then secondly, completely separately, incumbents in Europe and AT&amp;T in the States have started on this path few years ago, Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is bidding for Telmex and also Telef&#xF3;nica is trying to merge its fixed and mobile business in Brazil. So do you think that the value prospects would be better and safer for Verizon Wireless if it were also to merge with a domestic fixed-line business, and if so and if not, why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michel, why don't you take the U.K. question and I take the second one which is actually &#x2013; you know, what makes sense for Verizon comps, I think you should ask to Verizon and not to me and therefore I cannot comment. And again we have a lot of discussions with them and anything that would increase the value of Verizon Wireless would find a good partner in us and we are very keen to have every business discussion that helps Verizon Wireless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, but don't you think that you'll lose &#x2013; as a shareholder in Verizon Wireless, you will lose out to companies that are merging fixed and mobile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me tell you, for the time being it does not seem to be really the case. I have to say, as Michel has said, let me take the broader question, which is really &#x2013; forget it for a second Verizon, the kind of convergence thing. Clearly there are some segments in the enterprise sector that require converged services and this is why we have equipped the company in the last two years to be able to deliver those in most markets and by the end of this year, all our major markets will have that capability. So in the enterprise segment, it is the case. It is not necessarily the case to own the assets everywhere. It just depends on the conditions at which you can get them. But clearly that's the case.</p>
          <p>In the consumer space, it's really very early days. You mentioned content. I haven't seen a lot of advantage so far in putting together the pipes and the content. So I think it's very early days in that respect, you can put the question &#x2013; the answer into the U.S. frame more saying, I don't think that from a consumer perspective Verizon Wireless is today at a handicap because of this versus AT&amp;T.</p>
          <p>Second thing about enterprise U.K. the concern, for sure our focus right now is on mobile and you are seeing the results which have been presented by Vittorio, great success, leader in terms of net adds in the market. So I mean that we're really delivering the turnaround that we were expecting to deliver. As far as enterprise is concerned, in order to be able to answer the customer needs, we have partnership with BT in terms of own sale in order to access to the infrastructure and to be able to without owning the infrastructure, to answer our customer needs. We believe that it is a good answer in the U.K. By the way there is no real integrated player in the U.K. so the market structure is probably different from other markets. So we think that we're in the safe side and we're really focused on delivering the turnaround.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It's Nick Lyall from UBS. Can I ask on the European margins, you invested about 40 basis points I think of European margin into customer investment on the slide shown, you are still lagging, it seems quite a way behind other operators in Europe in terms of service revenue growth. So should we assume that this year's margin for example in the guidance includes much more investment in customer, investment this year or is it sufficient to as we stand at the moment and continue with the current run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again I take half of the question and leave half for Michel. I am not so sure that I think in the second, your statement about lagging behind in the second half of the year is much less true, so if you take the full year, maybe but if you take the second half of the year, it's less true. We've invested more in most of the markets and in most of them we are at par or better, probably you can see '02 slightly &#x2013; still slightly better in the U.K., but we are getting the iPhone effect in the base now. Clearly, in for example in Germany not having the iPhone still has a drag on us, but if you look at Spain, for example where we have a disadvantage because we don't have the iPhone, actually our performance is a pretty good I would say, two quarters we were better than Telef&#xF3;nica, two quarters they were better than us. And we have probably sacrificed less in margin, so it's 2-2 and better control of the board, I would say. If I can use a soccer metaphor, which is very appropriate now. The &#x2013; so we are investing more, we don't want to lose ground in second half of the year we have been aggressive. But we have been more aggressive because of the good work that the European management team has done on costs. So it's a deliberate reinvestment in performance in second half of the year. Michel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just let's maybe to give a few figures and to highlight that's true that we have delivered what we have said that we would deliver, meaning an increase of a now by &#xA3;270 million in H2 compared to H2 last year, so a real focus on that. Mainly on retention by the way, that was also what you have said, shifting from acquisition to retention, leveraging the iPhone or some other, let's say rates or tariffs in other countries. What we see is good results. We have renewed, with positive growth in terms of gross adds and net adds in consumer contracts and in business, all are in place in all the countries and we are clear leaders in Spain and in the U.K. in terms of net adds. In let's say Italy, that's slightly different because that's a prepaid market and that's only in Germany that we are still lagging a little bit in terms of net adds for, let's say, some weaknesses in our indirect distribution. But we are quite confident that with this strategy, which has been financed by our OpEx savings, we can really push the growth as we've seen in the past few quarters meaning by 1 point each quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's James Ratzer from New Street Research, I have two questions please. The first one was just looking at you revenue guidance for the year, I am just wondering why you are not being more bullish. I am looking at the current trends we're seeing through the second half of the year, you are saying you are only expecting to return to positive growth by the second half of this year. Could that be viewed as a conservative target?</p>
          <p>The second question I had slightly more detailed question around India. I was wondering if you could let us know what your carrying value of that asset is now. How come you took an impairment on the asset in the second half of the year but you didn't also increase the corresponding put to the SR family on your balance sheet? And can you let us know if there any tax benefits from this potential write-down either now or in the medium term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. All questions for Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Let's try and take them in order. Clearly the revenue trend is directionally going in the right direction. I think when we are trying to sort of forward forecast the plus or minus 0.3 or 0.4 or 0.5% per quarter, it is not the most precise science in a difficult and still quite turbulent world. I hope you are right. I hope we are being conservative. But we are sort of saying look, I think second half we should hopefully be there if it can be earlier rest ensured we will try and get it there earlier.</p>
          <p>On India, the carrying value and this is basically taking the original investment, which was obviously an equity investment and adding the debt that we inherited with the business. It is the funding of the investment in the business since then and it is doing at today's exchange rate is about &#xA3;8 billion before we took the charge. Okay? So the 2.3 is taking about 25% off which is not dissimilar to the reduction in share prices of other mobile operators in that territory. The &#x2013; now I'm trying to think are there any tax benefits of that? No. And thirdly, is there any impact upon the put, the answer is not in an accounting sense. Obviously whether the value of the business is higher or lower than the put value is another matter, but if the put word be exercised, we'll actually fair value that at the time of the exercise, there would not be a further charge to the P&amp;L, it would essentially be a reserve movement. I probably missed one of your questions, but I apologize.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Andrew Beale from Arete Research. Just coming back to India, I know it's difficult to answer the questions at the moment, but how do you see that you might be able to earn a return on capital on future investments over and above your cost of capital, given the spectrum, given the tri-proposals, given the effect of tax on mergers that might happen or might be interesting to increase scale, the push on all of those things? It seems like a sort of extortionate &#x2013; extortion in terms of regulation that's going on there. It seems a very hard situation. And secondly on Verizon, they launched an enterprise mobile service, I think last week, covering a bunch of European markets. Can you just confirm that that is out of Verizon comps level rather than requiring consent out of Verizon Wireless and also that it's a sort of MVNO start, that type deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the top &#x2013; why don't you take India and on the Verizon the easy answer is that the Verizon comp thing, everything which is then out of Verizon Wireless, is geographically defined in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take I think on India, break it down into three aspects. First of all is, our business performance currently, I think Vittorio has summarized that well in this slide. We are performing well, we are taking revenue market share. We're at 100 million customers. That's 20 million customers more than the acquisition business case, so we're tracking very strongly in terms of customer performance and systematically on revenue market share.</p>
          <p>We're hitting the cost efficiencies we've set ourselves for the business case through network share and in various other ways. We are only 5% above the acquisition case in terms of capital spend to date, so if you stripped it down, it comes down to the pricing environment. If you look at the pricing market environment versus our original expectations, you go back a quarter, quarter four of last year, we were around 95 paisa this quarter &#x2013; we're down to 69, April, 67, exit this year is going to be around mid-50s. So the pricing level is about 35 to 40% below the acquisition business case, but we are getting good MOU elasticity off that. So bottom line is, it's a pricing issue, we're competing well, we are taking market share.</p>
          <p>If I look at the TRA proposal, number one, it's just a proposal. I think even today, the DAT started to comment about some aspects of that, saying that they didn't support it. You can be sure we will rigorously oppose it along with the industry. I think there was unanimous support. What we really want to do is go back to where we were with the May 2009 export committee that put a series of recommendations forward about moving to a market orientation approach for spectrum. We want spectrum to be auctioned. We want spectrum to be able to be traded amongst operators. We want a fair playing ground in terms of fees and we want M&amp;A rules to be relaxed, so that you can get to efficient operators in what is a highly fragmented market at the moment.</p>
          <p>So our view is export committee did meet, did come out with a set of regulations &#x2013; recommendations that we thought were very positive and we want to get back to there. And in terms of 3G, there is a massive potential. Today if you look at the district headquarters, you've got about a 7% penetration of 3G handsets. You go to 10 years, we estimate that's going to be about 40%. So there's a lot of data opportunity. Data as a percent of revenue for India today is around 6% and we think we can drive that forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a corporate perspective, I need to make sure that capital allocation is efficient and can return &#x2013; I mean the cost of capital on marginal new investments. I mean what we paid is what we paid, which is why as you have seen for example in Andy's' chart, India's total CapEx have come down. So the strategy going forward is to make sure, and I think Nick and the local team have done a very good job knowing that in theory they had a kind of a wider and there are very strict criteria so every, whatever it is, three to six months depending, we just go through it and actually we have de-prioritized certain investments just simply because in certain rural areas at the today GDP levels, we cannot justify deploying the capital. Hence, we have saved hundreds of million of pounds.</p>
          <p>How we tackle the opportunity? Well more sharing, more Indus Towers, more commercial agreements potentially with other operators in order to reduce the I-element of the ROIs, since they are you know due to price reasons harder. So at the corporate level, I have to manage the capital, at the country level he has to manage the commercial operations. I think so far we're doing a pretty good job.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I know, yes. So it's &#x2013; Verizon has always got an enterprise &#x2013; an international enterprise presence, which they change over time in different areas. We actually cooperate with them on international bids. Sometimes we cooperate with BT, sometimes we cooperate with them, sometimes we cooperate, again going back to the earlier question on broader context of course ,we have to do these things with others, but it is not out of Verizon Wireless.</p>

But to be clear, we have assumed that there is still further discussions going on the 2G front. We have not included that in our thinking.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Paul Howard at JPMorgan-Cazenove. A couple of questions. Firstly on margins, clearly the trends are expected to be better this year, is this the lowest year of margin decline or perhaps you can say sort of what's the revenue growth you need to keep margins stable?</p>
          <p>And then secondly turning to the portfolio, there is clearly a hidden value outside Verizon Wireless as well, can this be a focus for the coming year in terms of realizing some of that value? Perhaps you can just update us on Softbank and when you can receive some of that deferred consideration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me take the second part of the question and then Andy can comment the first. It's a bit the same thing as my earlier answer on CapEx. I am, from a corporate perspective, very focused on making sure and the Board is very focused on making sure that we have the right mix of assets. So we regularly look at our assets and we have three priority areas; Europe, South Africa and India. And this is where we are going to deploy money if the conditions are right, that does not mean that we will deploy money at any cost, because we have looked at certain things that we found overpriced and we just decided not to do them.</p>
          <p>Now outside of that we will look at basically alternatives that we have. That does not mean that we are rushing into any not very well thought process, but again, we have to be given the dividend targets that we have and the cash flow generation, if we want to invest more in the three priority areas we will have to look at some disposals. So this is the way I think.</p>
          <p>You want to say something about the margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the margin in a fairly fixed cost business, clearly is heavily influenced by what we can do with the top line. And we are seeing a gradual improvement as we've talked about and hence why we've said that we do aim for this year to have a significantly lower rate of margin decline. I think if and when we can get back to a sort of neutral position on margin, is going to be very dependant upon the economic outlook and how we ride with that. We have a couple of things that work against us on margin, the move to fix within the business obviously is a lower margin activity. The effect of termination rate cuts actually impacts margin adversely, just mathematically. But I think over a two or three year period, it will be all about what happens with the general economies and what happens with the overall revenue trends that come off the back of them.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Morten Singleton of Collins Stewart. Two questions if I may. First off, can you give us some comfort that if the bidding in the auctions for 3G spectrum in India do go beyond the rather aggressive levels they are already at, there does come at point where you might take a view that it's just better to let the rest of the operators in market go ahead, have a blood bath and pick up some cheaper assets when M&amp;A is allowed a little bit later?</p>
          <p>And the second question just concerns your approach to investments in fixed line infrastructure and we've seen the announcement on Italy. I just wonder what proportion of the &#x2013; I think it's about &#x20AC;8.5 billion, Vodafone will be investing in that particular asset if that investment goes ahead? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The first answer is the easy one because I will not make any comment on an auction which is ongoing because everything could be interpreted as signaling, so I am afraid we have to wait for the next meeting. On the Italian thing, you have to put it into the context, today we invest about 15% of our CapEx into fixed broadband of our European level it's 450 million, I think I said in my presentation. Italy is a special case because that would not be a full Vodafone &#x2013; assume that this goes ahead, that would not be a full Vodafone thing to be really an industry-wide consortium with potentially also financial investors. So we are not talking about a for Vodafone Group major investment, quite frankly. We see that more of a country project that we can be contributors to in a country where we make very good money, where we have a very good position and a very good opportunity in growth in fixed. But we are talking about over a period of time, a few hundreds of million, not more, spread over a period of time. So -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Couple of questions, please. Is there anything you can say about the assumption you've made on Verizon Wireless associate income, revenue trend, margin trend for March '11? It's obviously becoming an increasing driver of profit and I guess the U.S. outlook is becoming a bit more uncertain. Secondly, MTRs, obviously it's really more a March 12 thing for Vodafone that the glide path is steepening, just wondering what your thoughts were at the moment, just to what steeper glide path meant for pricing for mobile pricing? Do you move to a flat rate and what does that all mean? Finally, there seems you have big mix change in the smartphone mix in March '10. ASPs on smartphones are coming down potentially a bit faster now. Does that mean you can cut blended sack in March '11 despite an increasing iPhone mix? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, unhelpfully, I am not going to provide what the detail on an individual business not least because we aren't doing that on our other businesses and secondly, because Verizon themselves don't do that with Verizon Wireless. And so we are taking the recent trends obviously. We get a slight benefit in terms of our contribution because if the debt levels ever reduce, then the financing cost which is part of the profit contribution actually moves in a positive direction for us. So directionally, I think recent trends plus some benefits from net income on that front is what you should read into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But other point on MTRs and maybe Michel, you talk about since it's more of a European thing, smartphones. I think we are embracing ourselves for a decline in MTRs over the long-term. They will clearly go down. The whole industry will basically reset I think in the direction of having very low MTRs potentially cross net becoming the norm. As always with these things, it's the glype path which is important and they need to just adjust offers to glype path which is why we support and we have always been supporting also in Europe certain managed glype path, but not sudden drops. So can I think of MTRs going to the $0.03 range, then eventually going below and then eventually potentially go to a more kind of billing keep up over the long-term. Yes, the issue is having it in a phased way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The smartphone is always is clearly is a fitter in Europe, Vittorio said earlier on that is 11% of our base which is smartphones today, we have sold an average 25% of our sales were smartphone this year. The exit rate was 30% and let's say we should for an averaging between 30 and 40% probably &#x2013; more towards 40% in next year that of course unlock data revenue. So what we're also monitoring very carefully is the attachment rate in terms of data packages that we get with those smartphones because that's the interest there. We will see two phenomenas in next year one which is that of course the smartphones cost is going to decrease. So which means that we will be able to push that into data, so which means that the level of in our device should reduce, but the volume will increase and will add a catch-up in like the beginning of next year around the iPhone. As you know we've introduced iPhone in the some countries this year and probably will introduce iPhone in the remaining countries in the next coming months. So we'll have these mixed effects of more volume, price going down so enabling down for the smartphone category as a whole but we will push the first apps on iPhone in order to just to catch up what we were not able to do previously.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. It's Robin Bienenstock from Bernstein. Two questions, if I may. The first, you mentioned disposals, it's obviously not a sellers market right now, unless you happen to own Brazilian assets but apart from cleaning up minorities, can you say anything about your principles when you think about what structure the group should be say three years from now on a longer term basis?</p>
          <p>My second question is really German specific and it's &#x2013; if I look at your cost saving wheel on page 12, Germany looks like it's been punching pretty seriously under it's weight in terms of contribution to those cost savings. Can you really start delivering that on that next year especially in light of what looks like an increasingly vulnerable Arcor, given cable and fiber squeeze from both sides? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; I'll take the first question and a piece of the second and then Michel will conclude. The &#x2013; you're absolutely right. This is not the best time for disposing assets, but I think that the shape of the group is basically the right one. Today, what we have, we have more integrated Europe, which is managed not as a single thing because it's not, but in a more integrated way with horizontal platforms run by Steve Pusey, which is why we can have network efficiencies, purchasing efficiency 4, 5% better prices than our competitors from external benchmark, not internal data and that's one piece.</p>
          <p>Then the second piece, which is the piece that Nick handles. It's the places where we have joint ventures, partners kind of more shared type of ownership, clearly India is the core of this and India will be the core of that because it's the area where we have &#x2013; we see the long-term potential. And then there is the third leg which is Morten's piece and it's the countries which happen to be more in the same time zones, almost by coincidence where you can run basically Central Europe, the East &#x2013; former Eastern Europe as more of a consistent thing, but then you have South Africa that itself is one platform and then we have Turkey.</p>
          <p>So, do I see, I can see changes across the different pieces, but at the end of the day we have one integrated model and then we have countries which are managed more in terms of in-market performance plus benefits coming from purchasing, and coming from other things. This is I think consistent, incidentally it's also delivering because if you look at the competitive performance that we have in most markets taking out for a second the iPhone effect in Europe, is pretty good.</p>
          <p>Now, Germany, Germany, I think you're right. I think we could do more in cost and I think that's what exactly what I said in my presentation. This year was the final year of integration of Arcor and Vodafone, so we had to put together the two companies, which is a kind of complex process to get to. And I think I said very clearly this is the year where we are going to push with the efficiency in the merged entity, which was not there 12 month ago.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe a few words. First you said increasingly weakness of Arcor-Vodafone in the fixed business, so which is not what I see -</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, why you have the weakness, so in the fixed business we're doing quite well. I guess that the focus this year was really to make the integration and so, which has been achieved. Meanwhile we know that we were not extracting all the cost that we should have extracted, but we decided nevertheless to invest in commercials in order to let's say keep growing and to renew with growth, what you've seen in the past two quarters, so which means that we have deteriorated our margins by two points, by doing that so &#x2013; we're investing and at the same stage not being able to take out all the cost that should be taken out. That's clear that the focus for the year to come is to decrease our cost structure so there is plans which are really now underway, which are mainly focused on technologies where we have different things around field maintenance, transmissions, energy where we have the highest cost in Europe. So there are plans that we have designs with Steve and the management team in order to, let's say take out costs, that's also the case in the support functions, now that we have this, let's say, merger between the two committees and also in sales and customer care. So you can expect a strong cost reduction in Germany in the year to come, coherent with what was now that as in the U.K.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But I'll give it a go. The &#x2013; I wondered on, the first part of my question would be on India's margin outlook sort of I have two halves of the year to look back on with very different margins and the trend there which is different to your competitors generally I think. I wondered how you felt about India's margins next year and thereafter. And the second question is a little bit ripe for you but is there any greater prospects now or in the next couple of years of being able to buy out the minority in Vodafone Italy and would that make you think any differently about your dividend targets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the same question. Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just in terms of the margin, yes, the second half of the year was a pretty strong, margin uplift year-over-year and over the first half. There were some reconciliations we did between Indus that meant some of that uplift was related to the first half so the gap is not quite as large as that. But generally we have an upward trend and that is against the rest of the industry, they are on a downward trend. So I think generally a good performance. We've said all along that we invested in Spacetel and Spacetel will start to deliver. Great news is that Spacetel in terms of customer share is already up to 7% and we are taking 16% of the net adds in Spacetel. So basically we got good commercial performance in Spacetel that starting to contribute and we've got a very aggressive cost program, cost reduction is not in just Europe to make sure that we improve margins.</p>
          <p>Now I say all of that's positive trajectory and then we have regulation and then we have pricing. So those are the 2 unknowns which give transparency into next year a little bit difficult, but we still feel committed to move towards higher 20s margins over the sort of medium term 5-year horizon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the second question is really an interesting question because we don't feel a lot pressure to buy out the Italian minority and quite frankly it's linked to the broader relationship with Verizon. So it's a bit likely to previous question. No news and we just are good partners and we keep working together.</p>
          <p>Do you mind if I go, yes, we will come back there later.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Karen Egan from RBS. If I could ask a few specific questions about your free cash flow guidance. One is related to this years free cash flow numbers whether you could quantify the one-off elements you mentioned the potential un-sustainability of the working capital but there are a couple of other one-off items in there. And whether you expect any one-off items in free cash flow this year? The second part of that is in terms of your CapEx guidance, flat essentially year-on-year. Is that related to the 6.2 billion in constant currency terms or is to the just under 6 billion in absolute terms? And finally, your some of your guidance doesn't obviously include spectrum spend. Does your free cash flow guidance include the higher interest charges from CapEx spend and the <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. So free cash flow for last year one-off items or sort of non-recurring I guess the primary two would be &#x2013; we've got 0.2 billion of Verizon Wireless dividend received in last year which other things being equal, would have come in the prior year. And the working capital was in year about 0.7 effect. Now as ever within various lines tax and so on, there are always humps and bumps sort of in there, but I would probably call those two out.</p>
          <p>Implicit in the guidance for this year that we are now in the excess of 6.5 is by definition that we won't have a recurrence of the extra dividend coming in from Verizon Wireless. And secondly that we will get some benefit from working capital but at a lower rate than we did last year. There is a limit of how much we can squeeze out of the working capital. The CapEx guidance is on a constant currency basis so we are saying adjust out for currency differences around the same level this year as last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for this year's level, are you using 6.2 or 6? So this year's CapEx number was 6.2 using your currency numbers and I think you posted in your cash flow statement just under 6 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we will. It is whatever currency, sorry, it will normalize. So the two will be the same, if you &#x2013; it depends which currency rates you are using, whether you are comparing actual out turn with our guidance rate for next year which is what the right way to look at that.</p>
          <p>Let's pick up &#x2013; on the point one, because I'm not sure on the rounding. Does the &#x2013; the free cash flow, you are correct, excludes the cost of spectrum. The free cash flow is not implicitly taking into account the interest cost on the cost to this spectrum, but given &#x2013; I won't comment on the spectrum amount, but given our low interest rates that would not be particularly significant.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs. Just a quick question from Michel, just clarifying your comments earlier, when do you expect to get the iPhone in the markets where you don't currently, to Germany, Spain, Netherlands I guess principally. And then in terms of the cost of that, I guess the thing that would make the most difference would be to have significant competition with Apple. So what's the outlook you see for greater price competition in the high-end of the smartphone segment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of schedule you should probably ask Apple rather than us but it's in the next coming months that we should see the iPhone coming in Spain and in Germany so that's I would say really now eminent. So that would be my first answer.</p>
          <p>Second, as far as iPhone is concerned what we have seen is that at least in the sales that have been achieved in the U.K. that's mainly a retention to meaning that it has mainly been focused on our existing customers, uplift of our customers so that's probably 75 or 80% of our sales. So that what is driving replacement of the iPhone right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in general I have to say I feel much better now than two years ago. Because now you walk in any shop and you have much wider choice &#x2013; wider choice of nice, well working, good kind of things that even I can use with pleasure than two years ago. So there is more choice. More choice means more competition, more competition means in general better economy. So I am reassured by what I see in the pipeline and in the shops.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Emmet Kelly at Merrill Lynch. I just have two quick questions, please. Firstly, just coming back to portfolio management and disposals, could you just run through your thought process on continuing to own a stake in China Mobile and just wondering how you view that especially in light of the big spectrum bills that you are facing in India and also potentially in the future in Europe as well. It just seems that there mightn't be much of the strategic rationale for owning that stake going forward and the sale of the stake potentially plug the spectrum bill?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the Italian wireless market, obviously you've had a fantastic year in Italy especially on the EBITDA margin side, and obviously some of this is linked to that fact that Italy is a predominately a prepaid market and handset subsidies aren't very high in Italy, however as we go into a smartphone environment in Italy it seems the entry point into the smartphone for our customers is quite high, I am just wondering can you see perhaps Italy swinging from being potentially from being a prepaid market into being more of a postpaid market, and whether there is a potential impact on subsidies and margins there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me go in reverse order. On Italy quite frankly, yeah, I think we are at what 7% maybe, something in that space, more or less maybe to go up a bit, but not in a major way keeping &#x2013; I am pretty confident that Italians spend on good things.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day &#x2013; At the end of the day, no, but I'm serious, you know. Culturally you prefer to spend on things and have a low commitment and spend very little on price. If I look at our price per minute in Italy, or price per SMS by the way, in Italy they are fairly low. So you spend more on the device upfront and then you spend less on the monthly thing. So if that thing that you described happens, I would assume that there would be a rebalancing, so there will be maybe a lower entry cost, but then higher up, which by the way not very high in Italy when I compare it to the Netherlands, when I compare it to Spain. I mean Italy and Spain have a big differential in ARPU. So that &#x2013; and of course they have a big differential in A&amp;R. So eventually I think it will work.</p>
          <p>The China Mobile question, we always look at, with Nick and with the board, at all assets, so not just China Mobile asking ourself do we have to keep, shall we go with this, the cost of regret of keeping and what is the opportunity. For the time being we are still happy to work with our China Mobile colleagues on the areas of cooperation which tend to focus now a lot on services applications, operating system, so the whole discussion that Tim was raising on smartphones and how we can make sure that there is a broad choice. They are putting a lot of resources on android plus which is the kind of Chinese version of android. We work together on JLL, the company is very good, delivering stock price has done well from our acquisition. So we are very open-minded, so the line of thought that you indicated is present, but for the time being we feel that it's okay to say that, but we continuously review what we can do more with them and we are very open and the board looks regularly at not just that asset but all assets. Yes. I promised I would go to the back. Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Will Draper, Execution Noble. Just coming back to dividends and particularly with Verizon Wireless, does your dividend guidance at just over 10p in three years assume anything from Verizon or not? And in the event that there was dividend from Verizon Wireless is it &#x2013; should we assume that that would be paid through as a dividend to Vodafone shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not assume any change in the current conditions and that day I think we'll have a very interesting and very positive discussion with our board on what to do. So no, the answer is we are projecting &#x2013; our whole strategy has been let's put the company in the best position in terms of generating good cash flow and let's have a goal to return more than what we said 18 month ago to our shareholders, but we are not factoring any change into the Verizon Wireless situation for this period supporting the commitment.

          <p>Thank you. Gary Slade from Capital World Investors. Two questions, first for Andy on the underlying net financing cost of 897, can you please break that down to what is regular interest on the SR put and interest income from the South Bank convert or warrant? And then the second on Egypt, there were reports that Telecom Egypt said they might want to build their own wireless network, if you could comment about that and does that mean that you would buy-in the minority interest in that country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the &#x2013; those items you referred to, have been separated out and are not included in those numbers. We've just dealt with underlying income, sorry, expense range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on Egypt, I think, you are referring to the rumors around the fourth license potentially. I mean, I met the Minister not long ago, I want to say two months ago, and I asked him in terms of &#x2013; is that an active consideration and his perspective was it's an option that could be done. At no point has anyone discussed whether is something they want to do. So it's all related just at a flat window that is due to come off in this September/October time this year that people are speculating on it and obviously TER adding into that speculation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got the mic already. James Britton from Nomura. First, question for Andy, is your tax department anticipating any change in the U.K. corporate tax rate? And can you just remind us of the sensitivity and to the group effective rate &#x2013; or the &#x2013; of any change in the U.K. rate? And secondly, a question for Nick on Indus Towers. Are there any strategic benefits affected by listing of that entity and are the partners considering a listing in any case, just to showcase around what the volume of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So I guess the answer is let's wait for this upcoming budget and see the answer to the question. We have not at the heart of this, assumed any fundamental change clearly in the medium-term not so much the core tax rate, but the approach of this country to the overseas profit taxation is something which is in discussion and frankly a change in the core tax rate, I think group level, would have not the consequential different impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On Indus Towers maybe, Nick, you can say something what I can tell you is we had Phase I, which was the creation of Indus, we have Phase II where we are now which is the exploitment of the assets and the increase of tenancies anything else and then there will be the Phase III that once we have reached the critical mass efficiency at the right EBITDA levels, together with the other partners we have to discuss what to do.</p>
          <p>You want to kind of -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean just to build on that, this year was all-around improving the operational performance so when we end to the year, we were really in start-up mode, we weren't really running correctly as a business. We have changed out the management team, the CEO, top team, and basically this year has been about gaining traction on operating performance. Very happy with how we are exiting this year and it just means that we are scalable going forward, so we have got some big goals for next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I would say we probably got about another six to nine months of operational improvements. We've got to get to the point where systems, processes, leadership bandwidth, is scalable enough across the whole business and we're nearly there, but we just got a little way to go before I think we are at peak performance and the margins at the right level.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And keep in mind that we are in a joint venture. So we have to discuss <mark type="inaudible" />. I think we have what, 4 more minutes left? So I would like to go back there as I promised. And then I will &#x2013; there was a hand but I &#x2013; it's &#x2013; now it's gone. No, it's still there. Yeah, yeah, right in front of the mic.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Gareth Jenkins from UBS. A couple, if I could. Just wanted to, following-on the Indus question, whether that's actually made you question whether you should actually own any network in any country, whether you feel that network differentiation becomes more important again with mobile data.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, when you talked about profitability on mobile data you said you're talking very much about ARPU and EBIT margins and/or EBITDA margins. I just wonder whether with the fully-loaded CapEx and the HSPA plus cost, whether it's still profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fully-loaded, sorry &#x2013; I &#x2013; if I said that I was not &#x2013; but I don't think I said it but if I said it, it was not correct. Fully-loaded which is why I made the distinction between dongles and smartphones, because smartphones have a high P&amp;L charge at the A&amp;R level but then they use couple of 100 meg per month. While if you look at profitability of dongles, it looks beautiful until you are &#x2013; actually really beautiful, you are at EBITDA level. And then you have 1.5, 1.6 gig per month which of course you have to charge back in terms of network utilization. So the statement that I made was valid for fully-loaded cash profitability, which of course is what we track on a monthly basis, because that's the right metric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one point I'd make about Indus and the telecom, yeah India is a little bit of a unique situation and the main reason it's unique is because there was a lot of new build. So when there is new build coming together with other players and deciding into go into new territory just with one tower to cover all the requirements of the operators has a lot of advantages. So it does vary market-to-market in terms of the sheer size of benefit you can extract.</p>

          <p>But let me tell you whom are we partnering with on the network side, the best long-term players in every market, so it's Bharti in India, it's O2 in the U.K., it's Telecom Italia in Italy. So when we partner, we partner really with intent of managing our CapEx and our return on investment in an efficient way, but not giving it away, giving it away, in advantage to players that are not there in the long-term. So it's more of an efficiency thing and keep in mind that most of the time is passive network sharing. It will become in my view more and more or so active network sharing in rural areas, but the real competitive advantage that you see is when the network is thick, which is more the urban areas, the big data areas and that's where we retain control. So it's a financially sensible strategy, but doesn't give away any commercial advantage. Yes, I think, I saw there was another one who'd been waiting. Yes, sir.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Maurice Patrick from Barclays Capital. I'm just curious to what extent you factored in increased austerity packages in your outlook for revenues and operating profit clearly an increasing theme right now and how you'll mitigate those kind of increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the. quite frankly. the way we factor in austerity packages is to think that prices will continue to go down. It's the simplest thing. And if you think about it austerity will create some kind of household sensitivity on spending and therefore, the strategy that we put together which we call customer value enhancement or internally we call it much more for more. We started this right after the big crisis and again it was not a big intuition. Intuition was we need to continue to lower prices and give more value to the families, because eventually they will be under stress and 18 month later here we are. So we are factoring, last quarter, Andy has shown, minus 11 percentage per minute in Europe, previous quarter minus 11%, previous quarter minus 10%. We just think we have to be competitive on prices. This is the best way of factoring in austerity-type of environment in the places where we need. Now -</p>

          <p>No this would Czech, Hungary, Romania, Turkey has been having currency effects and GDP effects, significant MTR effect, I mean they felt pretty austere last year already. But we have cut costs between 5 and 10%, maintained market share, we have high profit in those markets, so I think we have learned to live with a lot of bad news around us and coping with this, in general.</p>

          <p>Everything bad happened at the same time, but we have maintained above 40% EBITDA in an extreme environment, but the price has dropped 40%, then currency dropped significantly, GDP dropped significantly and so on and so on. So I think we have learned to cope with tough environments.</p>

          <p>No need to apologize, it's Stephen Howard here at HSBC. Two questions, one just following up on Gareth's question, I think we could do with a bit more detail about the situation in Egypt. That's pretty strange, you've got a partner there who seems to be threatening to build their own infrastructure. And I mean I'm just wondering what your tactics are. Are you going to try and persuade them to go to an MVNO route with you? I mean is there a compromise here that can be sorted out? And secondly, bigger picture conceptually, I was just wondering how you would respond if for instance someone like Google or Apple were to approach you and asked to buy, I don't know 10, 20 million contracts.</p>

          <p>Theoretical case. On the Egypt thing, in general we never, Stephen we never comment on specific departments discussions. I don't think it would be fair and I don't think it's particularly practically useful publicly. So we have a very good relationship with Telecom Egypt. We have a very good relationship with the government. We discuss and clearly if you know like in any good partnership, if diversions of interests arises, we will discuss how to sort it out. What I can tell you is it is very positive friendly, mutually kind of win-win type of situation. So I don't see honestly problems arising out of Egypt, at least I cannot foresee issues. But I would not like to comment specific discussions with a specific partner. I mean I don't think it's fair and I don't think you expect me to do it.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Great. I mean yes, clearly they are in a challenging position at the moment and they're keen to talk to us in a whole host of commercial opportunities and we are engaged with them. So we have a very good relationship with them.</p>

          <p>The Google Apple thing, I mean this is at the end of the day it has always been the case. I mean it might be in waves but again I have been in this industry for almost, what, 15 years. You always have the issue of commitment, you always have the issue of exclusivity versus the commitment, you always have the issue of flexibility of commitment. We are happy to deal with every type of thing. The reason why I was that precise in the giving the answer to the earlier question on the profitability of smartphones is because we track these things now in a very, very detailed way, and so we know exactly what are the boundaries of the economics and then we can handle deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that what is important that Vittorio referred to earlier on is the fact that really now there is competition in that space. So we have more or less commoditized the smartphone arena so meaning that the customers can jump from one device to the other device. So what is important now is really to provide differentiated services from the operator in order that the customer is really a customer of the operator, rather than a customer of the device. And when you have Apple, Google, BlackBerry, now with HP which has bought Palm and you have Nokia, you have Microsoft coming back, I guess, that's good new for us. Because that means that there will be plenty of choices and that's up to us to really provide a differentiated experience to the customers whatever the device they are taking. So that's completely different than the world which we were facing two years ago, that's a world where there are plenty of choice for the customers and so we can really have a roll with best network, with the best distribution, with the best customer care, with the best services, with the best tariffs and that's what we intend to play.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. This is Steve Malcolm from Evolution. I will go for two, please. First on dividend, I guess, your sterling dividend payer and most of your cash flows are in euros. Operationally things have got a little bit better but arguably exchange rate outlook has got a bit worse which is saying something given we're in the U.K. Can you just give us an idea of the discussions the board had about the outlook for the year and what resilience that dividend has to a sort of continually weakening euro going forward, let's say, 1 through 120 or 125? And secondly you made a comment on the efficiency of your data network saying, I think, you have 7 of the 10 most efficient. Can you just sort of tell us how measure that and how you sort of show the benefits and &#x2013; I'm not seeing it in cheaper prices you may refute that or should we just &#x2013; shareholders that, your shareholders are getting better margins on data traffic than other operators can provide? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. So the FX on the dividend clearly you are absolutely right. We have the majority of our cash flows are earned in euros. Our dividend commitment is in sterling. There is a natural sort of mismatch between the two of those. We have obviously looked at various scenarios, particularly on the three year basis, before making the commitment that we have made the target that we've given on the three year dividend. We have said in there, that that is on the assumption that we do not see the euro-sterling FX rate moving outside of the 1.15 boundary by more than plus or minus 10%. We'd have another look at it at that stage, but other than that the work we have done suggested we can tolerate within those margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. On the nature question I think, this is great opportunity for Steve Pusey.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We measure independent &#x2013; excuse me one sec &#x2013; we measure independently with A.T. Kearney which is a very good proxy where most of our competitors submit industry data. They measure annually about 70 networks there independently with a broad range of emerging markets as well as mature markets so we do truly get an independent reflection of how your networks are performing. And we are very proud of our benchmarking against that on particularly the cost-to-carry data through the infrastructure, which is highly regarded as tomorrow's measure and proxy of the efficiency of your network, given that most of the traffic is migrating towards data. I would hope that that's reflected in the results we had and also the reinvestments where we use those efficiencies back to the performance for our individual customers in each country, we are very proud of the response to the networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And again the trade off between lower prices and more profitability is again a market-by-market thing. No market we are at a disadvantage, we don't want to be more expensive than the good quality providers but we see already the distance between the good quality providers and the less good quality providers actually widening, which going forward is why we are committed to CapEx and why it's important that we have purchasing efficiency and homogeneous platforms across the footprint.</p>
