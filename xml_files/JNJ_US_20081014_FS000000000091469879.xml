      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome. I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2008. Joining me on the podium today are Chris Poon, Vice Chairman, Board of Directors and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals Group; Paul Stoffels, Company Group Chairman, Global Research and Development, Pharmaceuticals Group; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today in the audience is Sheri McCoy, Worldwide Chairman, Surgical Care Group. As we announced last week, effective January 1, 2009 Sheri will assume the role of Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals Group.</p>
          <p>A few logistics before we get into the details. The audio and visuals from these presentations are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the third quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide additional commentary on the results for the quarter and guidance for the year. Chris and Paul will then provide an update on our pharmaceuticals business. We will then open the floor to your questions. We will conclude our formal presentation at approximately 9:30. And following Q&amp;A with some final remarks by Dominic, we'll conclude the meeting around 10 AM.</p>
          <p>Distributed with the copy of the press release that you just received is a schedule with actual revenues for major products and/or business franchises. For the listening audience, these are available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website as is the copy of the press release.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2007 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.</p>
          <p>The Pharmaceutical group presentation contains statements about New Molecular Entities or NMEs and other medicines or line extensions in various stages of development. These presentations are based on the company's current knowledge of the status of development of these NMEs, medicines, and line extensions, and are subject to the challenges and difficulties inherent in product development.</p>
          <p>Not every compound highlighted today will make it to the market. In Biopharmaceuticals, there are higher possibilities of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information our future developments.</p>
          <p>Last item, during the call non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to the ongoing business performance. These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2008. If you refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Segment of Business. Worldwide sales to customers were $15.9 billion for the third quarter of 2008, up 6.4% as compared to the third quarter of 2007. Our operational growth was 3.3%, and currency added 3.1 points.</p>
          <p>If you turn to the schedule showing sales by geographic area, you will see that we achieved growth of 0.4% in the U.S. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 6.5%, while the effect of currency exchange rates positively impacted our reported results by 6.6 points. Our strongest-performing region was the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., which grew 15.3% on an operational basis. The Asia Pacific-Africa region grew by 11.3% operationally, while Europe grew 1% operationally.</p>
          <p>If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings on a reported basis were $3.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.17. This compares to $2.5 billion and $0.88 in the same period in 2007. Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, where we have provided adjusted earnings information. As referenced in the footnote, third quarter 2007 results were adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of the costs associated with the restructuring program of $528 million. There were no adjustments to the 2008 results in the quarter. Net earnings on an adjusted basis and earnings per share were up 7.6% and 10.4% respectively versus the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to the adjusted earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. Cost of goods sold at 30% was up 150 basis points versus the same period in 2007. Approximately half of the increase is due to changing mix within our businesses, while the remaining half is due to additional costs incurred in our manufacturing operation.</p>
          <p>Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses at 32.6% of sales were down 10 basis points versus last year. Cost containment efforts more than offset the impact of the change in mix of our business, driven by the strong growth of the Consumer business.</p>
          <p>Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 11.7%, 60 basis points less than the third quarter of 2007, due to a combination of the change of mix of businesses and the timing of expenditures.</p>
          <p>Interest expense net of interest income of $25 million compares to $52 million of net interest income in the third quarter of 2007. This increase in expense was due to a higher average debt position in the quarter versus the same period last year, as we continue buying back shares as part of our repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Other income net of other expense was $224 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $2 million of net other expense in the same period last year. As discussed last quarter, we received a settlement payment from Amgen for $200 million, which is reflected in this account.</p>
          <p>With regard to taxes, please direct your attention to the effective tax rate excluding special charges shown in the boxed section of the schedule. Taxes were 22.8% in the third quarter of 2008 versus 23.3% in the third quarter of 2007. Dominic will provide more commentary on taxes in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Looking at year-to-date data, consolidated sales to customers for the nine months of 2008 were $48.6 billion, an increase of 7.6% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, operational growth was 3%, and currency had a positive impact of 4.6 points.</p>
          <p>On the consolidated statement of year-to-date earnings, I'd first like to draw your attention to the boxed section. In both 2008 and 2007, charges for in-process research and development have been excluded. Additionally in 2007, the costs associated with the restructuring program have been excluded. With these adjustments, net earnings for the nine months of 2008 were $10.3 billion or $3.61 per share, up 7.7% and 10.4% respectively as compared to the same period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to business segment highlights, I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $4.1 billion increased 13.1% as compared to the third quarter of 2007. Operational growth was 9.4%, while currency added 3.7 points. U.S. sales were up 11.2% while international sales grew 8.1% on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter of 2008, sales for the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 11% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2007. Sales in the U.S. were up 19% while sales outside the U.S. were up 3% operationally. The successful U.S. launch this year of ZYRTEC was a major contributor to this increase.</p>
          <p>Our Skin Care business achieved operational sales growth of 12% in the third quarter of 2008, with sales in the U.S. growing at 15% and sales outside the U.S. up 10% on an operational basis. Strong growth was driven by NEUTROGENA, CLEAN &amp; CLEAR, AVEENO and Johnson's Adult, due to a combination of new product launches and strength in the core businesses. Also contributing to the strong growth in the quarter were the newly acquired products from Dabao, the leading moisturizer in China.</p>
          <p>Baby Care products achieved operational growth of 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2007. Sales in the U.S. grew by 1%, with some softness in category growth. Strong growth across most product lines resulted in an operational increase in sales outside the U.S. of 12%.</p>
          <p>Women's Health achieved operational growth of 6%. Sales in the U.S. were up 10% due to the successful launch of the new products in our K-Y line. Sales outside the U.S. were up on an operational basis by 3%.</p>
          <p>Operational sales growth in the Oral Care franchise was 7%, with U.S. sales down 3%. A significant new product launch in the third quarter of 2007 impacted the U.S. growth comparisons for the quarter. Sales outside the U.S. increased 18% operationally, driven by very strong growth for LISTERINE across the major regions.</p>
          <p>That completes our review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide net sales for the third quarter of $6.1 billion were up 0.2% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales were down 2.5% with positive currency adding 2.7 points. Sales in the U.S. decreased 6%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 3.3%.</p>
          <p>Our results continued to be impacted by generic competition on some of our products, namely DURAGESIC and RISPERDAL Oral. The combined effect of this generic competition has reduced the third quarter worldwide Pharmaceutical operational growth rate by approximately 11 points, with the U.S. impact estimated at 13.5% and the impact outside the U.S. estimated at nearly 8%.</p>
          <p>As we have previously reported, we saw a continued retraction in the U.S. market for erythropoietin stimulating agents or ESAs. This retraction has impacted the overall pharmaceutical growth rate by approximately 2 points. Additionally in the third quarter, sales results outside the U.S. were favorably impacted by a reduction to a reserve for sales of approximately $135 million related to CONCERTA. The majority of the reserve has been recorded as a reduction to sales in prior years. Excluding the negative impact of generics and the lower sales of PROCRIT and the positive impact of the reserve reduction, the underlying operational sales growth was estimated at 8%.</p>
          <p>Now reviewing the major products, both PROCRIT and EPREX declined operationally by 12% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. New competition and softening of the market due to ongoing label reviews have contributed to the lower sales results for EPREX. PROCRIT results have been impacted by a decline in the market versus the third quarter of 2007 estimated at 18%, partially offset by an increase in overall market share. PROCRIT aggregate share across all markets was approximately 48% in the third quarter of 2008, up 3 points versus the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Sales of LEVAQUIN, our anti-infective, were down 10% on an operational basis when compared to the same period a year ago. The script volume in the market was down approximately 5% versus the third quarter of 2007, attributable to a lower incidence of respiratory illnesses. Market share was negatively impacted by generics in the category.</p>
          <p>RISPERDAL Oral had an operational decline of 63% when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Sales in the U.S. were down 77%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 38% operationally. With the patent expiration in the U.S. at the end of June this year, there are now generic competitors for RISPERDAL in most markets.</p>
          <p>ACIPHEX as it's known in the U.S. market and PARIET outside the U.S. market is a proton pump inhibitor or PPI that we co-market with Eisai. On an operational basis, sales were down 19%. U.S. sales were down 18% and the sales outside the U.S. were down 20% operationally. In the U.S., script share has been negatively impacted by additional generic launches in the PPI category. Similar market dynamics impacted sales outside the U.S., compounded by the impact that market entry in Canada of generic rabeprazole, the active ingredient in PARIET.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our growth drivers; REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, grew by 19% when compared to the third quarter of 2007. Sales growth in the U.S. was 20%. Market growth in the anti-TNF [anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor] category continued to be strong.</p>
          <p>Sales to our customers for markets outside the U.S. were up 16%. As we reported in the first quarter, there was a significant increase in sales outside the U.S. due to timing of shipments reflecting inventory planning on our customers' part. Both the second and the third quarter sales were impacted as the majority of the inventory build was depleted. Excluding the estimated change in inventory levels, sales outside the U.S. were more in line with estimated increase in demand of approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Sales of TOPAMAX, which is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis, increased operationally by 18%. Sales in the U.S. were up 22% while sales outside the U.S. were flat on an operational basis. In the U.S., market share in the migraine category increased versus the same period last year. Outside the U.S., strong growth was achieved in many markets, offset by generic entries in certain other markets.</p>
          <p>RISPERDAL CONSTA, our long-acting injectable formulation, achieved third quarter sales growth of 10% on an operational basis. U.S. sales growth was 6%, ahead of the estimated market growth. Sales outside the U.S. were up 12% operationally, with continued positive momentum in share.</p>
          <p>CONCERTA, a product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, grew 66% operationally in the third quarter as compared to same period last year. As mentioned, sales results outside the U.S. included a reduction to reserve for sales of approximately $135 million related to CONCERTA. Excluding this reserve, sales were up approximately 12% operationally, with sales in the U.S. up 7% and sales outside the U.S. up 28% operationally. In the U.S., continued solid market growth has been partially offset by lower market share. The approval earlier this year of the adult indication for CONCERTA will enable us to compete in the broader ADHD market.</p>
          <p>VELCADE, a treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma, is being co-developed with Millennium Pharmaceuticals. We have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales growth was 37%, with very strong results achieved across the region.</p>
          <p>Rounding up the review of the Pharmaceutical segment, a manufacturing supplement sNDA for IONSYS previously submitted to the FDA did not gain approval. We are continuing the evaluation of a next-generation system. Additionally in the quarter, the EU filing for INVEGA for bipolar mania was submitted.</p>
          <p>I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $5.7 billion grew 5.6% operationally as compared to the same period in 2007. Currency added 3.2 points to the sales growth to bring total growth to 8.8%. Sales in the U.S. grew 3.1%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 8%. Results have been impacted by lower sales of drug-eluting stents. Sales excluding the impact of lower sales of drug-eluting stents grew nearly 8% operationally.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the franchises, starting with Cordis; Cordis sales were down 10% operationally with the U.S. down 26% and sales outside U.S. up 4%. Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of CYPHER, a sirolimus-eluting stent, and endovascular products, partially offset by strong growth in our Biosense Webster business. CYPHER sales were approximately $290 million, down 26% on an operational basis versus the prior year. Sales in the U.S. of approximately $100 million were down 47%.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the third quarter of 2007, the U.S. drug-eluting stent market growth is estimated at 15%. Penetration rates are estimated at 70%, up from 63% a year ago, while PCI [Percutaneous Coronary Intervention] procedures are up approximately 8% in the quarter versus the same period last year. These gains have been partially offset by a reduction in price.</p>
          <p>Estimated share in the U.S. of 22% was down 15 points sequentially and down 22 points from the third quarter of 2007, due to the market entry of two new competitors in 2008. Sales outside the U.S. of approximately $190 million declined 6% operationally. The estimated market share in the quarter of 30% was flat on a sequential basis and down four points through the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S. CYPHER estimated worldwide share for the quarter was 27%, down 6 points sequentially and down 11 points from the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Endovascular sales declined due to a combination of a recall of a re-entry catheter and increased competition in multiple segments.</p>
          <p>Now turning to growth drivers; within the Cordis franchise, the Biosense Webster business, or electrophysiology business, achieved double-digit operational growth in the quarter, driven by increased system placements as well as growth in catheter products.</p>
          <p>Our DePuy franchise had operational growth of 8% when compared to the same period in 2007, with the U.S. growing 7% and the business outside the U.S. growing by 10% operationally. Hip growth on a worldwide basis was 12% operational, with strong growth in both the U.S. and international businesses. On an operational basis, worldwide knee growth was 4%, while spine grew 7%. Mitek, our sports medicine business, grew 12% operationally.</p>
          <p>Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 10% in the third quarter of 2008, with the U.S. sales growing 8% and sales outside the U.S. growing on an operational basis by 11%. The HARMONIC business achieved operational growth of nearly 20% due to the global success of recently launched products and the underlying strength of this platform.</p>
          <p>Also contributing to the growth in the quarter was the REALIZE gastric band, launched earlier this year in the U.S., and the strong performance of the endoscopy products in the international markets, driven by increased awareness of the benefits of minimally invasive procedures as well as the metabolic benefits of obesity surgery.</p>
          <p>Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 5% with similar results of both in and outside U.S. Solid growth in sutures and strong double digit growth in hemostasis and biosurgicals were the major contributors to growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The diabetes franchise grew operationally by 10% in the third quarter of 2008. The U.S. business grew by 9%, while sales outside the U.S. grew 12% on an operational basis. The success of the ONE TOUCH Ultra line has been the major contributor to growth. Additionally, the Animas business achieved operational growth of over 30%, driven by continued market share gains in the pump business.</p>
          <p>Our Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 9% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 10%. Sales outside the U.S. grew 8% on an operational basis. ACUVUE OASYS, 1-DAY ACUVUE MOIST, and the ACUVUE lenses for astigmatism were the major growth drivers in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Rounding up the review of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics achieved operational growth of 9% in the third quarter. Sales growth in the U.S. was 11%, while sales outside the U.S. were up 6% on an operational basis. Immunohematology and immunodiagnostics products achieved strong double digit results.</p>
          <p>That completes highlights for the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson &amp; Johnson's third quarter of 2008. I will now turn the discussion over to Dominic Caruso for some additional comments. Dominic?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louise, and good morning everyone. I'd like to add my own welcome to members of the investment community who have joined us here today and to those who are listening via the webcast and conference call. We are very pleased today to report solid financial results for the third quarter. Our performance once again demonstrates how we are successfully managing the business through some short-term business pressures, while continuing to advance our key growth initiatives. In the face of the recent financial market volatility, we remain confident in our ability to continue investing in the future growth of our business, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>Louise has already reviewed the segment results for you, so I will mention some financial updates, highlight a few of the recent business developments in the quarter, and discuss our financial guidance for the year, before handing things over for a more detailed pharmaceutical update.</p>
          <p>Our sales results for the quarter were above the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. We also delivered another strong earnings performance for the quarter, also above the mean of the analyst estimates published by First Call. We continue to implement the cost-restructuring program that we announced last year. And as I noted on our second quarter call, we are on track to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $1.6 billion for 2008, which is at the higher end of our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Now a brief update on our share repurchase program, this $10 billion share repurchase program, as you recall, began in August 2007. And as of the end of September, we have purchased approximately $7.4 billion of our stock. Our share repurchase program along with our dividends continue to illustrate our commitment to returning value to our shareowners while maintaining a strong financial position that provides the flexibility to invest in business building activities.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we continued to make investments and take actions to drive the future growth of our business. Chris and Paul will provide highlights for our pharma business, so I'll just mention some highlights for MD&amp;D and Consumer. In our Medical Devices and Diagnostic businesses, we saw strong performances across six of our seven franchises, driven by solid sales in our DePuy, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, and Ethicon Surgical businesses as well as the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic, Vision Care, and Diabetes Care businesses. With new competitors in the U.S. drug-eluting stent market, the Cordis business has seen a negative impact to sales of CYPHER, as we expected.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, progress in other parts of the Cordis business looks promising. The development of the NEVO sirolimus-eluting coronary stent is ongoing and the Biosense Webster business continues to grow at double digit rates.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer segment this quarter and as a part of our focus on emerging markets, we acquired Beijing Dabao Cosmetics, one of the most trusted skincare brands in China. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been doing business in China since 1985 and Dabao marks our first acquisition in this market. Our work with Dabao and its employees has already enhanced our knowledge of this critical marketplace, and we look forward to further developing this brand for the future.</p>
          <p>Our Consumer business continued to see strong results from our allergy treatment ZYRTEC, which first became available without a prescription in stores across the U.S. in January of this year. By the end of June, ZYRTEC had captured approximately 26% of the U.S. allergy market since its launch.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the integration of the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare business and brands continues to be on track to meet or exceed our target of 500 to $600 million of cost synergies by 2009, and we still expect this transaction to be breakeven or modestly accretive by 2009, one year ahead of the original schedule.</p>
          <p>I'd like to update you on where we are with a few brief items related to some recent activities. First, I'm pleased to inform you that Ethicon has now entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Professional Wound Care business to One Equity Partners. We have previously announced the receipt of One Equity's offer in July and have been working through the process since that time. The guidance that I will discuss today does not reflect any gain from the divestiture of this business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter pending satisfaction of all closing conditions.</p>
          <p>As this divestiture is in essence a decision to reshape our portfolio, we expect any gain from this sale to be largely offset by increased investment spending or other actions. This anticipated gain affords us an opportunity to make additional investments and to consider other business decisions to enhance our longer term performance and financial condition.</p>
          <p>We also received good news recently regarding longstanding patent litigation between our Cordis business and both Boston Scientific and Medtronic. On September 30, the U.S. District Court in Delaware entered a final judgment of about $1.2 billion, including accrued interest. It is too early to say when we will receive these payments given the possibility of appeals, but interest will continue to accrue until paid. As has been our practice, we will not record any gain from these judgments until the cash is received, and we expect to record such gains as special items, so any potential impact is not reflected in today's guidance.</p>
          <p>I would like to provide you some comments for you to consider as you refine your models. Let's start with a discussion of cash and debt as well as interest income and expense. During the third quarter of 2008, the company continued to generate strong cash flows. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $150 million of net cash. This consists of approximately $14.8 billion of cash and investments and $14.6 billion of debt. This was an increase of approximately $400 million in our overall net cash position from year end 2007. This reflects our strong operating cash flow and the use of approximately $3.8 billion to repurchase our stock so far this year.</p>
          <p>Given the recent developments in the financial markets, I'd like to share with you some important points about Johnson &amp; Johnson. In our corporate investment portfolio, we had no exposure to subprime market or the financial services companies that have failed as a result of the recent credit crisis. We continue to have ready access to the commercial paper market at attractive rates.</p>
          <p>At the end of September, we renewed our expiring 364-day credit facility for $6.3 billion, and signed a new five-year credit facility for $1.4 billion to replace an existing one, both of which had AAA credit ratings affirmed. These facilities are part of our continuous effort to maintain our financial strength and flexibility.</p>
          <p>Now regarding interest income and expense for purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions and considering the continuation but not full completion of the share repurchase program during 2008, I would suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between 50 and $100 million of net interest expense, consistent with our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to other income and expense; as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses resulting from such items as litigation, gains or losses from investments by our development corporation, or asset sales. The gain associated with the Amgen settlement is recorded in this account. And assuming no other major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend you consider modeling other income and expense for 2008 as a net gain ranging from approximately $350 million to $400 million. This is higher than our previous guidance, but the impact will be more than offset by higher expenses in other line items as you saw some of this, this past quarter due to actions taken or investments made with such funds.</p>
          <p>Now a word on taxes; year to date, the company's effective tax rate was 23.6%, reflecting adjustments made in the third quarter resulting from the finalization of our Federal return. As you are aware, the R&amp;D tax credit extension was passed by Congress earlier this month, and our guidance has been updated to reflect this. The full impact of the R&amp;D tax credit for 2008 will be recorded in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we would suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2008 in the range of 23 to 23.5%, which would not include any in-process research and development charges or other special items. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to sales, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth for the full year of 2008 at the higher end of our previous guidance of 1 to 2% or even slightly higher. As you know, currency rates are difficult to forecast. So while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements on our sales, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency rates were to stay where they are today through the end of this year, our sales growth would be favorably impacted by approximately 3%, resulting in total reported sales growth for the year of approximately 5% versus our prior guidance as of 5.5 to 6.5%. This reflects stronger operational sales growth, which is more than offset by the negative impact of currency.</p>
          <p>This is a significant change in currency from our previous guidance. For example, at current rates, the fourth quarter impact of currency would reduce sales by approximately 1.5% as compared to an implied 3.5% of growth based on currency at the time of our second quarter earnings call. This five point swing in currency would obviously have a resulting negative impact to earnings in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Although we don't normally comment on the following year with respect to guidance the impact of a stronger dollar could have on our results, there is something I would like to highlight for you as you refine your models. If the dollar/euro rate were to remain the same as today for all of 2009, the impact to next year's sales due solely to currency would be a reduction to sales of approximately 3 to 3.5%.</p>
          <p>Now for earnings; when I last checked, the First Call mean estimate for EPS for full year 2008 was $4.51 per share. Despite the potential impact of currency in the fourth quarter that I just outlined and taking into consideration the strength of our operating performance this past quarter and the items I have outlined for you, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting full year 2008 earnings per share excluding in-process research and development charges or other special items of between $4.50 and $4.53 per share, an increase from our previous EPS guidance range.</p>
          <p>That concludes my update on our operating performance this quarter and guidance for 2008. Let's move on now to the next portion of our program today. Last year, many of you joined us in New Brunswick for a full-day review of our Pharmaceutical and Consumer businesses. Today, we look forward to providing you with an update on our Pharmaceutical business and some of the pipeline highlights we described for you then. We typically provide these brief business updates every October as part of our ongoing effort to keep you informed about our long-term strategy and prospects for growth.</p>
          <p>We have the most robust pipeline in our history and continue to see progress on several of our late-stage compounds which will be discussed today. I am very pleased with this morning to have Chris Poon, my colleague on the Executive Committee of Johnson &amp; Johnson. As you know, Chris is Vice Chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Worldwide Chairman of our Pharmaceutical group. Chris and the Pharmaceutical leadership team have been continuing to invest in key pipeline compounds and major line extensions that will drive our long-term growth, while creating a more efficient and cost effective operation that addresses short-term pressures.</p>
          <p>Joining Chris today is Paul Stoffels. Paul is company Group Chairman of Global Research and Development for the Pharmaceutical group. He will speak to you today about some of the latest developments and some of our promising pipeline compounds, rivaroxaban, paliperidone palmitate, golimumab, and ustekinumab. At the end of Chris and Paul's presentations, we look forward to taking your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over the podium to Chris, I would like to thank her on behalf of Johnson &amp; Johnson for her dedication and commitment to bringing health and well being to people around the world. Chris recently announced her plans to retire from Johnson &amp; Johnson in March 2009. And we will miss her leadership as we move forward with the business platforms, pipeline, and talent she has fostered across the organization. Few in healthcare today have so successfully combined a passion for business with the mission of transforming patients' lives as Chris has. We wish her the best of luck in the next chapter of her life. Now for the pharmaceutical update, Chris?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and thank you for being here today. It is going to be a pleasure to discuss our Pharmaceutical business with you. We're going to talk about our existing &#x2013; our exciting pipeline and our research and development strategy that underlies our success. As Dominic and Louise mentioned, Paul will also be here, and he's going to also give us progress not only on some our pipeline compounds but also give you a glimpse of some of the compounds in earlier development.</p>
          <p>So first let me set the stage. The Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceuticals group is a leader among the worldwide pharmaceuticals companies, ranking sixth based on annual sales. The ranking in size and growth has been achieved through a combination of organic internal growth as well as selective licensing in areas of strategic interest. It's also important to note that at the end of 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson ranked third largest among biotech companies. This biotech market continues to be an important source of growth for us. Biotech expertise in the industry is driven because of our capabilities through the entire value chain.</p>
          <p>Our R&amp;D capabilities in monoclonal antibodies pioneered at Centocor are significant and are transferable to the next-generation biologics. And we have unmatched biomanufacturing expertise and capacity, actually dating back to the very early years of biotech in Centocor's first plant in Leiden in the Netherlands 25 years ago.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2008, there have been several key compounds providing strong sales growth in our in-line portfolio of medicines. The strong growth of these compounds continued in the third quarter, fueled in some cases by new indications and in others by approvals in additional markets. So let me touch on a few of these, first VELCADE. It continued its high sales growth and tremendous success with a 44% increase year to date versus prior year. You'll recall that VELCADE was granted approval in June of this year for frontline use in multiple myeloma in the EU. More approvals of multiple myeloma frontline during the third quarter bring the total number of countries to 47. That's up from less than 20 at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our antipsychotic franchise consists now of two growth products. RISPERDAL CONSTA continues its strong performance with sales growth of 11% versus the third quarter of 2007 year to date. And for CONSTA, we are pursuing additional indications in bipolar disorder and we expect to hear more about these indications next year. And in addition, INVEGA contributed growth of 135% year to date.</p>
          <p>REMICADE continues its strong sales growth after 10 years on the market, delivering 18% growth and maintaining market share of about a third of the anti-TNF market. And CONCERTA's new adult indication just received in July has helped CONCERTA continue its strong sales growth for the year-to-date figure of 10%.</p>
          <p>And PERSISTA continues its success, fueled by the availability of INTELENCE, which received marketing approval in January of this year in the U.S. and recently in the EU. So this breadth and depth of our growth products have enabled us to lessen the impact of generic competition and the slower sales of PROCRIT, while our newer products that are still in launch mode continue to gain footing in their respective markets.</p>
          <p>So not only do we think about products, we also think about markets, and so let me give you a glimpse of some of our performance in our emerging markets. This focus on emerging markets, what we call the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries, we continued to see considerable growth in the third quarter. This is the result of several launches of new products, new indications, and of course increased investments to expand our sales forces in these selected markets.</p>
          <p>We continue to maximize our current portfolio and to pursue new indications for our existing products. A few of the major line extensions that we have either filed or received approval for thus far in 2008 are shown here. I've already mentioned CONCERTA in adult ADHD. TOPAMAX's pediatric exclusivity approval; this now extends the marketing exclusivity of TOPAMAX until March of 2009. DORIBAX, we received approval in the EU for urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, and nosocomial pneumonia infections. I just mentioned VELCADE for frontline approval in the EU for multiple myeloma. And just last Wednesday, we received approval for a new injection site for RISPERDAL CONSTA, a deltoid injection site.</p>
          <p>So you can see how busy we've been this first half of this year with the major line extension approvals, but also with some additional filings. We filed RISPERDAL CONSTA in bipolar mania, INVEGA for bipolar mania in the EU, DOXIL for metastatic breast cancer, and PERSISTA for early experienced patients in the EU.</p>
          <p>I think you can see why we are optimistic about our short and long-term prospects for our end-market products and our pipeline. This slide shows some of the key strategic drivers that we believe position us well into the future. And to summarize, here are some of the key attributes of our Pharmaceutical group. We have an experienced leadership team. As Louise mentioned, Sheri McCoy will be assuming the role of Worldwide Chairman for the Pharmaceuticals business. Sheri is a demonstrated leader, a close colleague, and her breadth of experience helps position Johnson &amp; Johnson well for the future. Sheri inherits a leadership team that is one of the most highly experienced, dedicated, with impressive track records, and I do believe that our Pharmaceutical group is in fantastic hands with Sheri's leadership.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, we have a diverse, well balanced portfolio that includes a broad range of therapeutic areas with high unmet needs. And we have a robust late stage pipeline and are poised for several key product launches. Our early-stage pipeline is also promising.</p>
          <p>As important, we continue to take actions to address the short-term pressures in our business. These include the cost improvement programs that Dominic mentioned as well as organizing our R&amp;D, our operations, and our commercial organizations for growth, continuing to invest in our pipeline, and ensuring that we have disciplined M&amp;A and L&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So let me just take a few moments to discuss our research and development strategy and to paint a picture for you of our strong capabilities and what makes us unique as an organization. We have research being conducted in seven therapeutic areas, in both large and small molecule platforms. We have established global operations with end-to-end capabilities, and we are pursuing innovative platforms and technologies in the context of a regulatory environment that is increasingly demanding outcomes-based development.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the seven therapeutic areas that are our strategic areas of interest. We are sharpening our focus in R&amp;D on these therapeutic areas where we feel we can best play to win because we already lead in that market and/or because there continues to be significant unmet medical need in that area.</p>
          <p>In order to accomplish our goal of a sustainable, productive R&amp;D organization, we have evolved to a hybrid decentralized, standardized model. The responsibility for research and early development of each of the therapeutic areas remains decentralized as we believe this is the model &#x2013; an environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship. At the same time, we continue to standardize or centralize certain key functions such as clinical operations, biostatistics, pharmacology. These centers of excellence or shared services provide support for the research and development activities of each of the therapeutic areas in order to reduce duplication and to leverage our scale. We believe that we have already seen the early results of this R&amp;D operating model and Paul will give you a glimpse into some of the new compounds moving through the early development pipeline.</p>
          <p>We believe that sustained R&amp;D productivity is the key to our future and we believe therefore that our long-term future remains very bright. As we have discussed in prior meetings here with you, we expect to file between seven and ten new products for approval between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2010. We are on track. Paul will talk to you today about four of these, paliperidone palmitate, ustekinumab, golimumab, and rivaroxaban.</p>
          <p>In 2008 thus far, we have already received marketing approval for INTELENCE for HIV in both the U.S. and in the EU, and we have filed the immediate-release formulation of tapentadol for pain. Additionally, we have received an approvable letter from the FDA for ceftobiprole and have submitted a complete response back to the agency. And for the remainder of 2008, we remain on track to file carisbamate for the treatment of epilepsy and YONDELIS in an oncology indication. And in 2009 and 2010, we anticipate further filings for several other compounds.</p>
          <p>So now let me turn the stage over to my colleague and friend, Paul Stoffels.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure today to discuss in more detail a few compounds in our late-stage pipeline that we are excited about. Today, I'll focus on rivaroxaban, the first oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor; paliperidone palmitate, a novel long-acting antipsychotic; golimumab, a human anti-TNF therapy that holds a lot of promise; and ustekinumab, a first-in-class mechanism of action for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. I'll also spend a few minutes highlighting a few key compounds in our early development pipeline.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with rivaroxaban, our once-daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor. We are very excited about this compound which we are co-developing with Bayer. Rivaroxaban is initially being developed for prevention of venous thromboembolism, or VTE, in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. But the larger opportunities are with additional indications for VTE treatment for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and for secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome.</p>
          <p>For VTE prevention, we filed for approval with the FDA in July based on outstanding data from the RECORD clinical program, in which more than 12,500 orthopedic patients have been investigated. This is the largest program ever conducted in VTE prevention in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery. It comprised four pivotal Phase III clinical trials that compared rivaroxaban with enoxaparin, the current standard of care. Rivaroxaban demonstrated superior efficacy in the RECORD program. This included three head-to-head comparisons with enoxaparin and a comparison of extended-duration rivaroxaban with short-duration enoxaparin. In each of the four trials, rivaroxaban and enoxaparin demonstrated similar safety profiles and low rates of major bleeding. Details about all of these trial designs are available on the ClinicalTrial.gov.</p>
          <p>Last month, Bayer HealthCare announced that Health Canada was the first country to approve the drug for VTE prevention. In addition, earlier this month Bayer HealthCare announced that the European Commission granted approval to market rivaroxaban for VTE prevention in adult patients who have undergone elective total hip and knee replacement surgery. We will be presenting our Phase II dose finding results from our studies of rivaroxaban in ACS at the American Heart Association meeting in November. In addition, we plan to present our pooled RECORD 1 to 4 data at the ASH [American Society of Hematology] meeting in December.</p>
          <p>This slide summarizes the results of the RECORD 4 study, which were presented in May. This was the first head-to-head study comparing rivaroxaban at 10 milligrams once-daily dose with enoxaparin at 30 milligrams twice daily, which is the FDA approved dosing regimen for enoxaparin in this patient population. By contrast, the RECORD 1, 2, and 3 studies compared rivaroxaban against enoxaparin dosed once daily at 40 milligram. In this study, rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin in preventing VTE in patients who underwent total knee replacement surgery.</p>
          <p>Patients showed a statistical significant 31% reduction in relative risk of total VTE events compared to enoxaparin. Total VTE events, which was the primary endpoint, was defined in the study as the composite of all deep-vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality. Rates of major bleeding, the main safety endpoint, while numerically greater in the rivaroxaban treated patients, were low in both treatment groups.</p>
          <p>Rivaroxaban is initially being developed for VTE prevention and there is a robust development program evaluating rivaroxaban in several critically underserved areas where a drug with these properties can have a positive benefit to patients. In the trials shown on this slide as well as in early completed studies, approximately 50,000 patients are expected to be enrolled in the rivaroxaban clinical development program. This includes trials in the prevention and treatment of a broad range of clotting disorders. These trials done in collaboration between Bayer and J&amp;J includes four Phase III clinical programs in VTE prevention in orthopedic surgery, VTE treatment, stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, VTE prevention in hospitalized medically ill patients, and a Phase II study in secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we are very excited about rivaroxaban. We believe that rivaroxaban's combination of exceptional efficacy and balanced safety provides a compelling and positive risk/benefit profile that can help improve patients' outcome.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at paliperidone palmitate, which represents the first atypical long-acting injectable antipsychotic with monthly dosing. Paliperidone palmitate uses an innovative new technology to deliver daily medication over a one-month period. We believe this is a significant advantage in antipsychotic therapy. The monthly dosing schedule may enhance compliance and provide pharmacoeconomic value by reducing the number of patient visits, hospitalization, and recurrence, which are the drivers of increased healthcare costs. The advanced nanoparticle formulation allows storage at room temperature while the prefilled syringes with smaller-gauge needles can be administered through deltoid and gluteal injections.</p>
          <p>Palmitate is initially being developed for schizophrenia and we are considering a bipolar program in early 2009. We filed a U.S. NDA for palmitate for treatment of schizophrenia at the end of 2007. We presented data from those pivotal studies at the APA [American Psychiatric Association] meeting in May, and we have conducted comparative trials between CONSTA and paliperidone palmitate, one of which is completed and one ongoing.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, palmitate uses a novel delivery technology; and as with a lot of novel technologies, you learn as you conduct more clinical trials about how best to use this technology. One of the things we have learned from the first competitive trial with CONSTA is that we can get much more consistent efficacy with paliperidone palmitate across broad populations of patients with a higher initiation dose. We used this higher initiation dose in a placebo-controlled study and found that this dosing regimen demonstrated strong efficacy and excellent tolerability. So we are now using this dosing regimen in a second comparative trial with RISPERDAL CONSTA, which is ongoing.</p>
          <p>We have submitted the data from the first comparative trial against CONSTA with a lower initiation dose as well as the data from the placebo-controlled study with the higher initiation dose for presentation at ACNP [American College of Neuropsychopharmacology], a major medical meeting in December. We anticipate results from the final comparative clinical trial with a higher initiation dose of paliperidone palmitate versus CONSTA next year.</p>
          <p>As I previously indicated, we filed an NDA for palmitate in schizophrenia late last year and received the complete response from the FDA in August regarding our NDA. The complete response outlined additional information needed before FDA would approve the application including a re-analysis of a subset of the data. No additional studies were requested. Given what we have learned about the higher initiation dosing providing an optimal level of patient outcome, we plan to include this new dosing option in our response submission to the FDA. We are in the process of preparing that data and anticipate the data will be ready to submit in the first half of 2009. Based on the new information to be submitted, we believe that this will be a six-month review.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to golimumab, the first human anti-TNF therapy, currently filed in the European Union and in United States. We believe that golimumab will offer excellent efficacy and best-class dosing. The subcutaneous dosing will be a single monthly injection. This compares favorably to competitive regimens ranging from two injections each week to one every two weeks. A state-of-the-art auto-injector is also a differentiating factor and golimumab had a very low rate of injection side reactions in the clinical trials.</p>
          <p>We have filed for three indications simultaneously, enabling us to efficiently and rapidly build a safety database in support of golimumab. We filed an MAA in Europe in the first quarter of 2008 and submitted the U.S. filing in June 2008 for subcutaneous therapy, for signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis.</p>
          <p>In June, we presented Phase III data in RA for the first time at the EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] meeting in Paris. Findings showed the efficacy of golimumab in several important populations: first, a method for Xa-naive patients; second, in patients with active RA despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate; and third, in patients previously treated with anti-TNF biologic agents. We have ongoing studies for all the potential findings including claims regarding impact on structural damage in RA and intravenous therapy for RA, and for ulcerative colitis, both intravenous and subcutaneous.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at the data for our studies of golimumab in combination with methotrexate in patients with active RA despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate. In this trial, called GO FORWARD, adult patients were randomly assigned to four arms: placebo plus metothrexate; 50 and 100 milligram golimumab in combination with metothrexate; 100 milligram golimumab alone administered subcutaneously every four weeks. Data were assessed at weeks 14 and 24, the co-primary endpoints were percentage of patients achieving ACR20 response at week 14 and improvement from baseline in health assessment questionnaire, or HAQ, at week 24. Patients on the golimumab 50 and 100 milligram plus metothrexate experienced significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA. Improvements were seen as early as the first clinical assessment, which was four weeks after the first golimumab injection, and generally continued to improve over time. Patients with RA receiving golimumab also demonstrated significant improvement in physical function as assessed by the HAQ.</p>
          <p>This slide shows results from the first prospective double-blind placebo controlled Phase III clinical trial to analyze the efficacy of an anti-TNF therapy in patients previously treated with at least one anti-TNF agent. In this study, 461 patients with active RA were randomized to receive either subcutaneous placebo or golimumab at 50 or 100 milligrams every four weeks. The primary endpoint for this study was the proportion of patients in each group that achieved ACR20 response rates at week 14. Patient responses were assessed through week 24 and improvements in HAQ were also recorded at week 24.</p>
          <p>Golimumab therapy significantly reduced the signs and the symptoms of RA. At week 14, 35% and 38% of patients receiving golimumab 50 and 100 milligram respectively achieved a primary endpoint of ACR20. This compares with only 18% of patients receiving placebo achieving ACR 20. These results were maintained through six months. Golimumab was generally well tolerated across clinical trials and was associated with a low rate of injection side reactions compared with patients receiving placebo.</p>
          <p>We believe golimumab holds great promise in various RA patient populations, including metothrexate-naive patients, patients with active RA despite metothrexate, and patients who have previously discontinued other TNF inhibitors. Golimumab may provide an appropriate treatment option to many people facing this debilitating disease.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to discuss ustekinumab, formerly known as CNTO 1275, a human monoclonal antibody which binds to the p40 subunit shared by IL-20 (sic) [IL-12] and IL-23 and neutralizes both cytokines. It has been initially developed for subcutaneous delivery for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. We believe ustekinumab forms a convenient of therapy requiring maintenance dosing only once every three months after two initiation doses at day zero and week four to achieve very high response rates. We believe this will be a significant competitive advantage. Psoriasis will be the first indication, but we are also developing the drug in Crohn's disease and have several other indications are under consideration.</p>
          <p>The BLA and MAA were filed at the end of last year. On June 17, the FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drug Advisory Committee unanimously recommended ustekinumab for approval. The FDA has formally extended the review for our application by three months and we now anticipate a response at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We recently presented the results of a competitive trial with ustekinumab versus etanercept. This was the first time a head-to-head trial has been done between two biologics in psoriasis. This was a Phase III multicenter randomized head-to-head study comparing ustekinumab and etanercept for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The study included three arms. Patients received either etanercept twice weekly or 45 milligram ustekinumab at day zero and week four or 90-milligram ustekinumab at day zero and week four. Over the 12-week period, these amounted 24 doses of etanercept in comparison to two doses in both ustekinumab arms. The primary endpoint of the trial was the percentage of participants achieving at least 75% reduction in psoriasis at week 12 as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index or PASI 75.</p>
          <p>This study was presented by investigators at the 17th Congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology [EADV] in Paris, France in September. At week 12, 68% of patients receiving 45 milligrams of ustekinumab and 74% of patients receiving 90 milligrams of ustekinumab achieved a PASI 75. This compared with 57% of patients receiving twenty-four 50-milligram doses of etanercept over 12 weeks. Needless to say, we are excited about ustekinumab, which represents a first-in-class therapy for patients with psoriasis.</p>
          <p>In the allotted time today, I also wanted to share with you a glimpse of our advancing early development pipeline. We are extremely excited by the opportunities represented here, which are compounds that are now in Phase II development. Let me go over each of them briefly.</p>
          <p>The first is an SGLT-2 inhibitor. This compound has the potential to be a novel treatment for Type 2 diabetes and obesity. It has a novel mechanism of action and works by inducing a significant increase in urine glucose excretion. It is well tolerated without associated hypoglycemia or weight gain. It represents a potential novel agent for weight loss. It is currently in Phase IIb and it has shown positive proof of concept.</p>
          <p>The second is an MTP inhibitor, which has the potential to be a differentiated treatment for obesity. This compound acts in the gut, which is different from other MTP compounds that may be systemically absorbed. For both these compounds, we are currently evaluating the Phase IIb data, and anticipate making decisions on plans for Phase III studies early next year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have TMC435, which is a once-daily oral protease inhibitor for treatment of hepatitis C which has demonstrated good efficacy and safety in its initial proof of concept. We are scheduled to present preliminary data on this compound at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Meeting in San Francisco starting October 31.</p>
          <p>We believe that sustained R&amp;D productivity is the key to our future, and we believe we have one of the most robust late-stage pipelines in the industry. And as we have already discussed, we also expect to file between seven and ten new products for approval between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>This concludes our look at the Pharma pipeline, so let me leave with you with a few key takeaways. We have an experienced leadership team that positions Johnson &amp; Johnson well for the future. We have a diverse, robust portfolio that spans a broad range of therapeutic areas. We have a robust late-stage pipeline as well as a promising early-stage pipeline that will provide growth opportunities for the future.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Rick Wise, Leerink Swann; thank you very much. Maybe I'll just start with a broad question for you, Dominic. Given the turmoil in the U.S./OUS economies' credit markets, maybe you could talk &#x2013; just to start us off broadly about the likely economic impact on your business planning, impact on the P&amp;L.

          <p>Okay, Rick. Well, recently we have seen some impact of the current economic conditions, but just in a few pockets of our business. And you know to date, as you saw from our results, it hasn't really resulted in any significant impact to our overall broad-based business performance.</p>
          <p>I'd like to point out that our business leaders have over time been able to make the appropriate adjustments in response to changing market conditions, and I certainly expect that they'll be able to do so in the future. But when we do that, we'll take a long-term view of how to keep our business healthy for the long term, Rick. So far, we've seen small pockets, a few pockets of impact, but nothing that's impacted our overall business performance.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You highlighted the compelling growth you've seen in the BRIC countries, for example. Do you think that can continue given, again, the global turmoil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a priority for the corporation, we have accelerating growth in emerging markets as a key priority for all of our businesses because we believe that that is a great opportunity for us. We've already been present in many of those markets. And as you saw, we're seeing significant uptake and we're continuing to invest in those markets. And when we accelerate our investments, the emerging markets tend to get a high priority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more and I'll &#x2013; you highlighted the increased investments offsetting the gains. Maybe you could be more concrete with us about the investments, where they're going, what you expect to derive from it, and then just maybe the longer term impact. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, great question. I'd probably &#x2013; I'd rather not be so specific about where the investments would be. But whenever we have some one-time gains like the Amgen gain or the gain from the divestiture of the Ethicon Wound Care business &#x2013; and we look at that gain actually as just a reshuffling of priorities &#x2013; we want to take the opportunity to invest in the long-term growth of our business. Our businesses have great growth opportunities that they present to us all the time. So it's our desire to help fund those investment opportunities. And they span, Rick, across all three of the major business segments, but I'd rather not be specific at this time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Matt Dodds, Citigroup. A question for Chris and Paul. You didn't highlight the Pain franchise, although you did have a little comment on IONSYS earlier. Can you just tell us what happened to IONSYS and where the next technology may be in timing? And then also on tapentadol, which you didn't highlight, can you just remind us if you still expect the approval by year end and file in early '09 for the extended release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on IONSYS, we recalled the product from the market because of a technical problem, and we are planning and working on solving that and reintroducing whenever possible.</p>
          <p>On tapentadol, the product was filed in January. Our PDUFA date is at the end of November. But we are expecting that this product will be a scheduled product and so typically that will take a DEA review afterwards. And so we expect that will be a 60- to 90-day additional review. At this moment, we're in active discussions with the FDA on tapentadol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you know that that is for the acute indication, immediate release. We're still on track for the chronic program and extended release program.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Seth Damergy with Deutsche Bank. Dominic, first on CONCERTA, the reversal of the reserve of 135 million, that's I guess about two quarters of historical sales. So can you give a little more color on that? And also does that drop straight to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So this quarter, we reversed our reserve for the anticipated pricing of CONCERTA in Canada. There was a ruling in Canada which increased the price of CONCERTA, and we had estimated that perhaps that wouldn't occur. That did occur, so that was favorable for us. And the impact to that in the quarter of about $135 million in sales is roughly two pennies or 0.02 to $0.03 to the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And on the HIV franchise, I know that you've had a couple of product approvals, one in Phase &#x2013; and another in Phase III. Have you considered a combination pill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two first products, PREZISTA and TMC 125, so INTELENCE now, are two products which are used mainly &#x2013; which are indicated for advanced patients, and they are used in separate pills. We are developing TMC 278, which is a very small dose and which is a very combinable product with a number of different products. The product is now in Phase III. Two Phase III studies are ongoing. We are looking for partnerships on how can we combine this product with different HIV, especially in first line where one's <mark type="inaudible" /> desirable.</p>

          <p>David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David Roman, Morgan Stanley. Just on the guidance, Dominic, it looks like for the full year, you raised guidance by 0.03 to $0.05 relative to where you were previously. By my math, the tax rate &#x2013; does that include the R&amp;D tax credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So by my math, the tax rate gets you probably 0.03 to $0.04. So for the fourth quarter relative to where the First Call consensus is, it looks like guidance is implicitly below that number. Could you just maybe walk us through the moving parts there operationally? How much does FX hit the bottom line in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the impact to FX, our guidance has in fact increased versus the previous guidance, due mostly net-net because of the R&amp;D tax credit. Because the stronger performance we've seen in the business thus far we believe may be offset by negative impact of currency in the fourth quarter. So I tried to give you an indication of the impact, and we can't predict currency. So I am just using currency at today's rates, the euro today. If that stayed where it was throughout the entire fourth quarter, sales would decrease due to currency by 1.5 points. Whereas my prior guidance at the end of the second quarter based on rates then, we expected sales to increase by 3.5% in the fourth quarter. So that delta of 5 points on our fourth quarter sales is the pressure we'll face with earnings in the fourth quarter. We'll overcome that, but that obviously offset some of the earlier gains this year. Currency may not end up there, but we think it's prudent to give you that kind of expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to be clear, I think you said previously that of the contribution of currency growth or decline, two-thirds of that falls to the bottom line of the gross?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. It varies, David, by where it happens in each currency and in each country. But not 100% of the change in top line falls through to bottom line. It's always historically been at least two-thirds. So two-thirds we can count on coming through to bottom line. Sometimes it's as high as 80 to 85%, but definitely two-thirds would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and one just follow-up question to one earlier on the economy. We've seen preannouncements from Advanced Medical Objects and Nobel Biocare so far. Could you maybe be a little more specific about which pockets of the business you're seeing an impact from the economy out there in the third quarter? And specifically some of your competitors in other areas have commented specifically about the month of September. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the trend throughout the quarter in those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, we don't typically comment on monthly sales trends and we just finished the quarter, so we don't really have a lot of data to hang our hat on. We did see some, as I mentioned, some pockets of the impact, and these were mostly in what I would call elective type procedures, so either in sports medicine or in women's health procedures, but not a broad-base decline. And in fact, you saw our results for the quarter were actually pretty strong across our surgery businesses. And in our Consumer business, we've seen just a slight decline in the growth of those markets year over year. They're still growing but just subsiding a little bit in growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse. I have a question for Dominic and one for Paul. I'm just going to start off with you, Dominic. Obviously, the world events have made balance sheets back in fashion. And so as a result of that, I'd like to probe a little bit on things like cash conversion. You're actually above peers from our analysis in terms of your cash conversion, but can you push that further as far as things like working capital and accounts receivable that may &#x2013; we may actually see some benefits on your top line as well as your free cash flow? And then if the cost of debt remains unchanged from current levels over the next 12 months, would you reconsider your capital allocation priorities? And I would put specifically out share repurchase as a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, with respect to balance sheet management, one thing that I'm very proud to point out is that our businesses have managed the business well throughout up and down cycles. And in fact you're right, strong balance sheets are now in favor more broadly, but they've always been in favor at Johnson &amp; Johnson. It's just the way we manage the business.</p>
          <p>I think that our free cash flow right now represents about 100% of our net income, so our businesses do a pretty good job of managing receivables and inventory levels. I think the only thing that we might consider as maybe a little bit of a caution on capital expenditure if times get a little bit tougher. But overall our businesses are able to manage this consistently through economic times, and they're used to this. So this is not a major undertaking for them.</p>
          <p>With respect to capital allocation and share repurchases, it's our policy to really complete the share repurchase that we're undergoing before we make any other decision on how to use our capital allocation for things like share repurchase. But as I mentioned before, our priority is obviously to first pay our dividend. Right? We have a 45- or 46-year history of paying a dividend, and that right now is about a 40% payout ratio and a very nice yield at these lower prices. And after that, we would prefer to build the business with our cash. But lastly, if we don't think there's value creating business building activities, we always look to the next use of cash to do something else to return value to shareholders, like share repurchases. But I can't tell you what our plans would be until we exhaust the current plan and then see what the outlook is for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I'd like to ask you about your hepatitis franchise. For telaprevir, could you comment on your filing strategy in terms of treatment duration and approach and the timing of that versus the United States and Vertex's plans? And then your follow-on product &#x2013; obviously the once-a-day benefit is something that would be very attractive versus telaprevir. Is there going to be a similar backbone therapy there, and anything else unique about that molecule that we should know about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, with regard to telaprevir, everything is on track there and in line with what Vertex is telling. We have a common development program together with Vertex, and it will be based in similar data in Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>With regard to TMC 435, this space of hepatitis C protease inhibitors is going to be a tremendously big new market. These drugs work very well, and we believe very much that there is space for more of these drugs. And 435 is a very attractive opportunity although it's still in early development. We just finished Phase II data. You will see them at the end of the month, and we have to confirm efficacy and safety in next stages. So we'll continue with both drugs until further notice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Phase IIb is in the works now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phase IIb is in the works for 435, yeah. And we anticipate that similar background therapies will continue to go for at least for a certain while. You know that there are also non-nucleosides and nucleoside analogs in development for hepatitis C, and you might anticipate that over time the background therapy for hepatitis C might change, like in HIV. You will see new very potent drugs coming out of research and interferons that are very &#x2013; not that well tolerated. So if there's any benefit of going to highly effective combination therapy for hepatitis C, I think it will happen, but it will take time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last follow-up. In the Phase IIb program, do you have a lead-in strategy as part of that program for pegin-ribravirin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is not yet &#x2013; I will come back to you about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of additional follow-ups. Rick Wise, Leerink Swann. Can you talk a little bit about drug-eluting stent pricing? I think, Louise, you mentioned that prices were down, and actually I have a couple of quick ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the U.S., the price in the quarter was 1,885. It's down 3% sequentially and about 9% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Dominic, you talked about cost of goods mix. Obviously I'm sure stents are a factor, more Consumer is a factor. Is that all there is on the mix side and maybe more specifics on the additional manufacturing costs? Is this a one-quarter phenomenon? You said half of it. Is it one quarter? Could that 70% &#x2013; again, we're sort of at a pretty low level of gross margin. How should we think about gross margin going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the quarter we did experience, as Louise pointed out, significant mix change. And just as a reminder, we obviously lost patent exclusivity for RISPERDAL in the U.S., so that obviously impacted the quarter margin, and the growth of the Consumer business obviously impacts the margin comparison.</p>
          <p>We had some manufacturing cost matters in the third quarter, and they may continue a little bit in the fourth quarter through the rest of the year. We'll handle these matters. Our teams know what to do, but they may be a little bit more costly to us, and that's why we've indicated that some of the gains that we've experienced may be offset by not only investment opportunities but other actions we have to take to shore up operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I'd rather not be more specific, no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just last, quick, you highlighted the new credit facilities. Did rates change just out of curiosity, again, the environment? Or are you renewing at similar rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, the credit facilities I referred to are backup credit facilities to our commercial paper line, so we've not actually used these credit facilities. We've actually just accessed commercial paper. And as I said, we continue to have access to commercial paper in the market, but I would call the rates today very, very attractive.</p>

          <p>One last question. David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David Roman, Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just for Paul and Chris actually on the Pharma business, could you maybe just give us an update on VELCADE in non-Hodgkin's, where we are? I think you already got a positive recommendation from the European agency. And then secondly on ceftobiprole, that Theravance and Arpida announced this morning that they would expect panels for their hospital-based drugs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on VELCADE, we're still under way with pursuing more indications for VELCADE. Non-Hodgkin's is one of them. And we don't have any more update other than that. The only other &#x2013; we did get an approval for frontline multiple myeloma. That might be what you're thinking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On ceftobiprole, we anticipate that today with all the new NCEs and important additional indications that we will get advisory panels at the FDA, so we anticipate with ceftobiprole we'll have an advisory panel, although we don't know yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one follow-up question. On Spine, the 7% reported growth, could you tell us what that was in the U.S.? It actually looks like that's getting a little bit better. Is that confidence that's driving the growth there or is there something else in the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the Spine growth in the U.S. was 5% and OUS was 12% to come up to the 7.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that 5% is an acceleration I think over last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the driver confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of it would be the confidence as well as some strength in the business as well. Okay, Dominic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you, Louise. Before we close the meeting, I would like to thank Chris and Paul for the overview of some of the exciting opportunities in our Pharmaceutical business today. I think they outlined very well how some of our compounds are progressing in our pipeline. We continue to execute against these and other key priorities that are critical to improving patient care and meeting customers' needs across our broad base of healthcare business. We are also innovating and building leadership positions across our businesses while continuing to grow profitably, all the while managing our cost and improving our operating margins.</p>
          <p>These successes are realized thanks to the excellent work and dedication of the extraordinary people across the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. Thank you for your continued support of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and I look forward to updating you in January on our full year 2008 results. Thanks and have a great day.</p>
