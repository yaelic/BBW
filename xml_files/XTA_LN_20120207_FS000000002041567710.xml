        <plist>
          <p>Today, we'll be announcing Xstrata's Preliminary Results of 2011, and as previously indicated, we will also run through the key points of our performance for the year. And I know that the main focus of the presentation is the very exciting announcement of the recommended merger with Glencore that would transform both companies to create what we think is this new powerhouse in the industry.</p>
          <p>So I've asked Ivan Glasenberg, the Chief Executive Officer of Glencore who you know well, and Steve Kalmin, their CFO, to join Trevor, Xstrata's CFO, in front of you. But as you know, the Xstrata team is made up of the chief executives who run our businesses, without whom the story which we're going to talk about a little later would not have been possible. And they are with us in the audience as usual, most of them are sitting in the front row, some are sitting elsewhere; Santiago Zaldumbide, the Executive Director of Xstrata and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc; Ian Pearce; Chief Executive of Xstrata Nickel; Charlie Sartain, Chief Executive of Xstrata Copper; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal; and Peet Nienaber, Chief Executive of our Alloys business. And Thras, who is known to you all, is also in the audience. But I'm also particularly pleased to welcome David Rough, I think our quite outstanding Deputy Chairman and Senior Executive Director, to the presentation. He's here in disguise, but if you want to talk to him, I'll sort of give you an idea of what he looks like.</p>
          <p>So the agenda for today is this. I know that you're all keen for us to talk about the merger, but you're going to have to indulge me for a few minutes because I want to talk a little bit about Xstrata and spend a short while on our results which we announced today and look back very briefly on the first 10 years leading up to this point that we and my colleagues who I've just mentioned, they're with me in the audience, have brought us to. And then I'm going to hand over to Trevor who's going to run you through the operational and financial review. And then we'll get on to the merger.</p>
          <p>As you know, our vision for Xstrata 10 years ago was based on a set of convictions about our industry and about the business model best placed to respond to the emerging trends we saw at that time. Those founding principles have served us well, and our company's rate of growth has been absolutely huge and prolific. Our market value today of around $60 billion is more than 100 times Xstrata's value when the current management team joined the company in late 2001. I don't think that Santiago and I, who were the initial protagonists, could ever have dreamed, together with Peet, that this is the company that we'd be involved in, joined later by Charlie, by Peter and by Ian.</p>
          <p>With the same management team in place, we've created superior value for our shareholders with total returns of some 370% since our IPO in March 2002, compared to about 54% of the FTSE 100 index overall. And we've taken opportunities other haven't taken, and we've built and managed well, and while we haven't escaped hiccoughs entirely along the way, the businesses have created great value, and I think these businesses stand as a testament to the fact that our strategies have been both sound and our execution very good.</p>
          <p>Now, as well as providing the vital commodities society needs, our growth and value creation have delivered value to a wide range of stakeholders in our business. In addition to generating significant returns for shareholders, in the past decade we have paid wages and salaries of some $19 billion, taxes and royalties of some $16 billion, and over $0.5 billion on a voluntary basis has been contributed to various communities and initiatives within those communities. We've invested a further $30 billion in sustaining or expanding our operations in building modern, efficient new mines and metallurgical facilities and infrastructure. So the full scale of the economic benefit of our presence is of course much larger and extends to the many families, many communities, local businesses and other industries which indirectly benefit from our activities. And along the way, we have built up a strong track record and reputation for best-in-class sustainability practices.</p>
          <p>And Xstrata, as you know, has evolved three stages of transformation during its short lifetime, with the successful execution of each phase forming a solid launch pad for the next. Back in 2002, our immediate focus, by necessity, was to embark on an intense period of acquisition, to find, to buy and integrate businesses that would deliver the scale and diversity of products and operating regions that would turn us into one of the world's leading mining companies.</p>
          <p>Simultaneously, we improved the quality of our assets, delivering year-on-year operating cost reduction, increasing productivity, extending the life of existing mines, expanding our resource space and the industry-leading safety and social and environmental standard. The companies we acquired provided us with a range of potential growth options as well as the scale to develop major new mining operations. And we have successfully delivered 22 major projects since 2002, extending existing mines and developing new operations across five countries. And of course, our major growth project pipeline is well advanced, with 20 major new operations or expansions to increase production volumes significantly currently and in construction.</p>
          <p>So the first 10 years of our history culminated in a record year for Xstrata in 2011. Operating EBITDA rose to $11.6 billion, net earnings to just under $6 billion, in each case exceeding our previous record in 2007. Net debt increased to $8.1 billion, with gearing at 15%, with a successful refinancing of our bank revolver, and our bond issue is executed in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The momentum of our organic growth pipeline continued apace, with 10 projects and expansions completed, including our Mangoola thermal coal operation in Australia which was commissioned on budget and ahead of schedule. Our coal and nickel businesses put in strong second half production performances with record annual production of Australia and South American coal and nickel, and in the record second half production of coking coal.</p>
          <p>Real cost savings have become a continuing characteristic of this performance, and 2011 performance didn't disappoint. Sustainable real cost savings of just under $400 million were achieved, and now each of our commodity businesses are amongst the most cost-competitive within their respective industries with second &#x2013; or first or second quartile cost position. Our reserves and resource base continued to grow in scale and certainty during 2011, and we are now significantly &#x2013; particularly significant increases to both copper resources, particularly in South America, an important region for our future growth plan. In total, contained copper resources increased by 15% compared to 2010 to over 13 million tons. We also executed six bolt-on acquisitions during the year to supplement our growth, including First Coal Corporation and the highly perspective Hackett River zinc properties, both in Canada.</p>
          <p>Our safety performance in terms of total recordable injuries continued its progressive improvement. At the boot level we reduced the frequency of total recordable injuries by 26% on 2010 levels, with particularly strong performance in our coal, nickel and copper businesses. Since 2002, the group has reduced its total recordable injuries frequency rate by some 84%.</p>
          <p>Our organic growth strategy is ramping up as planned, supported by a strong balance sheet that was bolstered by record cash generation of $11 billion, a successful refinancing of our bank facilities and $3 billion from our U.S. bond issued during the year.</p>
          <p>We commissioned 10 projects, five of which came online in the final quarter. I mentioned the Mangoola greenfield thermal coal operation which was commission ahead of schedule and within budget, and it bears repetition. And with this new low cost operation and the successful restart, incidentally, of ferronickel operation have already made significant contribution to volumes during the year. The Kikialik expansion at the Raglan nickel mine, the Newlands underground, the ATCOM East coal operations, were all commissioned in the second half. And between October and the beginning of this year, we have commissioned a capacity expansion at the Collahuasi joint venture, an extension to the Kidd operation's mine life, the Black Star Deeps and Handlebar Hill zinc projects and an expansion at the Antamina copper/zinc joint venture, all of which are now contributing to volumes.</p>
          <p>But despite total capital expenditure of over $8 billion, we ended 2011 with a very moderate gearing of 15%. Our strategy to execute the best growth options within our portfolio is now well underway. And we'll reduce average operating costs, increase volumes and deliver significant values to shareholders over the coming years to respond to the positive market outlook we see for commodities.</p>
          <p>So with that as a background, I'm going to hand over to Trevor to take you through the results, and then, of course, we'll get onto the main course.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sure you're all very keen to get into the main course, so I'm going to crack through our results pretty quickly and just highlight a few key points. 2011 was a record year for Xstrata, and EBITDA, cash generation and net earnings all rose to the highest levels in our 10-year history.</p>
          <p>Average prices rose for all our commodities, and ongoing demand from developing economies outweighed European debt concerns, the sovereign downgrade in the U.S. and the impact of the Japanese tsunami. Coal prices in particular remained firm, and we agreed thermal, coking and semi-soft contracts at prices which were around 30% to 40% higher than in the previous year. As a result, group revenue increased by 11% to nearly $34 billion.</p>
          <p>Record operational cash flows substantially funded the accelerating organic growth program and overall debt rose only modestly. Our effective tax rate increased by 1% to 26%, reflecting the guidance I provided at our interim results. And given current strengthening prices for our commodities and our increasingly positive outlook for the rest of the year, I expect the tax rate will increase slightly to around 27% in 2012. Attributable profit before exceptionals increased by 12% to $5.8 billion and earnings per share before exceptional items for the year were $1.97.</p>
          <p>Operating EBITDA rose by 12% to $11.6 billion, with second half EBITDA performance of $5.8 billion mirroring the first half performance, as a strong second half operational performance offset the impact of significantly weaker LME prices from the midyear.</p>
          <p>Coal contributed almost two-thirds of the increase in EBITDA, as the business benefited from higher annual production, increased received prices and substantial real cost savings.</p>
          <p>Average LME prices were in general higher than in 2010, as a strong first half offset weaker prices throughout the year. Strong coal contract and spot prices contributed $1.8 billion to operating profit, while higher copper prices, up 17%, added $700 million.</p>
          <p>Overall volumes, in particular from coal and nickel, improved over 2010 levels to contribute a further $90 million to operating profit, as the impact of new, lower cost volumes from recently-delivered projects started to come through.</p>
          <p>The contribution from our expansions and new mines more than offset the impact of significant flooding in Australia and Chile in the early part of the year, an underground fire at Blakefield South coalmine and reduced ferrochrome production to respond to weaker demand, and lower grades which we're experiencing at a number of our aging mines.</p>
          <p>The volume and pace of capital projects across the industry continued to fuel excessive mining sector inflation, as demand for key skills and equipment remained intense. Nevertheless, our teams again delivered a strong cost performance, trimming $391 million from the operating cost base in real terms.</p>
          <p>Coal was once more a strong performer, with Peter and his team achieving more than two-thirds of group cost savings from lower cost production from our new Mangoola operations, productivity improvements across our open-cut operations in New South Wales and from reaping the benefits of previous capital investment in the Cerrej&#xF3;n joint venture.</p>
          <p>Zinc C1 cash costs continued to fall, reflecting productivity improvements, particularly in Australia where Santiago's team managed $85 million of sustainable cost savings in 2011 despite the impact of weather-related issues at the Queensland operations in the first quarter. And in copper, cost savings were $49 million, which were driven by improved by-product credits from magnetite production at Ernest Henry, optimization of our molybdenum plant at Alumbrera, and the positive impact of the Kidd metallurgical facility closure which took place in 2010.</p>
          <p>Overall, cost savings were offset by the negative impact of CPI inflation and higher prices in mining-specific input, which together reduced our operating profits by just over $1 billion. Adverse foreign exchange movements reduced earnings by $820 million as the Aussie dollar in particular strengthened against the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization increased, mainly due to higher volumes in the nickel business and a higher capital base across the group. Other income and expenses included the impact of severe wet weather conditions, the Blakefield South underground coal mine which happened in the first half.</p>
          <p>Our operations generated over $11 billion of cash in 2011, 14% higher than in 2010 and allowing us to maintain a strong balance sheet despite a 39% increase in expansionary capital. At year-end, net debt stood slightly higher at $8.1 billion with gearing at 15%, the same as at the previous year-end.</p>
          <p>In September, we renegotiated our syndicated loan facilities into a $6 billion five-year facility which contains the option to extend the facility by a further year on both the first and second anniversary. This facility remained undrawn at year-end. In November, we also took the opportunity of a window in the debt markets to launch and successfully price a $3 billion four-tranche Yankee bond issue.</p>
          <p>Investment into our approved organic growth projects continued to ramp up during the year as a number of projects reached peak spending intensity, and expansionary capital spending in total was $5.8 billion in the year. As expected, our Koniambo nickel project pulled the highest capital expenditure, and monthly expenditure averaged almost $100 million during the year. The project is now tracking well against the revised budget. Productivity levels continue to improve and Koniambo remains on schedule to deliver first ore to furnace towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Other major CapEx programs included $1.7 billion for the Mangoola and ATCOM East coal projects in Australia and South Africa, and the Antapaccay and Las Bambas copper projects in Peru, which we will commission in the second half of this year &#x2013; or we will commission Antapaccay in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>We will reach our expansionary capital &#x2013; we will reach our peak of expansionary capital expenditure in 2012, and, as usual, I guide you to a number for this year, which is $6.8 billion of expansionary capital. I expect sustaining CapEx to moderate somewhat to a more normal annual level of around $2 billion for the period.</p>
          <p>Now finally, in line with our progressive dividend policy, the board has proposed a final dividend of $0.27 per share, which will be paid on 23rd of May to shareholders on the register at 4th of May, which gives a total dividend for the year of $0.40 and represents a 60% increase on 2010.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand you back to Mick.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Trevor. I've learned in the last few days what the true definition of an advisor is. An advisor is somebody who gives you advice on what you would like to do and simultaneously advises the market on what you may do through the press. And so, you have a transaction here which you all know about and this is almost a bit of an anticlimax, but let's try and put it into context.</p>
          <p>Right, so what we have here is a $90 billion natural resource company, a super-major with a unique business model, and I think this is what I want to actually take you through. 2.8 times Glencore shares for Xstrata shares, accretive to Xstrata shareholders from day one, with at least $500 million worth of synergies.</p>
          <p>It's the logical next step for the business, a unique business model, a governance and organization structure which is designed to maximize effect and give assurance to those who need to be assured that this company will go forward along a path of value creation.</p>
          <p>The transaction summary is actually quite simple. It's an all-offer by Glencore for the remaining 65.92% of Xstrata at the ratio that we've agreed upon. It will give Xstrata free float shareholders &#x2013; will own 45% of Glencore Xstrata, the new name for the company. And as I said, accretive from day one with at least $500 million worth of synergies.</p>
          <p>The Chairman will be John Bond, I will be Chief Executive, Ivan will be the Deputy Chief Executive, and Trevor will be the CFO, and Steve Kalmin, the Deputy CFO. It's a scheme of arrangement to require a court approval, we've got regulatory approvals to go through, and I expect it to close in quarter three 2012.</p>
          <p>So what we have in front of you in a picture is a global, diversified natural resource super-major with reach, scale, and diversity. And this picture represents to you I think a story which no other mining company can actually tell you, of operations and offices right across the globe in every single significant sphere which, as I'll show you later, maps the trades flows and matches the opportunities to develop production.</p>
          <p>And I guess I asked myself three questions about this transaction. Is this a value-adding proposition? Is it the logical next step? Does it capture value? Does it create an organization where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts? And if it is a logical next step, is it the value-added proposition? Then, is this the best governance structure that we can put together to make sure that this promise turns into reality into the future. And are these the best terms that the Xstrata shareholder can look at it and expect to see the deal go forward on?</p>
          <p>So let's address the question is this a value-adding proposition. The logical next step. As I said, two businesses which have created enormous value operating in parallel in the same industry, different parts of the industry. Xstrata's TSR, as I said a little earlier, have gone up by 370% since the IPO. Tremendous compound annual growth rate in Glencore from the time of the management buyout in 1995, 1996 to the IPO in 2011. Huge value-creation creating businesses of similar size and, as I said, but operating in slightly different segments.</p>
          <p>The next step is to then take these businesses which have been partners in so many things and put together as one coherent unit as a whole to make sure that we can actually capture value in what I think is going to be a set of positive industry dynamics but a changing industry.</p>
          <p>You well know that the secular change in demand and constrained supply remains a powerful, powerful vehicle for growth going forward. In the emerging markets, population growth, the urbanization of those populations, with increased wealth in those populations, drives a demand for metals and energy products and food and resources which is actually unparalleled in the history of mankind. And at the same time, the lack of investment in infrastructure, aging mines and falling grades, challenging new geographies make the supply constraints very real. And  an organization which is well-placed to not only supply commodities into these areas, but to actually operate in that supply chain, I think is a unique proposition for value.</p>
          <p>This enhanced scale is an important contributor to that value creation proposition. The fourth largest global diversified natural resource company; the 10th largest company, at least in the FTSE; $90 billion market capitalization from day one. And sustainable new optionality with greater strategic flexibility springs to mind when one talks about this; greater liquidity; clarification of the ownership structure of Xstrata, which has long been a source of topic when I've gone around to speak to shareholders; the improved risk profile; strongly positioned for continuing access to the equity markets; and well positioned to play an ongoing role in the global industrial consolidation.</p>
          <p>A power of diversification. No other resource company, no other company in our industry has the diversification of product streams as we have; strongly focused in metals, strongly focused in energy, and now strongly focused in the soft side as well. And I think this is a tremendous strength which we are going to have to build on.</p>
          <p>Greater diversification translates into more stable cash flows, lower earnings volatility, lower risk, lower weighted cost of capital and, therefore, higher returns. And off that base, the optionality of this business will in fact develop.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the business in combination on the 2011 results that have been announced in the trading statement that has been delivered by Glencore, an EBITDA of $16 billion on a combined basis, a net debt of $21 billion, and spread around the commodity spread as you see there.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that we retain our London and Hong Kong listings. We expect investment grade rating to be maintained and potentially improved over time. And just to say to you as a matter of comfort that have sufficient back-stop facilities to ensure that the existing debt facilities stay in place.</p>
          <p>So there's the logical step. But where can we capture the value? In the mid-1990s, demand for commodities was dominated by North America, Western Europe and some parts of Asia. It was a constrained and slightly smaller universe than the one we operate in today, where the emerging markets now account &#x2013; if we just look at copper as our proxy, 75% of copper demand, with the spread of supply chain right across the globe and the spread of demand right across the globe.</p>
          <p>Into this type of trade flows, where there has been a massive expansion of trade flows, in steps Glencore Xstrata with key resources located in emerging geographies, with the reach, scale and diversity are key. And again I'd highlight you in a slightly different way where our operations are and where our offices are: significantly placed in all those commodities, significantly able to deliver across that expanded value chain which we see in the earlier slide.</p>
          <p>So the new business model, which I think is required to maximize this value, is delivered in spades in Glencore Xstrata, recognizing that these trade flows are changing fundamentally due to the migration of growth to the developing economy. Value chains are now much longer, they're much more complex. They take risk for both suppliers and people who demand the commodities. But it also increases opportunity to capture value; where there's risk, there are people that can take risk and people that capture value from taking that risk.</p>
          <p>Access to new resources, I believe, requires the ability to operate in potentially highly challenging geographies but maintaining excellent sustainability. And I believe that the Glencore Xstrata model is able to capture the value from these trends.</p>
          <p>So we have this unique business model. Traditional miners on the left-hand side in exploration, mining and production, and processing/refining. Traders involved in logistics, marketing and trading. And Glencore Xstrata, a company of significant size, being the only company of significant size involved in every single facet of that value chain. And that is where the difference is, and that is where the optionality comes, and that is why this is a compelling transaction.</p>
          <p>Capturing the value in practice, and this is something which Ivan I think will talk to a little later, allows us to look at both the value coming from the top tier industrial assets that both companies bring to the table, the blending opportunities in terms of the range of products that we have and the ability to add value by blending those product ranges, capturing the value from the logistical and the infrastructure chain and the arbitrage opportunities and economies of scale that this leaves us, allows a value creation potential which I think is unique to this combination and which other companies are not able to in fact &#x2013; not in fact able to gather for themselves.</p>
          <p>But where's the short-term value coming from? Where's the value coming from day one? I think that we are going to get, based on the rigorous work that we've done, at least $500 million of synergies per annum from year one. These synergies are predominantly market-related and they relate to the fact that we are translating the huge production from Xstrata in full through the Glencore trading and marketing system. And we believe, based on this rigorous exercise, that there are clear cases where value will be added and we've looked at clear examples where that is achievable.</p>
          <p>Short-term value also comes from the fact that we are both involved in significant growth expansion. Our growth, as you know, comes through around about 2013, 2014 in a very significant way, Glencore's growth comes through a little earlier. And so the combined entities are able to in fact achieve an 11% compound annual growth rate from 2011 to 2015, which is significantly ahead of our peer group which stands at 7%. There is going to be significant capital expenditure. But if you look at the Glencore's capital expenditure, it's highly efficient in terms of the growth that they generate. And I think this again is the value to the organization.</p>
          <p>If I look at the medium-term value proposition, asset optimization, project optimization to increase returns and increase the efficiency of capital expenditure abound. Diversification into new commodities for the Xstrata shareholders; moving into agriculture on the one hand, and further enhancing our exposure into the energy side, given the thesis of constrained supply and burgeoning demand, is a really good story.</p>
          <p>We will apply operational excellence, where I think Xstrata has excelled across the total, entire portfolio of the asset base, and we apply the franchise, the marketing and trading franchise of Glencore across the total production base. And that will grow, and our ability to pursue growth therefore in these geographies, I think, is enhanced by that. We will play a decisive role in industry consolidation. And I think that, again, that given the &#x2013; putting this all together into one context provides this unique value proposition.</p>
          <p>And I guess from my point of view it is summarized by these six blocks. So if you think about what are the aspects that one needs to succeed as a business? Scale and diversity, and optionality and global reach; this company has that. World-class operating assets and a project portfolio, reserves and resources; this company has that. Integration along the value chain, market, customer and insight; this company has that better than any other company. Financial depth and continuous access to the global capital markets to exploit opportunities; that is clear &#x2013; it is clear from the way that credit markets have responded to the leaks already, where the CDSs of both companies in fact narrowed quite significantly. The entrepreneurial culture which both companies have enjoyed and which have created growth merged together to create a very powerful team motivated for value creation. And then the operational excellence and excellence in sustainability which we've developed will flow through to both organizations.</p>
          <p>A unique business model, access to new sources of growth, an entrepreneurial culture and evolved authority to maintain that strong momentum which has been the hallmark of Xstrata up to now, and leadership in cost containment, sustainability, I think this is a story which is powerful in terms of our ability to deliver this competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>So if it is a compelling transaction, does the governance that we put in place ensure that that compelling transaction translates into a company that will continue to deliver value? We spent a lot of time thinking about the governance and we spent a lot of time discussing it. And this is a governance which is supported not only by my board, but it's supported by the Glencore board, it's supported by the Glencore management and it's supported by our management. It's a governance which makes sense.</p>
          <p>As you know, John Bond, the Chairman of Xstrata, will be Chairman of the combined company, Glencore Xstrata, I will be Chief Executive, Ivan will be the Deputy Chief Executive. The industrial businesses, except for those few businesses where there in fact is no crossover, will be run by the Chief Executives of the Xstrata business. The marketing businesses will continue to be run by the Chief Executive of Glencore's marketing businesses. There will be an absolute synergy between these two businesses; they work closely together to find and maximize value.</p>
          <p>The board of the company will be taken from John, as I've mentioned, four Directors from Glencore, four Directors from Xstrata, plus Ivan and myself. And I think this management structure and this board structure allows us to go with confidence and say to you that this is a transaction which is made to create value and a transaction with sustained value, as this merger is taking place right through integration, through interoperations and beyond.</p>
          <p>There is limited integration risk, which I think is the last point that should be mentioned when one takes into account this whole thing. We have a longstanding commercial relationship with Glencore. We know each other very well. We have a decade of working together. And although I think there will be challenges on organizational structure, because, quite clearly, people who produce products and people who trade products have a slightly different cultural bent, but I think we can make a virtue as we build the bridge of cooperation between these two cultures and make sure that one and one equals much more than three or four. One and one actually equals 11. And we've agreed over here in terms of a governance mechanism that will make sense.</p>
          <p>The best terms. I'm challenged on this question. I've read in the newspaper, and I should actually look at this with some concern, that there's a chance that I'm going to be fired and voted off the board if I don't produce the best terms for the company. So I approach this topic with some trepidation obviously because who wants to lose their job on day one when you've announced such a fantastic deal and somebody thinks you've screwed up on the terms.</p>
          <p>Now, we know that I'm a lousy negotiator, but let's look at the proposition from the Xstrata point of view and let's see how badly I've done. Earnings accretive from day one. Earnings accretive from day one. My goal in negotiating this transaction was to make sure that the Xstrata shareholders saw uplift and saw value from the proposition. There's a potential ratings and value uplift from the combination, and we've seen the market already speak to that post the leak.</p>
          <p>Xstrata shareholders continue to benefit not only from the Xstrata growth story, but also from the value proposition that Glencore bring through their growth and diversification, their projects, and their marketing and trading business.</p>
          <p>The strong governance structure that I've spoken about. And I think it aligns strategies and clarifies the ownership structure of Xstrata in a way which gives us much greater financial flexibility to exploit the value propositions that are out there in the marketplace today. And in addition to that, a premium has been achieved. What more can you ask for?</p>
          <p>These terms reflect the vigor of &#x2013; the rigor of the negotiations and the universe of the possible. I want to make this point to you: I did not go out to negotiate a premium with Ivan. I went out to negotiate a ratio with Ivan, a ratio which reflects the right sharing of the combined benefit for the Xstrata shareholders and the Glencore shareholders. I had to recognize that there was no cash in this deal. This was a share-for-share transaction. And that's why I mention the universe of the possible. A tough negotiator who could enforce his way and achieve a dramatic premium for somebody who then is going to face massive dilution, simply erodes the value proposition for himself. And that is something which I simply couldn't allow to happen. We had to pitch this ratio in a way that both share prices should respond positively to the result of this transaction. And we achieved that. And I think that's a great achievement. And the result has been that we have a 15% premium to the undisturbed price of Wednesday last week when the news broke and we have a 28% premium to our three-month VWAP.</p>
          <p>So in combination of a great logic to the transaction, a great value creating proposition, a logical next step, an unparalleled company which will be unassailable in its ability to capture value in the marketplace, we have a great governance structure and we have a great set of economics for Xstrata shareholders. And from that point of view, I think that is a very exciting and satisfactory result.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to conclude now; you've heard enough from me. I'm going ask Ivan to say a few words and then we'll open up to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mick's outlined all the details of the value of the transaction. There was just a point in one of the slides which he spoke about &#x2013; we didn't give too much detail, but what I see the big value of the transaction is how we've operated Glencore in the past. And we bring a big amount of value to the joint group I think in two main areas.</p>
          <p>Number one area, as you know, Glencore deals with 8,000 suppliers around the world. We are talking to every supplier. And when I did the road show for Glencore and we met with all investors, this was what we had to get across, that Glencore deals &#x2013; different to the other mining companies, we deal with third-party suppliers. We're talking to every third-party supplier every day of the week and our traders are talking to them and buying product from them. When we're doing that, we see opportunities which no one else sees.</p>
          <p>And if people look at the history of Glencore, we didn't buy the major companies, as Xstrata grew. They grew in their manner and we grew in our manner, and that was the great combination that Mick always worked on. We were chasing assets where we knew the mines. If you look at our operation in Columbia, look in the Congo, you look at even the regional Australian operations, we were dealing with small mines. The small mine on its own was not a great mine, but understanding the reserves and dealing with the different mines in the area, like you see in Prodeco today &#x2013; just to give you an example, if you look at Prodeco, it looks like one mine but that was an acquisition of about eight different mines. No one realized the low quality Calenturitas material, which is not a great quality, but together with the La Jagua material where there was another mine just up the road, not far, if you could buy those two, put those two together, you'll create a Tier 1 asset. So that is what Glencore is able to do. We don't need to go and buy the Tier 1 number one assets. We're happy to buy Tier 3 &#x2013; as Xstrata has also done with some of the assets &#x2013; and we bought assets, put them together and create a Tier 1 asset.</p>
          <p>Now, this is what we bring to this merge group. We now have this massive powerhouse company &#x2013; you see the size and scale of it, that our traders out there talking to these third-party suppliers, looking at these potential assets can bring bigger opportunities to the company. So that's what I think brings a large amount of value &#x2013; different to the other mining companies, which makes us very different to all the other companies that we are competing against. They don't have this ability. They go to look at acquisitions; either large hostile takeovers or assets which come on the market on tenders or become available through a tender type process. But most of the assets which Glencore has acquired over the years has been quiet deals done with suppliers we have a long term relationship with.</p>
          <p>The other part that Mick mentioned is the big value that we do bring. And what is going to happen in this merged company, we get the flow of the Xstrata tons into the Glencore system. In the past, if you have a look what we had, we had agency agreements, we had different type advisory agreements but we never got the clear flow of their commodities into the Glencore system.</p>
          <p>Now, the Glencore system composes of lot a of our own production. It composes a lot of third-party tons which we bring into the Glencore system. Now we get the full flow of the Xstrata tons into the system. That allows us to find price arbitrages that exist. We're in the bulk commodity sector, we are not in precious metals, where commodities price at different prices in different parts of the world at different times. We can now take full advantage of that, with the Glencore tons, to ensure all our new shareholders get the benefit of it, which we didn't get before.</p>
          <p>Example, we can &#x2013; if we are loading tons from South Africa, coal, for example, which was going to United Kingdom, suddenly there is demand in India, we couldn't divert the Xstrata tons into India in the past. Today we can, and we can fill the tons which we were meant to supply to the United Kingdom from tons which we get from Russia from our third-party tons. And then we can do the same with copper concentrates which are going into the Xstrata smelters, we can divert it to other smelters and put third-party concentrates into the Xstrata smelters. This is what we bring.</p>
          <p>So therefore, the Chief Executives of the Xstrata Production Divisions will work very closely with the Chief Executives of the Glencore Marketing Division. They work close hand-in-hand bringing opportunities. They bring the skills of us, helping us to assess the mines or operations which we're looking at, we can work swiftly on that. But also, the marketing side, the two groups or the blending, or the concentrate side, what you can do with the smelters and the abilities to utilize the smelters within the Xstrata system as a trading tool, the two Chief Executives can work a lot closer together with that. So I think that is a real big value we are bringing to the table on this.</p>
          <p>And as Mick said, the synergies are around about $500 million &#x2013; we're just off the cuff, which we've looked, we haven't gone further into further detail &#x2013; could be higher also on the operational side and we haven't gone into that.</p>
          <p>So that's really where I see the big benefit of these two operations and putting them together.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ivan. So just to conclude before we open to questions, I mean, you've got clearly a very significant global, diversified company developing in the Glencore Xstrata model, but more importantly, and this captures the point that Ivan has just made to you, the integrator, producer and marketer, where Xstrata is without doubt in a league of its own, on the right-hand side, reflected by that bubble which Thras drew so beautifully for me.</p>
          <p>So the natural combination is the logical next step, the unique business model, governance and organization to support that, and therefore that should inform the questions which you're now about to ask me.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a &#x2013; you talked about merging the two cultures. Could you talk a little about who's going to run the different divisions? I guess at Glencore, typically it's the head trader who runs the divisional businesses. Will it be the Xstrata divisional CEOs who run the different commodity businesses or will it be the Glencore traders, or how is that going to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we basically have the existing Xstrata Chief Executives that are running the businesses now will continue to run those businesses. The Glencore production assets which fall into those businesses will merge into those businesses. The Glencore &#x2013; the marketing and trading flows from those businesses will be managed and processed through the Glencore trading and marketing system, and the Chief Executives of the existing marketing businesses will stay in place. And the point that Ivan made is that there will be an ongoing working relationship, close working relationship I would assume, between the Chief Executives of the actual operating businesses and the Chief Executives of the marketing businesses. And that is what's going to continue. So from a structural point of view, at the top, both companies actually have very little disturbance.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I can only mention, it's no different how Glencore operates today. And you mentioned that the head guys are trading, but how it works today, if you look at our copper division, you will have Telis Mistakidis who heads up really the copper trading part, and he has his counterpart alongside him, the production guy, <mark type="ph" /> Tim Henderson (0:41:33), that looks after the production, and they work very closely with each other. But Tim really keeps total control of the production. And the same as Mick said, will be here: the Chief Executives of Xstrata will look after the production part of the business working closely with the marketing team.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Chris LaFemina from Jefferies. Question about M&amp;A strategy for both Xstrata and, Ivan, for Glencore as well. Mick, you talked about how the combined entity would have a lower cost of capital and obviously be much larger in scale. Would this affect your M&amp;A strategy from how you would approach M&amp;A as Xstrata on its own? In other words, do you have to look at bigger deals or is there a different approach to risk around M&amp;A? And obviously, as a bigger company, smaller acquisitions are going to do a lot less to move the needle than the bigger deal would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think two observations on this. First of all, I mean, I don't think it changes the way that we look at M&amp;A. I mean, the way that Xstrata has looked at M&amp;A has been that we've had a very clear idea of what creates value, and then when opportunities have presented themselves where we can capture that value, we tend to take those opportunities as decisively and as quickly as possible. So we haven't been slaves to an idea. We've been slaves to value and the opportunities and marrying the two together. And I don't think that changes at all; I think that's the way we want to continue.</p>
          <p>I think the next point about this is, secondly, that there's no doubt that the combined entity provides much greater financial capacity and a cleaner shareholder structure to facilitate us looking at deals which otherwise would have been challenging for us to do. And therefore it does allow you to do larger transactions and it does allow you to grow in size in geographies which you might otherwise want to constrain yourself if the two companies are operating separately.</p>
          <p>So I think the advantages of scale give you the opportunity of taking perhaps onboard more risk and therefore more opportunity in those geographies which you might have said, well, we will be there but will be there only within a particular size. And I think there's the second value adding aspect of it.</p>
          <p>On the issue of bolt-on transactions, we have made a virtue of encouraging our Chief Executives to constantly search out for growth opportunities, and when those growth opportunities do make sense, to also go out there and capture them. And we've had, what, like five or six bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now, every acquisition might be small in size, but as you add them together they become very significant. And Ivan made the point of when you start out, you might start off with something small, but then you buy something which is connected to it, and then you put something which is connected there on top of it, and suddenly you have a big complex. And you translate something which is relatively small and relatively insignificant into something which is large and world-class. And that's what we encourage our businesses to do because that's how they're going to add more value as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mick, good morning. This is Andrew Keen from HSBC. Two questions on the premium, one specific and one more general. On the specifics, you quoted 15% premium using the Glencore closing price of 6 of February and your undisturbed price at the 1 of February. If we go back and use both the undisturbed price of the 1 of February, isn't the premium 8% rather than 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the number is 8%, but I don' think that's the premium.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The second question is, whether it's 8% or 15%, typical premiums in the mining industry are typically around 30%. You've paid more premiums than a lot of people and your own premium in hostile M&amp;A is typically around 30% to 33%. Don't you think 8% to 15% is rather low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm an expert in paying premiums, but I've paid in cash as well. So this is a share-for-share combination of two companies which are going to &#x2013; where the shareholders remain in place, going to go together and going to share the value uplift together. Why should one set of shareholders differentially be advantaged over another set of shareholders? I mean, I had this debate when we looked at Anglo American, so it's a topic which I've thought about for a long time.</p>
          <p>My job was to make sure that Xstrata shareholders got an adequate stake in this business and that we in fact we maximize the stake that we could get taking into account what was in the universe of the possible. And from that perspective, I think we have in fact done that effectively and we've maximized what we can take, and that has translated into, I think, a very acceptable premium for the Xstrata shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly, we can all say, well, we want more. Everybody wants more. My son always wants more. But sometimes when you want more, you start eroding what you're giving and you <mark type="ph" /> start (0:46:01) ending up with getting less. So I think we've actually pitched it right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one last question. Does this transaction trigger change-of-control clauses in executive employment contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This transaction potentially does trigger change-of-control clauses with some executives depending on the jobs that they get. From my perspective, it doesn't trigger change-of-control. I'm moving to the Chief Executive of the combined company. My job is pretty much the same, just a bigger field to play with and which makes me very excited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Myles Allsop, UBS. Just a couple of questions for Mick. Why now? I mean, back in December you were saying you're on the cusp of delivering meaningful growth that comes through 2013, 2014. Is it not better to wait and then sort of combine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to come back to the timing of the opportunity. This is not a transaction we just sort of thought about. I mean, this thing has been <mark type="ph" /> speculated about us (0:47:04) for years. And Ivan and I have been talking about does it make sense to merge these two companies six or seven years ago already.</p>
          <p>And I think it just comes back to sort of the way that I look at things, and I'm sure the way that Ivan looks at things, is that if you can reach a landing, then you must act. What is the point of not acting? We understand the principal behind this is that this is a great opportunity, this is a great company, this merger will give us great capacity to enhance value for shareholders. Having reached the landing on key terms, on governance, on ratios, on management structure, et cetera, why wait? Why miss the opportunity? Take it when it's available. And that's the way that I've always approached our acquisitions.</p>
          <p>It doesn't in any way diminish the growth that comes through to Xstrata shareholders. In fact, I think it gives them enhanced capacity to capture growth much earlier on by getting into the earlier capital efficient growth projects of Glencore.</p>
          <p>Ivan, I don't know if you want to add...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, you say wait later on, who knows what the wait later on. We've valued the companies, and when Mick looks at the accretion/dilution effect of it, he hasn't looked at it today, he has looked at the future DCFs of different type of valuations. And that's the value we get to. So we also have growth projects within Glencore. And the time came, we looked at all different ways of valuing it to get the right ratios, and it works today.</p>
          <p>And as Mick keeps emphasizing, you have to remember, it is not a purchase for cash. If it was a cash deal, then people can talk about premiums because then shareholders are departing and they are not getting the benefit of the combined unit and it's only going to one set of shareholders, the party who pays the cash. This is a merger of only shares, so all the shareholders are getting the same value. They're getting the benefits of the synergies, they get &#x2013; whether you say the shares are priced low today and some people have said why don't &#x2013; or wouldn't you do it later, is it the bottom of the cycle, wouldn't you rather do the merger later in the cycle? Sure. Late in the cycle using high-priced shares against high-priced shares. Today, when you stay at the bottom of the cycle or at a low part of the cycle, it's low priced shares against low priced shares. So it really doesn't make a big difference. It's not cash to purchase the asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one second question just to follow up on the synergies, $500 million. Could you just give us a bit more visibility on where they're going to be achieved? You say it's kind of off the cuff. Is there significant upside, do you believe, to those synergy numbers? I mean, and just thinking about your two organizations being very leanly run already, do you think this kind of CEO, Deputy CEO, CFO, Deputy CFO &#x2013; I mean, it seems that you're getting more bureaucratic at the top potentially. But just in terms of synergies and what upside there is would be helpful I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; I mean, firstly, let's talk about bureaucratic at the top. I think less bureaucratic at the top because the way the business is going to be run, I do have a bigger set of assets. Mick is definitely going to focus more on the asset side of the business and I'm going to focus more on the trading side of the business. You know the trading side of the business means a lot of travel, being out of the office a lot of the time, and it's relationships with customers, et cetera, and it's what I do and looking for opportunities, being around the world. So therefore, that gives me more freedom to do that easier. Mick running the company, being CEO of the company does release a lot of pressure from me to do more of what I do best. So that's what we're getting.</p>
          <p>Now, the leanness of the structures in both the trading and in assets will remain the same. In fact, I think we'll even get &#x2013; it will even get leaner because now we've got more assets, we can put them together, we can utilize the skills Xstrata's CEOs in their production division to assist on the management of our divisions where we are leaner and we're growing the assets and we do need outside skills to assist, so I think that adds a lot of value.</p>
          <p>The other part of the synergies, yes, the synergies we've looked at, and as I've tried to explain to you the arbitrages that we get on the pricing, the arbitrage that exists on the pricing, the blending opportunities, using smelters to bring in third-party tons and utilizing third-party tons within the system, those synergies we've looked at very carefully. We've analyzed what we've done in Glencore in the past, how we've made money with third-party tons. We didn't have that ability to do it with Xstrata tons. So all we've got to do is look at how much value we've created on the third-party tons which we buy and bring into the Glencore system, and putting that to the Xstrata tons. We've done that on the copper side, we've done that on the zinc side, we've done it on the coal, nickel side. It's pretty easy to calculate. So the number has been pretty scientifically done, it's been well done, it's been processed through the system, and that's I believe a conservative figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think the point to make about the synergies which we've not actually computed is clearly, there are a lot of synergies that come through from the tax and financial side which have not been factored into account. And we haven't factored into account the potential synergies that come through from the optimization of the asset base over time. So I think these are clearly the synergies fundamentally which flow through. There's very few sort of head office-type synergies that you get from other transactions, just given &#x2013; reflecting the fact that we both run very lean head offices, and the duplication in fact is very, very small. I think there's a &#x2013; there's great complementarity in the skills that are brought at the head office. And so, as Ivan says, the key synergies come out of that. And the dominant amount comes from copper and coal, but significant synergies from the other businesses as well.</p>

          <p>Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Hi, Mick. Just one question. You've grown Xstrata over a decade, you're comfortable operating in the regions you're in at the moment. How have you got comfortable potentially being the CEO of assets in a whole range of different regions that you haven't been in before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, let's be honest, there's basically two principal regions. It's the former Soviet Union in Kazakhstan, which in fact we've never had a difficulty in operating with, we just haven't had opportunities to operate there. Activities out of Russia and of course, the DRC. Now, again, one of the values of bringing this merger together is we bring skill sets of people who've operated very successfully in these areas. And my point was whenever I make these &#x2013; whenever I've made the points about risk is that I don't want to take &#x2013; I didn't want to Xstrata into areas where we had no skill set, because, to my mind, that seems to be unquantifiable. You can raise returns, you can get &#x2013; say, well, we'll get a higher IRR. But it's a sort of binary item; if you can't manage the risks, you get zero.</p>
          <p>Whereas here we're now joining together with Glencore, in fact, to have the benefit of risk capability of operating in these areas and have done it very successfully. And again, that I think is the value, that is an unquantifiable synergy of where we come from. And the fact that they're sitting in around about 40 countries around the world has a tremendous value.</p>
          <p>So I've been &#x2013; in looking at this transaction and getting myself comfortable about not only the asset mix, but where the assets are, I've looked at how Glencore in fact have been able to position themselves in these geographies, and we've taken a view that they do it in a way which mitigates risk and in a way which has risk mitigants which we could not have brought to the table because we just haven't been there in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, on that point I can just add what &#x2013; we talk about the risks in those countries, and Xstrata today is in Colombia. A lot of these countries Glencore got into not because we were mining there, we're trading there. We we're buying a lot of tons. Whether you talk the DRC, whether you talk Kazakhstan, whether you talk Colombia, we got into those countries because we were trading in those countries for a long time. We had field officers in those countries. And take, for example, and you asked Mick that question, we were in Colombia many years ago. We started the Colombian coal operations and we were the first mining company to go into Colombia. The Cerrej&#xF3;n projects, Cerrej&#xF3;n Norte, Cerrej&#xF3;n Centrale, were our projects initially. And we only got into those countries, and with Prodeco, due to our trading base. We were trading with those companies, companies ran short of cash. We eventually did pre-finance deals with those companies and eventually we converted some of those pre-finance deals into equity. And at the time, we were a smaller company. The scale got too big for us, and that's in fact when we brought in Anglo American, and finally we brought in BHP, when I brought in Mick when he was at BHP at the time, to come in as a partner to join us in those operations.</p>
          <p>So that's the same thing; there was a country no one knew about, everyone was scared to operate, but we got there first. People saw what happened and they all arrived. The same is happening in the DRC. We got into the DRC early, we're there, we do have our operations, Katanga, Mutanda, and we've seen it: other mining companies are coming into the Congo rapidly. And they will all be there rapidly.</p>
          <p>And Mick said Kazakhstan. It's a country we also developed there early on. We had a relationship with the producers there and we've got our assets. And people are today in Kazakhstan, and probably there are just not enough assets. All the oil companies are running to Kazakhstan to try get into Kazakhstan. The mining companies are starting more exploration. But these are not risky countries anymore.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:51) at Merrill Lynch. Could you tell us anything, Mick, about the regulatory process that you envisage for the transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think the primary regulatory process is the anti-trust approvals one has to get across the world. And really it's a matter of filings and going through these things that we have to file. And I think the principal country you have to file in the United States. At the moment, we think we have to file in individual &#x2013; some individual countries in Europe, but we wait for the European Union to opine on this. We have to file in China. We have to file in South Africa.</p>
          <p>In terms of where the long lead times are, I think they're basically in China. In South Africa, they have a slightly longer process than other jurisdictions. We sort of think that the anti-trust will probably be done for this to complete in the beginning of the third quarter, around about that period of time.</p>
          <p>The other key regulatory filing I think is simply the Foreign Investment Review Board in Australia, which I think will not be an excessively taxing exercise. Both organizations have operated in Australia very successfully, we're well known, and I don't believe that will be a key issue. And I think that's where the focus area is of the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mick, Heath Jansen here from Citi. Just to follow up on the anti-trust, I mean, is there any commodities in particular that you're concerned about on the anti-trust, particularly in zinc and copper, given your combined market shares going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, clearly the market shares are high, but we don't have any concerns. I just have to say to you, in the past, the European Union has always treated Xstrata and Glencore as one unit. So, I mean, I take that as a precedent, and I don't think that any of the volume in itself actually causes a problem in different jurisdictions, but they do trigger filing requirement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a second question on your whole portfolio structure and makeup now given that you're going to be a bigger organization going forward. Are there any commodities in there that are sub-scale and not going to meet those requirements of bolt-on activities? I guess the one that comes to mind is the PGM business. And secondly on that is just capital allocation and how you're going to think about capital allocation between growth projects now, given you've got a lot more competition for capital, particularly on the assets and the marketing business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think those are both very good questions. On the issue of the first question, are there assets which in fact we will take another look at. Obviously we do that. We do that dynamically all the time. And clearly, who would put this company together without in fact having a fresh look at what the asset portfolios are, what the trading portfolios are, and making decisions, is this the right mix, can we do something different, can we do something better. But we've got to do it, one, we have to get the shareholders to approve the transaction, we've got to integrate the businesses, and then I think we can approach that. But, clearly, it's going to be done. We have had no thoughts about that upfront.</p>
          <p>On the issue of how are we going to think about asset capital allocation, again, I think we have to focus in on value creation. This is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:59:38) where you allocate your capital. And we have to make a judgment based on risk and opportunity to create value as to where we put our capital going forward, whether it's an acquisition, whether it's a project. That is what we've done in Xstrata up to now, certainly that's what Glencore have done in terms of my observations. And I think we've continued doing that. Value creation is the driving focus of this group, not building great edifices, not building great things, how do we create value, and that's what will drive the way we're going to allocate our capital going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris LaFemina from Jefferies again. Just a follow-up question on M&amp;A in general. If your cost of capital is indeed lower, and obviously it's a larger entity, I would argue that Xstrata on its own probably would not be looking into oil and gas assets in terms of M&amp;A, but maybe the combined group, especially Glencore's marketing business in energy, you may look at oil and gas assets. Is that something you'd consider as a merged company, large scale oil and gas assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think oil and gas assets are very exciting. In fact, Glencore have two very exciting projects they're working on at the moment in Equatorial Guinea, and, Ivan, I don't know if you want to talk about them. But certainly that's an area which deserves and merits attention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've always said during the IPO phase, and one of the reasons why we did the IPO, which gave us the financial muscle to grow in that area, we do believe that's an area, we got expertise in that area and we would like to grow in that area. As you know, in that area in Equatorial Guinea, we're developing that base, and in Cameroon we've got E&amp;P projects, the existing project is already producing around about 60,000 barrels of oil a day. We own 23% of that.</p>
          <p>And we will keep looking in that area and try and grow in that area. We do have our investment in Russia, in RussNeft. It has had its problems, but today we do own that asset. The asset is &#x2013; or at the current oil prices it is paying down debt considerably. It was highly geared with Glencore debt and Sberbank debt. But it was highly geared, it is paying down debt rapidly at $110 oil type prices. It has an asset which has an EBITDA of roundabout $1.6 billion per year.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, that is an asset that could potentially we grow further in that area. So, yeah, we will look at those two areas. Are there other opportunities in West Africa where we feel comfortable in that area? If opportunities come, we'll look at them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Myles Allsop again. Just a few quick kind of follow-up questions. Does the deal impact the timing of the lockup for the Glencore shareholders? That's first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the lockup stays the same. There's no change in the lockup. The existing lockup applying to the Glencore shareholders remains. The first release of the lockup is on the 18th of May I think it is, Steve? And that's when the first release of the partners who get their one-fifth or one-fourth release falls due then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is a chart on page &#x2013; would show the pro forma ownership structure which was as at May, which shows what is still locked up as of that particular point in time and what was released.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of the Kazzinc transaction, is that impacted by this bigger, obviously, merger, or is that still going ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is still going ahead. The deal is &#x2013; it just was waiting for the regulatory approval in Kazakhstan. I think we've got that recently, Steve. So that should be going ahead. As you know, that's a $1 billion issue of shares at the IPO price of $5 &#x2013; the $5.30 price, and $2.2 billion in cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That should be expected closing in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the sort of synergies, could you give us a split between &#x2013; is it 90% marketing, 10% industrial, just so we can get a sense of what the tax rate will be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:30)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, you can take &#x2013; of the synergies, the $500 million worth of synergies, sort of around about $35 million to $40 million is &#x2013; sorry, about $20 million odd, $20 million odd to $25 million is sort of corporate-type synergies and the rest, principally, are synergies in the marketing area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that will be, what, 10% tax rate, is that the &#x2013; on the marketing synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marketing, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally, could you talk about the incentive program for employees, kind of the legacy Glencore and Xstrata employees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the incentive program is actually running &#x2013; it's pretty much the same as they are at the moment. What will happen is that the &#x2013; Glencore have an existing incentive program which the Xstrata people migrate into. So there's no changes that we've implemented in relation to long-term incentive plans or, for that matter, salaries and bonus structures and stuff like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if there are no further questions, let me first of all thank you very much for coming and listening to us. I really appreciate the fact that you've given us so much of your time. I apologize for the hassle it was to get into the building. But given the history of Occupy London wanting to actually make their acquaintance with me, perhaps they were a little bit more concerned than they normally are.</p>
          <p>To make one point, we clearly have to now go to our shareholders and speak to them and take them through the transaction. They all have many questions. That is a process we're going to go through and we're going to go through diligently, and we will be available to discuss any of these issues with all our shareholders and all of you as the time of this transaction takes place. We have a long gestation period. We recognize that. Speak to us if there are issues and we will be able to give you the answers. And again, thank you very much for joining us this morning.</p>
