          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo 2012 First Quarter Results, hosted today by Mr. Enrico Cucchiani, Chief Executive Officer. My name is Neligh and I will be your coordinator for today's conference call. There will be a Q&amp;A session after the prepared remarks. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Enrico Cucchiani. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome and thank you, again, for joining us to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2012. I'm Enrico Cucchiani, and I'm joined by Carlo Messina, General Manager and CFO.</p>
          <p>We last spoke on March 15, at which time we expressed our concern for the unfavorable environment. In the meanwhile, things have not improved, and times remain quite challenging. I anticipated that we were prepared to face strong headwinds and that we were going to follow a strategy of prudence and rigor. We also said we wanted to establish with you a very open relationship based on trust and full transparency.</p>
          <p>We also committed to deliver superior performance. Well, Q1 is now behind us. We have delivered on our promise so far and I believe our approach is paying off. Despite being based in what is labeled as the European periphery, it is comforting to see our bank performing in line or better than international peers from across Europe on several metrics.</p>
          <p>After this introduction, let me move to slide number one. Our conservative and prudent approach is captured by the three initial bullet points of the slide. Core Tier 1 has improved by 40 basis points to 10.5, and that is after pro-rata netting of dividends equal to last year level. As a footnote, I would like to remind you that Intesa Sanpaolo was the seventh-largest highest cash dividend paying bank in Europe.</p>
          <p>EBA capital ratio now stands at 9.6% versus 9.2% at the time of the exercise in September last year. Leverage is deliberately at a low multiple of 18.2, the lowest among peers, in order to reduce volatility and risk. Liquidity is very strong, regardless of LTRO, with LCR, NSFR at or above 100%, already in compliance with Basel 3.</p>
          <p>Economic performance is also good. Net income is up by 21.6% and is at the highest level reached in the past seven quarters. Normalized net income is a solid &#x20AC;746 million. Operating income is up 14.5%. Cost/income is at a very competitive level that is 46%. However, let me throw in a word of caution. It will continue to be good, but this level is not realistically sustainable, at least, until the end of this year. We recognize the gravity of the economic outlook and for that reason we have continued to make very conservative provisioning. We have activated our short-term initiatives discussed in our last call and we will see in detail in the coming slides what we have delivered on the promise.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to slide number three. On this slide you can see that our improved capital strength is accompanied by even stronger increase in eligible assets. Core Tier 1 has improved to a very comfortable level of 10.5% after pro-rata dividend. And the EBA capital ratio has also increased to 9.6%. Unencumbered eligible assets with Central Banks have increased by &#x20AC;21 billion over the quarter to &#x20AC;59 billion, providing us with a deep pool of liquid assets and both LCR and NFSR (sic) [NSFR] at least 100% already in compliance with Basel 3.</p>
          <p>Slide four. As already mentioned, we have positioned ourselves as the most conservative bank among European peers in terms of leverage for reasons outlined in the slide.</p>
          <p>On slide number five, at &#x20AC;804 million, net income is the highest in the last seven quarters and it's 10% ahead of consensus forecast.</p>
          <p>On slide number six, you can see the main contributions to the bottom line. Net interest income has increased by 4.6% and this reflects the impact of the ongoing re-pricing effort. Net fee and commission income was broadly flat quarter-on-quarter, but down 5.6% year-on-year, mainly due to a decrease in commissions from asset management, dealing and advisory.</p>
          <p>Regarding profits on trading, this is an outstanding quarterly result, up by more than 300% quarter on quarter and by 155.7% year-on-year, driven by a &#x20AC;274 million capital gain on the &#x20AC;1.2 billion Tier 1 buy back we carried out. This &#x20AC;274 million before tax translates into &#x20AC;183 million after tax. However, even excluding that gain, trading was up more than 155% quarter-on-quarter and almost 58% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Operating income is up 14.5% year-on-year, &#x20AC;330 million ahead of consensus. Personnel and administrative costs are down versus 2011. Operating margin is up by 32.8% versus 2011, reaching &#x20AC;2.6 billion, that is $360 million ahead of consensus.</p>
          <p>As you will appreciate in a few slides, this growth rate stems out in the European market. After prudent loan loss provisions, the bank was able to grow both in pre-tax profit, plus 21%, that is &#x20AC;260 million ahead of consensus, and in after tax profit plus 21.6%, &#x20AC;76 million ahead of consensus.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, we see an indexed P&amp;L and the year-on-year reference. Our cost/income ratio is now down to 46% from 53% in the first quarter of 2011. Operating margin is a healthy 54%, 8% up from 2011. And my non-banking background leads me to look also at an unconventional ratios, such as return on sales, which is a respectable 32%. On slide number eight, you can see the normalized net income is fairly close to reported net income.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine, this slide shows year-on-year development, I call this slide sources and uses. We have used, as you can see, our trading profits, inclusive of LTRO to ensure substantial provisions.</p>
          <p>On slide number 10, the slide shows the main differences versus last quarter. The highlights are, number one, &#x20AC;543 million contribution from profits on trading, more than in the referenced quarter, of which &#x20AC;274 million related to the buyback, as I said, that is &#x20AC;183 million after tax given that the slide develops around after tax money. Point number two, almost &#x20AC;1 billion of lower loan loss provisions. As you will recall, for 2011, in the last quarter, we built a very strong buffer at the end of the year. Point number three, the Greek govies impaired in the fourth quarter made a difference in 2011. We obviously don't have that in the first quarter of 2012 and that's makes a positive difference.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11, on this slide we see that all business units make a positive contribution, including public finance that in 2011 was negatively affected by Greek bond impairment. Insurance shows a strong improvement. Corporate and investment banking confirms a strong performance. Italian retail suffers from the low interest rate environment, but relative to Q4, 2011 shows a significant improvement.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, after five years of continuous cost reduction, we delivered an additional decrease of operating costs by 1.6%. The aggressive containment measure on administrative expenses, coupled with top line growth, leads to a best-in-class 46% cost/income ratio.</p>
          <p>However, I repeat the words of caution of my introductory remarks, as this level is not sustainable throughout the year. Nonetheless, Intesa Sanpaolo will continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in the European landscape.</p>
          <p>Now, let us turn to slide 13 to address loan loss provisions. The prolonged negative macro environment is generating further credit deterioration, as evidenced by problem loans inflow, which has increased by 25%. To tackle this development, we have beefed up provisions by 43%, keeping non-performing loans coverage ratio at very high level. In the meantime, we have maintained the record-high performing loan reserves at 80 basis points, which is roughly double Italian best practice.</p>
          <p>Page 14. Relative to the Italian market, our share of problem loans is increasing, and recovery ratio remains very healthy and extremely comfortable. In fact, it is improving. By the way, the share of doubtful loans is also influenced by the disposal of doubtful loans, but even without that the improvement is clear. We are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Now, let us turn from the detail to the big picture. As we turn to slide 15, we see that Intesa Sanpaolo on several KPIs is in line or better than international peers. Please take a moment to look at this slide, as this slide speaks for itself. Our peripheral bank performs, on average, better than European peers on several KPIs, except for loan loss provisions, which reflects country-specific environment, as well as a very conservative provisioning. We can gain further evidence of relative performance on the following slides. Let's move on with that benchmarking.</p>
          <p>Return on tangible equity on page 16. Only four players out of the 17 illustrated in this slide have increased their return on tangible equity and ISP is one of the four. That is only three other ones have done better. Furthermore, 18.6%, which is above average is a notable level taking into account the lowest &#x2013; that we have the lowest leverage among European banks. And besides looking at the absolute levels of return on tangible equity, please also look at the discrepancies for the 14 players, which have seen their ratio deteriorating in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, we go to slide number 17, and we can show you in greater detail how we stack up against the competition. On slide 17, we have the delta in operating income, as you can see, out of the sample of 17 banks, ISP is the one with the highest improvement. On slide &#x2013; and by the way, you can see that the majority of the players are actually showing deterioration, which perhaps is also connected to deleveraging.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we have the cost/income ratio, which we have already talked about. The improvement reflects both lower costs as well as a higher denominator that is higher income. As already underlined, within such level of cost/income, not sustainable throughout the year, but we will continue to work to structurally improve our efficiency.</p>
          <p>Slide number 19. When it comes to operating margin, even if you exclude the contribution from the buy back, ISP shows best-in-class increase year on year. Without the buy back, the improvement in operating margin is still 18.8%.</p>
          <p>Now, we can move to slide number 20. Last time we spoke, we made several commitments. First of all, we committed on re-pricing and we delivered. We delivered &#x20AC;120 million of additional revenues. We committed on capital reallocation from EVA negative to EVA positive facilities or customers. We delivered as well. We operated on 10% of the capital generating negative EVA. That is &#x20AC;450 million of capital out of &#x20AC;4.5 billion. And this &#x20AC;450 million of capital generating negative EVA has already been converted to &#x2013; has already become EVA positive.</p>
          <p>We committed on setting up a task force to strengthen non-performing loans management. We now have a task force of 330 FTEs dedicated to this effort. And we have already released &#x20AC;75 million of provisions. We committed on aggressive cost reduction. Well, we delivered with yet another quarter of sharp decrease in administrative costs, minus 3.7% and personnel costs, minus 1.2%.</p>
          <p>We committed to a smart use of LTRO and we delivered with a net present value of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. We can see actually the breakdown in the following slide on page 21. The net present value of &#x20AC;1.1 billion can be broken down, 37% is non-recurring and 63% is recurring.</p>
          <p>How did we use our LTRO liquidity? Nearly 3% of the LTRO that is &#x20AC;1.2 billion has been used for the hybrid buy back. Slightly less than two-third helped us in lowering our cost of funds, slightly more than one-third has been invested in short-term govies, easy to dispose off if needed. The maturity of this govies by the way is only 1.7 years.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude with a few comments on 2012 outlook and commitments as we move to slide number 23. If you allow me I will skip any comment on the transformation journey, which we discussed in the second part, which we talked about last time during the last conference. We will talk about the transformation journey in &#x2013; later on in the year. Let us now look into 2012.</p>
          <p>The macro outlook remains very uncertain and challenging. And frankly, I was hoping last time we talked that it would improve more. We see we are going through the recession and we don't see it ending anytime soon. This will likely generate credit quality deterioration and put the Eurozone under stress, European banks under pressure, while the European political landscape is evolving in unclear direction.</p>
          <p>In this volatile and uncertain environment, we confirm our target. That is Core Tier 1 above 10% and EBA capital ratios above threshold. We confirm that we will pursue conservative leverage levels. We're committed to maintain very strong liquidity and dividend per shares, at least, equal to 2011 level.</p>
          <p>By the way, Q1 net income already matches what is required to keep the promise. All-in-all, Intesa Sanpaolo is a prudently managed bank of the Europe periphery with core Europe performance. Perhaps we are overly conservative, but in this uncertain environment we feel the approach is the best protection against negative surprises. We believe that we have a perfect hedge in case the environment clears up and show signs of sustainable improvement. In that event, we will be &#x2013; have ample resources to step on the throttle and push for a more aggressive strategy.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me reaffirm our commitment to deliver superior performance. And I thank you for your kind attention and we are now ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Domenico Vinci from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have few questions from my side. One on the deposit competition in Italy, it seems to me that remains quite high among Italian banks in general. My question for you is why do you think is not cooling down despite the LTRO support and in spite the fact that other several banks are experiencing a significant loan reduction? And also, when we look at the system data, the deposit base remains stable. Do you see any element that can change these and basically reduce the competition of the fight for deposit in the system?</p>
          <p>My other question is on your sovereign bonds holding, clearly has been increasing in the first quarter as you anticipated. There is any limit in terms of percent on tangible equity that you think is reasonable, so any limit beyond which you will not go?</p>
          <p>And then my question more in general is that you're almost closing your six months in the bank now and you show very strong continuity in managing the bank very conservatively and very firmly. Now, the environment has been deteriorating since probably you joined. So my question for you, is there is any area where you think or you see the management, in terms of start changing something, and if so, which areas? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. I am not sure I heard completely your first two questions and therefore I leave them to Carlo Messina. On the third question, first of all, it's four months that I have &#x2013; since I've joined the bank. You're talking about continuity, I mean, I don't see any element of discontinuity vis-&#xE0;-vis the past. And I think it is warranted under the current environment, if anything probably, we are more conservative &#x2013; given the fact that we are also talking about the first quarter, we are more conservative than in the past when it comes to provisioning, loan loss provisioning. And I don't think that this is an element of discontinuity. I simply think that the environment is worse than in the past and it is uncertain. And it's not that I prefer not to start out thinking that things will improve and if they will not improve, we will adjust in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>We proceed and we do what we deem is fit, regardless of the timing throughout the year, which as I said, we try to be very transparent and very consequential. I think that, however, in these first four months, what you can see and what you can feel within the bank is that I think there is definitely a very strong pressure on performance.</p>
          <p>We've tightened some screws and I like to think that more than an element of discontinuity, this is a necessity under the circumstances. And in any case, it's something that I personally like, I appreciate, I've always done it and is what I enjoy. I mean, we have shown in this short presentation, some benchmarking with the outside. I mean, I don't want this to be an exercise that we perform with you guys on a quarterly basis. I like this to be performed, this sort of benchmarking, on a very local business-by-business basis by every individual manager. Are we already there? Not quite, but we are moving in that direction.</p>
          <p>And I think that we have done &#x2013; we have pursued very aggressively all the changes, what I call the short-term levers, to address performance issues. Under the new normality, we will continue to do so throughout the year and also next year. But in the meantime, we are starting to address some more fundamental changes that will improve our execution capabilities. And as I said before, I will talk about the transformation journey probably next time we talk or let's say in the fall or so. This is basically it, and let me now turn to Carlo Messina for the first two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So looking at the deposit competition, in this quarter, we were able to increase our market share on deposits by 50 basis points, so to 70.4%, despite the reduction in interest we pay on our deposits.</p>
          <p>So we increased our market share on all the different categories of deposits, site deposit, time deposits and bonds. And there is some &#x2013; in my opinion, a flight to quality in this phase in the market. So, for sure, there is competition, but for what Intesa Sanpaolo is concerned, in my opinion, we have no impact on this &#x2013; on the interest rate side. In any case, we are paying interest that is lower than our competitors.</p>
          <p>Considering the second question, so the sovereign bonds portfolio, as you have seen in our presentation, we increased our government bond portfolio by &#x20AC;14 billion, the real point is not the amount of bonds, but is the maturity. So we are ready to increase the portfolio, but with very short maturities. And so, in our opinion, what is very important is the short-term maturity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time for the call this afternoon. And few questions I had. And on the flat operating profit guidance, which you maintained from the last quarter, could you give us a number for that that you referred to? And why do you keep this flat operating profit guidance despite what was a very, very strong trading result, even if we exclude the hybrid buy back? And secondly, last quarter we discussed the outlook for provisions. If I remember correctly, you said the underlying LLP or underlying run rate from 2011 should be the guidance for this, it is about 80, say, 90 basis points, is that still the way you look at things? And last question, when it concerns of the macro outlook, what exactly has changed for you and what has kind of gotten weaker compared to two months ago? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think all three questions are strictly related, macro outlook, let's start on that. Frankly, I see more uncertainty in it. I see more political uncertainty. We have developments in France, developments in Germany. It's not clear what they will lead to. I would say, economic leadership in Europe continues to be a rather elusive notion. I mean very strong from the ECB, but other than the ECB I have doubts on the ability to grasp the economic issues from most politicians.</p>
          <p>The market environment remains extremely volatile. And the Italian economic outlook, well, I am not sure it has made all the improvements that we thought. When we spoke, I was indeed convinced that in LLP of 80, 90 basis points was adequate. Right now, I think that we have to be more cautious than that and least be prepared.</p>
          <p>For the time being, from what we have seen, I feel more comfortable with our provisions. We were also &#x2013; I mean, we were also lucky enough that we had a good performance and we could afford it to do that without any inconvenience. But in any case, what we see developing in the market would be the guiding star, the North Star, in setting provisions.</p>
          <p>Concerning earnings, again, I would just go for a flat level, simply because I see a rather uncertain situation ahead and I see a certain number of clouds. Therefore, I mean, when you are dealing with risk, risk is measurable and you can assess it and you can make a projection. As uncertainty is not a measurable, and in the situation of uncertainty, I prefer not to give forecast that might lead to unnecessary optimism.</p>
          <p>You might say that we are also psychologically conservative and therefore that impairs our effectiveness, frankly speaking, I don't think so. In the way we conduct business, I think we are extremely aggressive, extremely demanding, but on the other side I don't want to live with illusions, I'd like to be prepared for the worst.</p>
          <p>And I don't want to sell unnecessary optimism to our investors. We are in this journey for the long run. And I think &#x2013; and my primary objective is to make sure that we deliver superior performance. I don't know what the market performance will be. What I know is that we on average will deliver above market and we will be distinctive in that respect. Likewise, I don't particularly care about short-term market fluctuations. We are in for the long run and I trust that this is an organization that in the long run will prove &#x2013; will make our investors happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for this comment. Just one follow up on this, when you measure yourself against a flat operating performance target, what is the &#x2013; I mean, what is the euro number behind this? The clean operating profit that we should use as a basis to know what is flat year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd rather not give any guidance on the horizon. Frankly speaking, I mean this &#x2013; the result on the first quarter has been a positive development. I tell you, my &#x2013; and I tell you why, my personal experience, I've been in business and leading companies for many years. I've always found that results have always exceeded my own expectations and I don't want to just dilute anything with any number. Let's stick to the fundamentals.</p>
          <p>I mean, we have seen that on all key parameters the bank has delivered. And again, I am most concerned, what I want to put pressure within the organization is on outperforming the peers, the market at all levels. If we do that then we will continue to do well. If one starts with a figure, then there is the danger of managing figures. We are in the business of managing &#x2013; not of managing figures, but managing business and pushing people to the limit of their capabilities to deliver.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the brevity of the presentation, two quick questions. The first one, the insurance result, I saw it. I was pleasantly surprised. I was wondering to what extend this is due to better markets or there is any fundamental improvement in the operations and therefore there is a component of sustainability?</p>
          <p>The other one, sorry, again, to be going back to provisions, you mentioned obviously that you are conservative, the point well taken. My question is, are you being more conservative, let's say, than peers, just in provisioning or also in recognizing NPLs? Because obviously the year-on-year trend to some extend look a little bit worse at Intesa, not only on P&amp;L, but also on balance sheet. So, I was wondering whether you are applying your caution on both fronts. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me address your questions. On insurance, I believe I haven't really looked at the data of the other insurers, but I believe that the first quarter is a good quarter for Italian insurers. That is one element. But I think that also it's related to our performance. I think we have a good insurance shop right now, first class in life. And I think we will improve it over &#x2013; we will continue to improve it over time and perhaps we will &#x2013; I mean, potentially, we could do well also on P&amp;C. I don't know yet, if we have all the resources to work on that and I don't want to commit on that, but I see that we are improving and that we have a good potential.</p>
          <p>On provisions, I think that we are probably more conservative than the market for sure in provisioning, but I mean &#x2013; and I don't have clear indications about recognizing the situations, but my assumption is that, yes, we are also more conservative on that. Quite frankly, again, I think it's important to be ahead of the curve and the sooner you recognize problems, the better it is.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello, I'm Francesca Tondi. A couple of questions. How do you looking at the Moody's downgrades, not just yourselves, but also some of your local peers? How do you think that may change funding dynamics? And especially, a lot of the local banks in Italy won't be able to access funding certainly for a long time. How do you, in a way, think you're prepared for that? And also, what do you see the impact of your downgrade on the short-term funding side on the CP paper going forward? I know you're covered now. You have a lot of liquidity. More structurally, how you're thinking about it?</p>
          <p>On the second point, asset quality, and then flows of substandards, I'm referring to your slide 54, thanks for the details. I can see actually that federation is starting to kick-in in individuals and in small business. Can you add a little bit of color? It looks as actually mid-corporates, if any &#x2013; if anything are stable or slightly better. What is effectively driving that inversional trend? We've seen unemployment up in Italy, should we worry more about that part of the business? Thank you. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Francesca. I will let Carlo address your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So looking at the downgrading of Moody's, you have to consider that for local banks, in my opinion, there will be no relevant impact apart from the increase in the usage of collateral in order to increase their service to the ECB.</p>
          <p>Considering Intesa Sanpaolo position, we will have an increase probably by &#x20AC;2 billion in our eligible asset that we have to give to ECB, so a reduction in unencumbered eligible asset probably of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>And looking at the commercial paper and other items of our funding structure, I don't see any relevant impact because the substantial of the impact was already embedded in the market. So we are increasing our commercial papers in the last months and, in my opinion, no problem on this point.</p>
          <p>If you look then at the non-performance or the second question, the increase in the inflows that we had in Banca dei Territori and Corporate Investment division, the real point is the increase that we had in the Corporate Investment division was mainly related to product company, to the leasing companies, and other items related to Banca dei Territori was mainly on the small business and individuals, but it is typical of the cycle, but not so relevant in this phase of the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then what &#x2013; any specific problem with leasing, because I think that naturally the product companies are driving more of the increase there?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it is only the little firm that we have Centro Leasing. So it is not the leasing entity, but Centro Leasing that is under structure. So it is the little company of Carifirenze that is now incorporated. It is now in the process of being managed into the leasing business unit, and so that is the increase in the substandard that is related to this management within the leasing business unit, but no relevant item.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First of all, a question on slide number 20, on the recurring benefit of the ECB, LTRO. If you can explain in which sense there is a recurring benefit, considering that the financing has an expiry of three years, just for the sake of clarity?</p>
          <p>And second question on the dividend of the savings shares, because last year you paid the dividend using reserves. And I have noticed that another Italian listed company that did the same some years ago, the following year had to pay the normal dividend and also the minimum dividend that didn't pay the year before. So just a clarification, if next year we can expect, for the savings, on top of the $0.05 at least that you mentioned, also the $0.026 of ordinary dividend that was not paid in 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So we can start from the LTRO, and you have to consider that the recurring items of these benefits were considered only taking into account the real money that we can derive from the investment or from the repayment of hybrid that we made in the first quarter. So looking at the recurring, we have two items. The first one is the interest margin on the bond portfolio. So on the carry trade in the government bond portfolio it is roughly &#x20AC;200 million per year. And so it is the first part of the recurring items. And the other one is the reduction in cost of funding deriving from the reimbursement of the hybrid through the buy back that is roughly in the range of &#x20AC;70 million per year. So these are the two relevant part of the non-recurring &#x2013; of the recurring item. So we didn't use any kind of comparison with opportunity cost is, for sure, a comparison with a real money that we paid in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe you wanted answer also the one on the saving shares. However, I mean, it's fairly technical &#x2013; a fairly complex explanation that you can find on our website precisely. So, if you want, we'll answer you briefly. But, I mean, if you go on the website, I'm sure you can see it more precisely and is probably in the interest of time more efficient, as you wish.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is the usual update on your hedging facility. If I'm not wrong, in the first quarter, the positive impact was in the tune of &#x20AC;280 million. If I understand properly, the overall amount under hedging should be still close to &#x20AC;56 billion, &#x20AC;57 billion, so just a confirmation on this?</p>
          <p>Second question is on net interest income. The second quarter, apart from the different calendar, should experience similar driver compared to the first one? I mean declining Euribor, a stronger support from hedging, a marginal positive volume impact &#x2013; probably what is going to impact more in the second quarter is the stronger support from the LTRO. So my question is, is this enough in order to have a net interest income growing in the second quarter, or we'll have dynamic similar to the one experienced in the first one? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So looking at the hedging facilities, the figures are the one you mentioned is &#x20AC;56 billion of hedging facilities and the average interest rate, so I can add this information, is 2.7%. So this is the two elements of our hedging facilities for the first quarter with a contribution of &#x20AC;280 million to this margin. As far as the quarter, we do not comment on the quarterly basis of the net interest margin, but, for sure, you have to consider that markdown will have also another negative impact from the Euribor in the first part of this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to conclude, it seems like, in any case, the negative impact from the Euribor is going to be weaker, let's say, compared to the one experienced in the first one. So without asking you any direction for the net interest income, is it, in any case, proper to assume that the net effect of the LTRO in the second quarter &#x2013; is going to be stronger in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is correct. It is correct.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions similar to what has been already asked, but I would like a bit of clarifications, LTRO and insurance. On the LTRO, do you consider the allocation of the funds, you have given in the slide 20, an equilibrium, or will you still progressively invest more and more of the funds into government bonds? And so should we expect further pace up of contribution quarter-after-quarter?</p>
          <p>The second is on insurance, with effectively doubling results year-on-year, can you give us &#x2013; explain what the trends are behind that and give us an update of technical results in Q1 and the revolution in the last quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So looking at the LTRO, as I told in previous question, we are now using the funds, &#x20AC;14 billion, just in order to increase our short-term government bonds. We are ready to increase again our short-term government bonds portfolio. You have to consider that we are in a very good condition looking at liquidity. And so, if we'll have in excess of liquidity, it is possible to use in order to increase the government portfolio. We will see in the next months.</p>
          <p>Looking at the insurance results, so the results from our insurance companies, the result has increased due to the operating performance and also due to the financial performance and a relevant part of is albeit was through realized profit on the government bond portfolio in the insurance company.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two questions on my side, one is on the hedging again and the other one is on loan loss provisions. On the hedging, I understand your position is obviously dynamic and you hedge depending on what you see in the market. However, in an hypothetical scenario, where you were to leave the position as it is as of now, what percentage of the underlying hedging will mature by year end and what percentage next year, just to have an idea of evolution of net interest income going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question is on loan loss provisions, which was clearly the grey spot in this set of results. I understand from your earlier comments, you are more cautious going forward. I just wanted to know if anything has changed in the way you actually book impaired loans throughout the quarters. Historically, we have always seen at Intesa Sanpaolo a spike in Q4 in terms of loan loss provisions and classifications and more often than not also a spike in Q2. So my question to wrap it up is, should we still expect these seasonal spikes to happen from a P&amp;L point of view, or you have changed something in the classification criterias that should make the loan loss provisions throughout the year more even? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrea, thank you for your questions. Let me take the &#x2013; your question on loan loss provisions and I'll leave the hedging question to Carlo. First of all, you say it's a grey spot. I'm not so sure whether it's a grey spot. It is a grey spot or perhaps even more worse than grey if you look at the overall economy. But if you look at us, frankly, I don't see &#x2013; I don't look at it as a grey &#x2013; as a grey spot. Comment number one, we don't manage by spikes. We do provisions according to what we see fit, what we see as the necessary level of prudent provisioning. That is we don't wait for the last quarter. So it doesn't mean that if you see a &#x20AC;100 million now, you will see &#x20AC;120 million in the last quarter, okay, unless we have an additional further deterioration that at this stage we cannot envision.</p>
          <p>We see a problem. If you look at the chart, now, I don't remember which number, but I would tell you in a second. You look at page number 13, you see the doubtful and substandard loans increased by 25% and loan loss provisions increased by 43%, that should be a clear answer.</p>
          <p>I think there is another perhaps underlying more subtle question, would we eventually use all the provisions we have given, particularly given the fact that we have a huge, by market standards, provision against performing loans? We have 80 basis points that were against the market best practice of 40 basis points. The answer is, we would if we were to see a clear improvement in the economy. We know that there are other banks in Italy that have already started to release significant amounts of provisions.</p>
          <p>We don't do that because, A, we don't think that is appropriate. B, especially, we don't see the prerequisites for doing so. The economy is not clearing up. So we are not releasing any reserves. And this is something that in my opinion you should bear in mind, when you say that, to what you said, you said it's a grey spot, quite frankly, we could have used a lower level of provisioning and probably wouldn't have looked as grey or would have looked clearer, would the underlying reality been clearer, no. I think this is frankly the &#x2013; I would say, a conservative grey, if you wish. But, no, we do not intentionally mean to manage our reserving policy according to the calendar.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So coming back on hedging, as you know, the result of the hedging facility will depend on the interest rate of reinvestment, and as I told you is 2.7% will depend on the amount and it is &#x20AC;56 billion, will depend on the Euribor. So supposing that Euribor will remain at this level, in 2013, we will have a very similar contribution to the one that we had in this year. And if you want just to make a forecast, you can consider 10% reduction in each year for the next two years.</p>
