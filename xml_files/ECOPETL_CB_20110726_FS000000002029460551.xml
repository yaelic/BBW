          <p>Thank you, Alejandro, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the conference call. In slide five, please. The company made significant progress in its growth strategies reaching a new record in production and achieving solid operating and financial results. During the first half of 2011, gross production of the Corporate Group rose 20% compared to the same period of 2010, reaching an average production of 707,000 barrels equivalent of oil per day. January 24th, 12,000 barrels per day were added to Ecopetrol's Group, equivalent to 51% of Equi&#xF3;n's production.</p>
          <p>Regarding transportation, we increased our pipeline shipping capacity for crude and products by 10% and 16% respectively due to the conclusion of several infrastructure projects. These excellent operating results and the favorable price environment resulted in higher net income, greater margins and EBITDA. Net income in the first six months of 2011 amounted to COP$6.8 trillion, a 75% increase compared to the first half of 2010. EBITDA was COP$13.3 trillion, equivalent to an EBITDA margin of 51%.</p>
          <p>In slide six, we have summarized the execution of our investment plan. The investments in the first half of the year amounted to $3.4 billion, 77% more than in the same period of 2010, driven by higher investments in production and exploration, transportation and subsidiaries. 44% of the investment was allocated to production projects, 16% to subsidiaries, 13% to payments for acquisitions from previous years, 10% to transportation, 7% to new businesses, 5% to exploration, 4% to refining and petrochemicals and the remaining 1% was allocated to corporate initiatives and the supply and marketing segment. That investment in acquisitions and new businesses amounted to $678 million and includes the earn outs agreed on Hocol and OIG acquisitions, final payment for Equi&#xF3;n, the payment of rights on the Ca&#xF1;o Limon-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline and the increase of our stake in Ca&#xF1;o Sur block among others.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn the call to H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva, who will comment on Q2 results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In slide seven we have summarized the milestone of our upstream activity. During the first six months of 2011 nine exploratory wells were drilled by Ecopetrol in Colombia; Rumbero, Nunda, Puertos, Kaxan Norte, Mito, Pinocho, Fauno, Fontana and Rio Zulia West, four stratigraphic wells <mark type="ph" /> Amber-3 (6:13), Jaspe-3, <mark type="ph" /> Tufam-1 (6:15) and El Valle-1 and one appraisal well Jaspe-2.</p>
          <p>Of the nine exploratory wells drilled in 2011, Mito-1 and Nunda-1 tested hydrocarbons presence as well as Tinkhana well. This was drilled in 2010, but only reported hydrocarbon presence in February of this year and Fauno-1 well located in the Ca&#xF1;o Sur block where we announced evidence of hydrocarbon on July 5, 2011.</p>
          <p>Other two exploratory wells Puertos-1 and Kaxan Norte-1 were dry and the remaining wells were on evaluation phase as of June 30. Regarding the stratigraphic wells Jaspe-3 shows evidence of hydrocarbons <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:15) one well being evaluated.</p>
          <p>Hocol, our Colombian subsidiary drilled Clarinero Sur wells. This was declared dry. On the other hand, Granate-1 well is under evaluation as well as three stratigraphic wells on the CPO17 block. Internationally, our subsidiary Savia Per&#xFA; drilled exploratory wells in the Peruvian offshore finding evidence of hydrocarbons in Santa Teresa and Santa Catalina wells, while Lobitos was dry.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 2011, the Agua Viva well was being drilled in Brazil in addition of the Logan well in the U.S. Gulf Coast spread. Regarding our production during the first half of year 2011, the Corporate Group achieved a record production of 707,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day rising 20% compared to the same period in 2010.</p>
          <p>Ecopetrol accounts 655,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, Hocol 31,000 barrels, Equi&#xF3;n 12,000 barrels per day, Ecopetrol's stake in Savia 7,000 barrels per day and 2,000 per day &#x2013; equivalent per day from Ecopetrol America. Ecopetrol&#xB4;s production growth was driven by the rise in Castilla and Chichimene fields, which account for an average production of 111,000 barrels and 25,000 barrels per day respectively.</p>
          <p>Rubiales and Quifa fields added to Ecopetrol a gross output of 105,000 barrels per day, Cravo Norte 59,000 barrels per day, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:33) 25,000 barrels per day, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:37) 19,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn the call to Alvaro Casta&#xF1;eda, who will present the highlights in the Transportation segment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Let's move on to slight eight to review the main facts in Transportation. Group transportation capacity grew 10% between the first six months of 2010 and the same period of 2011. This was due to the increases in capacity at Apiay-Porvenir and Rubiales-Monterrey pipelines together with improved operational efficiency in the transportation system. Products transportation capacity grew 16% coming from the beginning of operations of Poliducto Andino with a total capacity of 53,000 barrels per day of diluent.</p>
          <p>Total volume of goods and products transportation also rose 16% reaching 1,181,000 barrels per day, of which 76,000 accounts for crude. The loss in volumes came from distension in Ocensa to 550,000 barrels per day. Crude volumes transported by truck reached 49,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011, 51% more than in the same period of the previous year. And internally, 43,000 barrels per day of crude were also up 27% when compared with the first half of the 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding Ocensa's open season required for capacity on the Ship or Pay contracts were below the minimum required, to entertain the expansion to 660,000 barrels per day, therefore Ocensa will consider additional development in order to undergo the financial discipline. As of June 30, 2011, these internally financed volumes achieved a progress of 9.91% on Phase I along with the increase and optimization of infrastructure <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:26) unloading trucks and storage facility in Banad&#xED;a.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the presentation to Pedro Rosales, who will comment on Downstream results, starting with refining.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to slide nine. The operating results of refineries were favored by better margins of products versus WTI, the higher volumes sold, the implementation of cost control initiatives and the optimization of operational processes. The through-put in the Barrancabermeja refinery increased 6% in the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, due to the growing production of low sulfur diesel by the hydro-treatment plant and a higher utilization factor of cracking units.</p>
          <p>The accumulated growth margin for the Barrancabermeja refinery was $6.96 or about an 81% growth compared to $3.85 per barrel in the first six months of 2010. The reserve margin in 2011 was explained by the strong WTI expressed for products compared to the cost of crude. The board of directors gave its authorization to make the investments required for the modernization project of the Barrancabermeja refinery Phase III with an estimated total CapEx of US$3.4 billion. That project will improve the refinery profitability in the medium and long-term, increasing the commercial factor to 95%, producing more valuable and higher quality products.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the refinery will allow larger volume of heavy crudes. As of June 30, the Cartagena expansion and operating projects recorded a 36% progress. The main goals of this project are to provide these refineries with a wide flexibility to lower cost crudes to produce high quality products, to support the petrochemical development and the whole capacity. Finally, the master plan to improving those services in Barrancabermeja advanced 37% in the first six months of this year.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 10 to review the main results in supply and marketing. The rise in the oil prices due to the political situation in the Middle East and North Africa had a positive effect in our results. The crude export basket price increased 39%, the products export basket 38%, and the natural gas basket 33%, all of them compared to the first half of 2010. Our sales volumes grew 14% compared to the first six months of 2010. Export sales accounted for 56% and local sales were 44% of total sales. Exported volume, excluding sales towards free trade zone increased to 37%, driven by the higher sales of Castilla crude.</p>
          <p>In June as part of our strategy to increase sales to Far East, the first cargo of 2 million barrels was shipped from the Port of Cove&#xF1;as. The main destinations of our exports were the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Far East and the Caribbean. The exports of products, excluding sales towards the free trade zone increased 14% because the Magdalena River was navigable for shipping fuel oil from Barrancabermeja refinery to the parts of the Atlantic Coast.</p>
          <p>Natural gas exports increased sharply due to the absence in 2011 of regulatory restrictions as those that prioritize the domestic market supply during the dry season of 2010. Finally, local sales volume dropped 7% during the first half of the year, mainly due to lower natural gas demand from thermal power generators and fewer deliveries of propane and LPG due to damaged lines during the rainy season.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation again to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez who will comment on the milestones of the internal consolidation initiatives in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>In slide 11, according to the latest ranking of Barron's Magazine, Ecopetrol is one of the 100 most respected companies in the world. In addition, Ecopetrol was listed in 444th place in the ranking of the Fortune 500 largest companies in the world published on July 9, 2011. Ecopetrol is the first Colombian company included in these lists. Savings in supply chain amounted to COP$188 billion year to-date. Regarding HSE performance, in the first six months of 2011 there were 17 environmental incidents due to the operational cover compared to the 19 events in the same period of 2010, also a 4% reduction in accidents was accomplished. Finally the annual shareholder meeting was held in March 24 with an attendance of more than 8,500 shareholders.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation to Adriana Echeverri who will comment on the financial results for the first half of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Let's move to slide 13. In the first half of 2011, financial results continue to be <mark type="ph" /> southward trend (19:53) to produce historically high revenues, net income, and EBITDA. Higher crude oil prices in our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:00) led to a growth of 47% in total sales when compared to the first half of 2010. Export sales were 71%, excluding sales to Reficar's free trade zone. Total cost of sales plus operating expenses grew 29%, mainly due to the rise of 30% by other costs as a result of a larger volume of products imported and purchases of hydrocarbons from ANH at higher prices.</p>
          <p>The rising crude level triggered the price in hydrocarbon transportation service. In addition there was a rise of amortization and depletion expenses coming from investments in the upstream segment. Fixed costs grew 13%, and is due to higher depreciation and contracted services to support the rising levels of production. Operating expenses increased 55% compared to the first six months of 2010, mainly due to the rise in exploration and seismic surveys expenses, non-successful activities and the investment in new exploratory assets. As a result of the aforementioned, operating income amounted to almost COP$11 trillion in the first half of 2011, an 85% increase compared to the same period of 2010 reaching an operating margin of 41%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the non-operating results, there was a net loss of COP$755 billion mainly due to hedging operations and crude differentials and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:41). These expenditures were partially offset by the income coming from subsidiaries accounted under the equity method. Net income finally amounted to COP$6.8 trillion, 75% higher than the first six month of 2010 where EBITDA amounted to COP$15 trillion.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide 14, where we present our financial results by segment. Exploration and Production segment reported COP$6.6 trillion of net income in the first half of 2011, led by the continued increase in crude oil production and higher prices of the export crude basket. EBITDA came COP$12 trillion. Refining and Petrochemical segment operation &#x2013; operating results improved compared to the first six months of 2010, due to the strong price differential between crude and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:48) and the cost control initiatives. The segment reported an EBITDA of COP$370 billion and a net loss of COP$152 billion, 59% lower than in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Transportation segment generated a net income of COP$262 billion and an EBITDA of COP$537 billion driven by higher transported volumes and the beginning of operations of Poliducto Andino and the expansion of transport capacity of Ocensa to 5,060,000 barrels per day. Finally, in the first six months of 2011, the supply and marketing segment reported a net income of COP$72 billion due to better differentials on crude trading. EBITDA amounted to COP$303 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to slide 15, where we find <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:52) as of the end of June of this year. Initial balance for year 2011 was COP$5.5 trillion. Operations generated additional cash of COP$24.7 trillion and other sources added COP$600 billion. These sources were then mainly operations were COP$16.3 trillion. CapEx was COP$4.3 trillion and dividends was COP$2 trillion bringing the ending cash balance as of June 30, COP$7.9 trillion.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, total assets amounted to COP$74 trillion and total liabilities to COP$32 trillion. We continue to have a low level of indebtedness. Financial debt was equivalent to 8.7% of total assets and to 20.1% of total liabilities, where debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the last 12 months was 0.29. Liabilities grew 35% when compared to the end of 2010, mainly due to dividend to be paid and a net worth cap on the capital charge to set between 2011 and 2014. Finally, during the second quarter of 2011 Fitch ratings raised Ecopetrol's ratings to investment grade for foreign and local currencies to BBB minus and BBB respectively. During the first quarter of 2011, <mark type="ph" /> the finance (25:38) was also raising its rating on Ecopetrol's investment grade. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:45) to Ecopetrol since 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to Slide 16 for an overview of the main results of our Corporate Groups. The results for the Corporate Group for the first six months of 2011 were stronger than those in the same period of 2010. Total pay for the Corporate Group amounted to COP$31 trillion, which is 50% higher than at the end of June of 2010. Group's net income amounted to COP$6.9 trillion, which represents an 86% increase with respect to the first six months of last year, whereas EBITDA was COP$14 trillion and EBITDA margins reached 47% which is 80% higher than the first six months of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the current slide, number 17, we have some results of our subsidiaries. As of June of 2011, the main contribution to revenues before elimination came from Reficar with COP$3 trillion, Hocol with COP$1.8 trillion and Equi&#xF3;n with COP$919 billion. Higher net income was reported by Hocol of COP$317 billion followed by Equi&#xF3;n with COP$73 billion and Ocensa with COP$31 billion. The figures for the highest EBITDA were Hocol with COP$577 billion, Ocensa with COP$199 billion and Equi&#xF3;n with COP$179 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I turn again the presentation to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's move to slide 19. The goals announced by Ecopetrol for 2011, remains unchanged. In exploration, we expect to drill 37 exploratory wells. Average fuel production for 2011 should reach 750,000 barrels per day, mainly driven by the growth of &#x2013; by the growth in our fields Castilla, Chichimene, Rubiales, Casabe and La Cira. In transportation, we will continue carving out the crude evacuation program, and along with our partners we will complete the first stage of the Bicentennial pipeline by the second quarter of 2012. Also, Oleoducto de los Llanos capacity between Rubiales and Porvenir will be expanded by 200,000 barrels per day among other relevant projects.</p>
          <p>In Refining, we expect to begin the construction phase of the modernization project of Barrancabermeja refinery and reach a 65% progress in the upgrading and expansion projects at the Cartagena refineries. In the marketing segment, we will continue diversifying the international market for our crude products. On Biofuels, we will continue construction of the ethanol plant of Bioenergy through an EPC. Finally, given the rising levels of production and the current trends on price of crude products, Ecopetrol should maintain solid financial results.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This is Juan Pi&#xF1;eros from Interbolsa. I have two questions for you. First, can we have more information regarding the exploration in Brazil about the Itauna wells and the new Agua Viva wells, and also some more information about the Logan well in the U.S. Gulf Coast? Second question, are you going to undertake the contingent projects for 2011? I mention this because the capital expenditure seems to fall short of the total cap expected for the year. And third, can you give us more details about the exploration campaign in Ca&#xF1;o Sur and you're looking for what plans? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Juan. How is it going? First question regarding the exploration in Brazil, we plan to drill Itauna-2 hopefully by the end of this year. Regarding Agua Viva the well is suspended at this moment waiting for approval from the NEP. And Logan, we are &#x2013; we have recently certificating according to the program, okay. Regarding &#x2013; you're question regarding the Ca&#xF1;o Sur exploration, we planned to drill in the remaining from the year between 10 to 12 exploratory wells. As you know, we reported some hydrocarbon presence in some of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In relation with the timing to the contingency for the investments, if you remember, we had an approval of the Board of Directors of $8.545 billion of which approximately $1.8 billion was for contingency project. It is important to mention that the Board of Directors has been approved different projects through the year. Different projects for production, also for exploration and also for transportation. And additionally we postponed $200 million for 2012. In that sense, practically the largest part of the contingency has been already approved. And I mentioned $200 million was postponed to 2012 in that way right now our target in terms of the investment for the Ecopetrol as a company is $8.350 billion approximately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good afternoon, everyone. Subho from Morgan Stanley. Two quick questions here. Can you tell us how many rigs you intend to operate next year in Colombia only?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How many rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, how many rigs.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, if you could give us a bit more clarity about this &#x2013; the hedging policy. First, the second quarter, the company if I'm not mistaken reported around COP$500 billion loss related to hedging contracts. I was just wanted to know if you could give us a bit of a clarity about the amount that has been hedged and at what price and what would be the duration of the contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Adriana is going to take the last question in just a minute in relation with the number of rigs for the next year. Okay. Just a minute, we're looking for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding the hedging transactions, first we have to remember that there is a GAAP difference between Colombian Accounting Principles and U.S. Accounting Principles. Under U.S. Accounting Principles you account for hedging transactions along with the hedging &#x2013; along with the trading operations. Here in Colombia, according to the Colombian entity GAAP we have to account for all the hedging operations in the non-operated items of our P&amp;L. That's why you find that so <mark type="ph" /> awkward (37:28). If we were go &#x2013; to be accounting under U.S. GAAP, the difference would be probably even COP$1.2 billion that is what you had in mind.</p>
          <p>So at the end what we have is a policy for the company since 1999, where &#x2013; what &#x2013; we try to do to protect our customer from oil price volatilities. Then every year we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:53) and therefore we try to hedge the more different <mark type="ph" /> variable set (37:59) maybe try to attempt to our customers. This year there was a swap spread having strategy that was contracted from January until December. The total volume, I don't have it right now, but at the end what happened is that since we are trying to hedge the price differentials between WTI and our heavy crude oil, then even the &#x2013; a typical behavior of crude oil prices and WTI and then the behavior of that hedging is not what we were supposed to have at the end. What we have are more revenues coming from our sales and exports, but the hedging cost of COP$531 billion and in the non-operated cost. The most part of those COP$531 billion come from the second quarter, which was COP$444 billion and that is more or less what is happening here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Adriana. I think I got the big picture of it. Maybe I should take this offline and kind of understand this in a bit more detail. I will contact you later after the call, thanks. And as far as the number of rigs did you have it or otherwise I will take that later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Enrique Vel&#xE1;squez, Exploration VP. We are in the process to define our drilling campaign for this year, including development as well as exploration wells. We plan &#x2013; we have a ballpark number between 40 to 45 rigs. Hopefully maybe in a couple of months, we have a better number regarding the rigs but I would say &#x2013; let's just say between 40 to 45, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how does that compare with the rigs you currently own, or you currently operate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is an increase around 10%. 10% to 15%.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we expect increase in production in the same tune 10%, 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are committed of having an increase of at least 12% is our commitment or where we are mentioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a CAGR</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we are &#x2013; excuse me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm just saying that the 12% is the implied CAGR to reach the million barrels target 2015 right?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Okay. Now I have the slide for the swap $80 per barrel for the <mark type="ph" /> swap (41:23) and the total volume was 30 million barrels for the whole year. That is supposed to be spread in the 12 month of the year.</p>
