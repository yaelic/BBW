          <p>Disclaimer: This presentation contains forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Deutsche Telekom management with respect to future events. They include, among others, statements as to market potential, and financial guidance statements, as well as our dividend outlook. They are generally identified by the words "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "estimate," "aim," "goal," "plan," "will," "seek," "outlook" or similar expressions and include generally any information that relates to expectations or targets for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, earnings, operating profitability or other performance measures, as well as personnel related measures and reductions.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections. You should consider them with caution. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond Deutsche Telekom's control, including those described in the sections "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" of the company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Among the relevant factors are the progress of Deutsche Telekom's workforce reduction initiative, and the impact of other significant strategic or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and business combinations and cost-saving initiatives. In addition, regulatory rulings, stronger than expected competition, technological change, litigation and supervisory developments, among other factors, may have a material adverse effect on costs and revenue development.</p>
          <p>Further, an economic downturn in Europe or North America, and changes in exchange and interest rates may also have an impact on our business development and availability of capital under favorable conditions. If these or other risks and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, Deutsche Telekom's actual results may be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Telekom can offer no assurance that its expectations or targets will be achieved. Deutsche Telekom does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to take new information or future events into account or otherwise. Deutsche Telekom does not reconcile its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a GAAP measure, because it would require unreasonable effort to do so.</p>
          <p>As a general matter, Deutsche Telekom does not predict the net effect of future special factors because of their uncertainty. Special factors and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including impairment losses can be significant to Deutsche Telekom's results. In addition to figures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Deutsche Telekom presents non-GAAP financial performance measures, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted net profit, free cash flow, gross debt and net debt. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP financial performance measures are not subject to IFRS, or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies may define these terms in different ways.

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2007 conference call of Deutsche Telekom's results. I would like to hand over to Ren&#xE9; for the presentation on the Group progress we made in 2007, and thereafter Dr. Eick will speak about the financials, and as always, we then will end up with the Q&amp;A session. Ren&#xE9;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon to everyone. 2007 was a successful year for Deutsche Telekom, and I'll give you five points to introduce this session, or to begin the session. The first is, we increased Group revenues by 3.6%, if you exclude currency impacts, by 3.6% or &#x20AC;2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>We did stabilize our EBITDA. And if you exclude currency impacts, we even increased it 2.2 billion to &#x20AC;19.6 but, including currency effects, we ended up with 19.3, which was over-accomplishing our target of 19.</p>
          <p>We've significantly increased free cash flow by 4.5% to &#x20AC;6.6 billion. Our debt capital market standing is stable despite the subprime crisis. And last point, we've raised the dividend recommendation by over 8%, so bottom line, five key points indicate that 2007 was a very successful year.</p>
          <p>Twelve months ago, I presented to you our "Fix, focus and grow" strategy. And as part of this presentation, we did set out clear performance targets for Deutsche Telekom in '07. We have delivered, I'm pleased to say that, on our commitments. Adjusted Group EBITDA of &#x20AC;19.3 billion and free cash flow of 6.6 are both ahead of target. Our commitment on attractive dividend policy is reflected in the proposed increase from 0.72 to &#x20AC;0.78, which we announced in December.</p>
          <p>The cost savings programs are being implemented. Save for Service has delivered gross cost savings of &#x20AC;2.3 billion against the target of 2 billion. In domestic BBFN, the net cost reduction of &#x20AC;0.9 billion can be reported and it's exactly on the targeted level. At the same time, we've successfully developed our German business. We have achieved a market share of DSL net adds of 44%. That's very close to the top end of our target range which was 40 to 45%, and we launched our second brand, Congstar, only last summer with about 200,000 customers at the end of last month. That means, in about six months, the brand has been established.</p>
          <p>In Mobile, the objective of growing internationally is reflected in both the strong organic development, where we have international contract net adds of over 5 million, and in the strategic acquisitions we've made i.e., Orange Netherlands and SunCom in the US, SunCom just closed last Friday, and it's now being consolidated as of March 1st.</p>
          <p>In the Business Customers segment, we are in an advanced stage of negotiations with respect to a partnering deal for the area of system integration. We expect to reach a solution over the next days or weeks, at the latest. Reducing costs, improving service quality and product leadership and innovation are central to improving our competitive position in Germany. We have not only delivered on our target for DSL market share, we've also managed a successful retention policy. 85% of our DSL customers are now on long-term contracts. In Triple Play specifically, 150,000 customers had signed up as year end closed, 220,000 were already connected.</p>
          <p>For 2008, BBFN management is aiming for 500,000 Triple Play customers in total. I'll talk about service quality in a moment, but let me just draw your attention to the margins at broadband fixed line. These margins improved sequentially throughout the year, from 32% in Q1 to 36% in Q4.</p>
          <p>In German Mobile, we saw the successful launch of the iPhone in November and in the year overall, we've had robust contract customer growth with nearly 1 million net adds. A core part of improving competitiveness in Germany is addressing our cost base. Here we achieved a reduction of approximately 8% in the adjusted domestic personnel expenses to a total of &#x20AC;9.5 billion in '07 from somewhat over 10.2 billion in '06. Next slide?</p>
          <p>2007 was, for our DSL business, very successful. We were able to stabilize our retail market share, which has now culminated at around 47%. During the year, we achieved 2 million retail DSL net adds, with 526,000 in the fourth quarter alone. That was the fifth consecutive quarter where our share of broadband net adds in Germany was at, or even above, 40%. The number of DSL net adds is more or less equal to the level of PSTN line losses, which for the year were just over the 2 million mark. As the regulator is determined to reduce our market share in that area further, we should expect this decline to continue.</p>
          <p>When I presented the new strategy to you last year, I emphasized the importance that I placed on improving the quality of service to our customers. I am therefore particularly pleased with the progress we've made to-date, despite the disruption caused by the strike earlier in 2007.</p>
          <p>We have exceeded the demanding targets that we set in each of our four categories. Over two-thirds of calls are now answered within 20 seconds. The deadline compliance is up to 82%. And IT stability has also increased to more than 100 hours. And ordering handling time is now down to only 1.5 or 1.4 days. So, the development of our domestic sales operation, as well as our service operation has also progressed well, and is ahead of target. We now have over 800 Telekom shops and the number of Telekom partners has increased to over 1000.</p>
          <p>At T-Mobile Germany, contract net adds grew by nearly 1 million during the year, which is an increase of over 20% year-on-year. Over the same period, contract churn remained stable at a low level of 1.2% for the year as a whole, and an even lower 1% in Q4. Max flat customers now number nearly some 940,000 and we have close to 100,000 myFaves customers domestically and the service was launched in October '07.</p>
          <p>The improvement in contract minutes of use per customer that we had highlighted in previous quarters continued, and overall, increased by around 10% year-on-year. Total MOU increased even more strongly by 17% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the detail of our personnel restructuring. We've made considerable progress and we achieved significant cost savings in 2007. Gross domestic head count was reduced by 14,400, which translates into a net reduction of just over 11,000. That means that by the end of '07, we had, within two years, reduced our head count by 26,500 on a gross base, since we introduced the 32,000 staff reduction program in 2006.</p>
          <p>We have also reduced our employment of temporary and external staff, which fell by approximately 5000 in 2007 versus 2006, especially at T-Home. However, the full impact of this will only be seen from 2008 onwards. The financial impact of all of this is reflected in a significant reduction in adjusted domestic personnel expenses, which decreased by approximately 8% from 10.2, or beyond 10.2 to &#x20AC;9.5 billion in 2007.</p>
          <p>In addition, other developments we have implemented will result in further reductions in personnel numbers. This includes the transfer to Nokia Siemens of over 1600 employees from VTS in January, from Vivento Technical Services in January. The sale of Media &amp; Broadcast, which will result in the deconsolidation of around 1200 employees in Q1, and the deconsolidation of five call center locations next month, which will involve around 640,000 call center &#x2013; Vivento call center service employees. We also took a &#x20AC;1.4 billion provision in the fourth quarter of last year for further staff restructuring in Germany, predominantly for early retirement for civil servants.</p>
          <p>Next slide, management update on 'Grow abroad with mobile.' T-Mobile's international business continued its double-digit revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Revenues increased by over 12% year-on-year and adjusted EBITDA by almost 18%. These figures do include the consolidation of PTC and tele.ring for the first time. Specific developments during the year were the acquisition of Orange Nederland, which significantly improved our position in the Netherlands, where we are now the number two player, and b) the acquisition of SunCom, which strengthens T-Mobile's US footprint by increasing its operations to 98 of the top 100 markets, and c) the network sharing agreement with 3 in the UK which should lead to savings of over &#x20A4;1 billion over the next 10 years for us.</p>
          <p>Next slide is US. Before I refer to the slide on the T-Mobile US developments in Q4 and 2007, let me stress some points which are really important. We did not see an impact of the weak economy, nor the subprime crisis yet. Neither has bad debt risen, nor did we see any weakness in subscriber numbers in Q4. The US$99 price plans announced affect less than 2% of our subscriber base in the US. I repeat that. The $99 plans affect less than 2% of our subscriber base in the US. We are confident on our growth at T-Mobile US also for 2008, and we have committed ourselves to a 3 million net add figure for this year.</p>
          <p>Now, back to '07. T-Mobile US had another very successful year, with service revenues up 16.6 year-on-year in dollar terms, and adjusted EBITDA up 13.7%. The margin expanded slightly to almost 28% in '07. ARPU was again strong, with both blended and contract up $1 to 51 and $57, respectively. Contract churn continued to come down, in particular as a result of the introduction of two-year contracts. For 2007 as a whole, contract churn amounted to less than 3%, 1.9, down from 2.2 in '06. T-Mobile USA had more than 3.6 million net adds, up from 3.4 million in '06, of which 74% were new contract customers. In Q4 specifically, the company added 951,000 new customers, of which 733,000 were contract, up by more than 30% from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Over the last 18 months, T-Mobile USA has introduced a number of unique differentiated products, which have done extremely well in the marketplace. Let me just mention myFaves, which now has 5 million customers, or FlexPay, the unique hybrid product offering, which offers more value to certain customer groups, while limiting our risk exposure, or HotSpot @Home, the very successful UMA product of T-Mobile USA.</p>
          <p>Just last week, we launched the latest iteration of this product, called HotSpot @Home Talk Forever Home Phone, initially in two markets in Dallas and Seattle, which allows customers to connect their regular home phones to their T-Mobile WiFi router. We also launched a $99 individual unlimited plan which includes unlimited voice and messaging.</p>
          <p>Let me emphasize that we consider the ARPU risk from this plan to be minimum considering that less than 2% of our customers are currently paying $99 or more for their rate plan. If this plan proves to be popular, it could even be ARPU-enhancing as we attract attractive customers. And as I noted, T-Mobile USA closed its SunCom acquisition last Friday, adding new opportunities in the Carolinas and Puerto Rico. We are also on track to launch 3G in New York in the second quarter, then adding other markets through the year. So, we remain very confident about the outlook for the US business, even in the current economic environment, and we are aiming for around 3 million net customer adds in '08. Just to be clear, these 3 million do not include the 1.1 million SunCom customers that we acquired; so they are extra and on top.</p>
          <p>T-Mobile UK, in the UK, we've had a good performance in '07 on all key metrics. There was a healthy service revenue growth of over 9% and particularly strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 21%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up by 2.8 percentage points at nearly 25% year-on-year, and at over 26% in Q4 specifically. Blended ARPU rose from 29 to &#x20AC;31 while contract was unchanged at 66. Contract net adds increased by 165,000 during the year, while the number of Flext customers went over the 2 million mark, up from 1.3 million in 2006. And I would like to emphasize again the importance of the network-sharing agreement with 3, and the significant cost savings and increased 3G coverage that this will deliver.</p>
          <p>Coming to Central Europe, our Central and Eastern European Mobile operations are a very true success story, which unfortunately is often overlooked. On a pro forma basis, adjusted for the consolidation of PTC, Mobile revenues grew by 9.3% to &#x20AC;5.6 billion in 2007, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 12.5 to &#x20AC;2.2 billion. This represents a margin of 39.4%, which is up one percentage point comparing to 2006.</p>
          <p>Contract net adds amounted to 2 million in 2007. Several countries also had strong non-voice results. For example, in Poland, non-voice revenues accounted for 19% of ARPU in 2007, up three percentage points from 2006. In Croatia, the non-voice contribution increased by five percentage points to 20% in 2007. Contract churn in all Central European countries was below 1.1%, with Poland at 0.7 and the Czech Republic even, at 0.6%.</p>
          <p>Next slide on Internet mobilization. If we turn now to the third element in our strategy, which is mobilizing the Internet, we can see both significant revenue growth and a number of important strategic developments. First, data revenues. These grew by 40% year-on-year, excluding messaging and have now reached nearly &#x20AC;2 billion at the end of 2007. UMTS data volumes in Q4 were up by over 60%, compared to Q3, and in the year as a whole, we're at almost eight times the level of 2006. That reflects the success of HSDPA across our European properties. I'll talk about web'n'walk and myFaves in a moment, and I have already mentioned the launch of the iPhone in November.</p>
          <p>Strategically, 2007 was important. We entered into the Open Handset Alliance with Google and other partnerships in November and are expecting the first Android handset to be launched in the fourth quarter. February this year, we entered into a partnership with Yahoo! That partnership integrates the Yahoo! search function, oneSearch, into the web'n'walk portal, in addition to other well-known Yahoo! Services, such as Finance, Mail, Messenger and also, Flickr. The search function is particularly innovative, since it takes into account the context of the search query, such as time and location. T-Mobile will obtain a share of the advertising revenues generated through sponsored links.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Internet mobilization, in Europe, the number of web'n'walk customers increased by over 70% year-on-year to over 3.2 million. In the same period, non-voice revenues in Europe, excluding messaging, increased by over 40% to almost &#x20AC;1 billion. In the US, there are now almost 5 million myFaves users. This product was only introduced in the fourth quarter of 2006, so we have achieved well over 4 million new myFaves customers in 2007.</p>
          <p>We have now introduced the successful myFaves concept in Germany and the UK with about a 100,000 myFaves customers in Germany by end-of-year 2007, following the launch in October. Non-voice revenues in the US are now at over &#x20AC;940 million, an increase of nearly 40% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Network-centric ICT on the next slide, as we mentioned, we are in an advanced stage in our partner search for the Systems Integration business and we do expect a solution very soon from now. At the same time, we're making good progress with T-Systems by winning major deals in Q4, and at the beginning of this year. In the fourth quarter for example, we won double-digit million contracts with Bosch, the build out of an MPLS corporate network for Europe, Africa and the Middle East with MTU and for the State of Saxony, the first build out of an all-IP network by a German Federal State. In '08, we've won more contracts with Airbus, Lidl and the build out of the IP-based wide area network, and recently with Old Mutual, an ICT outsourcing deal in South Africa. Also in December, we were the first company worldwide to receive the new certificate as a global SAP application management services provider.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude. Adjusted EBITDA for '07 was at &#x20AC;19.3 billion, which was above our original guidance of 19 billion. For 2008, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be around the actual 2007 figure. That takes into account the consolidation of Orange Nederland for the full year 2008, SunCom from March 1st and the deconsolidation of Media &amp; Broadcast in Q1. SunCom is expected to contribute around &#x20AC;0.1 billion in EBITDA in '08. We also expect free cash flow for 2008 to be around last year's level. We do remain committed to an attractive dividend policy for our shareholders. We announced in December the proposal to increase this dividend from 0.72 to &#x20AC;0.78 per share for the 2007 dividend.</p>
          <p>Operationally, at BBFN, management expects to achieve a minimum market share in broadband net adds of 45% in 2008. At T-Mobile USA, as I mentioned, the target is 3 million organic net adds in 2008 and in mobile data, T-Mobile management is aiming for an increase in non-messaging data revenues of around another 40%.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me hand over to Karl to take you through the financials in more detail. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ren&#xE9;. Good afternoon, and good morning to all of you. We are very pleased with our full year results. I only can underpin what Ren&#xE9; Obermann was already mentioning. It was a successful year, also, from my perspective. This is even more important due to the fact that we have more or less a new Board chaired by Ren&#xE9; Obermann. It was a very successful first year. We expect there is more to come.</p>
          <p>Revenues grew by 1.9% to &#x20AC;62.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly by 0.6% to &#x20AC;19.3 billion on a reported basis. In the fourth quarter specifically, however, adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.4% year-on-year to &#x20AC;4.6 billion. BBFN in particular, had a strong adjusted EBITDA performance in the fourth quarter. I will come back to that later.</p>
          <p>Adverse foreign exchange movements, however, had a major influence on our results. Assuming constant exchange rates, revenues would have grown by 3.6% to &#x20AC;63.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA by 0.8% to &#x20AC;19.6 billion. I think nobody had expected us to increase our EBITDA from 19.4 billion the year before on a like-for-like basis to &#x20AC;19.6 billion this year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income was down 22% to &#x20AC;3 billion. This was impacted in particular, by higher D&amp;A, due to purchase price allocation effects, resulting from the consolidation of PTC and tele.ring and significantly higher P&amp;L income taxes as they are reported different to the cash taxes. I will come to this later.</p>
          <p>Finally, free cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;6.6 billion, exceeding our revised guidance of &#x20AC;6.5 billion, and up 4.5% from '06. In terms of BBFN, overall trends were unchanged. Total revenues decreased by 7.4% while domestic revenues decreased by 8%, just over &#x20AC;20 billion. As before, higher revenues from wholesale services could not offset lower calling revenues in particular. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 11.2% to &#x20AC;7.8 billion as expected, while domestic adjusted EBITDA decreased by 14.1% to &#x20AC;6.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, however, we saw the impact of the cost reduction realized in '07 starting to come through, with domestic adjusted EBITDA increasing by 0.4% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of '06.</p>
          <p>Looking at the sequential development in revenues and adjusted EBITDA in '07, excluded Club Internet and Ya.com, which were sold in '07, we achieved a stabilization in revenue trends and a sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA, especially in the fourth quarter, contrary to the quarterly developments in the previous years.</p>
          <p>Domestic revenues stabilized at around &#x20AC;5 billion. The sequential improvement in domestic adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is due, in particular, to the additional cost cuts implemented in BBFN. While we are very encouraged by this improvement, I would caution you not to extrapolate this development into '08, given some of the competitive and regulatory pressure we are still facing, including the introduction of naked DSL.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost cuts, we delivered on our target of &#x20AC;0.9 billion, net OpEx savings at BBFN domestic in '07. Gross savings of &#x20AC;1.2 billion came broadly equally from lower personnel costs, lower IT billing costs, consulting costs and others. In addition, termination costs were reduced by 0.2 billion. Of these savings, &#x20AC;0.5 billion were reinvested to drive higher DSL retail net adds, expand the number of telecom shops, and to improve customer service, including the reduction of the strike backlog, resulting in approximately &#x20AC;0.9 billion of net cost savings. &#x20AC;0.6 billion of these were achieved in the fourth quarter alone.</p>
          <p>In Mobile, strong growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA continued on the back of double-digit customer growth. Total revenues increased by 8.4% to close to &#x20AC;35 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% as well, to &#x20AC;10.7 billion. These growth rates were impacted by the new consolidation of PTC and tele.ring and foreign exchange developments. Assuming constant exchange rates, the growth rates would have amounted to 12% in terms of revenues and 11.4% in terms of adjusted EBITDA. This was supported by strong organic growth in the US, in particular. Revenues at T-Mobile US grew 12.6% organically, while adjusted EBITDA improved by 13.7%.</p>
          <p>In terms of reported figures, international adjusted EBITDA grew by 17.8%, or 22.3% assuming constant exchange rates, while domestic adjusted EBITDA decreased by 11.4%. This decrease was due to the revenue pressures still seen in Germany, and higher market invest, specifically, higher subscriber acquisition and retention costs.</p>
          <p>In the Business Customers segment, total revenues decreased by 6.9% to &#x20AC;12 billion, while adjusted EBITDA decreased by 17.7% to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Total revenues were impacted in particular, by decreasing internal revenue as a result of the cuts in IT costs implemented in the Group, while external revenues decreased by 3.5% to &#x20AC;9 billion. International revenues grew by 7.1%. This strong growth however, was not sufficient to offset the revenue decrease of 10% in Germany. Compared to the third quarter, total revenues increased by 9.8% to &#x20AC;3.2 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cost cutting program, Save for Service, we overachieved our target of &#x20AC;2 billion with an actual reduction of &#x20AC;2.3 billion. More than half of these gross savings were at BBFN, while &#x20AC;0.5 billion came from T-Mobile and &#x20AC;0.3 billion from GHS. Lower personnel expenses accounted for 40% of the cost savings. Overall, the cost base of the Group increased by &#x20AC;1.2 billion, which was essentially due to the impact of new consolidations. This was partially offset by foreign &#x2013; by positive foreign exchange effects of &#x20AC;0.8 billion. The gross savings of Save for Service of &#x20AC;2.3 billion offset about 75% of the higher market spend in Europe and the US.</p>
          <p>Coming now, for my perspective to the most important number, free cash flow. With regard to free cash flow, we delivered on our revised guidance with a free cash flow of &#x20AC;6.6 billion, compared to 6.3 billion, excluding spectrum CapEx in '06. We achieved this despite a negative impact from working capital and despite an increase in restructuring payments by &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;1.7 billion in '07. These factors were more than offset by a net tax refund of &#x20AC;0.2 billion, a lower net interest payment, lower cash CapEx and slightly higher proceeds from the disposition of assets. Most of the decrease in cash CapEx was due to BBFN.</p>
          <p>Let me add some remarks on the tax situation. In '07, we had a significant cash inflow from income tax refunds in particular, di-tax, which resulted in a net tax refund of &#x20AC;0.2 billion, whereas in '06 we had a net tax payment of &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Reported income taxes however, showed almost the positive development. A tax charge in '07 of &#x20AC;1.4 billion, compared to a tax gain of &#x20AC;1 billion in '06. Adjusted for special influences, P&amp;L income taxes were at a comparable level in both years. Since we still have significant tax loss carry forward, especially in the US, I would expect P&amp;L taxes to remain higher than cash taxes also over the next years.</p>
          <p>Turning now to net income. Reported net income amounted to &#x20AC;0.6 billion, compared to &#x20AC;3.2 billion in '06. The decrease was mostly due to higher income taxes, where there was a swing of &#x20AC;2.4 billion from a net tax gain of &#x20AC;1 billion in '06 to a net tax expense of &#x20AC;1.4 billion in '07, which was mostly due to special influences as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Overall, the swing in income taxes is equivalent to more than 90% of the decline in reported net income. The remainder was due to higher purchase price allocation effects, which increased by &#x20AC;0.2 billion and higher net financial expense, which had benefited in an amount of 0.2 billion in '06 from the sale of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Coming now to adjusted net income, since the impact on net income was mainly due to special factors, net income adjusted for special factors decreased to a lesser extent from 3.9 billion in '06 to 3 billion in '07. This decrease was due in particular, to higher D&amp;A resulting from additional purchase price allocation effects and higher P&amp;L income taxes. Overall, as I mentioned already, purchase price allocation effects increased by 0.2 billion to &#x20AC;0.5 billion in the D&amp;A in '07.</p>
          <p>Coming last, but not least, to our balance sheet ratios, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. At the end of the year, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.9 times at the lower end of our target ratio. The equity ratio of 34.7% was at the upper end of our target ratio of 25 to 35%.</p>
          <p>The decrease in shareholders' equity was due in particular, to foreign exchange effects. In today's turbulent markets, we clearly benefit from our conservative liquidity reserve policy, which remains &#x2013; which maintains the liquidity reserves at around 40% of our net debt. This policy and the utilization of niche markets where we already have issued &#x20AC;1.5 billion this year, put us in a comfortable position with respect to our refinancing needs on the debt capital markets this year.</p>

          <p>Mr. Ulrich Rathe from Dresdner Kleinwort, your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you very much. Three short questions, if I may. First, with regards to the free cash flow guidance. I was just wondering whether you foresee a mix between the contribution of CapEx versus working capital and other effects in the free cash flow guidance for 2008? I.e., I'm sort of trying to fish a bit for sort of the implied CapEx developments here, or any other offsetting effects.</p>
          <p>Second, with regard to your target for 45% net add share in broadband. At what point you believe the regulators would be sort of starting to have another look at that? Where do you sort of think is the natural cap for broadband share?</p>
          <p>And third, with regards to US Mobile, where would you see a sustainable price premium for T-Mobile, compared to, say, a player like Sprint? What sort of price premium do you think T-Mobile with its own brand could maintain in that market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me try and answer these questions. Related to free cash flow guidance, the cash CapEx in '07 was about 8 billion, I think 8.2 thereof, around 4 billion in Mobile, and 3 billion in BBFN, and free cash flow was at 6.6 billion. So, EBITDA and free cash flow will be at similar levels in '08, compared to '07. We would expect to see a similar amount for the net interest payments as in '07, as the net debt will not change significantly. Certainly, net inflow and cash taxes will change to an outflow, and we would expect that the swing here could be around a billion from 0.2 inflow, to up to 1 billion outflow.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we would expect cash outflow restructuring payments to go down to around 1.1 billion. It was previously 1.7. And we'd further expect some support from the working capital side as well. So, capital expenditures should be at a slightly higher level or the similar level at least, as in '07, given the second year of the VDSL roll-out in Germany, and the already communicated 3G roll-out in the US, which we need to continue at a high pace. So, the significant &#x2013; the breakdown shouldn't be significantly different to '07.</p>
          <p>On the other side, other question, 45% target, I do not think 45 or even 50% should be &#x2013; should give room for regulatory intervention for several reasons. Number one, our total market share is still below 50%. Secondly, it is &#x2013; Germany is one of the most competitive markets, with many competitors both on the network and on the service provider level, as you can see by this high dynamic in the price movements. And also, we have cable operators now who have gained some momentum.</p>
          <p>So, I think for various reasons, the opposite should be the case. There is enough room now for reducing regulation, and lead over gradually into overall anti-trust law rather than sector-specific regulation. That is also the position we're taking vis-&#xE0;-vis the public and the legislators. So, we think there is not a real concern about intervention of regulation for DSL.</p>
          <p>US Mobile, I consider that somewhat competitive information here. Competitive, sensitive information and I would not want to give you an indication of the sustainable price premium we think we can achieve vis-&#xE0;-vis Sprint. We believe we need to be price-wise competitors and also, in the perception of the consumer, need to provide a good value for money ratio. So, certainly, we don't want to be seen as a big price premium player here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just following up on the question regarding VDSL. I'll take it that your VDSL roll-out is still on track in line with the recent intentions so that you would probably cover just over 10 million households by early 2009. Can I ask whether that's true and whether you're planning to further extend the VDSL network and whether you have any plans to close the central office locations in due course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, VDSL roll-out has been at the end of '07, 27 cities. And on top of that, we've come up with ADSL2+, which was easy to roll out comparatively speaking and less CapEx-intense. So, now we have high-speed internet through the combination of both in more than 17 million households already, but we will continue to roll out VDSL in '08.</p>
          <p>The additional coverage will decrease because of the size of the cities to be rolled out in '08 are going to be somewhat smaller. We start in the big areas of course. The investment of &#x2013; total investment of 3 billion is rather at the top end of spending. So, so far totally, we've spent around 1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>So, we will continue to roll out VDSL, up to 50 cities, and we'll decide in the course of the year what the roll-out plan for the next year is going to look like. That certainly also has some interdependence through the regulatory interventions. As you know, there is still some debate going on. And we'll look at that and take a decision as soon as we have more clarification on to the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, a couple of questions. Just going back to your broadband DSL share, the fact that you're now pointing to 45% or above, should we interpret this as a sign that you're going to be more aggressive in 2008? And if so, should we see that in your pricing or have you got other levers you can pull?</p>
          <p>And the second question, on the early retirement program, the 1.4 billion provision, can you give us an indication as to how many employees you expect that to cover, and perhaps when we should see the cash outflow relating to that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may be a little early, but I do think that the latest price moves on DSL or in DSL do not have such a significant impact as they used to have, say, two years ago or a year ago, because whether 29, 34, 25 or 31, it's all in the same ballpark. And so, I think that from watching what happens in the marketplace and talking to customers, talking to dealers, and so forth and to our own people, I think we're &#x2013; I don't think it's going to be a massive additional price war because prices are already at a very aggressive level.</p>
          <p>I think we will win primarily through, of course, staying competitive as we are, but winning through an extended sales and marketing &#x2013; a presence in the marketplace. We have strengthened our distribution, our direct sales activities, our campaigns, our media campaigns, and so forth. We've streamlined communication activities. We are less disperse now with regards to communication campaigns.</p>
          <p>I think it's more strengthening the brand, strengthening the distribution, improving our service levels, offering on-site services. Things like that which makes it more convenient to buy from us and which makes us the better supplier for end users than our competitors. So, I think it's the mix. Price-wise, we've got to be competitive. We can still afford a certain premium, but I think the other factors are becoming more important, because price levels overall have come down already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the early retirement program, I think it's certain foremost worthwhile to mention that altogether, we have provided in '07 full year &#x20AC;2.0 billion before taxes for these kind of early retirement programs for civil servants and our employees, of which 1.4 billion we provided additionally to what we have seen in the first three quarters in the last quarter, i.e., in the fourth quarter. What we did was, to cover the plan until the prognosis of end of 2010. That means that we have now covered all kind of &#x2013; expenses until '010 for these two programs already.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash terms, we did pay 1.7 billion in '07 and 0.7 billion in '06. We expect another payment of about &#x2013; a little bit more than 1 billion in '08, which was already mentioned by Ren&#xE9; Obermann. He made the point that this reduction in our, in the cash out for the early retirement program is going to support our free cash flow in '08. And that's perhaps what I could say about the early retirement program.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Austria is a very competitive, sometimes I would say, even crazy market, which really needs further consolidation. So, price competition is absolutely brutal as reflected in mobile data prices, which are undercutting fixed broadband prices. We did our job on consolidation, and given the experience with regulatory approval from our side, I don't think we can do much more in this market. Margins and revenue development are due to the consolidation of tele.ring only comparable for '07 to '06. Margin dropped from 28.8 in '06 to 28.4, so it virtually didn't, or it almost didn't drop. It almost stayed stable. For '08, we still would have to expect revenue decrease, but hope to keep or slightly improve the margin. So, again, Austria is an extremely competitive marketplace, where prices have developed, even undercutting fixed broadband prices. At the end of the day, that market needs some cure, I suppose.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just wondered what your experience of flat rate pricing in Germany tells us about what may happen in the US with contract ARPUs? Obviously, KPN came in with Base, which wasn't a full flat rate, but it was flat rate for on-net and fixed-line calls, so partially flat rate. What's the read across, is there anything we can learn from that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, the Netherlands, just wondering what your medium term strategy is in the Netherlands. There seems to be an opportunity there, KPN perhaps a bit on the back foot, how aggressive should we expect you to be in that market?</p>
          <p>And finally, we're hearing from some of your competitors in German DSL that SACs are rising, and so the ability to compete on the headline price commoditizes. What's going to happen with your own SACs in German broadband, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, since Base came into the market, there was an increased pressure, you're right, Justin, on introducing similar kind of rates which we also did and that attracted not only high-end customers, but also we have great ARPU on these, I'd say partial flat rates, they are not fully flat rates, because they still have tariff elements, which are variably priced. So, I think in some way, it stimulated the market, and so overall, nothing wrong with that at least for the German market.</p>
          <p>Second was related to US &#x2013; no, subscriber acquisition cost in DSL in Germany, you are right, there has been some increase. I think with the latest moves of Vodafone, also, on DSL, we've seen some increase in that, but our distribution is very strong. And we have a higher degree of independence from indirect sales. So, we can balance that out pretty well. I think we can still manage, and we very much stick to our forecast for this year. I don't think DSL acquisition costs are going to go through the roof for us. US &#x2013; you had a point on, what's that again?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are &#x2013; we are now through the integration of Orange Netherlands, a strong number two in the marketplace. And KPN is by far the leading dominant player in the marketplace in the Netherlands. We acquired Orange recently for 1.3. Our position has significantly improved. And there'll now be three rather than four players in the market. And so that position is pretty comfortable.</p>
          <p>Synergy effects from that acquisition, net present value is about a billion. And a big chunk of that in the first couple of years. So, overall, I think our position in the Netherlands is much more comfortable. And we will continue of course, to strengthen our position, but I don't think there is any point in trying to become the number one in the Netherlands at this point in time. It's just not realistic on the short term. So, therefore, we will continue to work. We'll have to take on more share, but I don't think we're yet realistically competing for the number one position in that market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions. Going back to the usage point on German Mobile, I think you said on one of the slides that contract usage per customer was about 10, was up about 10% for the full year. Just wondering if you can give us the quarterly percentage usage growth trends for Germany?</p>
          <p>And second, you talked a lot over the last couple of years about the potential for profitability improvements in the US. But the margin in the fourth quarter fell back to 26%, I think, which is about the same level as Q4 last year. So, why the short-term weakness, and what do you have to do to get to your longer term target, which I think is 35% plus? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the US. I think the margins in the US are in the Q4, traditionally being affected by strong customer growth. That's nothing new to you &#x2013; I'd say seasonal marketing campaigns and all that contribute to a usually somewhat lower margin in Q4. It was seasonal. We had contract net adds increased from 557 in Q3 to 733 in Q4, which was a plus of 31.6%. CPGAs increased from $280 in Q3 to 300 in Q4, because we had some higher advertising and marketing spends, while SACs actually remained flat, about $128 per gross add in Q4.</p>
          <p>So, 2008 margins could be slightly up, but will be somewhat affected by the additional OpEx associated with the 3G roll-out. As we always said, 3G roll-out is costing us money as long as there is no adequate utilization in the network &#x2013; of the network. But in the medium and long term, we stick to the goal. We aim for a target margin of 35% plus. So, no change to our long term perspective.</p>
          <p>Germany contract usage, I think, was the second part of the question. Let me try and read the detailed number here for you. Q1, we are talking, contract Q1 to Q4 was about 7 or 8%, if I'm not mistaken, plus I think about 10, 11 minutes more per customer, per contract customer minutes per month. So, there is a trend to increase, however, still in Germany on a lower level than in most other markets. UK is more than 400 minutes, Austria, more than 300 minutes. So, Germany, there is a long way for improvement, but it's gradually happening now.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ren&#xE9;, I have two questions. I know you don't give guidance for subdivision, but your EBITDA margin increased significantly in Q4, for the Broadband/Fixed Network on the domestic market versus the other quarter. So, I was wondering if that's something that we could expect for the next quarter, so if there was partly exceptional points in Q4? And concerning the US and the $99 per month offer, you were saying that if it was successful, it would be accretive on ARPU. What would it be on the margin, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we had strict cost cutting in Germany, which affected the margin in Q4. We improved from Q1 to Q4, and we will continue to do our cost cutting efforts in particular, in the German domestic fixed line business. On the other side, yes, there is some further competitive pressures, as we've discussed earlier on in the domestic market. So, looking ahead, it's a little premature, let's put it this way, to expect a full stabilization of the EBITDA in the Broadband/Fixed line area in '08. So, there is still going to be competitive pressure, and we will continue our cost cutting.</p>
          <p>However, as we've done successfully in the past, we're working against the trend here and we hope to compensate for as much of the impact of the traditional line losses as much as we can.</p>
          <p>US $99, I think the margin impact, or the ARPU impact is extremely small, and that would even anticipate a kind of a fast migration from the existing customer base, onto those new tariff plans which usually is not reality. You think that every customer has nothing else in mind than following mobile price plans, and swapping the day after those things are introduced &#x2013; that's wrong.</p>
          <p>Usually, there is a quite a high degree of inertia, so customers don't change from day one to day two. And therefore, the ARPU impact, even if they were to change fast, is pretty small. As I said, 2% of our customers are on those kind of revenues. And even if they were all to change, which is not happening, the ARPU impact is minor, very small, less than a percent. So, we're cool about that, to be honest.</p>

          <p>Mr. Simon Weeden from Goldman Sachs, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I wondered if you could comment on the outlook &#x2013; two areas, really. One is, it's coming back to German broadband, and the impact that the cable operators are having, because it doesn't appear that they're taking in aggregate a steadily increasing share of net additions, and notwithstanding your remarks earlier, whether or not that has an impact on pricing that you're going to need to adopt during 2008 to achieve the market share target that you've set out?</p>
          <p>And just coming back to the restructuring charges, given you're looking quite a long way ahead, I thought, ordinarily under IFRS, that would mean your posting to the income statement to these charges should perhaps come a little later. So, I wonder if you're already initiating some of these programs. And if so, whether or not there might be some chance of a peak during the course of 2008, if you're seeing some of the restructuring programs kicking a bit earlier. I guess that's my question, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, on the broadband &#x2013; the impact of cable, you're right insofar as cable operators have improved their share of market net adds. And I've always said we're taking them serious. And they come with bucket plans of about 30 or so euro for a connection. We're taking them very serious.</p>
          <p>But let's not take this out of proportion. Their share seems still below 10% of all net adds, and we believe we are very competitive from the point of sale to the delivery and the provisioning. I think we can also be superior when it comes to this whole service experience of our customers. Our prices are competitive. The quality of our product is extremely good. Yes, admitted, so is theirs, but we feel we are very competitive still and we're not panicking whatsoever.</p>
          <p>So but &#x2013; having said all that, they are a factor in the game. And as I said earlier, they are also one of the arguments we're taking towards the regulator for getting some relief on the regulatory framework.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, I don't know whether I got your second question correctly. What we did, again, with our additional provision in the last quarter was a donation of our already up and running early retirement programs for civil servants and employees. These are programs where we donated already, last year, 2.8 billion, i.e., in '06, 2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, it has come slightly down to 2.0 billion, again but the donation for our already up and running early retirement programs, I have tried to give you some guidance, what kind of cash outflow we are expecting, at least in '08. Which should give you, also, the confidence, how many numbers of employees we are expecting to retire in '08. I think there is not too much more I could say about that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions. One, on the US market, I mean, it seems that the financial markets in general are taking the view that we are at the start of a very, very destructive price war, I'm just kind of wondering whether you share that view. And if so, whether any of the operators can make a case for buying Sprint, which seems to be the root of these problems?</p>
          <p>The second question, on domestic fixed, you mentioned that you've got the naked DSL rates coming in this year, just kind of wondering whether you think that has any incremental delta on your line loss rate for '08, or is it kind of still in this 2 to 2.5 million lines for '08? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, sure, the Sprint plan was sort of an unknown, but I don't think that &#x2013; it's far from clear to us that these drops necessarily compels the rest of the industry to follow, given the kind of obvious discussions or issues which the company had to deal with, but anyway, I don't want to talk about my competitors here. It's just that I don't think for us, this is an automatism, what they do that we have always to follow. I think our brand is very strong and our position in the consumer market is very competitive. And we're seen as providing great value for money.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that the most recent move is necessarily a signal for major uncontrollable price wars. And again, these packages in the past which have been introduced so far have extremely little impact on our real ARPU. And if any, we have an opportunity to attract high-end customers with big buckets. I wish we had more customers on $99 price plans. And I wish that this could be an overall trend that customers migrate into those big price plans, and certainly, our intention is to promote those big price plans.</p>
          <p>So, again, I can repeat what I said, we're cool on this. We think that's a very well manageable situation. And we don't &#x2013; we're not too concerned about that at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Stefan Borscheid from WestLB, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Three questions please, the first one on, on line losses. And could you maybe give us a little bit more ideas? Could we &#x2013; should we expect line losses to accelerate now in view of this new regulation which should come in force in April that you will have to connect up to 330,000 lines per month?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on head count reduction, I don't know if am right, but if I add up all the provisions for restructuring that you built over the past years, I just get the impression that probably at the end of 2008, you should be well ahead of the 32,000 program that you currently have. And if I also look at your current number at the end of '07, I get the same impression. So, could you confirm that?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on the US, do you see any impact on your other tariff plans, on your current tariff plans? Do you see some &#x2013; the need to adjust some of them, so that they meet the $99 plan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's talk about the German situation first, on line losses. I think the &#x2013; one of the key questions is going to be, how is the naked DSL pricing, how does it have to be? Because resellers have already announced to switch from their resale business model to naked DSL either with us or with competitors. So, it really depends on what the pre-product price will be for naked DSL for resellers. What we've seen so far is rather supportive for infrastructure-based competition. So, again, with all caution, but I don't expect a major disruptive price situation by naked DSL.</p>
          <p>But bottom line, let's face it. We will have further line losses, not only because of broadband growth, but also from these structural effects that resale clients migrate to competitors and therefore, could resign from their fixed lines from us. So, we will have further line losses. We have to face that fact, and that's part of the reason why we're working so hard on Save for Service, part of the reason why we are so focused on improving our market share in broadband.</p>
          <p>Coming to the second part... the head count reduction part, the program, the 32,000 program is progressing as planned. In fact, you are right. It's even stronger than planned. At the end of '07, we've had a total gross reduction of the 32,000, already of 26,500, okay. So, and that by the way, it's almost 22,000. That means we are extremely well on track to meet those targets of 32,000, and &#x2013; which are gross reductions and 25,000 net reductions by the end of '08.</p>
          <p>As described in our presentation earlier, a further reduction, gross reduction of 3,500 employees in Q1 can be expected. I don't talk about long-term big numbers. That makes no sense. All I say is, we will continue to reduce capacities in all those areas which are affected by higher automation and where we have overcapacities. We just don't talk about big numbers for the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>What else... no, no, we're quite well positioned with our tariffs and particularly, with the offers of myFaves, and then with FlexPay, a very important product addition, recently introduced, very successful. And also, you followed the news on HotSpot @Home.</p>
          <p>So, overall, our range of portfolio of offers myFaves to HotSpot @Home is extremely well positioned, and again, I can repeat myself, we're cool about this, big buckets with flat rates. As I've said, we wish to attract more customers with those big spendings that can help overall, the ARPU.</p>

          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. It's been I guess about a year since you mentioned acquiring mobile assets outside your current service footprint. And during that year, have you actually come close to doing a deal and if so, why did you walk away? And then looking ahead, are you close to looking at another potential deal anytime soon, or is it just at the we-talk-to-everybody stage still?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you do not expect me to comment right? I've always said, 12 months ago, that our priority is strengthening our position inside the existing footprint, because obviously, for instance, in the Netherlands or in the US there is room for better market share and for consolidation, so was in Austria. And ever since last spring, we did two deals on this front, and we're looking for opportunities, which makes sense, strategic sense and also, financial sense with discipline. So you can &#x2013; you should expect us to do things if they are &#x2013; if they come along which make financial and strategic sense.</p>
          <p>We're not being &#x2013; we are not letting ourselves get pushed into something just for satisfying media pressure, because we know that leads usually to mistakes. And therefore, we are looking for opportunities at the right time for the right price, for the right opportunity. So, and everything else is not for me to comment on. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I understood that and you assume &#x2013; or you expect the price level to be stable in the German DSL market. But wouldn't you agree that you eventually have to increase your bandwidth of, on some of your bundles, for instance, the one for &#x20AC;39 to 6 <mark type="inaudible" />? So my question is, would you agree that you eventually have to increase bandwidth, and what would be the impact on your profitability? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not say that the prices will stay stable. I said, I don't think the pure price decreases, whether it be 34 to 29 or 29 to 25, have such a great impact as price decrease in the past had on the structure of the market, on the market shares, and so forth. Of course, there is going to be competitive pressure. Of course, we'll have further &#x2013; heated up on the price.</p>
          <p>But all I am saying is, I'm confident that we can achieve a high market share, because we have such a strengthened distribution now. We have a better brand, our service levels have improved. We are now &#x2013; we are better in retaining our customers, and so forth. So, there are many factors internally where we've strengthened our own position. Therefore, I'm optimistic that we can accomplish a high share, even without being right at the forefront of stupid price moves.</p>
          <p>The room downwards is of course, limited now for all of us , I suppose. Looking at what's going &#x2013; what's happening in the marketplace, reading the papers everyday, I think there is now a more general pressure on the others as well to maybe, at some stage, make some more money.</p>
          <p>But the question is of course &#x2013; that's a very good question &#x2013; what's the competitive field? And that may well be the quality of service. That may well be the total package from installation to devices to bandwidth. And so the answer is, we'll work on the quality of our network. We'll work on improving the bandwidth. We'll work on ADSL2+ and those things, to make our service, our package more attractive than the one of many of our competitors.</p>
          <p>So, the question is well taken. And I think the answer is yes, there will be more pressure on quality of service and the overall element of the package.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Given the US dollar-euro exchange rate headwind that we see developing, does your EBITDA guidance imply more confidence in the underlying T-Mobile US business than back in November? Or are there other areas that you're now more confident in? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've seen, at least, it expresses some more confidence. Because last time we talked, we had a lower US dollar-euro exchange rate. And today we are, I don't know where we are exactly right now, but approximately 150 or slightly higher. And nevertheless, we have repeated the guidance unchanged and we have kept it unchanged to what we said already. This clearly gives us some more confidence, but yes, we all know that there is some impact coming from the US and well, we are seeing significant headwind, which makes us even more accelerate our efforts to also be in line with our guidance this year as we did last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. At the recent Mobile Conference in Barcelona, Hamid talked about increasing mobile speeds potentially causing more fixed-to-mobile substitution going forward, given the low number of mobile and new households in Germany? Given mobile prices are so much lower now, given naked DSL is coming in, can you give us some idea of what you think the probability of a step change in the rate of line losses, say, the probability of line loss being 3 million in 2008 rather than the current 2? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that it's going to be that drastic. I think there will be pressure on line losses primarily by the other factor, and by the structural effect as resale clients migrate. But I don't think that fixed-mobile substitution is such a big factor in '08 yet, because still after all, on mobile, you cannot compete with a fast DSL connectivity for various reasons, because the mobile is always the shared resource, and the DSL is a connection to your house, to your home, for yourself.</p>
          <p>And so the performance of DSL is still better. The price, the value for money ratio for DSL for high bandwidth users is still better. So, there are many factors. Having said that, mid to long term, mobile is growing in its importance, and it will have an impact. And therefore, we are well positioned in Germany to participate exactly at that trend. In fact, we are one of the forefront drivers for that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have a question again on T-Systems. You are talking to partners and specifically on the IT integration part; can you tell us why not simply disposing IT integration, why it is important for the T-Systems set up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>System Integration, not IT operations or anything else, so we're talking about System Integration. I don't want to give you any details on the, on what the deal looks like. And therefore, it makes little sense at this point to explain to you what kind of negotiations we're leading or even indicating at, if I try to answer your question correctly, it would give you probably an idea about what the purpose of this whole partnership exercise is.</p>
          <p>What you know, Mr. Rothauge from being an insider to the German market is that T-Systems has, particularly in that area, virtually no capacity to, or very little capacity to, for offshoring. And therefore, if you compare the cost per hour in Germany for IT development, and compare that to markets like Central or Eastern Europe or even India for the same purpose, you see significant differences. So, we're not cost competitive in that field ,and that's the biggest deficit for System Integration.</p>
          <p>I can't give you any more detail at this point in time. Just give us a few more days or whatever it takes now, and then Reinhard Clemens is going to walk you through the details the logic, the rationale of all of this. And I'm sure you'll find good answers then. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one left. Can you update us on T-Online and Toll Collect please? Do you believe a settlement is more likely, finally, or a final decision by a judge? And in particular, at what time would Deutsche be obliged to build a provision for such a settlement payment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the moment, to build up a provision under IFRS is that you have a certainty of more than 5 --- 50% that you have to pay something and you have to know more or less the total amount or more, you have to have a kind of a certainty about the net &#x2013; the magnitude you would have to pay in order to build a provision under IFRS.</p>
          <p>That goes to the timing, which is not yet the case, neither in T-Online nor in Toll Collect. When it comes to the timing, T-Online I think is going to drag for a while, because we all know that in the first court decision, the party who are &#x2013; is losing the decision is going to appeal. That's why I am saying it will take some while. It will go into &#x2013; over the years.</p>
          <p>In Toll Collect, we will see whether we come to more certainty somewhere in the middle, or at the end of this year. And again, once we have certainty that there is something we have to pay, we will provide for it.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is concerning the cost cutting potential again. And specifically, how high do you think is the likelihood that you will be able to transfer a significant amount, let's say, 2000 to 5000 civil servants back to the German states at the &#x2013; yeah, against the backdrop of the statements we have seen in the German press recently, and the news flow around this?</p>
          <p>And second question here, do you see the potential for cost cuts at T-Mobile outside Germany? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first part, regarding civil servants, all I should say and all I can say at this point of time is that we are in good discussions with public institutions on that very topic. We are asking for support by them, and for a continued effort, because we can't have in one lot &#x2013; one solution for a few thousand.</p>
          <p>We have to do it step-by-step, 50 here, 100 there, so it's a continued exercise over the next month and quarters and years, but we are looking to &#x2013; forward to some good cooperation here with the public institutions. It's too early to say more about this.</p>
          <p>What was the other part? Mobile cost savings outside of Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, mobile cost savings outside of Germany, yes, there is always opportunities to introduce similar cost saving programs outside of Germany, be it in the US or be it in Eastern Europe or be it in more or less all our mobile markets. I think when it's &#x2013; and this also leads me to the fact that typically one could see our 4.2 to 4.7 billion target as a little bit conservative. But I think we would rather under-promise and better over-deliver than once we are wrong.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In 2007, I think you reinvested quite a lot of your savings in BBFN and SAC, and you are pushing customers on to lower priced 24-month contracts. I just wonder if you can put the total SAC investment you made in '07 in some sort of context, as to how you see 2008? Would you spend more or less on SAC in total, do you think, in BBFN?</p>
          <p>And is the upwards pressure on SAC that you were talking about earlier just due to continuing very competitive land grab, or has the move to 24-month contracts created some sort of scarcity in gross adds? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will not talk about SACs in detail in Fixed Network, but the recent figures you've seen in the press regarding German competitors of 200 up to some &#x20AC;600 for Double Play seems quite high. In Triple Play, the SACs are declining, since the mass market launch in early September last year. Again, having a reasonable SAC management is part of our activities and efforts to accomplish our guidance and it's part of the game, so we're not foreseeing unreasonable amount of SACs in this year. But of course, we have to be sufficiently competitive here as well. I can't give you any detailed guidance here. I don't think it's going to be outrageously high.</p>

      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Ren&#xE9;, a target of 40% increase in data revenue, excluding messaging in your mobile portfolio would be comparable with '07. I was just wondering if you could talk us through where do you get the confidence for such a high number of &#x2013; such a high level of incremental growth in '08? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In mobile data, the confidence is very simple. First of all, if you look at the growth rate in the last couple of years on the traffic, we started off extremely low, as we all know, a few years ago. We are now at year-on-year eight times or 10 times higher traffic volume, and it hasn't even begun yet. I think the internet mobilization is widely underestimated in its impact. The fact that traffic volumes are increasing eight times or 10 times year-on-year, and the revenue increases only 40%, is only due to the fact that mobile data prices for access have been extremely high. That is also no secret &#x2013; have been extremely high and have come down rapidly.</p>
          <p>I still think there is, looking ahead into the next year, there is significant room for growth in mobile data and I think it's one of the most important drivers of our industry, because we haven't even started seeing high machine-to-machine volumes, we haven't even started really high volumes in internet surfing, we have &#x2013; there's just an enormous amount of growth to be expected in that area. So, 40% on mobile data growth, in revenues, I think, is doable. I actually think it's conservative, to be honest.</p>

          <p>Mr. Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley, may we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Just a quick question on the free cash flow definition, because obviously everybody has slightly different free cash flow definitions. Could you help us with what proportion of EBITDA and CapEx actually belong to the minorities? I think it's around 2 billion of EBITDA, in a sense, belongs to the minorities that you have, mainly in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Also, are you planning to have any netting off of CapEx in 2008, as you have done in 2007, with sales of real estate in that calculation? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is &#x2013; yes, there is some netting off of cost CapEx. That's what we &#x2013; that's what we did last year as well. If you look into our detailed numbers, you will see that we have seen a total proceeds coming in out of asset disposal in total amount of &#x20AC;0.7 billion. This was netted against the cost CapEx in order to come to the final net CapEx number. Yes, we do expect also some kind of netting effect of '08.</p>
          <p>We will see what total amount it's going to be, but that's how we handle it. And I think what I can say about the minorities is that we have 0.5 billion dividend payouts to &#x2013; with respect to dividends and to cash in our free cash flow statements. That's what we did last year, I do not expect a significant change in that in '08.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I had a question regarding the broadband market in Germany. One of your competitors seems to believe that there is going to be a slowdown in net adds in '08 versus '07, I think it's something about 3 million net adds.</p>
          <p>My question really was, given the fact that prices are now substantially lower than a year or two ago, and the fact that penetration of broadband is lower in Germany than, say, in the UK, France or Spain, do you see any reason why there would be a slowdown in net adds in Germany? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, no, the opposite. I think there is room for growth.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is about to end. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Mr. James Ratzer from New Street Research. May we have your last question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="30" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And if it's the last question, if I could try two, please. The first one was just regarding your narrowband access line in the wireline division. I noticed that that in the fourth quarter was down 6.7% year-on-year. That is a slip from the trend we've seen in the preceding quarters, yet there hasn't been an acceleration in overall line losses. I was wondering what explains that performance in the fourth quarter, and how you see that narrowband access line developing in 2008?</p>
          <p>The second question was just relating to ARPU in T-Mobile USA, which through Q's 1 through 3, had been growing about 2% per annum. That's now fallen back to flat year-on-year, with both voice and data trends slightly slipping. Is there anything that's driven that in the fourth quarter? And how do you see that developing also in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the narrowband line losses you asked for &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; I am not sure I understood the question there, but whether you asked for Q4, narrowband line losses, or access revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="30" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's revenues, please. It seemed to have slipped in the fourth quarter to being down 6.7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="30" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that didn't &#x2013; doesn't seem to have been a change in the rate there at which lines are being lost, so I was wondering why the rates of decline in revenues had suddenly slipped in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mainly affected by price reductions in bundles and also, price reductions for T-Systems. So, in the corporate side, because the telecommunication part of the offerings of T-Systems is &#x2013; has been under price pressure. So we had to be more competitive. And overall, it was pretty much affected by price reductions in bundles, which we did and which we needed to do in order to stay competitive.</p>
          <p>The sequential &#x2013; the second question was ARPU US, I think the contract ARPU was 56 in the fourth quarter, slightly down, and the same as in the fourth quarter of '06. So year-on-year, stable. The sequential fall in contract ARPU was primarily due to a lower variable revenues from contract customers. So, in other terms, lower overage spendings, but it's not a big change over the quarter. Also, there is some seasonal impact in December usually &#x2013; less working days.</p>
