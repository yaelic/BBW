      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us here today at Norwest for the 2012 Half Year Profit Announcement. Joining me this morning is Tom Pockett, our Finance Director; our Managing Director of Supermarkets, Tjeerd Jegen; our Director of BIG W, Julie Coates. The chair next to Julie was supposed to be occupied by Steve Greentree, but he's gone homesick. It's got nothing to do with liquor results, he's just not here. Next to him is Dave Chambers, who is the MD of our PEL business in New Zealand. Together with Tom, Tjeerd, Julie and Dave we'll provide a detailed review of our first half numbers.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation we're going to do a little differently, but if you just look at the agenda it will give a hint of that. We're going to look at the group strategic priorities that we set out on the Investor Day that we held here in early November. We want to touch on those strategic priorities and give a little bit of an update on progress as to how things are going there. We'll then talk about a detailed look at each of the business units and the results and each of the business unit leaders will assist in the presentation of those outcomes, before we close with the detailed financial performance metrics for the group.</p>
          <p>So if I start with the ambition that drove the presentation on the Investor Day. And really it's about Woolworths leveraging its position as Australia's leading retail group, but through a customer-driven future that features both innovation and growth. And the starting point for us on delivering on that ambition starts with the customer, the left hand side of the page. It's a renewed focus here and it's central to the plans that we've got for the future. So knowing and having the customer at the center of everything we do moving forward. And really the customer drives the second item on that slide, which is about multi-options.</p>
          <p>Customers changing, not today, the customer's been changing for the last couple of years in a fairly significant way. And it's not good enough to have just bricks and mortar, it's not good enough to have just online, it's a combination of all those channels and all of those communication types providing new reasons to shop. You're going to hear some of those this morning and we've got more work to do to build on that to compel more and more customers to shop in Woolworths' group of stores. And the great advantage we have is we've got a recognized group of everyday brands for everyday needs, which are the well-known Woolworths group brands.</p>
          <p>I guess the challenge for Woolworths is kind of unique. The challenge for us is to make a strong business even stronger. We've got the chart here that shows out our margin and EBIT and results over the course of the last decade or so, and it's recognition of this being a strong business. But as I said our challenge is to make it stronger.</p>
          <p>Our focus is clear and that's deliver on the capacity for future growth and build that capacity for future growth, while making sure we maintain our shareholder returns in the medium to short-term. So to each of the strategic priorities for future growth and for those that attended the Investor Day these would be very familiar to you and I just want to touch on each of them and then give you an update on our progress to this point in time.</p>
          <p>First one was extend and defend our leadership in food and liquor, the core of our business and the most important part of our business. And we touched on things like returning to a leadership position from a marketing perspective and Tjeerd will update you a little more on how that's applying to the supermarket business. Unlocking our business or probably setting up our business for the new consumer reality, the tougher consumer and competitive reality moving forward. Having a business set correctly is vital and we are focused on doing that.</p>
          <p>Fresh Food, we are Australia's Fresh Food People and Fresh Food growth is one of the largest opportunities for us moving forward and we are making progress. Liquor is an area for us that's continuing to deliver and both market share and sales growth as we move forward and we are happy with the momentum that we have there. Talking about momentum also in New Zealand pleased with how that's traveling and Dave will fill you in on that. So food and liquor is the heart of our business and extending and defending our leadership there is our major focus.</p>
          <p>We also talked about the opportunity to act on our portfolio to make sure that we've got the sort of businesses and the range of businesses we needed. They are businesses that are built for the future with an eye to the future and in line with that, we are acting quickly on the review of how we participate in the consumer electronic business. We've announced the consolidation and divestment of Dick Smith, all the plans to do that and we are also accelerating the alignment of the BIG W offer and the improvements that we've got lined up to set that on its path for the next 10 years featuring Julie's presentation this morning.</p>
          <p>Maintaining our track record of growth is vital to us. And I think our result today shows a strong business; shows a strong profit result, but also shows our preparedness to invest for growth is vital for us. We are confident about our future; we are confident about the future of the Australian consumer and we are investing. We are investing in new stores; we are investing in multi-option retailers we call it which is a combination of shopping channels for all shopping occasions, which include the new online environment. You all know now that we are building a new Home Improvement business and that's tracking well and I'll give you an update on that.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to look at other opportunities both domestically and internationally, that's been a task that's been underway now for a number of years and continues to be the case producing opportunities in the international space is something we continue to keep an eye on. All of that is depending on us having the right enablers and the supply chain is at the heart of the last decade for us and it's going to be at the heart of the next decade for us as well as we move into multi-option retailing.</p>
          <p>Fulfillment, the movement of goods from A to B is very much the future for our business. Continuing to reinvest in the Home Improvement space is part and parcel of that and continuing to grow our supermarket business courtesy of customer data is the other one and we've made significant moves in making better use of customer data and Tjeerd will take you through some of that in the future.</p>
          <p>Talking about Tjeerd, Tjeerd is a good example of our movement here and our progress in combining the best retail talent in Australia with some of the best retail talent from around the world to make sure that this business has what it should have and that is the best thinking, the most recent thinking and the brightest retail minds from around the world in charge of running this business and planning for its future.</p>
          <p>So I'll just briefly now touch on progress that have been made against each of those four strategic priorities. The first is really around the supermarket business and Tjeerd is making excellent progress, I am not going to steal his thunder, he is going to give that to us in some detail in a moment. Suffice to say, we are providing the support that Tjeerd needs and the resources that he needs to deliver on the new Fresh Food People, which is his focus moving forward. The slides one through to four, I'll just point out I've got top section which says work underway and says also more to do at the bottom of the page and we've got a lot more to do in Supermarkets. We're really just starting to get going there and we're pretty excited about the upside.</p>
          <p>We've also &#x2013; looking at positively &#x2013; at the future positively and are opening of 39 new stores. We're on track to open 39 new stores this year is I think testament to our confidence in the future and our capability in delivering our pipeline of great sites for our supermarket business.</p>
          <p>Liquor, as I said a moment ago has been a feature and continues to have strong momentum, strong market share growth and plenty more to come in a business that's I think a very good example of what multi-option retailing is all about. It's got multiple channels of bricks and mortar. It's got multiple online and direct channels as well. I think it's a very good representation of what the opportunity for others in their business can be. And the New Zealand transformation is hit a key landmark this year with all of the stores in New Zealand, now being under the one banner and allowing Dave and his team to really drive that as a focus single business unit going forward. But we've got more to do as the bottom of the page says and the fresh opportunity remains large for us. And, but we've got work to do in order to deliver on that.</p>
          <p>So if I go to acting on &#x2013; acting to maximize our portfolio, and we've announced of course that we plan to consolidate and divest the Dick Smith business. We've announced a one-off charge that goes with that decision and the process is underway and we're pretty pleased with the level of interest that we've got and the discussions with those interested parties are well advanced as I stand here today. BIG W has got a bright future. BIG W has got work to do and Julie's got a good idea of what it is and she'll share some of that with you today. So work's still to be done there.</p>
          <p>Growth, as I said is vital to us and very much a focus for our business. We're investing in multi-option retailing not just in the online platforms, but in the bricks and mortar platforms that we are looking at. We're also investing in having the right people here to manage it and we're thrill to have Penny Winn back to lead the charge in terms of multi-option retailing in our business. And we can point to a number of initiatives over the half that I think show movement and progress. We've upgraded recently our very successful supermarket mobile phone app. We had one and a half million downloads of that application. We've upgraded it that now allows you to shop directly from your phone and pleased to say that we've had 500,000 people take that download. It shows the level of interest and importantly for us it's bringing a whole lot of new customers to Woolworths and that's the power of multi-option retailing moving forward. We're very much looking forward to that.</p>
          <p>We've launched our Door Buster Daily Deals site and also rolling out our Click then Collect option for our online customers. Masters today has nine stores. I think the slide says eight, now it's got nine. Good on you, Clare, you've updated it, thank you. We've got nine stores &#x2013; Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland with the latest store opening in Victoria just yesterday.</p>
          <p>We're on track with our ambitions for Masters both in terms of the number of stores we're getting on the ground and the performance of those stores. In relation to other growth and the last picture on the page really shows the targeted growth that's an targeted acquisitions we're making in the hotel space. Bruce and his team have successfully integrated the Compass Hotel Group in Western Australia, the 12 stores that we acquired there before Christmas. So I think we took them on at the end of November which was a bit of a challenge given the Christmas was right upon us, but the team did that and delivered it and it's well entrenched now with our systems and our brands well and truly in place.</p>
          <p>We're working with the regulator at the moment to hopefully get a favorable outcome to the 31 stores that we're looking to acquire here in New South Wales. So we're targeted, we're focused and building on our successful hotel and liquor business.</p>
          <p>The enablers that I spoke about before, some examples on the page here. We are just about to open after its commissioning the Hoxton Park D.C., state-of-the-art retail distribution center. It will provide for the Masters; it will provide for other Home Improvement customers, it will provide for BIG W first and foremost, but really importantly also is that it's going to provide our fulfillment facilities for our online business; so really looking forward to that being open over the course of the next couple months.</p>
          <p>Category Lab is an internal term, but Category Lab is simply term given to the use of data within the Woolworths group. It's how we're using the loyalty card data for merchandising decisions and store planning decisions in a very formal way and Tjeerd will touch on that with some more detail.</p>
          <p>Quantum is starting to deliver and has a renewed focus on above store costs. We anticipate that they will start delivering into the financial &#x2013; into the next financial year FY 2013, but are pretty excited about the work that's underway there. And I spoke before about the combination of the existing talent with new talent to deliver the best retail team in Australia.</p>
          <p>So to the half-year results, my summary of the half year results is &#x2013; I can make in two points. I think it's very solid result, which shows growth from continuing operations at top line and even an NPAT level, which I think in this environment is a good and solid result. I think the second part, when you look into these numbers that it also highlights the level of investment we are making in the future. So there are two key messages from these numbers. One is I think it's a good strong set of profitable figures and I think it's also testament to the growth &#x2013; the confidence of our growth in the future and the investment that we are making.</p>
          <p>So just to touch on some of those numbers, if I start with the continuing operations side of the slide, which is obviously excluding the Dick Smith business, top line sales of 5.2%, represent $28.9 billion in sales, EBIT level of $1.825 billion or $1.826 billion, which is an increase of 3.3% on last year and earnings per share going up by 3.4% to $97.2.</p>
          <p>So if we look at the total group, after the once-off $300 million restructure provision, I just want to touch on EBIT, at $1.545 billion shows a 13.5% reduction on the group's number last year. NPAT down 16.8% to $967 million and we're declaring a dividend of $0.59 per share, which is an increase of 3.5% on the previous year. So it's a great platform for our group. It's a &#x2013; for us to move forward with confidence and look to growing this business into the future. And talking of growth, I'd like to welcome to the stage Tjeerd Jegen, who is going to talk about our engine room, the supermarkets and the work that's underway there. Thanks, Tjeerd.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Grant. Good morning. My name Tjeerd Jegen, responsible for the Australian liquor &#x2013; sorry, petrol and supermarket business, and I would like to give you an update on the progress we're making with our strategy. But before I do so, I would like to first start with some financial highlights for the half.</p>
          <p>And starting with the top line, so we had good growth, 5.9%, but more pleasingly so, are the bottom line results went even faster with 6.3%. It's all driven by good improvements in margin and margin went up by better shrink management and I will refer back to it later, great improvements in our own-brand sales and good global buying. We've also opened 25 new stores in the half and we'll continue to open 14 more stores, so 39 stores in this French year, which is a record for us in opening new stores. That's the financial highlight.</p>
          <p>I would like to move on to our strategy. We kicked off our strategy last year in November at the conference and our four key pillars I would like to go over all four of them now. First of all, it's being First Choice in Fresh Foods. We are the leader in Fresh Food. We are Australia's Fresh Food People and we believe there is extensive opportunity to grow Fresh Food even further and that's at the bottom of the foundation of our plan, growing Fresh Foods.</p>
          <p>Also providing unbeatable value to our customers, every single time they come to our store. And we are making good progress there. And when they come to our store, we also would like to delight them, surprise them with great new offers. And last, but not least we are tailoring shopping experience, you can now shop everywhere, and anywhere with your mobile phone with Fresh Food People. And we've summarized all of the things we are doing in this space as the new Fresh Food People. That's the summary of our strategy. And the word people is very important, because our people make a difference. And before I go to our strategy, I would like to highlight the change I've been able to make in my senior team. And Grant already spoke about our ambition to combine world-class, international retail talent with the best local retail talent and my team's testament to that.</p>
          <p>And I am pleased to announce that I have enjoyed two new joiners in my team David Marr, who is an Australian, but he's worked on the supplier side first, Fosters, being Financial Director, then moved to the U.K. and worked as Financial Director for Tesco, a company quite &#x2013; which I'm quite familiar with, but he worked in the U.K. And then he decided to go back with his family to Australia and he's a very strong part of my team as being the GM of Finance.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to announce that on the 23 of April, my team will have another new recruit, which is Alex Dower, who has also had a supplier background; Mars, PepsiCo, Tesco U.K., strong roles in Retail, Fresh Foods and Grocery and currently works private equity for Pret A Manger and he will take up the role of General Manager of Grocery and Own Brands. But I've got a solid foundation and veterans in Woollies and all of them combined have 50 years on average of good experience in Australian market. And this is an example of a great combination of local talent, international talent driving our business forward.</p>
          <p>We're making very good progress on our agency pitch. We're nearing completion. We'll be able to announce a new agency in the very near future and with a new agency in our financial year last quarter; we'll start a new brand campaign, which will clearly highlight our ambitions to grow Fresh Foods to the next level.</p>
          <p>Talking about Fresh Foods, this is core of our business. We're Australia's Fresh Food People and we're celebrating 25 years of very proud years in this business. We've seen great growth in important categories in our business; deli, bakery and meat. And especially meat I would like to give you a bit more update on how we're performing there and what a capability has led to in giving back to our customers.</p>
          <p>We've also made good progress on our supply chain. Our ambition is to reduce the lead time from Fresh Products from soil to shelf by one day. And I'm pleased to announce half way through the year, we've reduced the lead time by half a day, so well on track to deliver on a promise, which is very important because most of the customers' feedback is I would like to keep my Fresh Food about Woollies fresher for longer in my kitchen. And our winning 2015 store format, which are rolling out across the nation, which generates significantly high Fresh Food sales, we've been able to improve upon. We've got a couple of pilot stores where we're implementing new elements of Fresh Food and they are delivering strong growth upon a good performing format and those elements of improvement we will also integrate and refurbishments and our new stores going forward.</p>
          <p>Meat, I'm really proud of this because we've always been strong in our meat business. For 20 years, we've been buying and working with farmers in Australia and buying direct our cattle all across Australia. That's a unique skill set and something which we own. With working with the MLA we've been able to get accreditation on 13 of the most important cuts of our beef and having an MSA label on them. And the great thing is we're the only supermarket, national supermarket in Australia who has this across all the stores across 13 cuts of beef.</p>
          <p>What does it means, very technical story, of course, it's about maturing beef a bit longer, it's about changing the way you debone the product, change the way you do your supply chain. But for customers it's a very simple USP. It's tender, juicy beef all the time. Doesn't matter if you fry it, you grill it, you roast it, it's always good. That's our promise to customers. And we see strong uptake. We've launched in January. We've seen double-digit growth on those 13 cuts in a market which is more or less flat. We're rolling out new cuts for winter, a big range of roasts, and we're also working with the MLA to have a lamb MSA range coming out soon. So great strength because of the unique way we've always done our supply chain, we're now able to give more customer benefits in a core protein category in Fresh Foods.</p>
          <p>We're also making good progress on value, unbeatable value. We've launched a new ticketing system which much more clearly highlights to save customers make on specials, how we communicate our promotion store and we've also started implementing new ways of giving value to our customers; giving value at the most important moments of the year. Everybody is buying a Christmas ham at Christmas, but we are the only ones giving $5 off when you buy your ham the weekend before Christmas. And by doing so, we've seen growth &#x2013; double-digit sales growth on a product which pretty ordinary in Australia, but we've been able to grow significantly with giving more value. And I can tell you our ham is the best ham in the country, because again we source it directly ourselves.</p>
          <p>And for Australia Day, we thought wouldn't it be great, the most important iconic products, a lamb leg has the best value in the market. So we offered customers $10 off. We had 97% redemption on our products. We had some issues in getting our stock in stores, but we had a very big success with that. I already talked about the fact that our EBIT, our bottom line grew faster than our sales line, and a very big driver was good progress on shrink. We've got 30 projects at the moment simultaneously in our pipeline to reduce the shrink levels, some of them national rollout, some of them in pilot phase, and they are helping us reducing our shrink levels. If you look at the international benchmark we feel confident we can continue to reduce our shrink bill by really implementing great, good retail skills and we've already been achieving a double-digit basis point reduction in the first half and we are confident that we'll continue on that journey of reducing our shrink bill.</p>
          <p>A personal pride of me is to bring more customer-led insights and bringing the customer on the decision every time to make a decision in our stores. Grant already spoke about the Category Labs. While we met in November, we just started. We've got six full-time teams supporting our commercial team, 35 categories have undergone a deep dive as we call it and 20% of sales is now touched by Category Labs.</p>
          <p>We've also started customer talkback sessions, which is a focus group in our stores with a professional moderator and a store manager and area manager sitting in the back listening to what customers like about us, but more importantly, what customers would like to see improved in our business, which is great for a store manager because he can then improve his store, and it's great for us because we combine all the insights every single month and have a clear agenda what we want to improve nationwide. And all of this delivers us great benefits, it's great benefits in the way we lay out our stores, great benefits in the way we use our space and great benefits in the range we build; and it's bottom up, it's coming out of insight on category level.</p>
          <p>And talking about range, we know from a customer insight that own brands are important, but we also know that customers really like choice and they like a depth and breadth in our ranges. And if you look at the hierarchy of range, the most important part of our range are the proprietary national brands, supported by a good own brand range. And our objective is and has always been to work with our key national brand suppliers to provide growth in our categories. And over the last six months, I've highlighted some examples and I will touch upon two to illustrate our joint collaboration with key suppliers in growing category value.</p>
          <p>One of them is with Unilever. If you go into the detergent category and if you compare the value per wash of powder and liquids, it's more or less the same, but they've been able, with the technology they were using in their labs, to develop a new product, the pod. And that pod has about 3 times higher customer value in the category than if you would wash with powder or liquid. Great for Unilever, great for us and great performance improvement for customers. We have supported that launch like no other retailer in Australia and our market share is significantly above our fair share and, as a consequence, our detergent category keeps on growing.</p>
          <p>In Fresh Foods, because Unilever is a very big company, we also give a lot of opportunities to small companies and we've launched only with us a unique organic yogurt. I can recommend you to use it for breakfast, it's a great product; it's five:am. Small company, lists in our stores, 7 million of new sales in our company and they are about to sign a contract with us and supporting us on Macro. And Macro is really the fastest-growing brand in our business. It's a product that's good for you. There's four elements in Macro; there's an organic range, a natural range, a free range range and a free-from range if you've got a need to eat something differently because of health reasons.</p>
          <p>It's the fastest growing brand in our business, and especially our free range poultry is extremely popular with mothers who would like to give their children food which is more responsible. We are also making very good progress in our mid-tier, our Woolworths Select. We have seen great benefits of launching new Select products, for example, in the pizza category, which was on the decline. We've launched a greater new range, great value of pizzas and this launch has been enabling us to turn around the negative growth into positive territory. We've also recently launched a great ice cream range, and I can recommend you the Triple Chocolate, it's my favorite. It's really good, it's great value. And together with the Marine Stewardship Council we've launched a range of sustainable seafood products and the line-caught tuna is a great product which also provides a catch for the future years to come, not just this year.</p>
          <p>Tailoring our shopping more to our customers' needs is very, very important for our strategy, multi-option as we call it. We've already seen great uplift in the app, which is a great benefit, if you want to go shopping, if you want to know what the closest store is and the opening hours. As we said in November, we also would like to use the app as a device to start shopping with your phone.</p>
          <p>We've launched it, half a million of people have downloaded the new version and we've already seen great pick-up rates of new customers actually using the mobile phone for shopping. And about half of those customers are new customers to the company. So it's great for incremental sales. We've also launched a new platform, the engine of our online business, which has many, many benefits for customers, but also great efficiency benefits for ourselves in the way we pick our products in-store and are able to deliver them to our customers. And, by the way, we don't just deliver to our customers, we also give them an option to pick it up whenever they want, wherever they want with Click &amp; Collect, and we believe it's a big opportunity going forward.</p>
          <p>What would be a supermarket offer in Australia without a great petrol business? And our petrol business is growing fast. Of course, we're being helped in terms of sales dollars by a higher price per liter. But also on a volume basis, we've seen strong growth in petrol. We've also seen healthy EBIT growth in our petrol business and we've opened 10 new sites in the half, and we keep on continuing to grow this service to our customers. So just in summary, the first half, supermarkets and liquor, good top line growth, 5.9%, strong bottom line growth, 6.3%, and we're making good progress on our strategy. I'm looking forward to update you on the progress on our strategy next time we meet.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>So as you can see on the slide, Steve Greentree was going to do this part. Steve's not well, so I'll talk to about the growth in liquor and it's a good story and one I'm pleased to tell. Very strong top line growth and reflecting in $3.6 billion in retail sales now for our liquor business. With that comes market share growth, with that comes a strengthening business and more customers.</p>
          <p>So our leadership really is reflective of I think the structure that we now have in liquor, which is a multi-option approach. So we have multiple channels serving the different styles of shopping occasions that customers have. So destination Dan Murphy, one-stop shop Woolworths liquor, super convenient BWS, direct and online Cellarmasters and now Dan Murphy online shows the options that we're providing to cover the opportunity that there is within the liquor business.</p>
          <p>The nature of the Cellarmasters business has brought with it great benefits to our business and allowed us to vertically integrate and leverage a vertically integrated business that Cellarmasters is. So we're announcing today or sharing with you today that we're producing our first wines out of the Dorrien Estate facility that will increasingly provide winemaking facilities for our house brand stable of products within liquor. And space growth following new Dan Murphy's, whether that be stand-alone sites or part of our site on our hotel portfolio, all are very important for us being able to grow our liquor business.</p>
          <p>Talking about hotels, touching on that for a moment, 3.9% sales growth, which is I think very good in the environment for the hotel business. We've seen tremendous growth in the food business and we've seen steady growth in the gaming business over the course of this half. We anticipate that we'll continue to grow this business. We've integrated the Compass Hotels, which will of course add to our business there, and the sales increases flowed through mostly to the EBIT result, courtesy of hard work from Bruce and his team to take costs out of that business, given the higher mix that food now is of our hotel business. So a terrific effort there and more to come, building on our 294 venues that we've got hopefully with the acquisition of the stable of Laundy Hotels. So growing our network of hotels and retail liquor outlets is important and we've got many more to open across our stable of BWS, Dan Murphy's and Woolworths Liquor over the coming half.</p>
          <p>The new format that we shared with you at the Investor Day for our Dan Murphy's stores which showcases better our spirits, our premium spirits and our wine sections within the Dan Murphy's store, now is in 23 of our stores and continuing to rollout and we're seeing great uplift from that refurbishment investment.</p>
          <p>Multi-option I've touched on, and we've got more to do in that space. The Dan Murphy's online facility is quite new and that is growing rapidly. Own brand, I think Steve shared at the Investor Day that our own brands now are equivalent to being the second-largest supplier to our liquor business, which gives you an idea of the scale of house brands within the liquor business that we've driven, firstly, through our wine category, but now through spirits and most recently in beer and ciders and ginger beer and all of the emerging categories that there are within the liquor business.</p>
          <p>Vertical integration I've touched on and our initial steps into that territory leveraging the Cellarmasters assets and best new talent or growing our talent. The best example of that really is to show the smooth succession that's undertaken or being undertaken in our hotels business with Bruce Senior being succeeded by Bruce Mathieson, Jr., a smooth transition, equivalent almost. No, that's wrong, I was going to say equivalent experience in the marketplace, but that's not possible, he's much older than you, Bruce. So &#x2013; but we've not missed a beat with that transition and Bruce Jr.'s role has been taken by Dom Di Deo, who is with us also this morning, who runs the operational side of our hotels.</p>
          <p>Our joint venture in the hotels business is a very successful one. We've proven that over the years. It's the backbone of a lot of the growth that we were able to talk about here today and is a good and solid partnership moving forward. So I want to introduce to the stage for the first time Dave Chambers to a profit announcement. Welcome Dave and...</p>

          <p>Well, thanks, Grant. Good afternoon, Dave Chambers, Managing Director of Progressive. I just want to touch quickly on some of the highlights from our business and we're actually very pleased with the continuing momentum of our business. Our sales grew 3%, comp sales up 4.5%, which in a very low inflationary environment gave us some really good real growth.</p>
          <p>In the half, we did have a little event that helped some of our sales and of course it had the right outcome as well. So that was really terrific, but that did give our sales and our comp sales in some of those locations around New Zealand a good boost. Really pleased with our EBIT growth, up 9.2% and was very strong indeed. Our CODB percentage increased entirely by a new distribution center that we opened in week one in Auckland, as well as increased insurance premiums sort of flowing through into all businesses in New Zealand and that is affecting us. Without those two issues, our CODB percentage would have been slightly below the prior year.</p>
          <p>And I was very pleased to be able to open four new stores in the half &#x2013; sorry four stores; two new, one replacement, and one of our earthquake-damaged stores in Christchurch, the Palms was able to reopen during the half.</p>
          <p>If you look at our seven strategic imperatives and touching on the first one, the single brand. As Grant said, we did achieve that. We achieved it on just about 27 months from the public announcement that we would go to one brand. It's really been a fantastic achievement by the team in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>I think there are many retailers around the world, who have actually tried to rebrand stores, rebrand supermarkets and actually haven't succeeded. It's not only have we done it very quickly and there were 18 stores that we had to rebrand during the half, but most important things we took the customers with us. And not only the customers we had, we took some of our competitors customers with us as well. So that's been a real highlight. It's been terrific to actually get that achieved and then as we work on our next strategic imperatives for the next few years we can actually build on having the one brand.</p>
          <p>We need to continue to grow our network of stores and we've opened two stores since the end of the first half and we have further six stores currently under construction, two more of those should open in the second half, which gives us four currently under construction that will open quite early in the first half of the next financial year. In January, we opened our first City center store in Auckland, just up of Queen Street and Victoria Street performing exceptionally well, hitting double its targets and the customer response has been fantastic; the opposition opened a store just down the road from us about three weeks ago and didn't take any business of us at all. So very pleased about that.</p>
          <p>Our multi-channel engagement with customers has been something we've continued to drive very hard through the half and we will continue to drive into the future. We have 800,000 unique Onecard holders shopping with us every single week in our stores. And just as Tjeerd talked about the Category Lab and using that data to actually tailor our offer, tailor our range, our layout and everything else about our business. We have 93,000 fans on Facebook and we really get some terrific interaction from those customers. They tell us pretty immediately whether something is good or not and we're able to respond rapidly to make changes as and when we need to.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we have launched, we upgraded our Countdown website during the half and our customers can now go online into the Onecard details and every week receive an electronic mailer that is tailored to being with the office that they like to purchase and shows them the office that we have, with our office that they might not be interested in. So that &#x2013; and that's had terrific feedback. And we've also launched our Countdown on YouTube site. So if you want to know how to cook some products, have a fillet a fish or cut up a chicken, then go on YouTube, click on Countdown and you'll be able to see some of those things coming up there.</p>
          <p>Our franchise network, part of our business we don't talk about terribly much. We currently have 52 stores that are franchise to us. We're under two brands; we have a FreshChoice brand and SUPERVALU. These are small stores and part of our strategy is to also grow this network. We currently have three stores under construction by our franchisees, not by us and last November we were lucky enough to have the Prime Minister of New Zealand come and open our very first FreshChoice store in Auckland.</p>
          <p>It's a little store. The owner operators put $7.5 million of their own money into it, their own capital. It's performing well and it will be a really good addition to our Countdown network around New Zealand, particularly in rural centers. They will be smaller format stores, but it's really important for us to be able to grow our total presence within New Zealand and to be able to leverage our supply chain effectively across more stores than just Countdown.</p>
          <p>And lastly, the supply chain, as I said in week one of this financial year, we did launch a National Distribution Center in Auckland. It has gone extremely well. The logistics team has done a great job. It came in under budget, on time, all the KPIs have been met, service level in the 90% from week one, and it really gives us terrific capacity for the future for the next few years. It's enabled us to do some things like put Coca-Cola through our network previously, to October of last year, that was going direct to store and already it's showing us benefits in our margin and that will continue to grow over the coming years. So I'd like to hand over to Julie Coates from BIG W.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dave. Well, good morning everyone and thank you for the opportunity to outline to you BIG W's first half results, as well as give you an update of our progress against our strategic priorities we talked to you about in November. Oh, I've gone backwards. I would characterize the BIG W first half results as a tale of two quarters.</p>
          <p>So in quarter two, we saw an improving result, both in terms of sales and profits. The $30 million shortfall in sales, translated to a $5 million in shortfall EBIT for the first half. We saw improvement in our gross margin, largely driven off our global sourcing and strong markdown control. There was a pleasing increase in customer numbers and units sold in December in a challenging trading environment, and that trend has continued into the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Deflation averaged 5% across the half. And our costs were well controlled with costs in existing businesses, existing stores, staying flat even against the inflationary pressures of wage and light and power increases. The increase in the cost dollars are largely attributable to the four new stores that we opened in the half.</p>
          <p>As I said in November, what's important to our customers right now is to win on value everyday and value is about price and it's about quality and I talked to you about the launch of the Emerson brand. And what you have here is the front page of our catalog launched two weeks ago for our season launch and what you'll see there &#x2013; for those of you that under acquainted with the latest trends &#x2013; is colored denim.</p>
          <p>Colored denim jeans at $18.86 teamed with a $5 ribbed-T. Our customers have loved this and, in fact, we will continue to drop this product into our business across the coming half. Emerson is just one of the examples of what we're doing to continually involve the categories across our business in line with our customers' expectations. And for those of you that are interested I'm dressed top-to-toe in Emerson today, particularly for those that are online.</p>
          <p>We also launched our Get it For Less marketing campaign and that effectively communicated our price leadership position and we know that because we've done the research to understand the impact it had in our business. But quite excitedly, we launched the Smart Value brand. Now this is product that existed in our business; a two-pack pillow for $7 existed in our business. We've repackaged it, we've put it in orange, it's front and center, we've called it out in the catalog. And I'm pleased to say that the launch of this business has driven an increase in units, sales dollars and, importantly, gross profit dollars in our business.</p>
          <p>BIG W is the largest discount department store in terms of sales, with the smallest number of stores. So we know we can grow market share by increasing our store footprint. We also know we can improve profit as a result. We've had a very successful launch of our online business through our Daily Deals, and last night's hourly deal, three hourly deal in fact sold out in two hours. So there's a question about quantification, but it just goes to how popular that is. And we've doubled our sales in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year in online.</p>
          <p>We launched the app and that app has been downloaded by over 260,000 customers. That's a price-checking app. But by the end of this financial year that app will actually be transactional. So that's a fantastic initiative for our business. But, importantly, we need to leverage of this online platform to become truly multi-option, and working with Penny and the team we aim to be Australia's leading general merchandise, multi-option retailer.</p>
          <p>Why that's important to us? Is because we know the customer who shops online and in-store and we know this from our Everyday Rewards data, is twice as valuable to BIG W as those that shop either online or in store. We've talked a little bit about the supply chain. This is Hoxton Park. It actually doesn't look quite like that at the moment because we've been filling it with stock. So indent stocks we started receiving in January and local stock in February and our first dispatch is March. But this is not just any shed. This shed takes the best of what we've learnt in Woolworths supermarkets with things like voice pick, together with the best of what we know exists around the world; goods to person. And that is exactly as it sounds, the product comes to the picker rather than the picker going to the product, sounds simple, let me tell you the technology is not.</p>
          <p>What this shed will do is to continue to drive productivity in our business, and to continue to manage &#x2013; help us manage the flow of merchandise to the stores and the customer. But it's also taking lead times out of that flow of merchandise. So this shed along with the investments we've made in the last three years in processes and systems with our <mark type="ph" /> cart (46:40) system, our automated stock replenishment system, and our planning system, for example has taken the lead times for our cross-dock product from 21 days to 8 days.</p>
          <p>The fifth and most important &#x2013; and one of the most important strategic initiatives is of course stepping up our global sourcing. In FY 2012, we will deliver 50% more product into our business through direct sourcing than in FY 2011. We already have plans for FY 2013 to be 50% more than FY 2012. So this is an important part of our strategic initiatives to continue to drive our gross margin.</p>
          <p>And just before I sum up, I'd also like to mention that Glenn Gilzean is joining the team as the General Manager, Store Operations. Glenn was formerly the Group Director for Retail Operations in Woolworths in South Africa. He replaces Craig Partridge and Craig has made a real contribution to BIG W over the last six years. Unfortunately Craig has moved on to join Penny to run the &#x2013; well not unfortunately for Penny, but unfortunate for me to join the logistics team to run the operations for Woolworths Limited.</p>
          <p>So, in summing up, I think you can say that the strategy is really clear and the BIG W team knows exactly what they need to do to deliver it. It's about winning on value everyday and winning on value is about price and quality. It's about continuing to evolve the merchandize categories in our business and as Grant says, we've got more to do here, but we've certainly made a start. It's about leveraging off our online platform to become truly multi-option. But to do that, we've also built a world-class supply chain to enable us to do that. So you would have heard Grant talk about Hoxton Park not just supporting BIG W, but in fact supporting the multi-option business, of which BIG W will be a huge customer. It's about exploiting those &#x2013; that supply chain that we've built to drive productivity, and lastly it's about stepping up our efforts in global sourcing.</p>
          <p>So with that I'd like to hand it back to Grant.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Julie. I'm just going to wrap up by touching really briefly on Home Improvement and on Dick Smith. Home Improvement, and Masters in particular. Seven stores opened in the half nine in total trading, as of today, spread around the country and there will be 15 by the end of the year, at least 15 by the end of the year. 18 under construction around the country at the moment, so good progress and on-track in terms of our property pipeline, as far as our property pipeline goes. In terms of performance we're very pleased with how the stores are going. They've opened up strongly, they continue to trade well, and they're absolutely where they need to be for us moving forward.</p>
          <p>One of the next big things for us, in coping with the multi-option theme that Julie spoke about, is that we will have online transactional Home Improvement courtesy of Masters over the next coming months. We'll be the first business to do so. So that will have the great advantage for us of spreading the Masters name around the country more quickly than we can get bricks and mortar around the country. I think the benefits of that are obvious. So a business that we're really happy with the progress in.</p>
          <p>Dick Smith, we spoke about a lot at the half-year sales announcement and I just want to just briefly pause on the results of this business. First of all, I think it's one of the few consumer electronics businesses that is showing positive sales and positive comp sales, and I would say, a strong positive comp sales. If you look at the Australian number there, comp sales of 2.4% for the first half, and in our New Zealand business, a very strong 6.5% comp sales for a consumer electronic business in 2012.</p>
          <p>I don't think that's bad at all and a pretty good effort in relation to the EBIT result as well, $20 million last year and $19.5 million this year. It shows the focus that we're seeing in a team we've had on this business and it hasn't missed a beat. In fact, it's gathering momentum if anything over the last few months. But we've made a clear decision in respect to the future of that business and its future within the Woolworths Group and we've changed our tack to be looking at consolidating that business and in the process of divesting it. And of course, the once-off $300 million provision features in the half-year profit announcement this year.</p>
          <p>So, it's just a productivity, because it's so central to do what drives Woolworths both now and in the future, and it's just one slide. And we've put Quantum at the top just to add some more information around what Quantum is and what it does in this business, and there are a number of key planks here. Firstly, the direct global sourcing, it's an important part of BIG W. It's an increasingly important part of Supermarkets. It will be an important part of our online businesses going forward.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is really clear there and that's to double the amount of money attributed to globally sourced products in our business. That's no small number and &#x2013; but we're very clear on how that's going to be achieved moving forward. With that, comes all of the benefits of new products, increased range and substantial margin improvement moving forward.</p>
          <p>The not for resale area is an area of opportunity for us. We're taking an aim at a number there that's about $4 billion. So it's a big number that we're working on getting an improvement for, and obviously even a small increase &#x2013; improvement rather in our not for resale business will see us in a great position there. We've recruited to get the best from around the world also in respect to that not for resale chase and they're in place now and that's underway.</p>
          <p>Sustainability is important for us given that the carbon taxes looming and the costs that will come as part of &#x2013; particularly in relation to energy. We're working hard and have been for a number of years in truth to make sure that we're minimizing the energy cost increases effect on our business. And above store costs, which is the real focus of climate at this particular point in time, taking aim at our above store costs to ensure that they provide some of the fuel for the growth that we're looking to deliver in this business.</p>
          <p>Logistics though is at its core, it's at the core of lot of what we're talking about whether it'd be fulfillment or whether or not it'd be sustaining our existing bricks and mortar business. And our ambition we shared with you at the Investor Day and that is to continue decreasing the cost per carton within our supply chain. We're very clear on how we've delivered that up until this point in time, which is the yellow line on the slide. We're very clear on what we need to do to continue that line heading in a downward direction moving forward.</p>
          <p>The point we made, and I wanted to make again today, but the point we made at the Investor Day was that we've made the really big investments in supply chain up to this point in time and the job for us now is to slip those assets without having to invest the same sort of money in our supply chain infrastructure moving forward.</p>
          <p>So that being said, to the detailed numbers for the first half, I'm going to ask Tom to help us with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks Grant. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll just take you through some of the aspects of the balance sheet and the cash flow. One of the key things here is our balance sheet and cash flow this year really reflect the investment we're making in our strategic initiatives. They really underpin Woolworths' growth over the next three years to five years; in particular, Home Improvement, Cellarmasters and the store growth part in particular in Supermarkets. So, I think that's just an important aspect of how we should look at the cash flow.</p>
          <p>In terms of our balance sheet, inventory was up about 14%, primarily driven by the growth of the inventory in Masters business, as we roll out new stores and stock the distribution center. Cellarmasters acquisition, the increase in store openings right towards the end, particularly supermarkets had a bit of an impact.</p>
          <p>As Grant said on the previous slide, we're really ramping up our overseas sourcing and that as we take ownership of that stock earlier we will get a higher stock that will be clear that's got a much higher margin when that process is through the system. And if you back out all those just for information, you have average inventory days down a fraction.</p>
          <p>Trade payables are up 6.4%, mainly reflecting Masters and Cellarmasters. Receivables are up just under 16%. There's two elements in it; there's a Cellarmasters acquisition and there's a bit of an impact from the timing of receivables and most of which the cash was collected in January.</p>
          <p>Fixed assets are up due to the CapEx spend and the intangibles are up due &#x2013; primarily due to our acquisitions during the period. Our net repayable debt, whilst up $657 million from December, was only up about $120 million from June and really reflects that we &#x2013; despite all our expenditure we only grew down on debt just over $100 million for the period.</p>
          <p>Our average inventory days, as I mentioned decreased, 0.6 days when you back out all of those strategic initiatives that we are undertaking. In terms of our cash flow, there were some quite interesting elements in this. We had a buildup. We've really tried to provide detail information on the cash flow, so people can see what's going on. So I hope you appreciate the greater transparency. We have shown you the buildup of stocks for Masters and the impact of overseas indent has had. There was also as I said some issues on the timing of receivables, which really we received in the January and a slight impact from the super payment that we've paid this year, but haven't paid last year in December.</p>
          <p>Interest is up, as expected, because of the share buyback that we did and the CapEx. The tax paid rate whilst normal this year was lower last year because we got some benefits from the investment allowance and R&amp;D from the government, which was very nice.</p>
          <p>The purchase of the businesses relates to Compass and Tait's and we're up just over $200 million in relation to property development for the period. We've also broken out the Lowe's contribution so that you can see how much Lowe's are contributing so which comes off our CapEx spend. And combined with the proceeds from the issues and all the dividend, cash was down about $91 million, which is quite a relatively small amount, considering the activity that we're doing in terms of investing.</p>
          <p>Shareholder payouts, fairly straightforward, strong history of shareholder payouts, which shows our intention to reward shareholders going forward. In terms of capital management, we executed 1.2 billion syndicated facility in October 2011. We did a $700 million hybrids issue, which you'd be familiar with.</p>
          <p>There's no maturity to debt in the immediate term so we're pretty through in terms of renewing all our debt facilities. There'll be no share back during 2012. We're targeting about up to $200 million in property sales for the year and our fixed charge cover remains very strong at 3.04 times. So built up over the last few years, we did capital management, plus clearly investments in property and this brought us back to 3.04 times.</p>
          <p>Funds employed is down, when you back out the provision and some of the investments we've made, which don't have the full earnings, yet back up to 16.7. But as we continue to rollout new stores, the new store profitability will lag the investment in ROFE. That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. So just comment on the outlook to complete the wrap up, and we're anticipating that the trading conditions will remain subdued for the remainder of this financial year as a result of the external market conditions, and I think they're all pretty well known to us.</p>
          <p>We're looking to continue to expand and invest moving forward. So our behavior in the first half will be reflected again in the second half. We spoke and pulled out and highlighted Masters particularly, when we gave this guidance in the first instance. That commentary hasn't changed and is moving according to plan.</p>
          <p>So if I can just restate that our guidance is &#x2013; we're continuing to &#x2013; we expect the growth of net profit after-tax excluding the restructuring provision of $300 million for Dick Smith will be in the range of 2% to 6% for the FY 2012 year.</p>
          <p>So just to briefly recap. Our ambition is important for us to share because it sits out what we're undertaking to do here and that's about setting our business up for growth in the future. We're approaching the future confidently, but we're doing it in a way that has a business set at the current pace if you like of the external market. So we're aligning our business to that and also confidently investing for the future. So we're working hard here on making a strong business even stronger and at its heart is a focus on the customer, and our investments I think reflect that and our intention to continue for Woolworths to be a growth business moving forward.</p>
          <p>So that's the formal part of the presentation for today and we'll move now to questions. We'll do questions firstly in the room, and then we'll move to the phones thereafter. So <mark type="ph" /> David (1:01:10), if you want to start with you, welcome.</p>

          <p>Hi, Grant. Thank you. Yeah, I'll open the batting, if I may. Just two questions. The first one's fairly broad and the second one just a specific one. But the first question I've got is the whole theme about investing for growth in the future. I think I read Tesco saying just recently, it might have been our analyst in the U.K. commenting that what they said, they said that they're cutting back or readjusting their capital spend based upon a more subdued outlook. Now, admittedly, the U.K. is a bit more subdued than what it is here.</p>

          <p>But, the Woolworths style seems to be that when things get tougher externally you seem to go a bit harder on your CapEx and you seem to want to really drive hard and I'm just a bit concerned about that, particularly given the trading conditions in the next three years to five years, I think, it would be fair to assume they're going to be a lot harder than what they were in the last three years to five years. And I suppose, whilst establishing market positions, when you look at your CapEx and your investment in inventory, it's going to be pretty tough to show an increasing return on investment, given your attitude toward investing for future growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd just like to hear how you can generate growth and returns given a tough external environment and given your focus to establish growth and establish a market position going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, your question's a fair one and has been a big focus for us, <mark type="ph" /> David (1:02:48), on how we look at the future. But I guess the hint is in the wrap up I gave very briefly, which is about we have to adjust our business to what the norm is going to be moving ahead in terms of the prevailing conditions. We tend to agree with what you're saying, that the next three years are going to be no better than the last three and certainly the next decade is going to be very different to the one that we've just come off. But we've got scope in our business to adjust our business, to change gears in our business. And I don't mean just from an investment point of view, I mean in terms of how we structured our cost base, some of the fundamentals of our business.</p>
          <p>And our plan is to adjust our business for the reality of the new era and invest for growth so that we can take advantage of that. It's not about scaling it back to make it smaller or to see our opportunities for growth evaporate, but we're realistic about what we've got to do to change our business and reset it for the reality of the new era.</p>
          <p>But for us, that effort should have in parallel with it sensible investments in the future. And we've talked a lot about multi-option here and people get sick of us talking about it, but really it's an important part of how we're looking forward. Customers have changed. It's not just the external environment has changed, their needs have changed and we can't be sitting there with a business model that suits the past and not the future. So you're right. We have changed gears before and we have invested before when times have looked a little less certain, and that's part and parcel of why we're able to sit here in 2012 and say we sit atop a very solid and well performing business. So my answer to your questions is in two parts: investment without resetting our business I think would be wrong, resetting our business and making investments make sense to us and that's the path we're on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're investing and the reason why our return on funds employed is lagging where it's been historically is clearly because of acquisitions we've made and the investments that we've made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the last couple of years it has been lagging, and can you see &#x2013; can you get that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, we believe we can. I'm not going to put a timeframe around it, but because we've got more investment to do in Masters, we've got more investment to do in multi-channel, we've got more investment to do to deliver the property pipeline that we've been working hard to deliver. So we're going to continue investing, but we've got to also balance what we're doing and continue to manage our balance sheet and make sure we fit within the parameters that we've historically held dear, such as our rating and fixed cover and the like, parameters that we stare at, and Tom particularly, every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one final specific question, probably more to Tom. When you open a store and when you close a store, a supermarket, when the cost of opening, such as the training of the labor, the razzamatazz and all that, do you charge that straight to your EBIT, that line, or do you capitalize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's all written off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all written off. So in the EBIT line, the opening costs and all that gets straight to your bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I could add, <mark type="ph" /> David (1:06:29), just one other thing to what you said, Grant. There is an opportunity here, if the developer market wasn't as depressed as it was, we wouldn't be doing this development, we'd be getting the developers to do it, as we traditionally have. But that market is depressed. Hopefully it will start coming back and we will be not doing developments going forward. There is clearly an opportunity here to continue that process and then sell those stores and recycle that capital in the future. So I guess the question we always get, you could stop new store development and then once you stop, you've got a three-year hole, maybe four-year hole or we use our balance sheet and keep going through this period.</p>
          <p>So that's also our thinking. And at some extent for your point, probably not sufficient, we had a forecast there about $1.4 billion and we did pull it back to $1.2 billion and a lot of that is sitting in some of the way we're going to look at refurbishments going forward. So maybe not &#x2013; maybe we make a new store look like 2015, but then Tjeerd really looking at individual items to do within the store as opposed to a full store reset. So we're looking at very specific elements within the store, such as sushi and Eastgardens, et cetera, where we can actually see specific returns on that spend. So hopefully that helps.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Grant. Ben Gilbert from UBS. You talked a bit about the strategy to divert some of the short-term pain for long-term gain and the supplier issues <mark type="ph" /> raising more documents (1:08:20) in the first half. Can you help us understand how much of an impact that had on your first half result in the supermarkets business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to tell because the first half wasn't normal trading. We know that it's had an impact simply because of what occurs in those sort of negotiations, but I couldn't put a figure on it and I wouldn't because, as I said, trading patterns are impacted by a whole lot of other things; weather on items such as soft drinks and cordials and deli items and all that sort of things are probably a bigger factor in the first half than any one particular supplier. But we made no secret of the fact that we're doing what we do on a regular basis and that is reset with suppliers and make sure that we've got the right sort of terms and buying prices for our customers and we'll keep doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it a lot of the work that you did in the first half, has that sort of come to an end and now you're going to start getting the benefit from that? Or is it still an ongoing process just working through those ranges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an ongoing process and I think, and that goes to the point it always has been and always will be. But we &#x2013; the benefit that we've got at the moment, and Tjeerd touched on it, is that we're able to do that now in a much more informed way through the Category Lab. And so for the first time, I think we've got a greater level of fact-based statistics to go to our suppliers and show them shelf profitability and those sort of things than we've ever had before. And that's good for both parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final one from me is just in terms of a lot of the opportunities you've talked about around sort of shrinkage and logistics...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...can you give us sort of any sort of quantification of how big those savings could be? Because I think a year or so ago when Quantum was talked about said there's potential for similar size savings as refresh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How big are those opportunities over the next sort of three years to five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll ask Tjeerd just to talk about shrinkage for one, that is part of the &#x2013; specific to supermarkets, but he'll give you some sense of the size of the prize in something like shrinkage. Tjeerd, do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if you make the international comparison, which I've alluded to in my presentation, there's a significant difference between what our shrink levels are and what's initially normal in a similar business. A shrink has many faces, so some of it you can fix short-term and we've done over the last six months good work and, again, we've already seen a double-digit basis point reduction, while we're confident that over the years to come &#x2013; I mean, years &#x2013; sustainable years we will see a continuation of a double-digit basis point reduction in shrink and because I think there's still lot to gain there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Grant, next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Grant Saligari, Credit Suisse. Just a couple of specific ones from me, if I could. First, on the Australian food and liquor business there are number of moving parts in the CODB line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, some?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are number of moving parts in the CODB line with Cellarmasters, and so could you give a more like-for-like type of figure in terms of the CODB outcome there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're right and embedded in that number is Cellarmasters. And Cellarmasters has a higher cost of doing business than our supermarkets run rate. So that's not a help to that line. That actually ensures that we have to work harder with our cost line. We've worked to ensure that productivity in our stores has been well managed. In other words, our major cost, which is our wage costs, has been well managed in our supermarket business. So we've also looked at, as Tom said before, how we manage things like refurbishments. That usually when you do a refurbishment, you get quite a deal of repairs and maintenance and those sort of things that go with it. In other words, the peripheral charges that go with the refurbishment.</p>
          <p>We've found smarter ways of spending that money in-store and that also goes partly to your question, <mark type="ph" /> David (1:12:23), about how we operate in the future. Being able to spend a significantly less amount of money on refurbishments for the same sales outcome is something that we're starting to understand. And that flows through to the cost line as well. So if I had to answer it simply, the Cellarmasters actually inflates the number, it doesn't deflate it. And I think the major progress that we've made is in the major cost, which is in the wage line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just second one from me, the New Zealand gross margin line was up very strongly. Was that a true like-for-like figure or were there some different allocations between the CODB or the other one-off factors there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was a like-for-like, and I think what New Zealand are benefiting from is on the back of lot of the initiatives that we've spoken about today, like global sourcing, like if our house brand penetration is low, New Zealand's is lower or historically has been lower. So there's substantial catch up in a way at the gross margin level that New Zealand has had available to it and Dave and his team have just started delivering on it. And I think the other thing is the more we reduce DSD to stores as well, the greater the benefit at a gross profit line as well. But that's been steady. That's not been <mark type="ph" /> one jump (1:13:42).</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, it's Michael Simotas from Deutsche Bank. I'd just like to try to get a better understanding of the Masters start-up costs. I mean, you've reiterated the previous guidance of $100 million, but noted it's dependent on the pace of these stores. Can you just comment on how much of the centralized infrastructure was in place in the first half? And if you roll stores out faster, is that a drag on the costs or a benefit to the costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we roll them out, if there's a substantial change in the rollout then that will bring with it cost. In other words, if we deliver a lot more stores more quickly, naturally there's going to be greater cost. But the guidance that we gave and the answer that I gave is exactly where we are, we're right on the money in terms of the stores that we were wanting to deliver and the costs associated with the start up, whether it be centralized infrastructure or the establishment of the stores and the training and all of that sorts of things that we referred to before, is right where it needs to be, in a phased manner. So we're standing here today saying again we're confident that we can land the number that we gave at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks. And then a broader question. Food deflation is obviously one of the big drivers of what's happening in the Australian supermarkets business. If we look at the Australian supermarket environment versus what we're seeing in New Zealand, it's a very different picture in terms of food inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have thought the global factors, including FX, are broadly similar between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand is also a very competitive market. So I'd just be interested to hear your views on what the difference in the dynamic is there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think on a couple of fronts it's different. And one of the really large drivers of deflation, Michael, as you'd know in Australia, is the Fresh area. And we've got produce deflation running at times in January at around 20%. So the number for New Zealand is hardly anything compared to that. In fact, I think during December it was around 5% or 6% deflation. So there's quite a difference and a really big contributor and none of their other Fresh departments are in deflation.</p>
          <p>So there's a completely separate supply chain and resource base for Fresh, which is a really big part of the business and one of the biggest influences on our business. There hasn't been a change in, I think, price investment in that market that there has been in this market either. It's been a more business as usual approach is the way that I'd describe it. So I think, the conditions are quite different between the two and the outlook for us is that the deflation here will continue through until the end of this financial year based on everything that we're looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Okay, Craig?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Grant. Craig Woolford from Citigroup. Just a question about store refurbishments. Can you talk through the effectiveness of the 49 store refurbishments in supermarkets? The supermarket comparable store sales were impacted by deflation, granted, but there's certainly just a soft result there. It seems like you want to cut back on the refurbishment dollar spend. Are we going to see a sales dip from these store refurbishments? Are they delivering a return on investment that's satisfactory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, no, there's not going to be a cut back in the refurbishments that we do, we're just going to be more efficient in &#x2013; and we are more efficient in how we do it. And that's not at the expense of sales outcomes. So the lighter touches that we're doing in what's substantially the 2015 format are providing the sort of lift that greater expenditure was, and that's quite often what happens with these sorts of exercises where the investment early on in a particular format, you learn quickly. And, certainly, Tjeerd has brought a whole new set of eyes to what we're doing in terms of store refurbishments, and his guidance and the initiatives that are in there just about to grow wings and spread to the rest of the network. So, I'm committed and Tjeerd is committed to us using our capital more sensibly, not any less effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, if I twisted it I guess another way, I mean, maybe you're spending too much on refurbishments before or perhaps the refurbishment uplift is not easy to gain across your portfolio of stores that are already in great shape, and generally aren't getting a significant uplift because the overall sales per square meter figures are broadly flat for your business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's got more to do, if you look at historical numbers, you can't really compare that to the environment that we're in at the moment, it's a completely different environment. We're really happy with what we're getting from the refurbishment money that we're spending, but you got to look at it differently on a couple of fronts, and one is the prevailing environment that we are in at the moment and where the sales momentum is versus where it's been previously. We don't have the same expectations because it's a different market, but we know clearly what we've got to get as a return on that money and we're getting it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. My other question was just around overseas. Two parts. Firstly, can you clarify the future of the consumer electronics joint venture in India? And then there was a small footnote in one of the slides about offshore ambitions generally as a measured approach, but where is your thinking on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It hasn't really changed, Craig, and not to have it up there would have people asking whether or not we don't have any more ambitions. So it was really just to say that it continues to be a watching brief for us on exactly the same parameters as we've communicated before. We're not going to risk the balance sheet. We're not going to bet the organization. We're looking at markets that we've had identified now for some time carefully there and &#x2013; but the alignment of availability, price and time for us needs to be exactly right before we go down that path. So I think that's something that we've got to look at. Sorry, the first part of your question?</p>

          <p>Hi, Grant. Shaun Cousins, JPMorgan. Just a question in regards to the deflation environment you face in food and liquor and in BIG W. Can you rely on the improvements in GM that you've made via shrinkage or mix or sourcing and the CODB reductions that you've been able to enjoy, can you continue to rely on those to see EBIT margins expand in the Australian food and liquor and holding BIG W if the deflation that we've got currently continues on during the fiscal 2013 and during the fiscal 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe so, because of the lot of the steps that you saw on the slides. If I just take the BIG W business as an example, global sourcing helps us manage our margin and provides Julie with a whole new avenue for products and, in some cases, categories. So that's one example. The movement at Hoxton Park and the refinement of the supply chain for BIG W brings with it margin benefits and cost reduction as well and there's been an upfront investment in that and we'll see the benefits once that gets up and running.</p>
          <p>So there are number of things that we can point to that say that they will help provide the offset to the deflation that's occurring in that business. And similarly with Tjeerd's business in the supermarket space. Much harder when Fresh Foods are running at that sort of level, but as I said at the sales announcement, that's a cyclical event and that isn't going to change substantially in this financial year, but we believe in the second half of the calendar year that should start to behave itself a little better than it has.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And given the recent ABS data for January, which I think showed food retail growing at around 1.5% and you guys have been underperforming calls on a comp basis and that business is not where you want particularly in terms of draw and you got fresh deflation. Are you guys confident that you can grow in the third quarter at a positive comp rate in Aussie food and liquor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're partway through it. And we pointed to two things at our sales announcement at the half. One was we expected deflation to increase which should ease and the other one was that we'd be cycling some big numbers that were courtesy of the flat events last year, which were a positive for us not a negative, so &#x2013; but we're part way through the quarter and the result of that quarter is still to be &#x2013; will be added up at the end of March. So we're seeing good performance in our supermarket division and we're confident of its ability to continue growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Hi, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Grant. David Cooke from Nomura. A couple of questions, if I have a look at the some of the underlying businesses, Danks. Could you give us a feel please as to how the underlying Danks business went, have you lost more than you'd expect in terms of retailers there. Have you gained more in terms of that you thought and also then having a look at Dick Smith, Australia and New Zealand. Can you give us a bit of a feel please as to how the stores that are being hit, i.e. excluding the 100 stores that you're going to close in over the next couple of years performed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Firstly to the Danks business, the Danks business is performing well, but there are two parts now to the Danks business. There was the original wholesale business that we brought and it's now grown a retail arm which the small format convenience, Home Improvement offers. We've been busily acquiring in that space and now have a growing portfolio of small retail formats, which the Danks business and Mark Burrowes who heads that business managers.</p>
          <p>For wholesale business we've been really pleased with David in terms of how it's held its numbers of customers. They will always be in a competitive environment like that, retailers that moved between franchisers from Mitre 10 to Danks, and so and so forth. But we are in a pretty neutral space, which is I think a good outcome for us and the acquisitions that we make and have made serve further to reinforce the strength of the wholesale business.</p>
          <p>That business is benefiting from the growing Masters business and the joint buying advantages that those two businesses now get and supplying and increasingly sharing things like supply chains and the like. And we're able to pass on those savings to the customers, which have really been material in the last quarter and I think that's growing the loyalty factor for the Danks customers. So we're confident about that and its performance and its contribution to the Home Improvement space.</p>
          <p>In relation to the Dick Smith business and the stores, I guess, you're referring to the reformatted stores, David, that we've referred to and the comp sales that we see in those, they've outperformed the balance of the portfolio of Dick Smith stores now for some time and that's continuing there in the new format they've got the right range and they've traded strongly over the last couple of years, Dave, and they continue to do so. So the positive comp numbers that you saw on the screen for the half come courtesy primarily of those well-performing stores. The reason we're looking at the tail is that they don't perform as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify the stores, the 100 stores that you're closing, they're the ones that have not been refurbished...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the main, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so just on Danks, can you give us or can you quantify what the growth profile was of the underlying Danks business. What's the sales growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final one for me, if I have a look at your inventory days, you say that excluding the indents, Cellarmasters, et cetera, et cetera, inventory days was down 0.3...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>0.1, was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fresh was down a half, I might read into that therefore the dry grocery was up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I missed the bit before dry groceries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You say that Fresh was down half a day, that you've got half a day of savings in the supply chain on Fresh and therefore does that mean that dry grocery was up? Is that why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one which is a really small or a smallish component of it. So our inventory in supermarkets generally was controlled well. So there is no blow out there that's offset by the half day that Tjeerd was talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The half day relates to time, so you've still got the same level of stock in the stores, it's just getting there quicker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question on the sales impact that you're seeing from the deep dive negotiation, I think, you said its over 20% of your sales base now, there is obviously profit impact, but I was more interested in the sales impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Phil, and what Tjeerd was describing is the work that we're undertaking right now and have undertaken over recent months. The benefit from those actions will flow over the course of the next half and the next year. What happens, with the Category Lab is you effectively redesign your shelf space and your category in a store. And what it leads to is a more efficient use of space. It leads to a more sensible mix of product and leads to an improved profit outcome on the shelf. It will take the next little while for that to flow through. We have a very clear idea obviously as a result of the Category Lab process as to what that outcome will be, but I'm not going to point to anything in today's results, because it's too early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then follow-on on the hardware losses, are there any costs that come through this fiscal year that are sort of one-off in the sense that they were built up and you capitalized them until you open the first door, they hit this year and you don't get them again next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the nature of the rollout is exactly that, we'll open 15 stores this year and probably anything up to 18 or 20 the next year. And it's just a continual rollout and we will bear the costs of that in this year and next year and the year after. We said and have said it will take years, three to four for this venture to start to breakeven and as I've said a couple of times, we're on track and so that remains our focus and our expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, just a question on liquor and appreciate <mark type="ph" /> Dave's (1:29:38) in there. Strong performance from the liquor division but the share in that business is now almost equal to where it is in supermarkets. Could you just provide some color on I guess where you think that will get to longer term, whether it's ahead of supermarkets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our focus is on ensuring that we cover as many shopping occasions for the customers as we can and the market share will be the outcome of that. We're looking to grow our business and we're looking to do that by providing more opportunities for our customers to get the best offers. And I hold liquor up as our best example at multi-option shopping and that was more to come. So we've got well established destination format. We've got well established convenience bricks and mortar formats.</p>
          <p>We're completing the integration of our direct and online business courtesy of Cellarmasters. We're growing our online business courtesy of Dan Murphy's. And that's all above line. Then you get the margin benefits that come from being a truly vertically integrated business. So it's one of the most mature models of what we're heading to in other parts of our business. So I think it's an outcome of us winning with the customer. It's not something that we've got written down on the page as an ambition for market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and just another one on private label liquor, you're saying that it's going to double over the next few years. Does that all come from one or should we look at it as beer and spirit as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a well established label program in wine and that was probably the entry point for us in the liquor space. But increasingly spirits have been added to that and most recently beer in all forms and the fastest growing categories in the liquor areas, as Tony will attest, the ciders and the ginger beer or the alcoholic ginger beers and the like and we're in there early with our own offering, which I think is part and parcel of again why the liquor business has got momentum.</p>
          <p>It's not waited until categories become mature and then enter. It's in there early with its own brand and if I could point to low carb beers as an example of that, the Platinum Blonde product that we launch now, two years ago, three years ago, was at the beginning of that growth. So it's across all categories and it's in categories that make sense and categories that we can add value to and choice to for our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, I was wondering if it was possible to get a bit more color on the gross margin expansion in the food and liquor side of the Australian food and liquor business. Obviously you did three basis points, including petrol, are you able to give a bit more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of things. Tjeerd touched on one really important one in fact, Tjeerd might get to answer this one, but certainly shrinkage was an important part of that and private label being another part, did you want expand on our margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; what I already alluded to, but it's also because we are increasing our share of global sourcing, so working together with BIG W team and sourcing from Hong Kong, that's significantly more that we've done before. And we've got strong ambitions to grow a direct sourcing together with BIG W in the near future. So it's also growing our own brand share and not our home brand share, but our own brand share, especially Select and Macro which have significant higher margin than the average of the store and I think those three combined gave us a good margin uplift in the half an we're looking forward to see more improvements coming through, but also investing in value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it also goes partway to the question that was asked a moment ago, in relation to Category Lab, Tjeerd, and that is all of those benefits have got to blow through to margin over the coming years that investment in the Category Lab will show itself in margin expansion and top line expansion over the coming years. So there are certainly the suite of things that Tjeerd has spoken about and some of the investments that we're making at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and perhaps one for Tom, the property sale which was about $73 million, did that contribute to EBIT at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Property sales, did any of it flow through to EBIT or how much through to EBIT?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, very small. We normally try and just minimize the lease cost on all our property sales, so we don't really try and get a development profit out of it.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I've got a question on supermarkets and the new marketing campaign for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about how significant the program that might be and also whether it will have a noticeable impact on the cost of doing business in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is no comment, because we don't want to preempt what's going to be delivered. We spoke about the need for us to lift our game in this space and we're doing that. We're doing it technically at the moment, but in a more profound way will come courtesy of the new agency and resources that Tjeerd is arming himself with. He advised you that he is very close to making his decision in relation to the agency and I know that to be the case and he's being very generous in sharing with you when that program is going to be launched. I'm not going to be any more generous and let you know what it is. But in terms of its cost, we don't expect there to be a material impact on our cost base. These are things that we manage within our, in this case advertising spend and we'll be disciplined enough to make sure that that's the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, and just a question on the cost of doing business in New Zealand. Is the cost increase from the new DC a one-off duplication cost for the transition of DC or is this going to be an ongoing cost that we'll see in the second half as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you see an increased cost and an increased margin opportunity courtesy of the changes that Dave has made particular in New Zealand, so part of &#x2013; and it's ongoing and it's steady and it has been for some time. So you've got to cover the cost of the new shed, but they are more than offset by the improvement as you get in margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew McLennan with CBA. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I've got a quick question for Tom in relation to the property CapEx. You continue to spend a huge amount of money in the property side, I understand it's going to dilute returns, but could you just explain what kind of impact its having on margins within the supermarkets business for the rental cost your saving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it will have an impact over time, however we have an interest cost versus a lease cost, so one is going to offset the other. So when you do a property development, you in theory incur or, well, practically incur the interest cost earlier and then obviously you don't have the lease cost, but you do still have the interest cost until you sell it and lease it back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that definitely has been captured in the supermarket division rather than elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we charge &#x2013; in the corporate center we charge &#x2013; when a supermarket we own starts trading, we charge the supermarket business a rent which is captured in the offsetting the corporate center. So the supermarket food and liquor result you are seeing is effectively has a rental charge in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Small follow-up question's on the outlook medium term. I think at your strategy day, you mentioned this year's tough and shouldn't expect it to get much better in a profit growth sense in fiscal 2013. Have you seen any change to that since the strategy day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our reconfirmation today of our outlook at that stage is that we're seeing things in a similar sort of ways as we saw at that stage, Phil. Beyond that, we wouldn't make a comment on, so we're not providing guidance on that today. We're reaffirming our guidance for this financial year today.</p>
