        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Grupo M&#xE9;xico's second quarter earnings conference call. I am joined in this conference by Octavio Ornelas, CFO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano; Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations; and other executives of the Company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the many issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I will comment on our mining division's most relevant results, to passing the call to Octavio, who will explain the financial results of the transportation division.</p>
          <p>Now, I will finally comment about the proposal to effect an all-start business combination of Southern Copper and Asarco on the common ownership. During the second quarter, the markets deteriorated significantly due to sluggish growth recovery, the perspective of China's acceleration and Europe persisting in their crisis.</p>
          <p>Consequently during the second quarter, we experienced price weaknesses across basic metal sector, and increased volatility. However during the second quarter of 2010, the U.S. and European copper demand for refined copper increased 22% and 4% respectively, when compared to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, China continued with solid buying leading to a continued drawdown in inventories, low treatment charges and a positive arbitrage between LME and Shanghai. This involvement to a controversial tight supply demand balance and robust fundamentals for copper.</p>
          <p>The LME's average copper price for the second quarter was $3.19 per pound, 51% higher and the $2.11 for the same quarter in 2009, although 3% lower than the first quarter of this year. In the last couple of days, we have seen a quick jump in copper prices to levels over $3.25 per pound, triggered by the return of risk appetite as copper resource in general have been positive.</p>
          <p>We maintain our bullish perspective on copper and anticipate a return being more fundamentally based tight performance in the second half of the year, leading the way to a supply restrictive environment in the mid-terms. With respect to molybdenum, which as you know is our main byproduct and this quarter represented around 10% of our mining division sales.</p>
          <p>Prices averaged $16.10 per pound, that is 77% above its average price for the second quarter 2009, and 2% higher than the first quarter of this year. We see modest consumption coming back to where it was before the economic crisis. In addition to this, we expect to see a return to a deficit environment as the recovery of the energy, transportation and infrastructure sectors accelerates.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the Grupo Mexico financial highlights, we are happy to report that in the second quarter 2010, our total consolidated revenue was 1.9 billion, an increase of 76% year-over-year. Sales for the first half were nearly 3.8 billion, an increase of 99% year-over-year. This increase is mainly attributable to higher average metal prices and higher copper production volumes from Asarco and a significant increase of 33% in the revenue generated by our transportation division as the economic activity improves in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the second quarter was 984 million, an increase of 66% on a year-over-year basis, and 1% lower than the first quarter 2009. The second quarter cost increase of 390 million is mainly explained by higher prices in several of our key inputs and the incorporation of Asarco, which accounted for 60% of this increase.</p>
          <p>Even as copper prices improve, the company will continue its effort to reduce costs, improve productivity, and maintain consumption and expand discipline, with the objective of strengthening our position as one of the world's leading cost producers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the second quarter was 886 million, with an EBITDA margin of 47%. This figure represents a significant improvement of 53% year-over-year. EBITDA in the first half was 1.8 billion, an increase of 147% year-over-year, out of which 357 came from Asarco.</p>
          <p>Net income in the second quarter was 310 million, an increase of 30% year-over-year. For the first half, it reflected a significant improvement of 155%, compared to the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to CapEx, in the first half of 2010, it amounted to 206 million, out of which 175 was spent in the mining division and the difference in the transportation and infrastructure division. The capital has been lower than expected because of a temporary suspension on the construction of the Tia Maria leaching plant in Peru.</p>
          <p>In the transportation division, investments were made for the continued modifications and replacement of various tracks and improved operating safety.</p>
          <p>As previously we announced, now that we have recovered <mark type="inaudible" />, the Board of Directors approved 3.8 billion CapEx program for the next five years in the state of Sonora. The program considered the following projects. A 2.1 billion investment to expand Cananea final production from 180,000 tons to 450,000 tons of copper per year. That is an increase of 270,000 tons or 150%.</p>
          <p>The major components of the Cananea CapEx are a new concentrator, with an estimated annual production of 188,000 tons and additional leasing plants with a copper capacity of 82,000 tons per year.</p>
          <p>The plant also includes a molybdenum circuit, with an estimated annual capacity of 2,000 tons. As you may recall, we do not recover molybdenum in the past in Cananea.</p>
          <p>The total consolidated debt at June 30 was 4 billion. With a cash balance of 2.6 billion, business falls in a net debt of 1.4 billion. The company maintains a comfortable long-term debt amortization schedule and ample financial flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>As you might recall, Americas mining secured a syndicated loan of 1.5 billion last December. This was used for the reorganization of Asarco. During the first half 2010, the company prepaid 650 million from this loan, with the remaining balance of approximately 860 million. In addition, Asarco fully prepaid its 280 million promissory note that it owed to asbestos creditors. Before June 30, Asarco have no debt outstanding.</p>
          <p>Our current cash position plus our cash generation capability will support operational need and CapEx expenditures, still looking room to flow additional value generation opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on May 17, we paid the quarterly dividends of $0.17 peso per share outstanding, that's equivalent to $104 million. For the second quarter 2010, the company's Board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.17 peso as well, which will be paid in cash on September 10 and represents a disbursement of a little bit south of $100 million, little bit north, 104 exactly.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to an overview of Asarco financial highlights. This is our second full quarter with Asarco consolidating into Grupo M&#xE9;xico. During the first half, Asarco sales were 813 million, a significant increase of 66% year-over-year. Cost of sales was 526 million, up 37% from the same period 2009. EBITDA was 357 million with an EBITDA margin of 44%. And net income was 107 million, that compares to 37 million loss for the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of production, in the second quarter, Asarco produced 53,000 tons of copper, an increase of 11% from the previous year. This increase is due primarily to better ore grades of the Mission mine and stronger recovery of Ray. Asarco continue to reduce its cash cost, lowering it from $1.57 per pound of copper, this includes our products, in the second quarter of 2009 to $1.16 in this quarter. This improvement is a result of greater productivity and operating efficiency in addition to better product prices.</p>
          <p>CapEx in the first half of the year amounted only to 7 million. As previously announced, exploration and drilling began in the company's mine operations during the second quarter. The initial results confirmed our expectation that this program will increases our reserves and lead their way to increase mine production through the modernization of the company's mines and metallurgical plants.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper, and will try to keep this brief as Southern Copper had its conference call earlier today. In the second quarter, Southern Copper's net sales were somewhat south of $1.2 billion, cost of sales worth 122 million, EBITDA was 612 million with an EBITDA margin of 52%, and net income was 313 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter 2010, Southern Copper mine production of copper was down 4.8% year-over-year. It was mainly due to expected and temporary lower ore grade at some of our mines. However, this was mitigated by higher production of other byproducts. Molybdenum reached a record production of 5,500 tons in this quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to cash cost after byproducts, for this quarter, it was $0.265 per pound and this cost &#x2013; I mean, this cash cost was $0.36 lower than the $0.396 cents per pound of cash closed off the second quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>With this, I will pass on the call to Octavio Ornelas, who'll discuss the main financial highlights of the transportation division. Octavio, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel. Good afternoon, everyone. I will now turn to the second quarter results of the Transportation division represented. Private subsidiary Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico, ITM, as you may know, the principal subsidiaries of ITM are Ferromex and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>First, I will go with Ferromex. The load volumes transported during the second quarter of this year measure in net tons/kilometer was 11.9 billion, compared to 10.2 billion in 2009, an annual increase of 16%. Cargo in the first half of this year measured in net tons/kilometer accumulated 22.4 billion, an annual increase of 19% and reached a record high to the number of railcars transported in net tons/kilometers. In terms of railcars, Ferromex transported 22% more cars than in the first half of last year. The intermodel show a strong recovery during the first half. So the number of containers moved was 41% above those of the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>In line with our current performance for the whole year of 2010, we're estimating Ferromex load volumes measuring net tons/kilometers to be 47 billion tons/kilometer representing an annual increase of 20%. Also we estimate that through a combination of tariff increases and a mixture of traffics revenue we increased in the year by an annual figure of around 23, 24%.</p>
          <p>Net sales for the second quarter was 309 million, a significant annual increase of 33% and 70% higher than the first quarter of this year. Net sales in the first half reached 573 million, a 33% annual increase due to higher load volumes. The operating cost in Ferromex for the second quarter was 195 million, an annual increase of 26%. This increase is mainly attributable to increased freight volume, a 10% increase in peso price of diesel, salary increases and exchange rate effects, all of which were partially mitigated by better performance from powered locomotives.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the second quarter of this year was nearly 105 million, a significant annual increase of 49% with an EBITDA margin of 34%. EBITDA in the first half reached 197 million, a 56 annual increase and was equivalent to 34% of net sales. Net income during the second quarter of this year reached 50 million, an increase of 24% with respect to 2009 and 22% higher than the first quarter of this year. Net income in the first half reached 91 million, a 52 year-to-year increase.</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding tax and expenditure of Ferromex. In the first half of this year, they amounted to nearly U.S. $32 million, mostly allocated to improving infrastructure throughout routes, to modernize operating systems for greater safety and to improve commercial systems. Ferromex has already committed 74 million of its CapEx program of this year that will be exercised during the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>For the whole year, Ferromex expects to invest $134 million, mainly on infrastructure, renewal and the development of our railyard at  <mark type="inaudible" /> while we left, which will support higher international car transportation at the Piedras Negras border crossing.</p>
          <p>Finally, on capital expenditure. I should make sure that in the last Board meeting it was approved the acquisition of additional 44 locomotives, the construction of 17 new sightings and the expansion of all other eight already in place in order to increase a cargo capacity of Ferromex for next year. All these projects imply capital outlay of $170 million, which will be executed during the first four months of next year.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss the results of Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate with ITM. Ferrosur total revenue in the second quarter were 71 million, a year-to-year increase of 25%. Net sales in the first half reached 134 million, an annual increase of 25%. Load volumes transported during the second quarter measured in net tons/kilometer were 1.8 billion, compared to 1.7, an increase of 4% over the last year and 7% higher than the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur increased 300 percentage net tons/kilometer at 166%, it's loaded cars for the energy segment within Pemex, given fuel oil traffic as well as by 45 percentage of net tons/kilometers and 78% loaded cars for the metal segment.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the second quarter of this year was 18 million, an annual increase of 20% with an EBITDA margin of 26%. Net income during the second quarter was nearly 8 million, an increase of 16% with respect to last year and 65% higher than the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure in the first half amounted nearly 13 million with Ferrosur to invest 24 million in this year, mainly on infrastructure renewal. And the last one I should mention, should be the ruling that we have on May 12 by the Federal Court of Justice on tax and administrative matter, which result that <mark type="inaudible" /> should consider as approved the acquisition of Ferrosur by Infraestructura by Transportes M&#xE9;xico, subsidiary of Grupo M&#xE9;xico. Their notification to the parties is expected to be released in the next few days.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Octavio. Thank you all. Just to conclude, I would like to mention that we have announced that we submitted a proposal for the Corporate Board of Directors for an all-start combination of Southern Copper and Americas mining in which opening stockholders of Southern Copper would receive common stock of AMC, that is American Mining, and the same for the Southern Copper shares. But the ownership of AMC, Southern Copper public stockholders will have an ownership interest in the business of both, Southern Copper and Asarco.</p>
          <p>And we firmly believe that the proposed combination would solidify Southern Copper's position as one of the leading copper companies in the world and enhance the scale of operations. The transaction would result in combined operations that will provide the all common Southern Copper stockholders the opportunity to benefit from additional estimated reserves of 8.3 million metric tons, additional production of approximately 200,000 metric tons per year, expanded geographic production footprint, geographic diversification and the associated production possibility.</p>
          <p>Combining Southern Copper and Asarco on the common ownership would unlock synergies, including the improved recovery and capacity utilization, cost reductions and operations, transportation and overhead, and CapEx savings. The combination will be affected through a merger between Southern Copper and <mark type="inaudible" />, the only subsidiary of AMC. As a result of the merger, Southern Copper public stockholders would receive 1.237 shares of AMC for each shareholder &#x2013; for each Southern Copper share they own, I apologize, resulting in an aggregate ownership by public stockholders of approximately 16.6% of AMC in the aggregate.</p>
          <p>With that, we conclude the &#x2013; our presentation and we'd like to open the floor for questions-and-answers.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. My first question is related to the consolidation of Ferrosur. So, I think that Octavio mentioned that the notifications to the parties should be released over the next few days. Can you just give us like &#x2013; an idea what would be the next steps after you receive these notifications until you finally can &#x2013; like can consolidate Ferrosur and Ferromex? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Felipe. Let me pass that on to Octavio, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Felipe, what's &#x2013; we're expecting that notification to the parties of this ruling will be by the end of August, okay. Now, how long is going to take these ruling to be &#x2013; a ruling depends upon how Coseco reacts. If Coseco makes appeals that ruling, then I think that we will spend another six to nine months in order to have a firm sentence.</p>
          <p>So we will have that consolidation ready by the end of the first quarter of next year. It's on time in the second quarter of next year, something in the next quarter of this year. If Coseco were not to appeal, then we will be &#x2013; I mean, we'll be ready to make that consolidation or if not the consolidation at least the concentration will be a firm sentence.</p>
          <p>So that's the idea, okay. If they appeal, they are going to go another six months of fighting with Coseco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And sort of how we speak, if they don't appeal when do you expect the consolidation to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If they don't appeal, well we don't know we will make the consolidation, but it's true that we will make the concentration, we got already &#x2013; make all the legal things that proceed, that hasn't proceed right now, for example that comes in consolidation, that doesn't proceed because of this fact. And we would begin to do that. There we need to know what to do first, we will be ready to make an IPO in the future. And we will need to decide we make the consolidation first of both companies or we may be ideal with both companies separate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And my second question is related to your cash position. So can you just tell us what you have on the &#x2013; on your cash position right now, because there were some &#x2013; you made a notification that you had some shares of GAAP, so I just wanted to know what's your cash position right now? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're not referring <mark type="inaudible" />. I mean, I guess what we have is treasury is very safe with investments, we have some debt securities. And not only &#x2013; the only disclosure &#x2013; relevant security that we currently hold in our balance sheet is the share that you are referring to Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico, which is &#x2013; that's why we filed this with the SEC or with the Mexican authorities. So nothing, no other security that we need to disclose at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Good afternoon. Just wanted to talk a little bit about Asarco, which has posted good results. Can you share with us if you have an estimate of, revised estimate of volumes for DGNX and any comments on EBITDA generated by the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Carlos. Thank you. I mean, yes, I mean, we're very happy with the resource of Asarco. As you know, this has to do a lot with the lowering cash costs effort that we put in there. It's only been &#x2013; two quarters since we are consolidating in the third quarter, we have in two full quarters. As you know, we closed the reorganization on December 9 of 2009. And I guess, I'm going to give you the run rate that approximately guidance will be given, we've talked about a little bit north of 200,000 tons and currently the run rate is a little bit over that.</p>
          <p>So, that's what we expect. I mean, we're doing a lot of exploration, we've retained experts to assess and audit our reserves and that's what we do. I mean, I guess going forward, we've said that that's what Asarco at this point generates, around 200,000 tons per year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And in terms of EBITDA?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in terms of EBITDA, well, it depends on the price of course. We've talked about 700 roughly in the past. I mean, that's still the guidance that we have. I mean, we're working as I said with geologist and with expert firms to try to maximize the mine plant, and to improve it and we're looking towards that. And I guess at this point, that's what we can disclose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you. And if you &#x2013; and then just talking about the transportation division. If everything goes as planned and the competition commission does not appeal, when would you be in a position to do an IPO? And what would you take into consideration to decide if you do it with the two companies consolidate &#x2013; on a consolidated basis or the two companies separate?</p>

          <p>Okay. Well, my guess is that we will begin to work once we know we have a firm sentence, excuse me, we will begin to work on that one.</p>
          <p>We need to see how the market is evolving by that time in order to see a consolidation of Ferromex and Ferrosur entails a negotiation with Union Pacific. I mean, it's not as easy as it seems, Union Pacific owns 26% of Ferromex or Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano Ferromex. So we need to make a negotiation if we were to make the consolidation. So we need to see how the markets are evolving at that moment and to see if we proceed to make the merger or we first make the IPO and then proceed to make the merger and proceed with those discussions. So it's something that we still have not decided.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my call. I was just wondering on CapEx. It's my understanding that you are adding the, I mean you approved the 2.8 billion three-year plan CapEx and then you have a five-year for the Sonora and Cananea expansion. So, if I'm doing my math right, that would be &#x2013; that would add up around 1.7 billion per year on the next three years on CapEx. And then, you will have the remaining less than a billion for the next two years. I was wondering if you could just be more specific as of when would you be expecting to be concentrating like more CapEx, like if you could divide it into the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure Karla, thank you. I mean, first of all it's important to note, I mean this is a five-year plan. And that, but we're really pushing the gas on in terms of Cananea that's mainly your area of concern, has to do with mainly three investments. One is, what we call a <mark type="inaudible" /> which is a crushing and conveying system that feeds the leaching plants. And the two, is the SFCW or leaching plant themselves. We had already ordered these two and had worked on even before the labor stoppages. So we have expanded part of it already and we're pushing the gas on there. So we're going to spend, I mean really this year, it's a $140 million to restore the facility that they are estimated budget that we currently have.</p>
          <p>We're going to expand the <mark type="inaudible" /> and the SFCW plants that I am referring to. So that really give you, I mean, complementing what we had for the Tia Maria project which is was very standstill, I mean, being put on hold just because of the environmental impact study of that water supply issues that today where commented on, I mean, so the copper share. So that's really what we have to focus on for this year. If you want to look at the next year, I mean, we talked about $1.1 billion of investment for 2011, $1 billion for 2012, that's pretty much the next, I mean, 2.5 years that we're going to spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so &#x2013; but, okay. Then just &#x2013; this year that would be around the same figure? It's around a billion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had $250 million CapEx project, yes. And to that, we could add the Cananea investment that I just mentioned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah. And just a question on the transport division. The 44 locomotives that you're planning on buying, it's &#x2013; that represents an increase of how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, we have an outstanding number of locomotives, around 580. So let's say, it's 44 &#x2013; it's a 7.5% decrease.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I would like to understand the logic of why now doing the combination of assets of Asarco on Southern Copper? Why not wait until its &#x2013; you guys have more, a better view of the assets and spent a little bit more time with these asset that you did not control for so many years. So, what's the logic behind? Obviously, I'd love to know how did you determine the valuation of Asarco? And last but not least, if you can comment also a little bit on your holding on GAAP, because we were quite surprised to see that you were holding a stake of over 10% for several months. So, if you can elaborate on that, I will appreciate it? Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Victoria. Thank you for your questions, very interesting all of them. Let me just start one by one. Well, I mean, first of all, I mean, we believe that the combination, it makes a lot of sense in terms of strategic rationale. I mean, you don't loss synergies. It provides even to the pro forma company a stronger balance sheet and, I mean, this is &#x2013; this is really the right timing for us. We've had the company for two quarters already. As you know, we own the company since we acquired Asarco in 1999 and we filed for chapter 11 into 2005.</p>
          <p>So we really know the assets, and they provide a lot of synergy between them. So, we &#x2013; I mean, as a group, it makes sense to try to do this operation at this point. We are very positive as I mentioned because of the economic circumstances of the copper prices. And this is really common to all, I mean, let me get back to the valuation, which might be confusion out there. Let me &#x2013; I'm going to try to walk you through because I think there has been confusion in the market and I like to clarify that. I'm going to take this opportunity.</p>
          <p>So let's start with approximately $5.9 billion of equity value for a cycle, that's what we've disclosed in our proposal to the Board. If we add to that, the market value of 80% of Southern Copper that AMC currently owns, and that is based on simple average share price of Southern Copper for the last 30 trading days. That stake is valued approximately 20 billion. Then we can deduct the AMC facility. As you might recall, we entered into a $1.5 billion facility, which we have prepaid and now we only have around $860 million outstanding. This facility that is outstanding is in pesos, I'm just giving you the $860 million number just to make things easier. We can add to that the cash that figured AMC.</p>
          <p>Latest filing that was approximately 100 million. So far Victoria, we have $5.95 billion of equity value of Asarco, 20 billion for the 80% of Southern Copper plus a net debt, that's approximately $25.2 billion AMC equity value. In our proposal, we are basing this on a similar standing share capital of AMC of 1,060 million shares, so that give you an implied price per share of Americas Mining common stock of approximately $23.75.</p>
          <p>Dividing the Southern Copper share price again the 30-day trading average by the implied price per share of Americas Mining common stock leads to the proposed exchange ratio of 1.237, AMC shares, they're each share of Southern Copper common stock. Now using the proposed exchange ratio and multiplying that with the number of Southern Copper's shares held by public shareholders, and that is 800 million shares, hence 20%, that equals 170 million shares yields approximately 210 million new AMC shares to be issued.</p>
          <p>If we divide the 210 million newly issued AMC shares by the sum of 1,060 million existing AMC shares plus the 210 newly issued shares, results in the ownership of 16.6% stated in our proposal letter. So that is how you end up with the numbers that we filed in our proposal and that is really the breakdown, I don't know if that was -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is very helpful, but I was more wondering how do you arrive to the 5.9 billion-ish value of Asarco?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
