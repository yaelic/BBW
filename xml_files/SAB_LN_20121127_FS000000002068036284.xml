          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the SABMiller 2013 First Half Results Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to SABMiller. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. Good morning in the U.S. to everyone. I am Gary Leibowitz, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at SABMiller in London. Welcome to our first half results presentation for the six months ended September 30, 2012.</p>
          <p>With me today as usual is Jamie Wilson, our CFO, who will also participate and lead in the Q&amp;A later in the webcast.</p>
          <p>As usual, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which reflect the best current judgment of management including risks and uncertainties. The company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So, let's kick off. This half year SABMiller's proven approach to delivering organic revenue and profit growth was again effective. Strength in brand portfolios and our development of local beer markets on the grounds drove broad-based revenue and profit growth.</p>
          <p>Underlying volumes, pricing and mix are all trending positively and contributing to margins offsetting global raw material cost increases and some local marketing currency pressures. The breadth of our local portfolios, with pricing, packaging and style developed to suit each market, is allowing us to create volume growth and providing us with effective revenue management levers.</p>
          <p>Although there has been a slowing of growth in most emerging markets towards the end of the first half, notably in LatAm and China, we believe their economic fundamentals remain promising over the longer-term. We're confident that those markets will continue to deliver a disproportionate share of global growth even as they become still larger in scale. The IMF forecasts that these markets will overtake the developed economies in size in 2013 as you can see in the graph. And in this context, our superior position in the emerging markets will continue to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>Our position created not merely from exposure, but rather developed deeply in local marketplaces, up and down the value chain, from farmers through to distribution, retail and consumers, and, of course, with constant exposure and relationships with local government.</p>
          <p>We have continued to strengthen and update our local flagship brands in the core mainstream and local premium segments around the world. From Tyskie to Castle and from Aguila to Mosi and Snow, these brands continue to drive performance and are in strong health.</p>
          <p>Local premium and craft beers, as you're aware, are undergoing a renaissance in many markets. We've historically created and led in local premium and emerging markets and we're now doing more to develop this across the world. This is being complemented by product innovation across a wide range of styles and prices and countries.</p>
          <p>From craft and ciders in the U.S. and Europe to recipes with different flavors and raw material basis in Africa, we've accelerated innovation up and down the price ladder and this will continue drawing consumers into the beer category on the basis of both appeal and in some cases greater affordability.</p>
          <p>Now turning to some regional highlights; starting in LatAm, where we have intensified our execution in trade in the past year. This and our broader brand and package portfolios have driven further gains in our share of alcohol. In this vein, in Colombia earlier this year, we began rolling out larger 750 milliliter jumbo bottles designed to create a sharing culture and improve affordability in the on-premise, while also supporting consumption in the home.</p>
          <p>Our profit and margin growth in LatAm remained strong. Lager volume growth of 4% in the half year was complemented by underlying price mix up 4% and EBITA growth of 14%. Recently, the economic backdrop has become less favorable though with headwinds in some markets resulting in slower growth.</p>
          <p>Colombia, in particular, which had demonstrated good GDP growth and low inflation has cooled somewhat. A strong currency and weak export markets have dampened manufacturing activity, and, in turn, employment and consumption growth.</p>
          <p>Despite this, the medium-term outlook for Colombia remains strong. It is forecast by the EIU to remain one of the region's most attractive investment locations over the next five years with forecast GDP growth above the rest of Latin America. And our outlook for our other LatAm markets is similarly optimistic.</p>
          <p>Turning to Europe, the timing of an economic recovery remains uncertain with varied country effects. In Central and East Europe though, per capita consumption is reaching or even surpassing previous all-time highs in beer. Our own organic volume growth was 9% in the period, with share gains across nearly all our markets.</p>
          <p>We've increased support behind our core flagship brands, which maintain leading market share positions, for example for Tyskie in Poland shown here in the illustrations, but much higher input costs, increased marketing, selected price reductions and negative mix drove Europe EBITA down 5% on an organic constant currency basis. The negative mix results from established structural trends in the region in favor of non-returnable packaging and modern chain and discount channels. Both these changes are dilutive to industry margins.</p>
          <p>In this environment, our re-based businesses are leveraging their brand equities and building commercial capabilities suited to the changing times. Our focus is on regaining profit growth with increasingly sophisticated revenue and category management tools and processes.</p>
          <p>We've launched numerous premium price innovations across our markets using our consumer insights into demand trends, particularly among younger adults, such as new flavors of Redd's in Poland and Frisco in the Czech Republic, low-alcohol Radlers, which has been launched in Poland and Czech, of which an example is Gambrinus shown here in the lower right-hand corner of the picture, Hungary and in Slovak Republic as well.</p>
          <p>The alliance with Efes contributed positively to SABMiller's EBITA growth in Europe, but competitive dynamics in Turkey and the integration in Russia have had an adverse effect on lager volumes in this period, which were down 5% for the half year on a pro forma basis. Efes soft drink operations, however, through CCI, had a very strong half with volumes up 9% on a pro forma basis and margins also rising.</p>
          <p>Turning to North America, in the U.S., MillerCoors' sales to retailers were down 2% on a trading day adjusted basis as previously reported, offset by revenue per hectoliter growth of 4% due to firm pricing and strong mix. These, combined with continuing cost savings, drove EBITA up 6% in the period with North America margins up 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>Advertising and trade activation of MillerCoors Premium Lights is intensifying and will continue to do so for the balance of the year. Coors Light is on its way to eight years of consecutive growth with higher volume and segment share. The brand positioning, Rocky Mountain cold refreshment continues to resonate well with consumers.</p>
          <p>Our focus on Miller Lite continues. MillerCoors is increasing support behind, 'it's Miller Time' with strong investment in sports and entertainment partnerships, special football packaging, NASCAR activation and new programming for Thanksgiving that occurred in the run-up to last week's holiday.</p>
          <p>Packaging upgrades including the punch top can and new tap handles are having a positive effect. And the repositioning of Miller64 has also generated an improved trend with a campaign linked to New Year's resolutions coming up of health, wellness and keeping active.</p>
          <p>Tenth and Blake continues to outperform the growth of the craft segment, with volumes up in double-digits for the first half of the financial year. Leinie's Summer Shandy has been the major driver, delivering 32% growth for the Leinie's franchise in the period, and leading to a decision to implement a year-round rotation of Shandy's under the Leinie's name starting with Lemon Berry Shandy, which is doing very well, as we speak.</p>
          <p>The Blue Moon franchise also continues to drive growth, continuing this autumn with its Pumpkin Ale and with three innovations set to launch in 2013, tapping into the wide range of craft beer drinkers from basic exploration to deeper experimentation.</p>
          <p>Other craft initiatives, such as Batch 19 and Henry Weinhard's are expanding after strong consumer feedback. Third Shift is set to launch early in 2013 with Redd's Apple Ale to be rolled out nationally also by the first quarter of the New Year.</p>
          <p>Moving to Africa, despite economic and excise tax headwinds in some markets, our operations on the continent continues to generate robust organic lager volume and underlying EBITA growth of 6% and 19% respectively.</p>
          <p>Our trade execution and full portfolio focus enable us to drive volume growth ahead of GDP across most markets. We've significantly increased our outlet reach and distribution, capitalizing on our expanded brewery footprint.</p>
          <p>Our integrated trade service packages create improved drinking environments and cold beer availability as you can see on the bar chart in the slide in the upper right hand corner, helping beer category growth.</p>
          <p>Our product and package innovations are stretching the price ladders, attracting new consumers into the category and generating trade-up within the category. The world's first lager made from cassava was launched in Mozambique and has been received enthusiastically. You can see it towards the bottom of the slide, known as Impala.</p>
          <p>Castle Lite is a resounding success in the premium segments, in markets in which it's been launched, filling a demand for aspirational premium brands into which middle-class consumers trade up on special occasions.</p>
          <p>And Castel, our associate, also delivered good volume growth in beer and soft drinks. The integration of our businesses in Angola is delivering synergies ahead of expectations, making a material contribution to Africa's EBITA margins.</p>
          <p>Our Asia Pacific region has reported mixed performance. Growth across consumer categories in China has moderated. CR Snow grew volumes by 4% on an organic basis, which was ahead of the industry with share increases led by the Snow brand. Beer prices continue to increase, albeit more slowly in an environment of wage and cost inflation. CR Snow continues to penetrate premium outlets with its portfolio of Snow premium variants, notably Snow Draft, contributing to the 11% organic constant currency revenue growth for the regions in the half year.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our Indian business performed very well, reporting volume growth of 23% and strong EBITA growth. Our differentiated state by state strategy continues to succeed and recent portfolio expansions include Indus Pride, shown here on the bottom right, creating a new segment of lagers with local flavor profiles, extensions to Foster's brand and Royal Challenge and Miller High Life also in the premium segments into major cities in India. Our selective investment model should continue to drive both volume and profit here.</p>
          <p>In Australia, the adverse trends within the beer and alcohol industry continue on the top line, exacerbated at present by low consumer confidence. CUB's volume performance was worse than that of the industry before the start of our program of management actions to improve marketing and sales. This was partly covered by improved pricing discipline and a deliberate focus on revenue management. The integration plan is on track and we've recently announced the restoration of the flagship Victoria Bitter brand, back to its full flavor, full strength position and this has been extremely well received with some promising early signs.</p>
          <p>And lastly in South Africa, our increased premium segment share is striking as shown on the right on the slide. Aggregate lager volumes grew despite challenging economic conditions, including electricity and fuel price hikes. And our intensified sales efforts and combination of direct and indirect distribution continued to bear fruit in the form of stronger retail relationships, stronger competitive positioning, and further improved beer market share.</p>
          <p>In soft drinks, 8% growth for the half has been driven by our retail service extension drive particularly in townships. Looking further ahead, we expect this trend to continue strongly. Demographic segment comparisons versus Mexico, shown in the lower right corner here, provide an interesting perspective on the potential for further growth. Both beer and soft drinks businesses continue to extract scale and efficiency benefits, which are driving EBITA margins up significantly as you can see in the other right corner of the slide.</p>
          <p>Lastly, above the level of our regional operations, we're leveraging our global scale. Our new global talent model was approved by excom in September 2010 and has been implemented across our business with implementation in Australia currently underway.</p>
          <p>In the second year of implementation, the impact has been positive and we're making better and more effective deployment decisions for the long term. We're less reactive and much more deliberate about whom we move where and are able to take calculated risks with strong, high potential talent.</p>
          <p>In this financial year, 32 moves of executive talent have been made across regions. Our talent pool is truly global with executives filling our global top 200 positions spanning over 40 nationalities and all continents.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now hand over to Jamie for his review. Go ahead, Jamie.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day, everyone. We'll start by looking at our earnings per share performance. The group has delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth in all of our major currencies.</p>
          <p>In the first six months, this represents a 14% growth in U.S. dollar terms. This reflects good organic EBITA growth boosted by the acquisition of Foster's. Revenue and profit growth have been healthy, with underlying volumes, pricing and mix all trending positively and contributing to margin development. The interim dividend is US$0.24 per share, which represents an increase of 12% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Despite the moderation in growth in some emerging markets in the latter months of the half, we grew volumes and revenues across most regions. Lager volumes increased 3.9% on an organic basis versus the prior year, led by strong growth in Africa by 6% and Europe up 9% against the weaker comparative and helped in Poland by the Euro 2012 Football Tournament. A 6.1% increase in organic soft drink volumes was driven by Africa and South Africa, generating total volume growth of 4.4% on an organic basis.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency group revenue grew by 7.6%, reflecting a combination of higher volumes, selective price increases and improved brand mix in most regions. Organic constant currency EBITA grew by 9.4%, mainly due to revenue growth and an improvement in organic margins of 30 basis points. There has been a positive impact on operating metrics from the acquisition of Foster's, our alliance with Anadolu Efes, and the management combination of our Angolan and Nigerian businesses with Castel, all completed during the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, most of our main operating currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, so the performance trends in reported and organic terms varies somewhat.</p>
          <p>Group revenue per hectoliter increased 3% on organic constant currency basis, and all regions other than Europe grew compared with the prior period.</p>
          <p>Latin America benefited from selective price increases and positive brand mix across the region, driven by our premium brand growth.</p>
          <p>North America, firm pricing and favorable brand mix resulted from the Tenth and Blake division growth, mainly driven by Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon, as well as down weighting of our economy beer segment.</p>
          <p>In Africa, strong performance from our subsidiaries, assisted by price increases and mix benefits from the growth of both Castle Lite and local premium brands in a number of countries, drove the increase.</p>
          <p>Price and mix benefits in China and India drove the 6% increase in group revenue per hectoliter in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>South Africa benefited from a moderate price increase taken in lager and below-inflationary price increases in the soft drinks portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the decline in unit revenue of two percentage points was driven by the growth of our economy brands, particularly Ciucas in Romania, targeted price reductions in Poland and the continued consumer shift from the high value on-premise to the off-premise channel in a number of markets and growth of discounters in that channel.</p>
          <p>Raw material input costs for the half-year were up by mid-single digits on a constant currency per hectoliter basis versus the prior year, which was in line with our previous guidance. We have seen higher brewing raw material costs driven by higher barley prices and rising energy prices. And those energy costs have flown through into some packaging costs, as well as distribution cost.</p>
          <p>These increases have been partially offset by savings achieved through our global procurement program. As always, cost pressure has varied between regions with the steepest rises in Europe, Africa and South Africa.</p>
          <p>Reported EBITA margin benefited from the acquisition of Foster's and was up 100 basis points to 18.2%. On an organic basis, we saw improvements in most regions, an overall increase of 30 basis points despite the rise in input cost.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency EBITA margin in Latin America grew strongly due to slighter price increases, volume growth and combined with the variable production and other cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Performance in Castel boosted Africa's EBITA margin, with subsidiary margins under pressure from capacity expanded &#x2013; expansion-related costs, input costs and investment in marketing.</p>
          <p>Asia's EBITA margins were leveled with the improved top line performance in China and India, offset by increased marketing and sales costs in China.</p>
          <p>South Africa: beverages, EBITA margin benefited from price increases, operational efficiencies and fixed cost productivity, however, was impacted by the one-off excise charge in our associate, Distell.</p>
          <p>South America margin improved due to strong pricing and brand mix and the phasing of information system costs, partly offset by higher marketing spend.</p>
          <p>The EBITA margin decline driven by the negative mix, selective price reductions and higher raw material costs, together with an increased level of marketing spend and advanced trading.</p>
          <p>Net operating benefits were expected to reach $250 million this year, in line with previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Procurement continues to be the main contributor with an increasing flow of projects in non-production spend areas adding to that in the more established scope areas of raw material and packaging. Manufacturing in some regions and sales and distribution benefits also continued.</p>
          <p>Our global ERP implementation progress continues. The design and build of the global template has been completed and this is in the process of being thoroughly tested in Poland.</p>
          <p>Work to transition from project-led structure into business as usual operations in IS, is in hand. We continue to progress with shared services, decentralize our treasury operations for European countries and are implementing the same in Africa, resulting in both financial and operational benefits.</p>
          <p>Despite the adverse foreign exchange translation, adjusted EBITDA, comprising EBITDA before cash flows from exceptional items together with dividends received from MillerCoors, increased 12% on the prior year with underlying growth enhanced by the contribution from Foster's. In aggregate, the level of operational working capital was unchanged, but there was an outflow in the period due to the timing of payments including the settlement of some costs provided in Australia combined with higher receivables in Europe as the modern trade channels becomes more important.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure, including that on intangible assets, for the first half of the year was $105 million lower than the prior period. We continue to invest to address capacity constraints and to support growth particularly in Africa. The adjusted net finance cost increased by 70% to $391 million, following the increase in borrowings related to the Foster's transaction.</p>
          <p>The group's effective tax rate of 27.5% was 100 basis points lower than the rate in the first half of last year, primarily as a result of geographic changes in profit mix, together with the tax effect of debt taken on with the Foster's acquisition.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow increased by $205 million versus the prior period. However, the timing of cash flows generated in a one-off inflow in Australia from tax was a specific timing factor and it will reverse in the next year.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position as of 30th of September has decreased over the last six months, reflecting partial repayment of the Foster's acquisition facility and the repayment at maturity of bonds in Colombia and South Africa. As a result, gearing has decreased to 65% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.6 times.</p>
          <p>Our access to liquidity remains strong with committed headroom available to comply with all covenants on existing borrowings and to fund ongoing capital expenditure. We remain on track to return to net debt to adjusted EBITDA to its target range of between 2 and 2.5 times within the next 18 months, in line with our stated financial policy.</p>
          <p>Our weighted average interest rate on gross debt as of 30th of September has decreased to 4.4%, down from 4.9% at the end of March. This is primarily due to the repayment of higher interest rate debt combined with lower floating interest rate, most notably in euros and Australian dollars. The majority of our debt continues to be held in floating rates.</p>
          <p>And now the outlook; although we have seen moderation of economic growth in some countries in recent months, the fundamental potential of the emerging markets in which we operate remains strong. In that context, we expect our brand, channel, and <mark type="inaudible" /> development initiatives to continue to drive top line growth.</p>
          <p>We expect input cost pressures to continue at the similar levels of the first half of the year, up mid-single digits on a per hectoliter basis and we will selectively raise prices where market conditions permit.</p>
          <p>The positive impact from acquisitions and business combinations seen in the first half of the year will reduce as we cycle the completion dates in the second half, although the synergy generation will continue.</p>
          <p>As previously advised, capital expenditure for the full year is anticipated to amount to approximately $1.6 billion, with new brewing capacity in South Sudan and Nigeria already coming on-stream and elsewhere under construction in Ghana, Tanzania, Peru, Uganda and Zambia.</p>
          <p>Finally, our effective tax rate for the half year was set at our current expectation of the full year at 27.5%, towards the lower end of our advised range of 27% to 29%.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Jamie. And so to conclude, a reminder of our key thoughts today, SABMiller's very strong revenue growth continues in this half year driving underlying EBITA growth of some 9%. Our proven approach to brand and beer market development continues to deliver with pricing, mix and cost efficiencies further contributing to the result.</p>
          <p>We believe that emerging market fundamentals remain strong despite some current moderation in growth this year. Our model of leading local flagship brands, innovation and expanding premium assortment is working as we've shown across many markets. And as Jamie has just described, we continue to invest in our future growth in the form of capacity, systems and capabilities.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, we'll be happy to move into questions and answers, either over the phone line or through our Internet web cast, where we've invited everyone to submit questions online. And in fact, operator, I think we'll kick off initially with a question that's come in through the website. And then, after that, we'll turn it over to the phone lines.</p>
          <p>The first question is broad, Jamie, saying where do you see the greater emphasis of growth coming over the next few years between your emerging markets, LatAm, Africa or Asia? And do you expect all of your developed market regions to deliver margin growth during the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gary. I think the &#x2013; I think it's fair to say that we expect LatAm and Africa both to continue to grow over the next two years. I mean, clearly, in terms of per capita consumption, Latin America is more developed than Africa. And therefore, there is more room for longer-term growth within Africa given it's coming from very low per capita consumption. But clearly, what we're seeing in Latin America is the ultimate shift to premium, which is lifting the value delivery from those markets.</p>
          <p>So I think we're comfortable with both Latin America and Africa. If you go into Asia, then it's a slightly different story. I mean, we're continuing to get volume growth in China, albeit at lower margin. And then clearly, we're obviously working in Australia now to continue to develop that business. So that will develop the store base in terms of volume, but lower in terms of value delivery.</p>
          <p>In terms of the developed markets, I mean, obviously, you've seen the margin contraction in Europe and the period under review, and clearly that's the result of a combination of the price reset and also the input costs. We would expect that to bottom out and to start to grow margin from that lower base as we go out through the next few years. So yes, we'd expect developed markets to generally enhance their margin delivery. And in terms of the growth prospects, I think we see it reasonably spread across the emerging markets.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. It's somewhat a follow-up to your comment you just made on the outlook. I'm particularly interested in hearing more about the U.S. and Latin America. It seems like maybe we're seeing a bit of reverse here where the U.S. market is firming up a bit while Latin America maybe directionally is getting a bit softer.</p>
          <p>So just curious once again from a strategic point of view, what levers do you have to pull? Is the beer industry more about pricing at this point? Is it about trading up? I'm just trying to get a better sense of growth in these two very important markets for you going forward. Where is the upside coming from? And particularly for the U.S. as that market is starting to firm up, is it more about the pricing side or regaining or gaining some volume share in the beer industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, I think there's a combination of factors going on there. I mean if you look at the U.S. first of all, I mean clearly we still have a continuation of the two sort of prongs of the industry in terms of the premium end of the industry still continuing to grow double-digits and our Tenth and Blake subsidiary continue to grow within that and performing very well.</p>
          <p>But you're right, there does appear to be a little bit more life in the rest of the beer industry, albeit that's represented more by a reduction in the rate of volume decline at the moment. But that segment has also been able to take price. So as we've said in the past, there's been a bit of a trading off in terms of the fact that although we have some slight volume decline, price has been covering that and allowing us to deliver sort of a reasonably constant delivery in that market.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that price is going to be buoyant in the sense there's not going to be huge price, it's also being measured price rises within that which keep the volume in balance. But there's a little bit more life there and hopefully if the U.S. economy picks up, we'll generally see some uptick in the beer volumes.</p>
          <p>But clearly, it takes a while for the economy to pick up and flow down into the actual employment statistic and hence the core beer drinkers tend to still be a little bit nervous about the future. Having said that, the premium sector will continue to grow and we will continue to develop our brands like Leinenkugel's, Blue Moon and brands like that in order to satisfy that demand at the same time.</p>
          <p>The dynamics in Colombia are different to that. I mean I think you see a slight softness there. I mean, softness is a sort of a relative word. I mean what we've seen in the second quarter is slightly lower volume growth but it's still growing in terms of volume. And we're still delivering good revenue delivery, and indeed we are delivering good margin growth.</p>
          <p>So I think we got to be a little bit careful by saying softness in those areas I think it's just that there has been a number of issues within Colombia, partly as a result of the strength of the currency, which makes exports a little bit more difficult partly as a result of some of the internal security issues there, which means that trading has been a little bit softer in Q2. But we're seeing continued volume growth and we are still &#x2013; we're seeing continued revenue per hectoliter delivery because of the premiumization of that market.</p>
          <p>So, I think we still see strong growth there. We're not seeing a change between the two, but what we may see is less or a little bit less decline in the U.S. beer market, perhaps a little bit stabilization potential growth coming back to that at some point in the future.</p>

          <p>And as a follow-up, can I ask also on Latin America. Your competitors have been more focused or quite strong in markets like Brazil and Mexico. You're obviously strong in Colombia and Peru. So I was just curious, developing that region as far as a long-term strategy, is it about doing more of the same in your current markets? Is there a need to expand further in Latin America? How do you think about that region developing over time?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't need to expand there. I mean, I think we're very happy with the footprint we've got there. I mean obviously we've got Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, El Salvador, Honduras, I mean all of these markets are a good strong beer markets for us and we believe as we look forward in the sort of outlook for Latin America economy is that growth region of Latin America will do well and we're very happy with that.</p>
          <p>I mean clearly, yes, Brazil is a big beer market. Mexico is a big beer market but they are also quite dominated by the existing players. So I think you have to be quite selective in seeing whether you want to play in those markets or not. At the moment we are busy trying to develop our business in our existing regions.</p>

          <p>Okay, we'll take &#x2013; we've got one more question coming in off the web, in the meantime. Jamie, this concerns the U.S., MillerCoors has seen a very strong contribution from mix to revenue per barrel growth, contribution from mix of sometimes up to a full percentage point, do you see this as sustainable and is it driven by declines of below-premium as much as gains in above-premium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, both contribute to certainly the gains that we're seeing in the premium end of the sector and the innovations that we're doing in that space are clearly adding in terms of the mix benefit that we get, and we'll continue to drive that very strongly and believe that our brands are performing particularly well and we've seen again the success of some of the Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy again over the summer period, which has been very gratifying.</p>
          <p>But yes, our below-premium portfolio has also declined a little bit and that obviously contributes to the mix. But I would say that we're confident that we'll continue to grow the upper end of the portfolio to sustain that mix.</p>
