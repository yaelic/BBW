          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Six Months Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later on, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you all, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Mr. Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's six months results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen is with me today and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>It's been a strong second quarter and first half year for H&amp;M. The year started well and the positive development continued in the second quarter. Our spring collections have been well received and we have continued taking market share in a fashion retail market that remains challenging. And we have increased our profitability.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, second quarter 2012. Sales including VAT increased 12% in local currencies in the quarter, and in comparable units, sales were up 2%. Net sales grew 15% to SEK31.7 billion. The strong development is proof that H&amp;M's attractive customer offering is being appreciated in all our 44 markets, in big as well as in small cities, and in countries with strong economic growth, as well as in countries with a tough macroeconomic climates.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, sales per market. Germany is still by far our largest market with 22% of group revenue. Our sales have developed well despite a slow clothing market. The strong development in the U.S. continues. Sales increased by around 30% in local currency in the first six months. We've had many successful openings; for example, our first store in Houston, Texas. Sales in the UK were also strong with an increase of 16%.</p>
          <p>Our rapid growth in Asia and especially in China continues. We have more than 100 stores in China now. Since Q2 last year, we've opened 42 stores and our expansion continues. Sales in China were up by 47% in the first half of the year. In Japan, sales have developed well following a tough year last year, and we see continued great potential for H&amp;M in Japan. All our new markets, with Bulgaria being the most recent addition, have performed well. And also in our franchise markets, sales have continued to increase, and both we and our franchisees are satisfied.</p>
          <p>Going back to the second quarter, please return to the slide, second quarter 2012. Gross profit for the quarter increased to SEK19.5 billion corresponding to a gross margin of 61.7%, unchanged from last year. The gross margin is a result of many different factors, external as well as internal, together with the decisions we make in line with our strategy to always have the best customer offering in each market.</p>
          <p>In the quarter the overall effects of the previously very negative external factors such as the cotton price were more or less neutral. The U.S. dollar, our most important sourcing currency, was also relatively neutral year-on-year for the products we sold in the second quarter. But for the second half of 2012, the U.S. dollar will have a negative effect since it has strengthened materially against most of our sales currencies. We, however, have a long-term approach and, as always, we will strive to offer our customers the best combination of fashion and quality at the best price.</p>
          <p>Looking at markdowns in relation to sales, they were at the same level as last year and, thus, the effect on the gross margin was neutral.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's long-term investments that are aimed at broadening the total offering of the group, those investments continue. Like we said in connection with our first quarter results, one of them is an entirely new store chain that we will launch already next year. The name will be &amp; Other Stories and it will be a great compliment to our existing brands. In the second quarter, in relation to sales, these investments were smaller than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Over to operational costs. Cost control in the group remains good. Costs in comparable stores decreased from second quarter last year as a proportion of sales. SG&amp;A was SEK12.7 billion in the quarter, up 10% in SEK and 8% in local currencies. The increase is explained mainly by the expansion. As a share of sales, costs decreased to 40% from 41.5%. And just to remind you, in the second quarter last year, there was a provision of SEK248 million related to H&amp;M incentive program. The main part of that provision was booked as SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The operating margin increased to 21.8% from 20.3%. It is a high level for H&amp;M historically, but above all, it's a high level compared to the industry. Net profit for the period was up by 23% to SEK5.2 billion and corresponding to earnings per share of SEK3.15.</p>
          <p>And now looking at some key figures for the period, please turn to the slide, key data. Stock-in-trade was SEK11.3 billion, an increase of 8% in SEK and 6% in local currencies, compared to the same time last year. The increase is due to the expansion. The stock-in-trade is well composed and at a good level. Cash flow from current operations was SEK10.7 billion. The main explanation for the increase is the increase in profit and the development of stock-in-trade.</p>
          <p>Investments were SEK2.6 billion, above all in new stores but also in IT and logistics. Despite a dividend of SEK15.7 billion paid out in the quarter, our finances remain strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK13.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And now some words on our expansion, please turn to the slide expansion. We added a net of 84 stores in the second quarter, and the group had a total of 2,575 stores at the end of the period, of which 2,446 H&amp;M; 51 COS; 55 Monki; 19, Weekday; and 4 Cheap Monday. Of the total, 75 are franchise stores. Our expansion plan remained intact and in 2012, we plan to open around 275 stores net.</p>
          <p>We are growing in all our markets. China, the U.S., and the UK are the three countries where we plan to open the most stores. We're adding five new markets this year. During the spring, we opened our first three stores in Bulgaria. All of them have been well received by customers, and will be followed by more openings this year and this autumn, we will open in Mexico, Latvia, and Malaysia, as well as in Thailand, which will become a new franchise market.</p>
          <p>All of them are very interesting markets, not least Mexico. The store in Mexico City will be the first H&amp;M store in Latin America and we see great demand for H&amp;M also in this part of the world where people are waiting for us to open.</p>
          <p>COS continues to do very well, and we'll open in six new markets only in this year. In May, COS opened in Italy and Finland with very successful openings in Milano and Helsinki. Last week, the first COS store opened in Poland and next week, Hong Kong, followed by Austria in August and later this year Kuwait via franchise.</p>
          <p>This autumn we will also expand our online sales with the launch of H&amp;M's shop online in the U.S. We are looking forward very much to offer this opportunity to customers in the world's largest online retail market.</p>
          <p>Looking further ahead, our global expansion continues. Next year, we will again open stores in several new markets. Contracts are signed for the first three stores in Estonia that will open in Tallinn in the autumn of 2013. We're also opening Indonesia via franchise.</p>
          <p>Before we start the Q&amp;A session, a few comments to summarize. We've had a strong first half year. We've strengthened our position further and we've increased sales by 12% in local currencies and by 3% in comparable units. The fact that we continue taking market share under the challenging conditions that still prevail in many markets with economic austerity and restrained consumption shows not only that we have strong collections that are appreciated by our customers, but also that our business model works well also in times of economic weakness.</p>
          <p>Conditions will always be changing in the world around us. For example, we have seen movements in currencies and the cotton prices. We will always be exposed to external changes and we will keep our long-term focus. This means that we will always put the customers first and see to it that we have the best customer offering in each market.</p>
          <p>We're now happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Okay, we do have a question coming from the line of Omar Saad. Please go ahead with your question, announce your company's name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Omar Saad from ISI Group. Nice quarter, guys. Good job.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to ask you about the &#x2013; it looks like there's been an inflection in the mark-down cadence. This quarter we're stable year-over-year. What are the factors that you think are &#x2013; do you think are driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the most important factor, of course, is the strong sales. And our collections have been well received. And there are a lot of different things to explain that but we are happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; great. And then on the cotton comment you made in the prepared remarks, how do you think about balancing the benefit of lower cotton costs and -- versus kind of the rising wages as you think about your cost of goods? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There are several different factors both external and internal that affect our purchasing costs. And exactly how we choose to balance them and that will, of course, always be from our view looking into our customer, offering it in a competitive market. But we -- but for competitive reasons, we choose not to exactly go into how we will use different external factors. But the most decisive will be the decisions we will make when it comes to our customer offering. But that will be decisive for the gross margin. And I have to also remind you that there a lot of other internal and external factors, which is &#x2013; which are affecting the cost of goods sold for H&amp;M as we are using a income statement by function. So it's not only the pure sourcing costs. There are plenty of other factors as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company's name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Afternoon, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard here from Merrill's. Yeah, can I just ask a question on the U.S. market, please, another strong performance there. Did you see a significant difference in performance on the East versus the West Coast during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The performance in the U.S. have been strong all over the continent, both in the East Coast, Midwest, and the West Coast, as well. And today we are also in other parts of the U.S., so we see a strong performance all over the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on the gross margin, these long-term investments that you've made that you said were obviously less of a factor in Q2 compared to Q1, I just wondered if the new store chain is most of those investments or is it only a small part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one part. There are different other investments as well in broadening the total customer offering within the H&amp;M as well, so &amp; Other Stories is one of them. And the long-term investments, they will continue in the coming quarters as well, but they will, of course, vary between the quarters, and in Q2 the share of sales was less than in Q1, and it's simply due to that Q2 is a bigger quarter when it comes to turnover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So should we expect to also &#x2013; should we expect then a slightly higher rate &#x2013; I'm sorry; a lower proportion in the second half of those investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, also if you're looking into the share of turnover, it will be totally dependent on how the turnover will develop during the third and fourth quarter. So the impact as a share will be, of course, decisive on the top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. All right; thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question comes from the line of Peter Farren. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company's name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Peter Farren from Bryan Garnier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. First question's on the gross margin because it was flat in Q2. You indicate that discounting the dollar and cotton prices were all flat and there's a negative from your long-term investment, the buying office, et cetera, so I was wondering what the positive was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we actually are saying in the report -- we are looking into those four, five factors that we have been talking about the last year, which were significantly negative in the past quarters, that is mainly the cotton prices, it's the wage inflation in the sourcing countries, it's transportation, it's the capacity of the suppliers, and then also this U.S. dollar effect.</p>
          <p>When looking overall, in those four to five factors, the effect is more or less neutral compared to the corresponding period last year. And the long-term investment, as I've just said, they will continue. So it's a big change from quarter one when it comes to those four to five factors. But still, I have to remember there are plenty of other factors as well affecting our cost of goods sold, and of course, how we choose to work with our custom offering. So it's only those four, five external factors that we are commenting on in the report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. But what I'm trying to understand, though, given all those external factors, you say had broadly no impact in Q2, and that your long-term investments had a negative impact, even if there's more than Q1. There's obviously a positive in there somewhere because you achieved a flat gross margin overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, exactly. And as I said, there are maybe 20 to 30 different factors and year-on-year change as we are using this income statement by function, then there are our costs when it comes to design our logistics, our buying organization, our production offices, etcetera, and there can be smaller changes in a quarter, but year-on-year, it can be the opposite change. Plus 10 basis points last year, minus 15 basis points this year. There you already have a year-on-year effect of up 25 basis points, but no significant ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And a quick second one if I may on Bangladesh, if you could just give us an idea of how you're being impacted, if at all, and if you're managing to shift production out of the factories which were being impacted by riots?=</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are, of course, following the situation very closely and it's correct that some of our suppliers are affected but we have, all in all, between more than 700 suppliers in the group, so we think we can handle this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Fraser Ramzan. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company's name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Fraser Ramzan at Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just firstly a question on mark-down, when H&amp;M says its stock or its inventory level is good and well composed and it's up by less than sales in the quarter, should we think that that means you might have a pretty favorable mark-down impact in the coming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's far too early to say actually anything about the mark-down affect in Q3. We just started the summer sale in some countries, and still it's over two months still to go. But that's correct that we are satisfied with the level and the composition of the stock in trade as going out from Q2. But, yeah, it's too early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just if I might just add to that, obviously, you've kindly given us an outlook for currency for the second half of the year, which as you say quite visibly has swung to the negative. Given broadly your sourcing lead times and your level of commitments at this time, is it fair to say that at net-net average unit costs are likely to be down in the second half taking into account all those different factors that you just cited?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think you could put it that's simply there as Jyrki has said the last several times, there may be 20 or 30 of different factors affecting and the most important thing regarding the gross margin is, of course, how we decide to work with the customer offering.</p>
          <p>But again, there are enough things like how we succeed with the efficiency improvements and with negotiations, etcetera. So I refrain from giving you a guidance about the net-net price, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then effectively your commercial policy will determine whether or not you actually achieve &#x2013; what gross margin you actually achieve, I think that's what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, always.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. It's Jamie Merriman from Sanford Bernstein. My first question is just on the SG&amp;A. It's very impressive cost control in the quarter and I was wondering if there are any specific actions that you took in the quarter to control cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said earlier, we are always working with our cost structure and the efficiency, so we have a strong cost focus within the H&amp;M group. So there are no special &#x2013; it's fine tuning, finding out, planning better, et cetera, so nothing dramatically; but we have done a very good job in that part as well during the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just one more question, if I could, Just in terms of the open to buy and the commitment, it seems like you've gotten the benefit of flat cotton prices sooner than I would have expected and I was wondering if there's been any efforts to increase the open to buy or the level of your commitment going into the season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and no. I mean, we have always an open to buy in order to react fast, and knowing with some changes we can be very fast. And then of course, with strong sales, the chance or the opportunities for fast lead times increase and we can act very quickly. So in a way, you could say that has one effect that, of course, affects the lead times. And again, I'd like to remind you that &#x2013; when we talk about the six months, etcetera, that's very theoretical. And in reality, it's never that simple.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi there. This is Rebecca at Santander. Just on OpEx again, you said that in the second quarter, the like-for-like OpEx was negative. My question is, is that sustainable over the third and fourth quarter? And which costs on a like-for-like basis are being reviewed, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the like-for-like OpEx was on a better level than the last year. And we are looking into all different kind of costs when it comes to OpEx. And we have a strong focus on that. And a lot of times, we get a question about the share of sales. And for us, the most important is to have a really good control over the year-on-year development within our operations. But still, we will continue to make those investments that we feel is necessary because that will even give a stronger H&amp;M in the future, and we have the financial strength to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>As I said, we don't give any forward-looking statement when it comes to cost development, but we are confident with the way we are working with the OpEx but we will still do those necessary investments that we need to do. And if it's about the share of sales, that we will of course, then be dependent on how the turnover develops during the second half year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I just want to ask you on the financials &#x2013; I mean the financial net. As a percentage of sort of full year net debt, it seems like you have a significantly higher interest rate achieved on your net debt position or net cash position, sorry, especially compared to in Q1 most recently. So my question is really have you found alternative ways to invest your cash at this stage?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, nothing dramatically. We are having quite a conservative financial policy and of course, what we can see in some markets it's &#x2013; that sometimes we even get better interest rates just on the current account instead of deposits. So the share of deposits have gone down in some countries and &#x2013; but nothing dramatically.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. This is Chris calling from Barclays. Most of my questions have been answered, to be fair, or maybe not really answered, but one question on investments. Maybe help us understand a little bit how you do these investments in the product offering, because if they are &#x2013; if the magnitude is reliant on top line, it looks like they are fixed amounts, in which case, the more sales you do, the less impact they have in the overall gross margin. Is this the right way to think about these investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course. If the investment would be a fixed amount, then of course it will be totally dependent on the development on the top line, the share of sales, of course. But the reality is not such static. It's also the amounts are differing from quarter to quarter. But for this quarter, the main reason for the long-term investment is that it's a less share than in Q1. It's mainly the top line is much bigger in Q2 than Q1.</p>

          <p>We are very happy with the development in, obviously, across all our countries and markets including Greece and Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, etcetera.

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital. A couple of questions. Just on price, prices generally in apparel in most major markets started creeping up in the last six months or so. Can you just say what you've actually done with your average prices over the &#x2013; particularly in &#x2013; with your spring summer collection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not raised our prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And you've mentioned that your 2Q EBIT margin was relatively high by your standard and by the industry standard. And yet, followed it back, you've actually only been noticeably below that once since 2005. And I was wondering what your message is with that? Is it that we should be cautious about assuming higher EBIT margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know how you have been analyzing the EBIT margin. Of course, there are some quarters have in nature a bigger EBIT margin. But if looking at the performance for our second quarter, the 21.8 as operating margin in this year's Q2, we &#x2013; I think, I can't remember it exactly, but I think we had a stronger Q2 in 2010 when it was almost 26%. But then it was driven quite much from our internal hedges and those FX that we got there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there we had a really, really high gross margin as well. But looking &#x2013; the past three years, this is except for 2010, I think it's the highest operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you were actually higher than that in 2006, 2007, and 2008. So, you've done a consistently higher EBIT margin in 2Q for quite a long time which is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But still, we think we are happy with this. It's -- for our measures, it's a good operating margin and also considering the environment we are operating in. So we are very happy with this operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure you are. The -- can I just also ask about admin, which your admin expenses were up 6% in the first quarter, but only up about 1% in the second quarter, and &#x2013; but again admin seems to have been going up much faster in 1Q than 2Q going back for several years. I'm just wondering is there anything behind this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comparing to last year's second quarter, there we had quite a big increase in last year's second quarter. We had this long-term incentive program &#x2013; Hennes &amp; Mauritz incentive program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But even if you strip that out, you were 845 against 835, which is kind of 1% increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And additionally to that, we also had investments in IT and other long-term investments that was really high in second quarter last year. There you see a really high increase from the year &#x2013; the previous year. So that's the reason for this increase of around 1% this year to second quarter last year.</p>

But can you sort of give any further details as to how you're doing on the Internet in your existing countries?</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; and secondly, it's really just a question on, you mentioned the capacity with regards to suppliers primarily in Asia. Can you sort of just give us a little bit of a flavor as to whether you're seeing excess capacity or better deals to be had from the Asian suppliers because of capacity issues?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, regarding the Internet, I did mention that we are looking forward to the online expansion of the Internet sales in the U.S. this autumn. So yes, of course, Internet is more and more important role for the whole region, and of course, for H&amp;M as well. And we are investing a lot in IT online, as you know. And looking forward very much to this expansion first to the U.S. but then, of course, after the U.S. the ambition, the plan is to roll it out in the rest of the group. So very excited and strong development.</p>
          <p>Next question regarding capacity, it's true that it's looking &#x2013; compared to last year, it's more capacity which is good. But on the other hand, the salary costs are higher, so it's not so simple to draw any conclusions from that.</p>
