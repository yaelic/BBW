          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the RBC 2009 First Quarter Results Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Marcia Moffat, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Moffat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Presenting to you today are Gord Nixon, our CEO; Morten Friis, our Chief Risk Officer; and Janice Fukakusa, our CFO and Chief Administrative Officer. Following their comments, we'll open up the call for questions from analysts. The call will be one hour long, and we will post management's formal remarks on our website shortly after the call.</p>
          <p>Joining us for your questions are Barb Stymiest, our Chief Operating Officer; Dave McKay, Head of Canadian Banking; George Lewis, Head of Wealth Management; Jim Westlake, Head of International Banking and Insurance; Doug McGregor, Chairman and Co-CEO, Capital Markets; and Mark Standish, President and Co-CEO, Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>As noted on Slide Two, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which involve applying assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Gord Nixon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcia, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this earlier than usual conference call. But with us in Vancouver and we know the analysts have a very busy day with all the reporting seasons, we though that it would be good for everyone and particularly our investors to have the call earlier than usual.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Slide Four, RBC once again displayed the strength of our Canadian businesses and demonstrated the value of our diversified business model. We earned this quarter over $1 billion, with earnings per share of $0.73.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight items on Slide 4 impacting our earnings. Excluding these items, our earnings were 1.6 billion, with earnings per share of $1.14. Our capital ratios remained strong. Our Tier 1 ratio was at 10.6% and our tangible common equity to risk adjusted assets is at 6.8%. This reflects capital issuance in the first quarter, as well as our continued focus on managing our risk adjusted assets and the earnings contributions from our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our solid financial profile should provide our shareholders and clients with additional confidence in the strength and stability of our organization and should support the continued growth of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, I would like to make a few comments about the roughly $1.3 billion of market-related charges that we took this quarter and describe our approach to valuing illiquid securities in the market. Unfortunately, fair value accounting, while well intended, have their limitations. Today's mark-to-market accounting rules did not anticipate illiquid markets and, as a result, have generated unintended consequences for bank earnings around the world. It has also given rise to a wide range of judgments that can be applied. The result has been significant disparity in how securities are valued and how changes in values are recognized in financial statements. This does make comparisons more difficult.</p>
          <p>Some institutions have chosen to use a more models-based approach to valuation, while others have used a greater level of observable market inputs. This can cause the valuation of the same securities to vary.</p>
          <p>For example, the fair value of exposure hedged by monolines can be determined using market inputs such as credit default swap spreads, or internal models designed to predict long-term recovery levels. These methods will result in different assessments of fair value. Moreover, even with credit default swaps, using spot rates versus an average rate can cause different results.</p>
          <p>Our approach has been to use market inputs and spot pricing where feasible. While this results in more income volatility than internal models, this is the approach that RBC has taken because we and our auditors believe it to be more transparent, conservative and in keeping with best practices.</p>
          <p>In addition, institutions have made different choices on the types of securities that are held in trading portfolios versus non-trading portfolios. Again, this makes comparisons difficult. As you know, changes in fair value of assets in available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolios generally will not flow through the income statement.</p>
          <p>We believe we have been very selective in determining which securities should be held in non-trading portfolios. While both the use of observable market measures and the holding of securities in our trading portfolios causes greater volatility, we feel it provides better transparency in reflecting the current market conditions. While we don't like this volatility, over time, there should be convergence between different methodologies as illiquid assets mature and realized values are determined.</p>
          <p>However, notwithstanding these charges, as I said earlier, we had a very solid quarter and continue to manage the current headwinds effectively. I'd like to give you an overview of our results.</p>
          <p>Canadian Banking continued to drive results, with strong earnings reflecting volume growth across our businesses and effective cost management. However, the low interest-rate environment impacted our margins and offset much of the volume growth. We had higher provisions for credit losses reflecting both higher loss rates and portfolio growth. This increase is not surprising as we see the weakening of the Canadian and Global economies.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, earnings were down, largely reflecting weak equity markets. We continue to have leading market share in Canadian mutual funds and full service brokerage, and will continue to focus on building our wealth management business by adding experienced consultants. This will position us well when we begin to see improvements in the equity markets. Outside of Canada, we have been particularly successful at recruiting advisors and teams who value RBC's competitive position and stability.</p>
          <p>Insurance generated solid business growth, with net income up from last year. In International Banking, our U.S. Banking business continued to be impacted by the challenging environment, resulting in higher provisions for credit losses and write-downs in our investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Once again, we continued to generate solid results in our Capital Markets business despite the market environment impact. I keep referring to the diversity of our businesses, but it is really seen here when you look at how we continue to produce solid earnings from this segment during this extraordinary environment.</p>
          <p>With respect to our dividend, we are maintaining our quarterly common share dividend in the second quarter of 2009, which we believe is prudent in this environment. Over time, our objective is to grow our dividend.</p>
          <p>Stepping back and looking at overall results, the operating environment is certainly challenging, but I am certainly also proud of how we have been able to manage through it. It's important that during these times we stay focused on our strategy to navigate through these challenging times that lie ahead.</p>
          <p>We will focus on maintaining a solid capital position. We will build on our solid risk management practices. We will manage costs aggressively and prudently. And, we will utilize our flexibility to build our core earnings by investing in select areas where we generate value and can generate value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The current market conditions continue to create opportunities for RBC, given what has happened to a number of competitors around the world. We will continue to capitalize on our growing global reputation for strength and stability and I believe we will be in a stronger position when these markets start to return to a more normal environment, which we believe they will.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Morten.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gord. I'll start with an update on our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking at slides 11 to 16, we had $747 million in provisions for credit losses in the first quarter, up from $619 million last quarter. This quarter included a general provision of $149 million. This reflects deterioration in our corporate portfolio, higher loss rates and volume growth in our Canadian retail lending portfolio, and higher provisions in our U.S. banking portfolio.</p>
          <p>I will now review specific provisions for credit losses by geography. Starting in Canada, which represents 78% of our overall portfolio, we have higher specific provisions related to credit cards and personal loans, mainly unsecured credit lines. This reflects both higher loss rates and portfolio growth. Provisions for wholesale loans increased from the prior quarter, largely reflecting a provision in our corporate lending portfolio relating to a specific client in our prime brokerage business. This one item had a large impact on our Specific PCL ratio this quarter.</p>
          <p>There is no gross impaired loan or allowance for credit loss for this item because as the account became impaired, we took a provision, wrote down the loan, and took over the underlying securities within the quarter. Since taking over the portfolio of securities, we have seen some recovery of losses and have taken steps to reduce the overall size and risk of the portfolio. We have no other prime brokerage accounts of this magnitude and have scaled down this business, while adding further mitigation and control processes.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S., which represents 15% of our overall portfolio. Compared to last quarter, we have higher provisions for residential mortgages and personal loans, reflecting the deepening recession and housing market decline. In the wholesale portfolio, lower provisions related to our U.S. residential builder finance portfolio were largely offset by higher provisions related to our U.S. Banking commercial loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Finally, the remaining 7% of our loan book consists largely of our Caribbean banking operations. In general, our international portfolio continues to be stable.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 16, our total allowance for credit losses is 87 basis points, as measured against total loans and acceptances. This is up from 76 basis points in the prior quarter. In terms of coverage ratios, our total ratio is 73% and is approximately 107% if you exclude our U.S. Banking operations. The coverage ratio for our U.S. Banking operations is approximately 40%. This is mainly due to our U.S. residential builder finance portfolio, which has a coverage ratio of 20%, as we believe underlying collateral values will give us a reasonable recovery rate over time.</p>
          <p>Coverage ratios are a function of portfolio mix, underlying the use of recovery rates and the overall quality of the portfolio. It is a bottom-up process. The level of coverage is within our expectations based on previous cycles. We believe we are appropriately provisioned at this stage of the cycle.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 17, let's look at the global trading Value at Risk. You will see that there were six days with net trading losses in the quarter, four of which exceeded global trading VaR. Two of these were due to month-end valuation adjustments and the remaining two were due to significant volatility in equity and credit markets.</p>
          <p>We undertook some risk reduction actions in this quarter that I would like to highlight. As mentioned in the past, we have been winding down the risk in our correlation book. This is a trading portfolio containing CDOs of corporate default swaps. We have sold most of the positions in this book and are managing the residual exposure. In the first quarter, we undertook a series of risk reduction trades and trade assignments. These contributed to our market-related losses in this quarter.</p>
          <p>I will finish off by spending a moment on bank-owned life insurance, since we have received some questions in this area. We have included some background information in Appendix B of our slides. We believe the probability that clients will surrender their insurance policies remains low. These policies are intended to hedge our clients' long-term benefit liabilities by providing a long-term, tax-free income stream. If a client surrenders, they would lose the tax-free income and must pay taxes on accumulated tax-free earnings, which we believe is a substantial impediment to surrender. Also, our payment obligations can be reduced by contractual protections relating to portfolio leverage and capital adequacy of the client. We have one policy with a notional value of $2.5 billion and a fair value of $900 million. After taking into account contractual protections and provisions taken, we estimate that our payment obligation would be approximately $500 million if this contract had been surrendered on January 31.</p>
          <p>Where appropriate, we proactively work with clients to restructure contracts. This further reduces the likelihood of surrender. By restructuring rather than surrendering, a client is able to preserve the tax benefits while improving returns.</p>
          <p>We are satisfied that the cumulative positions we have taken are appropriate, and we have not been doing any new business for some time. Our Investor Relations team would be happy to walk through the background information in our slides with you.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Janice Fukakusa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. As Gord mentioned, net income for the quarter was just over $1 billion, which was down 15% from the first quarter of 2008, and down 6% from last quarter. We remain focused on managing costs and have been able to manage our expense growth rate while continuing to support enterprise-wide business growth. Our expenses are relatively flat compared to last year, if you take into account our acquisitions and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our results were affected by market environment impacts and higher provision for credit losses, as Morten discussed.</p>
          <p>In terms of the market impacts, we had both favorable and unfavorable impacts that collectively reduced revenue by $1.3 billion and net income by $646 million. The losses related primarily to structured credit and unfavorable increased credit valuation adjustments. The credit valuation adjustments reflected both wider counterparty credit spreads and higher net derivative-related credit exposure to certain of our counterparties.</p>
          <p>Up to a year ago, valuations resulting from market and model-driven inputs were generally the same. More recently, we've seen a divergence of the output from different valuation methods. Accurate valuation is important in managing risk and in properly pricing our trading activities. Our objective is to remain as current as possible in valuing exposures so that trading activities and our view of risk align. For this reason, we're using credit default swaps based on spot rates with respect to credit valuation adjustments. Provided there is no credit event, these credit valuation adjustments will flow back into income over time.</p>
          <p>I'll also briefly comment on MBIA's announcement last week to form separate structured finance and U.S. public finance companies. Both MBIA's CEO and its insurance regulator have publicly stated that each legal entity is adequately capitalized with sufficient resources to pay all expected claims in a timely fashion. As a reminder, we've taken cumulative credit valuation adjustments of $1.1 billion against our MBIA exposure. We believe that in a realization scenario, we're more than adequately provisioned.</p>
          <p>I'll now review the quarterly performance of our five business segments. Starting with Canadian Banking on slide 19, net income was up 3% from last year, reflecting volume growth across all businesses and a favorable adjustment to our credit card customer loyalty rewards program, offset by spread compression and higher provision for credit losses and lower mutual fund distribution fees.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, you will see net interest margin decreased over the year and the quarter. This reflects the impact of lower interest rates, product mix changes, and a competitive marketplace. Despite this decline, we grew net interest income by 2% from last year on volume growth across all businesses.</p>
          <p>Looking at Wealth Management on Slide 21, net income decreased 29% from a year ago, due to the impact of capital markets on fee-based client assets and transaction volumes. Moving on to Insurance on slide 22, net income was up 26% over last year. This largely reflects improved Canadian life and health policyholder experience and lower allocated funding costs on capital, partially offset by lower favorable actuarial adjustments.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 23, International Banking had a net loss of $144 million, down $175 million compared to net income of $31 million last year. This decrease was mainly due to performance of our U.S. banking business, which had investment portfolio losses and higher provisions for credit losses.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to our Capital Markets segment on slide 24. Net income was down 26% from last year, largely reflecting the market environment impact and the provision for credit losses that Morten detailed. Certain trading businesses continued to benefit from the increased market volatility and the lower interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Overall, despite market impacts, we generated solid results this quarter with strength in our Canadian Banking and Insurance segments, as well as certain businesses in Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the Operator to begin questions and answers.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, two questions. With respect to Canadian Banking, when we adjust for the credit card-related gain, results were down 2% year-over-year, pretty consistent with respect to the other large retail franchise in Canada. And I'm wondering if we can talk about the credit trends that we're going to face going forward with the sharp increase in unemployment and bankruptcies, and also just looking at potential operating leverage in this franchise. Does it look like 2008 really benefited from the cost control and whether that can continue to 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's Morten. I'll start with a couple of comments on the credit trends. I mean, clearly, the results this quarter actually are quite strong, reflecting very stable performance in the small business and commercial segments. So provision levels there actually remain stable at very solid levels while we continue to see decent growth in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Where we have started to see some impact from the deterioration in the economy is in our unsecured consumer lending cards and unsecured credit lines. But again, the trend is relatively modest and you've seen -- so -- I mean, my view on the impact of the environment is that the impact of unemployment is first on our unsecured consumer lines, and for a protracted period, you will also start to see this show up in the small business and commercial portfolios. But looking at the trends over Q1, which was a fairly difficult quarter from an economic standpoint, the impact on the portfolio has been fairly modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost side, Jim -- it's Gordon Nixon speaking -- as you are aware, we formed, with our restructuring a month or so ago, a new Group Operating Committee which Janice Fukakusa is chairing. The top priority of our Group Operating Committee at this point in time is a significant review of all of our processes and the cost reduction process.</p>
          <p>We have very ambitious internal reduction targets across all of our businesses, including the back-end of our businesses, which would of course impact our Canadian banking business. And we have not sized them at this point. From a public perspective, we have internal targets for both 2009 and 2010, and there's a tremendous amount of work going on on that front. And, as I say, we have internal targets, and we'll be talking about more with respect to that in the future as we provide more &#x2013; do more detailed work and have more credibility with respect to the sizing of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't know, Dave, whether you want to make a specific comment with respect to your branch network away from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue, Jim, it's Dave McKay -- to invest for the future. So we are looking at opening branches and focusing on those core areas that drive our competitive advantage. Having said that, I think we've shown good cost discipline, and we're going to continue to focus on making sure that we manage our costs closely. As an example, when we do open those 30 new branches, we're going to do it FT neutral. Those employees will be transferred from other branches to staff those new branches. So there are areas to manage, and as Gord has mentioned, we have an overarching program that we're focused on. But we feel confident that we can manage our costs closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. Just the second matter I just wanted to address was the breakdown with respect to the prime brokerage business. Could you talk about what the issue was with respect to the risk management and has it &#x2013; how has it been rectified and how does this apply to your U.S. business, where you've been growing your prime brokerage business pretty aggressively over the past year-and-a-half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; it's Morten. I'll take a stab at that. So in terms of the -- first of all, to emphasize, this is -- the account that we've had the issue with is an account that is by far the largest that we have had in the prime brokerage business. So with that account in the position that it's in, the remaining business is significantly smaller and spread over a large number of accounts.</p>
          <p>The largest part of the business by volume remains in the Canadian market as opposed to the U.S. You're right, there's been some growth in the U.S. market. Fundamentally, the issue that caused the losses was the completely outsized move in the convertibles and some of the other markets where the fund had some positions, and that caused the NAV of the fund to drop significantly.</p>
          <p>So, the &#x2013; yeah, what we have done since is obviously go back and look at the operational controls to ensure that we are on top of any that exhibit any similar moves. But at this point, we're comfortable that the controls will keep us on-side. And as I said in my comments, the business has been downsized, and we are basically operating at a reduced level while we're in this market condition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks, Morten.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Brad Smith from Blackmont Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I have quick questions. First one, just dealing with the impaired loan trends. I think I heard earlier we were talking about the unsecured portfolios in Canada, but I was just observing it in the price in the supp pack on Page 26, the residential mortgage impairments are climbing. I think they were up about 23% 93 million in Canada. I was wondering if you could provide us with some discussion as to what's happening there. And then, Gordon, a question for you, with government interventions briefing in the U.S., just wondering if you could give us some sense for how you view that opposite your U.S. growth strategy. Maybe give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of acquisitions like Lyon Changes? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Morten. I'll start with a couple of comments on the impaired loans growth.  So you're right that we have seen a noticeable increase in the impairments in the Canadian residential mortgage portfolio. I mean, what this reflects is the difficult market in Canada for residential real estate, where prices are off somewhat. I would note that the &#x2013; with the loan-to-value levels that our mortgage business is underwritten on, what the impact of this is -- and in my view will continue to be -- is that we will just see some increase in impairment. If you go and look at the level of provisioning that's required for the residential portfolio, it has remained stable through Q1. And given the health of that mortgage portfolio, I don't see any change in that dynamic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So, in other words, you see recoverables being remaining strong, so you don't need to provide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. And I think the underlying dynamic will be that relative to the recent years' quarters, the length of time that we've had to basically turn over properties that go -- where the mortgage goes into default might lengthen somewhat. But our ability to recover well within our mortgage levels, loan levels, is, remains very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Competitors have said that deterioration, and most of it was in the insured mortgage, same situation for others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, number one, with the &#x2013; it's in a sense, not that surprising that the insured is seeing a sharper run-up in that the insured is where you have a higher loan-to-value ratio where the numbers over 85% ends up being off of our books. So the -- that it's not surprising that borrowers in that segment might have on average a slightly higher problem rate. But if you're looking at it from a loss and recovery standpoint from RBC, the dynamic is actually very strong.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, to answer the second question, the environment in the U.S. continues to be tremendously uncertain. As I've said in the past, there's uncertainty with respect to balance sheet, if one were to do anything in the acquisition front. But even more so, the uncertainty with respect to TARP, the government intervention, how the whole environment is going to unfold puts us in a position where we're watching with interest, but with tremendous caution, the overall U.S. marketplace.</p>
          <p>So there is &#x2013; we're following it closely. We are certainly following the activities and staying in touch and on top of what the various regulators are doing in the United States. But I would say it is clearly an environment of uncertainty. And I do not think it's prudent to try to attempt to do anything when there is such a high degree of uncertainty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you agree with those that do the intervention <mark type="audio gap" /> U.S. banks, as hurt positions to consolidate the better prospects in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. You cut out half way through, Brad. Can you just repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I was just wondering if you would agree with those that view the interventions as putting U.S. banks in a better position to consolidate the more attractive candidates going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is &#x2013; it's very difficult to know because the rules are so unclear. I think that there is no question that a lot of integration and consolidation in the United States will be done with significant involvement from the regulators, whether it's FDIC or the Fed or the Treasury. And so, the answer to your question is likely, yes. But it's very difficult to tell in today's environment because there's been so little activity, and there's so little clarity in terms of how it is all going to unfold going forward.</p>
          <p>As I said, I think it was on the last conference call, I do think that there will be significant opportunities over the next couple of years, in all sectors, not just banking, in the United States. And -- but I don't believe there's any hurry in a marketplace like this with such a high degree of uncertainty where capital is such a scarce resource, to try to catch a falling knife as I described it.  So until there's a higher degree of clarity and certainty and things start to evolve, you're going to continue to see us operate with a high degree of caution</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Two questions related . So first, the hedges MBIA, can you help us understand the deterioration of the CDOs? That would help us understand and we'll hope what might happen .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, could you pick up your phone, you're cutting out. I think you might be on a conference phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was asking about the MBIA hedges on Page Seven of the report to shareholders. What is the rough duration of these assets? And then I have another one while you look for that, which is related to Page Eight, specifically the equity. If there's an unrealized loss position of 658 million, how does the impairment process work for equities in that roll? I understand how it works with debt, but how about for equities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, its Janice speaking. I'll answer your question about the impairment process on equities first. The equities in our available-for-sale portfolio are mainly Canadian banks, and the reason we have that portfolio is to hedge our stock-based compensation expense. What the -- when we look at the impairments and test for potential impairments with respect to equities &#x2013; and I think that we put a lot of detail in the MD&amp;A about our process -- we look at the underlying earnings power and earnings quality of the banks that we're invested in. We look at the past stock history in -- with respect to longer term over the cycle in assessment of those particular impairments.</p>
          <p>So, it is a judgment, but we look at it from the perspective of the fact that a) it's a long-term investment. We intend to hold it for the long-term and therefore, we need to look at the investment across many cycles. And b) from our other perspective, is that those securities are being used to hedge our comp plans, so in essence from an expense perspective, although there's timing differences, it's somewhat of an offset. They're not investments just to earn income on them. And Morten, I'll turn it over to you for the MBIA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick, Janice, so the price of the security or how long it will remain at a certain price it is not an important item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We also look at the aging of the securities and the price fluctuations and how long they've been underwater or above water, those sorts of things there.  There is quite an extensive process and already we know that in U.S. GAAP, there -it is more disciplined around that particular process. And so when we're looking at reporting on US GAAP, we're also going to be reviewing that from a U.S. GAAP perspective, because there are more stringent rules-based approaches to generate our equities portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, its Morten Friis. I'll try to take a stab at the question you've left us with here. In terms of the MBIA hedges and the underlying CDOs et cetera there, I think the thing I would focus on is not so much the maturity of the underlying assets as the timing of defaults and payouts from MBIA as the assets show losses. So the -if you look at the portfolios that we hold, we will see defaults generating claims and payments starting as early as later this year. And so in terms of the MBIA hedges, I think that is where we should focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Can I just make a request? We recognize that the telephone system at the hotel we're at is not quite as effective as we are used to. So, we apologize for -I know there are some challenges with respect to the quality of the system. But it would be very useful if analysts asking questions would pick up their phones, because it's a lot easier for us to hear if people speak directly into the phone rather than a speaker phone.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Michael Goldberg from Desjardins. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can hear you well, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Can you explain why your gross formations, shown on Page 27 of your supp pack are up to $2.6 billion, it is, primarily on the wholesale side. And then you've got the &#x2013; offsetting that -- about $1.5 billion of cured sales and repayments, again, elevated on the wholesale side. Can you explain what went in and what went out, amounts, what it's related to and was there a direct offset between the two numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Morten Friis. The large swing here relates to the prime brokerage accounts that I referenced in my comments at the outset. So you will see that there is -- and as I explained, it ended up not affecting the impaired balance at quarter-end. But as the loan became impaired, you would see it then on the formations here flowing through the total impaireds and being offset by an equal movement out. So, the -- in terms of the wholesale impaireds and the formations, that one account caused a set of numbers that is significantly different from previous quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it was an equal move in both the gross formations and the cured  sales and repayment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So in effect what was done was that the loan went impaired, we took a provision. We took over the assets, so that the assets are now managed as part of the RBC portfolios within our trading businesses because the loan had defaulted. So the loop --it ends up moving into impaireds and then out of the impaired loans, because the assets are now RBC assets where we manage the underlying portfolios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, just for clarity, can you tell us how much of the -- how much is included? What's the number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the number -which number are you referring to? I mean, you see, when you see the large formation and what moves out, the majority of that number, both in terms of formation and movement out, you see there you could figure out how it balances off, is represented by the prime brokerage account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I understand that, but what I'm wondering is what that amount is.  In other words, I'd like to know what the gross formation would be excluding that prime brokerage account?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're not providing that level of detail. But you can get fairly close by just &#x2013; you will get a pretty good idea when you look at the total numbers here between the various pieces on the supplementals. I think it's &#x2013; let me put it this way, the level of formation outside of this account is not off side what we've had in previous quarters. It's consistent with the trend you see in the rest of the portfolios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Let's move on to the next question, Michael, and we'll take this offline. Because we can walk you through this off, in IR.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you &#x2013; okay, my other question is could you give us some idea of how much revenue you generate from prop trading, excluding facilitation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, the bulk of our trading activities are with clients and counterparties. And specifically when you look at trading revenues, we really don't split them that way because we're a client-led business, and so we look at the trading revenues on both sides. So we don't look at our trading revenues using that lense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think Michael the &#x2013; I know, I remember Chuck Winograd has tried to answer this question a bunch of times and it's very difficult to separate out client when you're in a flow business trading &#x2013; customer versus proprietary trading when you're taking positions. But as Janice says, most of our businesses are customer-based businesses. If you're asking what businesses are specifically prop trading, I'll turn it over to Mark, but I think it's primarily our GAT business would be viewed as a prop trading business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael. It's Mark Standish. I think, to give you a sense of the balance just going back to Morten's comments, that we had in the quarter, only 6 trading days of net losses and two of those were month-end valuation. I mean, that really points to the significant diversification that we have in our trading businesses, both in terms of the nature of the books but also in terms of the geography. And as you can see, given the volatility that we've seen in the quarter, we are running a very disciplined, very diverse business on the trading side. And as Gord said, it's very heavily focused on clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, couple of really quick questions. First, Gord, can you highlight, or give us some rationale for the DRIP plan and why some activities were moved into the DRIP plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Barb, actually, to answer that question, who's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Darko. It was simply that it's easy to do. We think there's a demand there, that being able to issue shares from treasury to augment capital ratios in an environment where there's a huge focus on capital was an easy fix and we think our shareholders will take advantage of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much do you expect to generate in terms of capital from this switch? What would be your rough estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the -if we a have take-up, looking at some historical information, 20 to 30% of our shareholders may choose to take advantage of this, so 20 to 30% of our dividends that would be paid in a particular quarter. Over time, it's going to take a while because people are going to have to go through the process of making the amendments to how they receive their dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks. That's helpful. And one last question, if I can sneak one in here, on the write-downs with respect to in the credit default swaps and the correlation book. Can you walk me through why the write-down was the size that it was? And given that you've segmented this business, can we expect to see more of this in future quarters? And can you give me a handle on how I could go about tracking that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is Morten. I'll start with the final piece. I think, as I said in my comment, we've done significant risk reduction trades. This has &#x2013; so we've taken most of the risks in the correlation book off the table so that -to eliminate as much as possible future volatility from this source. I would note though that there is -some piece of the book remains. So we obviously have a risk of some volatility there, but it's significantly reduced from what it was. And the size of the write-down really is a reflection of our desire to move as much of that volatility off as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what's the size of the book and can you give us sort of the right --can you outline that for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the size at my finger tip. So we'll have to get back to you with a little bit more background through IR after the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do we have &#x2013; I mean you can see in there that we've got the notionals, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, just to reinforce Morten's comments, because they are important.  I mean, the reason we did that this quarter is we made the decision to &#x2013; to the extent, to get out &#x2013; to move out of this business. So it's -this was an intended step to basically exit to a large degree the correlation trading business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And -it's Mark Standish, Darko. To add to Gord's comment, we've been very aggressive at exiting this and other businesses because the opportunities elsewhere in the business to generate revenues with our capital is just so great right now that we've been very focused and very aggressive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure the funny accent's going to help with the hearing too well here.  Gord, your opening comments were very interesting. You talked about something that has been a problem and that is that mark-to-market is creating such tremendous volatility in reported earnings.  When I look at your earnings this quarter, I mean do you think that mark-to-market accounting helped your earnings or do you think it hurt your earnings s this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it hurt our earnings significantly because most of the write-downs that we have taken with respect to the adjustments, the roughly $1.3 billion, are all related to mark-to-market accounting. I think that the &#x2013; as I said in my comments, ultimately there will be convergence. But it creates a tremendous amount of volatility relative to the way banks have traditionally reported, if you go back to previous cycles. Like if you do a comparison between 91, 92 as an example, when banks were in -- in Canada at least were in a lot worse shape than they are through this cycle, the accounting impacts are dramatic and dramatically to the negative in the current environment, because you're marking to very, very illiquid levels.</p>
          <p>And the reason that we highlighted, in Janice's comment et cetera, the MBIA example is because, there's sort of three -- there's various outcomes with respect to that. One of course is which everything is -it paid out. Another is that they don't payout generally and then you've got the mark-to-market and then you've got your realized value, or expected realization, and they're very different numbers. And you're marking to a credit default swap which is a market-determined, with a higher degree of illiquidity and it pushes institutions to the lowest level to some degree because of what has happened in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So I don't want to become a pundit on accounting policy and accounting rules, but there is no question that it has created unintended consequences and you are taking marks, in theory on assets where there will be realized values. Now, you know things could get a lot worse and those marks could get worse and the realized values could get lower. But at any point in time, you're marking to levels which generally are below potential realized values and that's an issue. I think from -- in terms of comparisons. One of the points we've tried to make is what we have done is tried to use the most conservative approach, which means we are using, as opposed to internal models, we are using observable market inputs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Gord, to the same extent, you without -- your trading, I mean your rules with respect to marking are applied to everything, whether it's these books or your regular trading books. So if I remove these, you had 1.7 billion in trading revenues, which presumably you could make the same point on, that you had realized gains from blowout in credit default swaps which may not actually translate into gains down the road. Isn't that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think there &#x2013; that would be fairly small. I mean there'd be some truth to that and again, I think we've always been very clear that if you look at capital markets'' trading revenues, there's no question that there is some benefit that we are getting, or the marketplace is getting, as a result of the volatility and the -that is occurring in the marketplace. But if you look at our trading revenues, they tend to be well-diversified across various books, fixed income, foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives, equities, GAT, et cetera.  So it's a -- I think to some degree you're comparing apples and oranges, although there is some value to the trading businesses, given the high degree of volatility and some of this, the margin increases that has come from the illiquidity.</p>

          <p>Ian, it's Doug McGregor. I think the other issue that we have discussed in these calls is that on CDS, I mean we use CDS to hedge our loan portfolio primarily and the gains &#x2013; the CDS gains in the quarter were not significant and it's not a book. We don't trade CDS for the sake of trading CDS. And I think in terms of the trading numbers -as Mark has said and as Gord has said -the trading environment, the spreads in the trading environment, the fact that many counter parties in Europe, in the U.S. and in Canada that were active a year ago aren't active now has really allowed us to take market share in our flow trading businesses, and they're producing very well.</p>

          <p>We're doing business with customers that we've never dealt with before because we have the liquidity and balance sheet and given what has happened in the marketplace. And that's one of the opportunities that I think has sprung from the turmoil in the current marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I've heard you've put things like your muni bond business, I've heard you may end up being one of the last men standing in a business that is going to be a business long-term. Does that mean that your trading revenues on a quarterly basis, we should assume are now are going to exceed $1 billion a quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know we won't answer that question. But as we've said all along, from a strategic perspective, this is not a business that we're abandoning. We actually have been shrinking our risk adjusted asset in this business. We've had headwinds of currency, because 62% of the assets, I think it is in that business, are U.S. dollar based. But we have been reducing -- attempting to reduce our risk adjusted assets for obvious reasons, but this is a business that we are going to continue to invest in. So the answer is yes. We do like our prospects in businesses like the muni business and others, given the change in landscape, because I think coming out of this, I think it will be a business in which margins have expanded and as long as we operate with a high degree of prudence from a risk management perspective. And on that front as you know, we've learned some lessons over the last year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca from Genuity Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Following along from that question, as retail slows a little bit because of higher PCLs or maybe slower revenue growth, loan growth throughout this year -and let's assume for a moment that maybe Royal can generate a $1 billion plus this quarter, maybe 1.7, 1.8. If the bank can generate that kind of trading revenue going forward, what do you envision the change in mix to be for the bank in terms of retail versus wholesale earnings? Do you see, at least for a period of time perhaps a couple of years while you benefit from this, the bank shifting aggressively toward wholesale earnings from the retail business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think that we have been very, very disciplined to try to maintain the appropriate ratio and our stated strategic objective is 75% retail or retail-related, which of course includes insurance and wealth management and other businesses, and 25% wholesale.  What I've always said is there's a wholesale range and it will be slightly higher than that range during a good part of a wholesale cycle and slightly lower than that range during a weaker part of the wholesale cycle and 20 to 30 is roughly the range that we have used in the past.</p>
          <p>And going forward, we want to maintain that. We may -- it may -- from an earnings perspective, I mean it'd be nice if it trended up, because that would be a good thing. But in terms of strategically managing the business, we are going to remain very disciplined on that front, because we think it's a model that the market is going to accept as being an appropriate level because margins will be good in the wholesale side of the sector.</p>
          <p>But to the extent that people are overweighted in that sector, there will be a -- I think a valuation issue. There will be a risk perspective. So we're going to remain very disciplined on that front. So could earnings creep up? I would love to see it happen, because as I say, that would be a positive.  But in terms of managing the business, we want to remain 75% strategically in banking, insurance, wealth management, and less volatile businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would I be right in suggesting that for this quarter adjusting for everything that the bank has highlighted as an item of note, that that capital markets business was something like 40 maybe 45% of total bank earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the straight math.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the straight math.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean with all the adjustments, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it could happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We wouldn't expect the banking earnings in the United States, for instance, to be as negative for an extended period of time. So you can look at it at any point in time. If you'd looked at it a couple of quarters ago, you would have had much, much lower number. So I think it's a little bit risky to look at it on a specific quarterly basis, because as I say, some of the weaker earnings and areas, like US banking and even an area like wealth management, where earnings continue to be solid, but clearly are down dramatically because of what has happened in the equity market. So I think as those businesses come back, you'll see more of a reversion to the north.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sort of related question, again if you go through the exercise of reversing all the adjustments to bank, highlights as items of note, salaries and employee benefits this quarter, it was a large number. $2.6 billion is what I'm coming up with and that's up maybe -- that's up 600, 650 million from last year and up maybe $500 million quarter-over-quarter. And I guess, what I am struggling with is, I understand that on a cleaned-up basis, an adjusted basis, the bank's revenue was up in a huge way and that might explain why the variable comp would be up. But ultimately, what shareholders got was the reported number, not the adjusted number. So, why is it that salaries and benefits would be up so significantly because of this higher trading revenue, when ultimately the bank didn't really earn that, because there was a loss there that we're excluding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can tell you on the losses, we are one the few investment banks in the world that actually has a bonus pool based on earnings not off revenues. So there is no correlation between the revenue growth and the &#x2013; in other words, the capital market's bonus pool, if that's what you're talking about, is not up, because it impacted by earnings not revenue. So I don't know, Janice, if you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe the question is -- maybe you could just answer on a quarter-over-quarter basis, salaries and employee benefits, 2.6 billion, up 22% and up 32% year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That in US currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Some of it is US currency and then some of it does have to with the fact that we have a top-line bonus pool on the trading books. And so you will see shifting of that in and out until we get to the end of the year. The way we account for that expense is, we like to accrue it as current expense in the quarters and then we adjust it as we're going through the year to reflect the longer-term performance. So -- and it is a lot of the expense is U.S. dollar-based, so there is that ramp-up.</p>
          <p>So if you look at our total expenses, that there is that bump in variable comp. If you look at the rest of the expenses, our expenses outside of variable comp have actually going down about 7% quarter-over-quarter. So, we are maintaining that cost discipline. The variable costs, we -- in trading businesses is more like a cost of goods sold and a top-line pool as opposed to a profit sharing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It just seems to me like the shareholders are eating the losses, but the capital markets people continue to get awarded. It feels like that just by looking at these results, but that's more a comment than a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's just not -- that is just not correct, because that's not how the pools work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Ian, this is Doug McGregor.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's going on is that Janice's explanation is correct. What we have is a revenue -- and a NIAD-based bonus pool. And the accrual you're seeing, the portion of it that's relevant to the capital markets business, is formulaic. And I think probably the good news is that we have accrued a good amount of bonus this quarter. As we get to the end of the year, we'll see where the bonus pool is and we'll allocate it amongst the businesses accordingly. So, what's driving that accrual is just the top-line, in portion, is the top-line revenues from those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, and it's important that I reiterate this, because I think it is a real source of differentiation in how we run our business compared to what you have seen elsewhere. If you look at our capital market bonus pool last year, it was down pretty proportional with their earnings reduction. In other words, it's driven by bottom-line earnings. The bonus pool was down, I think it was 30% roughly, and earnings were down roughly 30%. And that is very unusual. And I think it's a trend, frankly that the whole industry will move towards for precisely the reason you're mentioning, which is that if you're paying bonuses off revenues, then you can have results that you've had in markets like the United States that you read about everyday where you have bonus pools being paid out when revenues were there that earnings weren't. If we don't have earnings, we don't have bonus pools.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess I better make it a good one. Gord, you mentioned staying very cautious on the acquisition front, in USP&amp;C. Is it also the case for organic capital deployment in that business or can you make loans at a better spread with little risk and so you're happy to pick up the slack from competitors that may be pulling back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going let Jim Westlake answer it. It is a good question and there is a lot of attention to be paying. I would say a macro perspective, capital allocation internally across our businesses is priority #1. I mean, I think that is the biggest area that we should be focusing on in terms of creating the value for our shareholders, what businesses we allocate capital and where the returns are most attractive, and where we can deploy it most effectively. And that's forcing us to make decisions like getting out of the correlation trading book and moving capital into other areas where we think there are returns. And I would say within US banking, they are going through that exercise very much internally as well. So I'll let Jim speak specifically to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Gord. And I think that when you look at the US, we are definitely seeing a lot of opportunities. And so, where it makes sense and where we can make money particularly on the lending side, there has been a lot of consolidation in the southeast market. We're in the heart of what was Wachovia country and so, we are seeing lots of those. Very tight on the deposit side, but great opportunities in lending.</p>

But I would like to thank everyone once again for their participation and for joining us on this call and we look forward to presenting at our next quarterly results. Thank you very much.</p>
