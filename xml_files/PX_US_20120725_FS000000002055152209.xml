          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter Praxair Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie, and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Jim and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results and outlook. We'll then be available to answer questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide three for our consolidated second quarter results. A first glance at this slide reveals that sales and earnings growth were subdued and fell short of our long-term objectives. But I want to emphasize that our results were significantly constrained by negative currency translation, lower pass-through of natural gas price in hydrogen sales, and deteriorating manufacturing conditions in Europe and Brazil.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we had fantastic results in North America, which we expect will continue, and when Brazil and Europe turnaround we will be back on our historic trajectory of double digit earnings growth. We've taken restructure actions in Brazil and are evaluating additional actions across Europe and in Surface Technologies' European plants, which serve the manufacturing sector. These steps will ensure better results in these weak spots without waiting for a rising tide of economic conditions.</p>
          <p>There is a chart on page 11 I would like to refer you to in the appendix of the teleconference slide deck, which shows the volatility of our six major overseas currencies and also why we are lowering our guidance for the remainder of the year by about 3%. Year-over-year, as of June, the Brazilian real has fallen 22%, the euro 11%, the Mexican peso 16%, the Canadian dollar 4%, and the Indian rupee 19%, and the Korean won 8%.</p>
          <p>Our year-over-year sales declined 2% to $2.8 billion, but excluding a 6% negative currency impact and a 2% impact from lower gas pass-through of natural gas, sales would have grown 6%. More importantly, operating profit, ex-currency, was up about 9%, and EPS about 11%, demonstrating that we are still getting leverage down the income statement through productivity and strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>In fact, operating cash flow was a record $725 million, representing more than 25% of our sales. Our debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 53% and debt to EBITDA was 1.9 times. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $164 million and repurchased stock of $104 million, net of issuances.</p>
          <p>$1.3 billion remains available under the share repurchase program authorized in January of this year. After-tax return on capital for the quarter is 14.2% and reflects the large amount of projects under construction and therefore a significant amount of project capital on our balance sheet not yet completed. Return on equity increased to 29.7%.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to slide four for our updated earnings guidance. For the third quarter, we see a continuation of similar business trends sequentially and are issuing earnings guidance in the range of $1.35 to $1.40. This guidance reflects the assumption of an additional $0.03 of currency headwind sequentially from the second quarter as the major currency swings occurred in late April.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, our third quarter earnings expectation reflects negative currency translation impact of about $0.12 per share. As such, for the full year, we've lowered our earnings guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 or about $0.15 to $0.20 from the prior guidance. The majority of the reduction, or about two-thirds, relates to negative currency translation impact based on current exchange rates. Additionally, volumes everywhere outside of North America are falling short of expectations and we're not anticipating macroeconomic conditions to improve in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our long-term growth outlook remains strong and we're maintaining our capital spending forecast of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion against a backlog of $2.5 billion of projects under construction with committed customer contracts. As these projects start up over the next two to three years, they will contribute significantly to sales and earnings growth.</p>
          <p>The backlog remains strong at $2.5 billion and reflects five plant startups during the quarter, as well as signings of four new plants under construction for long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>The level of new business activity remains healthy overall. We've seen some recent slowdown in proposal activity in Brazil, but have also seen acceleration in proposal activity in North America. So on balance, it remains about the same. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver the expected 4% to 6% top line growth from new projects, and the backlog of projects currently extends that framework through 2015.</p>
          <p>And now I will let Kelcey explain in more detail our second quarter results by segment, including recent project signings and startups.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Please turn to page five for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 2% above the prior year quarter. Underlying sales grew 6% from 4% higher volume and 2% higher pricing. The effects of cost pass-through, primarily lower cost natural gas which is contractually passed on to hydrogen customers, reduced sales by 4%. Negative currency translation from Mexico and Canada reduced sales by 2%.</p>
          <p>Underlying energy market sales in North America were very strong and grew 21% year-over-year. The most significant driver was our on-site supply systems to Gulf Coast refineries. Gulf Coast refinery distillates production is growing, and customer margins are improving as customers benefit from lower hydrogen prices, which are tied to the price of natural gas. We also continued to deliver strong spot sales out of our Gulf Coast Hydrogen Storage Cavern to meet customer needs.</p>
          <p>Our oil well service business in Mexico continues to run at very high levels and delivered strong volume growth in Mexico. This business primarily provides liquid nitrogen and pressure pumping services to the oil and gas sector. Sequential energy sales were steady, with the growth in the United States and Mexico moderated by the typical second quarter seasonal slowdown in fracking for natural gas liquids and oil in the Alberta region of Canada during the spring thaw.</p>
          <p>Underlying manufacturing sales grew 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, with growth in all three countries, United States, Canada, and Mexico. Packaged gas sales remain robust, in-line with manufacturing strengths. In PDI, same-store sales, which excludes currency and acquisitions, were 9% above last year. Gases were up 8% and hard goods were up 10%.</p>
          <p>Packaged gas primarily serves the manufacturing market, but sales were also strong year-over-year to metal fabrication and sequentially strong as well to chemicals and refining. Underlying sales growth to metals customers was solid at 3% year-over-year. This was due to strong liquid argon sales for stainless steel and metal fabrication, as well as oxygen sales in our pipelines in the Northern United States to steel mills.</p>
          <p>The underlying fundamentals of most North America end markets are good. Underlying on site sales grew 8% year-over-year and sales for merchant volumes grew 2% year-over-year with liquid hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon growth partially offset by weaknesses in CO2 from reduced dry gas fracking.</p>
          <p>North America operating profit was $363 million, 11% above the prior year quarter. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, the operating profit would have grown 14% from the prior year quarter. The operating margin was a very strong 26.1%, reflecting volume growth, higher pricing, and productivity, which more than offset cost increases and the negative impact of currency translation. Lower cost pass-through, which reduced sales with minimal impact on operating profit, contributed 1% to the operating margin in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The pipeline of activity for potential further packaged gas acquisitions remains strong. During the quarter, we made packaged gas acquisitions in Orange, California and Tonawanda, New York. We also acquired Canadian Cylinder and Gases, an independent distributor of industrial and specialty gases and welding equipment, located in Prince George, British Columbia. This will enhance our ability to serve current and future customers in this high-growth region of Canada.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we expanded our the packaged gas presence in the northeast region of the United States to supply industrial and specialty gases, as well as hard goods, to meet growing demand. This new location serves the Boston, Hartford, and Providence markets.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we started up oxygen supply to Fondiaria, a producer of steel billets for the construction industry in North Central Mexico. The plant, with a capacity of 120 tons per day, will increase Fondiaria's productivity and its production and help Fondiaria meet its energy efficiency and environmental requirements. The new facility also increases our production and supply capacity in the region.</p>
          <p>Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America is increasing, and we are seeing strong activity in energy, chemicals, manufacturing and metals markets. Earlier this week, we announced the signing of a long-term contract to supply Vale, a leading international mining company, with oxygen for a new nickel processing facility being built in Canada. Praxair will build, own and operate an energy efficient cryogenic air separation unit with a capacity of approximately 400 tons per day, which is expected to start up in mid-2013.</p>
          <p>This project is a good example of how our products help our customers improve the environment. Vale will utilize the oxygen to remove sulfur and iron from the nickel. The process will enable Vale to process the nickel ore concentrate directly into finished metals without having to smelt it first, avoiding sulfur dioxide and dust emissions. Nickel is used to produce stainless steel and other alloys and used in various industries, including aircraft.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page six for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe increased 3% for the second quarter versus 2011. The sales increase was due to the acquisition last year of an increased ownership interest in Yara Praxair, located in Scandinavia, which is now consolidated. Underlying sales were comparable to the prior year, as 2% higher pricing offset lower volume. The weaker euro reduced sales by 9%.</p>
          <p>Price actions in the region are sticking and we are gaining traction across all countries in Europe. Just as we do with any price action in any region around the world, we'll review margin contribution of individual customer accounts and we'll continue to drive price increases in the region.</p>
          <p>Packaged gas volumes declined 5% year-over-year in Spain, Italy, and Germany. This reflects weakness in the metal fabrication and manufacturing markets, which are significant contributors to the lower industrial economic activity versus a year ago. Sequentially, volumes continue to decline in Southern Europe, particularly Spain.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of $68 million was 6% below the prior year. Excluding acquisitions and currency, underlying operating profit decreased 9%, primarily driven by lower volumes partially offset by productivity and cost savings resulting from our fourth quarter 2011 restructure.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are currently assessing further fixed cost actions to be taken in Europe to ensure we are rightsizing the cost structure of the business to reflect expected longer term slower growth in the region, especially Southern Europe. We are on track to start up two of our four plants currently under construction in Russia later this year. These two plants will serve the chemical and glass industry. New project proposal activity is growing in Russia and Scandinavia, including the metals, energy, and manufacturing markets.</p>
          <p>Page seven shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $520 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter. Underlying sales grew 1% for the quarter, primarily due to improved pricing, partially offset by lower volumes. Negative currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 16% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Higher volumes from new on-site production facilities were more than offset by lower volumes to merchant and packaged gas customers, largely attributable to the lower industrial production rates in Brazil.</p>
          <p>By end market, year-over-year sales increased to metals, healthcare, and energy customers, and were lower to manufacturing and chemical customers. Sequentially, underlying sales were steady for the quarter, with higher pricing offset by lower volumes. Negative currency impact reduced sales by 8% in the second quarter versus the first.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in South America was $110 million, 21% below the prior quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation impacts. Ex-currency, operating profit was comparable to the prior year, as higher pricing offset cost increases primarily related to power, distribution, and cost inflation.</p>
          <p>In South America, Brazil has just experienced the third consecutive quarter of negative industrial production. In addition, June was our lowest volume month of the quarter, indicating volatility with little sign of near-term improvement.</p>
          <p>Current Brazil Central Bank consensus industrial production for the year is now zero, which implies an industrial production rate of about 2.4% for the second half of the year. We remain bullish on Brazil in the medium to long-term, given the strong growth fundamentals in place and its emerging economy, as it continues to transition from an export driven economy to a more local consumption driven market with a growing middle class.</p>
          <p>In addition, there's a quite a bit of pent-up demand for infrastructure build out in front of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. The government has pulled several stimulus levers quickly to stimulate demand, including lowering the interest rates, lowering consumption taxes, and currency intervention. However, given the general global macro-uncertainty with the European debt crisis and the slower growth environment in China, the stimulus measures are not working as quickly as they historically have.</p>
          <p>As such, during the second quarter we took action to reduce costs in South America, primarily head count reductions, and we'll realize the benefits in the second half of this year. South America currently has eight projects in the backlog across four countries, which include Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay in diverse industries such as metals, chemicals and manufacturing. These projects are scheduled to start up between the third quarter of this year and the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we started an on-site plant to serve a metals customer in S&#xE3;o Paulo state. This location will also supply the surrounding area with merchant product including liquid argon.</p>
          <p>We also started an air separation plant in Colombia during the quarter to supply Gerdau, one of the largest suppliers of specialty steel in the world. The plant will also produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon to the local market in segments such as oil and gas, manufacturing, chemicals, food and beverage, and medical. Praxair has production facilities located in all regions of the country, which ensures supply reliability throughout Columbia.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide eight for our results in Asia. Sales of $348 million were comparable to the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 3% came primarily from higher on-site sales in China, India, and Korea, including new plant startups from metals and chemicals customers. Overall growth was negatively impacted by lower sales to electronics customers in Asia, due to lower demand from semiconductor, flat-panel display, and solar customers. Electronics sales were 3% below prior year.</p>
          <p>Lower merchant and packaged gas pricing, primarily due to the electronics end market, reduced sales by 1% from the prior year quarter. We expect this challenging price environment to continue in the near term, as long as electronics volumes remain weak.</p>
          <p>Asia's operating profit grew 8% from the prior year quarter and included a gain on land sale. Lower price decreased operating profit, as did currency. During the quarter, we started up two plants for customers under long-term take or pay contracts, both located in China. Praxair China started up a new air separation plant in Nanjing for Meishan Iron and Steel, a subsidiary of Baosteel. The plant has a capacity of 1,700 tons per day and supplies oxygen, nitrogen, and argon to support Meishan Steel's growing demand, as well as deliver added value in energy efficiency, product quality, and process safety.</p>
          <p>This plant nearly doubles the existing oxygen production capacity serving Meishan Steel. We've been supplying industrial gases to Meishan Steel for over a decade, and have already built a number of air separation plants for them in Nanjing.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we also started up a large single-train 3,000 tons per day air separation plant in Wuwei, 100 kilometers from Nanjing, to supply oxygen, nitrogen, and clean air to the Anhui Wuwei coal based chemicals project.</p>
          <p>This is another example of Praxair China's demonstrated capability to supply oxygen to coal gasification units which provide feedstock to the chemical industry. About 40% or $1 billion of our backlog is for long-term customer projects in China, India, and Korea that will start up between this quarter and early 2015. New project activity for the region remains robust.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we announced the signing of a long-term supply contract with Yankon Group to supply industrial gases to its coal gasification process for the production of methanol and downstream chemicals at its chemical park in Northern China.</p>
          <p>Praxair will construct a large air separation plant with a capacity of 3,000 tons of oxygen per day. The new plant is scheduled to start up in early 2015 and will replace Yankon's existing air separation unit. The liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon produced will be integrated with Praxair China's liquid productions and distribution network in the region.</p>
          <p>Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page nine. Surface Technologies' sales for the quarter were $168 million and comparable to the prior year. Underlying sales increased 4% driven by higher volumes and pricing. Sales increase came from higher aerospace coatings and increased coatings from energy markets, primarily oil and gas.</p>
          <p>Currency negatively impacted sales by 4% due primarily to the weakening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar. Operating profit remained unchanged for the quarter at $27 million. Higher volumes and leverage from improved pricing increased operating profit. These benefits were offset in the quarter by currency translation impacts and cost increases, primarily related to employee wages and benefit costs and general inflation.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&amp;A. Please try to limit yourself to one question and if needed a quick follow-up for clarification. That way more people can get a chance to ask a question.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I was just wondering if, in your North American business, you can kind of talk about what the monthly trends were throughout the quarter and maybe into July? And then do you think that your customer base will be impacted by the strengthening dollar and maybe some other competitiveness goes away so that could actually be a headwind for them going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take the first part of that. We haven't seen any sequential slowdown on a month-to-month basis, moving all the way back to first quarter through July, everything is continuing to be strong and growing. We've had fantastic growth in the manufacturing sector, that may slow down a bit, but we haven't seen that yet. And so in terms of competitiveness, I think that the strong dollar has been basically caused by the fact that the U.S. economy's doing so much better than any other economy in the world, but I don't think it's at a point where it impacts the competitiveness of our customers as a whole. And secondly, I think the benefit of lower natural gas prices is helping our customers, certainly more than any impact from the currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And then just on the Asia business, maybe I missed it. What was the gain on sale of land that you said was included in that profit? How big was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we have about seven plants selling liquid nitrogen &#x2013; high purity nitrogen to Samsung, and the Korean government's putting a major highway project right through that area and is asking us to move our plant and buying the land through the process. So we had a land sale gain worth roughly $0.03 a share in Asia's segment operating profit. But on an overall basis, that was pretty much offset by restructuring costs that we took, particularly in South America segment. So on a segment basis, on a year-over-year, Asia's probably $10 million higher than it should be and South America's probably $10 million lower than it should be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Could you just discuss a little bit more &#x2013; you talked about there's been stimulus in Brazil and I guess there's also obviously been a lot of stimulus in China. And could you just sort of talk about both markets in terms of, does Brazil need more stimulus or does it need more time? Then also, what effects, if any, are you seeing from the initial stimulus in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, let me start out with Brazil. Industrial production has been declining in Brazil, beginning last August, so it's pretty much almost a year now. And that's a combination of several things. It started out to some extent being a result of what was the &#x2013; the very weak &#x2013; very strong Brazilian real, that was making exports from Brazil less competitive, but now that it's devalued by 23%, that should reverse itself.</p>
          <p>Another bottleneck in the Brazil industrial economy is the availability of skilled labor. And I think that really what's happening is, there's so much construction activity with Petrobras, with the World Cup and everything else going on, that there's been shortage of skilled production &#x2013; construction labor, manufacturing labor, production labor, which has really bottlenecked the economy and caused inflation. So about a year ago, the Brazilian Fed increased interest rates pretty significantly to try to stop inflation. They've now lowered interest rates significantly and they're doing some other policy moves in terms of number one, keeping the exchange rate weaker and then number two, certain taxes on imported items and so forth. Another thing that's happened in Brazil is that the trade with Argentina has pretty much come to a standstill, based on what's going on in Argentina. So there's a lot of factors there. I think that the long-term secular growth in South America, in Brazil, is certainly intact, but they've got to work their way through some of these issues.</p>
          <p>Now China's a different story. I think it's hard to expect that China's GDP growth would be at 15% a year forever and ever and ever. So now IP growth and GDP growth are somewhere between 5% and 10% and I think on a sequential basis probably lower than that. Then in addition you've got a change over in power and power struggle going on within the ruling party, which remains to be worked out during the rest of 2012. Now that hurt us quite a bit in the quarter just ended, primarily because of slowdown in demand for argon and lower argon prices, and that was caused primarily by a slowdown in the production of photovoltaic. Long run, though, the five-year plan for China embraces the end markets that are growth markets and that's primarily moving to more coal gasification for energy and for production of chemicals and more industrialization in the middle area of the country, which really hasn't grown very much.</p>
          <p>So I think the secular growth is still intact, but we're going through a kind of a down draft that's more of a cyclical nature. And then, I guess while I'm talking about it, I'll just add India to the equation there, because India's in a recession also due to &#x2013; due primarily to sort of government gridlock, and that needs to be worked out as well. But I think the emerging market countries do have &#x2013; probably have a high-multiple of industrial gas demand growth as opposed to GDP growth. Emerging market countries tend to be more focused on construction and manufacturing and less so on services and that's really what drives our growth. So we're still long-term optimistic about that, and we think that we're best positioned of any industrial gas company in the emerging markets overall.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. A couple questions on North America. Can you just outline what your operating rate was in LIN/LOX and you seem to be one of the few people not talking about shortages in helium, so I just wondered if your supply situation is better than others there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So operating rates in North America and then helium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>North America, LIN/LOX, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay. So operating rates in North America are strong, on-site oxygen for the steel industry continues to be strong. Merchant LIN/LOX volumes continue to be strong, although a little bit of a falloff in the second quarter in Canada related to our fracking business, which has a seasonal shut down as the ice melts and the roads are shut down for awhile. So operating rates strong, really across all end markets in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now helium, everybody's talking about helium. Helium really only has about &#x2013; it's a natural resource that's extracted from the ground, most often as a byproduct with natural gas, and there are really only six or seven major sources in the world. One of the things that I think we have done that others have not done is become more backward integrated in production of helium and less dependent on basically the producers of natural gas that when they are producing natural gas, they also produce helium and sell it to the industrial gas companies.</p>
          <p>And some of those natural gas sources have been shut down, creating a squeeze in the availability of helium. So all of our competitors have put customers on allocation, some as low as 50% of their normal need. We hadn't done that until &#x2013; we had to put people on 100% allocation because they were coming to us when they couldn't get supplied by our competitors, so that's caused us to do 100% allocation and then temporarily an 80% allocation.</p>
          <p>So we're in pretty good shape on it, but helium's going to be a scarce commodity. There's a finite amount in the world and we're focused on that. Which leads me to just kind of one other point I want to make, the recent survey done with our customers shows that when asked the question, how do you choose your supplier, more than 70% of respondents say that reliability is the most important factor, with the remaining 30% split between price and technology. So it is important for our customers that we remain a reliable supplier.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks. First off, I was just wondering if you could discuss the competitive landscape in China broadly? It seems that the mature geos around the globe have mostly been sorted out where you have a number one and number two player and that's been determined by competitiveness and then M&amp;A eventually. How do you view the Praxair China strategy, what's your strongest foothold in that country by geo or by industry? And if you can just talk about how you see that playing out over the next 5 to 10 years in terms of the overall landscape competitively in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that really brings up our, what we call our density strategy and &#x2013; because making a high operating profit and a high return on capital in industrial gases really is a function of having good production distribution economics, having a lot of customers close to the plants and also getting byproduct economics between the on-site and the merchant businesses.</p>
          <p>So we have really focused ourselves on four &#x2013; three and then added a fourth region a couple years ago. The Beijing region where we have clusters of plants and clusters of customers, the region from Shanghai to Shenzhen, where we have the same thing, and then south in the kind of Daya Bay region where CNOOC is the big customer. And then we've added the Chongqing region to that two years ago with a coal gasification project and merchant liquids there.</p>
          <p>So we're not going after every project there. There was a recent electronics project, which we really weren't interested in because it was out in the middle of nowhere and we couldn't get synergies with our other customers there. So all four industrial gas companies plus <mark type="ph" /> Yinbee (35:50) are competing in China, but it's a big country, there are a lot of project opportunities and we just have to be selective in terms of the ones that will be most profitable to us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the cost reduction evaluation for Europe, can you talk about what type of things you can do over there to help improve that business near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So I think as most people know, we did some cost reduction back in 2008 when the big recession came. I think we were probably more effective in North America and South America back then and less effective in Brazil because we really didn't want to lose any capacity or ability to meet customers' demand if demand came back up. Now we've sort of concluded that packaged gas business in Spain and Italy probably will never come back to the levels that it was at earlier, in the 2000-2010 decade, because there was a lot of stimulus going on with subsidies for highway construction, railway construction, infrastructure and so forth, which was helping to drive packaged gas sale. So what we're focused on is consolidating plants and geographic areas to fewer plants. That'll be the main thing that we'll be doing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then for North America, PDI continues to hum along there. Did you see any slowing to any degree in the quarter and when you take a look at the second half of the year, do you see that business moderating or keeping at the same pace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the sequential growth rate will continue to be fairly strong, maybe not as strong as it was over the past 12 months. But as we get into the third and fourth quarters, when you look at year-on-year comparables, some of that growth is going to start to lap itself, okay? That doesn't mean anything fundamentally different, but when you look at the numbers, they'll start to lap themselves. But packaged gas demand is strong. One of the things that we're seeing a shift a little bit is that for a long-time hard goods growth was outpacing gas growth, which was indicating of an expanding demand. But hard goods growth is much lower margins to us than gas growth, so it really wasn't the growth we wanted to see. What we did see in the fourth quarter, I mean, in the second quarter, was higher growth in demand for gases, which is really a pretty healthy development.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim. Could we revisit the question on productivity that you touched on earlier, have your triggers for when to do restructurings in each region changed? I'm just trying to parse the thinking behind flagging ahead of time possible restructuring actions in different regions, I mean, you usually don't flag ahead of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, most of the productivity gains year in and year out are not really related to macroeconomic situations, they're related to getting more energy efficiency in the plant, more distribution efficiency and more administrative efficiency. So we continue to drive the normal productivity programs. I would say that there are three points that we were focused on this year, which are partially macroeconomic &#x2013; or really macroeconomically driven. So in South America, you've got wage inflation really accelerating and probably growing faster than we can increase prices. So to maintain your margin, you need to kind of shift your operating philosophy to less labor and consequently higher sales per employee. So that's kind of the focus in South America and Brazil right now.</p>
          <p>And then in Europe, it just doesn't seem to be coming back, as I just mentioned; we just see kind of permanently lower demand in the packaged gases in Southern Europe. And then in our PST business, which basically has three end markets: aerospace, energy and general manufacturing. Most of the general manufacturing is in Europe and that's just been the Achilles' heel to having PST grow at the rate that it should be growing at. So we're going to take a fresh look at curtailing some plants and production and head count in PST, but it's really just focused on the European industrial end market, which is very weak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then also just to elaborate on one of points on how you cope with wage inflation in the U.S. About, I think it was about 10 years ago you did a big push to automate and remote control as many plants as possible, I mean, with the new systems. Is there any reason why similar systems would not be applicable around in Asia or Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's sort of a continuous process. I mean, we go through &#x2013; every 10 years or so, a new generation of technology there. But the technology has a better payback in a business which is a bigger business, okay? And so we really haven't fully implemented in anywhere else in the world the same technology that we've implemented in North America. And &#x2013; but we're moving &#x2013; we have been doing that and we'll continue to do that. And basically, it's plant control systems which allow you to start up and shut down the plant without losing much energy efficiency. It's about being able to shift production from one plant to another depending on the power cost in one location versus another. When you have lots of plants, like we do in North America, that's a very fine-tuning thing; when you have a few plants, there's not that much opportunity there. And then lastly, in distribution economics, it's really state of the art logistics planning tools. So there's always room for improvement there.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just looking at Asia, the operating margin in Asia, if we exclude that gain on sale, it looks like operating margin declined. And I guess I would have expected, given the poor performance of electronics, that you would have actually had a positive mix benefit, because electronics are typically lower margin. Can you just help us understand what was going on with those margin dynamics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you just explained it pretty clearly, the electronics is pulling down the margin and particularly argon sales to photovoltaic manufacturers and the price of argon are pulling it down, but the sort of non-electronic end markets have much higher margins, and also have significantly higher volume growth rates. You might have also cited a kind of a disappointing volume growth rate, just because we had positive volumes outside of electronics and negative volumes in electronics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then can you talk a little bit, Jim, about how the Air Products acquisition of Indura maybe changes the competitive dynamics in South America for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it'll change the competitive dynamics at all, we certainly &#x2013; we know them, we know his family. We had kind of an inside track on that, but when it went to public auction, we just could not get anywhere near to the prices that were being offered by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:27) and Air Products, especially when you look inside the company and you look at what plants they have and what capacity they have, and what contracts they have, and a significant part of the business is selling nuts and bolts and stuff. So we shied away at that price, but we've got strong businesses in the major countries that Indura operates, the number one share in Peru and Columbia, and number two share in Chile. And we're very optimistic and positive about the outlook for the new on-site projects in those areas. And so, anyway it's &#x2013; I don't see any change happening to our business as a result of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; and just maybe lastly, one of your competitors commented on seeing some steel industry weakness that was impacting their liquid argon volumes in North America. Are you guys seeing anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, it's that's a circular logic. We have much higher &#x2013; we're the number one producer of argon in North America by a long shot, okay. And we have more diverse production of argon amongst different plants, whereas some of our competitors really just make argon out of a couple of plants. And so those would be plants that are not &#x2013; if they're not operating, they're not making any argon, okay. So I know, both our competitors saying they would have made more money if they had more helium to sell and more argon to sell, but they didn't, because they didn't plan ahead to make sure they had that capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, just two quick questions. First of all, when you think &#x2013; when you add up like the competitive advantages versus maybe the cost and inflation issues, when you think about the profitability on projects, how does Brazil compare with the rest of your platforms, say North America and Asia, in terms of like returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I would say in terms of new project investments, we use the same hurdle rates, maybe currency adjusted or interest rate adjusted, country-by-country. But there's a wide range. We're doing projects that are smaller kind of projects where, what I call we get a lot of synergy between the old business and the new business. We can get 20% to 30% IRRs on those projects, okay. So Brazil really has a large share of projects that look like. Other projects, which would tend to be more standalone or very large projects, tend to be more competitive and more in kind of the low to mid-teens in terms of IRRs. But that's kind of the same story around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then just with regard to your &#x2013; the RFPs, you had said, were starting to really heat up in the U.S. Can you give us more color as to where they're coming from, I know you mentioned the Vale contract that you got, but what other areas should we be thinking about in terms of where this demand's really picking up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would say the mining sector is certainly one, with nickel and copper and gold prices high, so the North American miners are expanding and there are also new process technologies that are environmentally cleaner but also use oxygen in the processing technology. So the mining sector is one and then the chemical sector is another. There are probably about 20 potential, and I use the word potential, chemical project expansions in North America, a lot of ethylene oxide and so forth. So those two end markets are where we would be looking to &#x2013; where we're seeing increased proposal activity for on-site projects.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's better in the north than the south. It's kind of a &#x2013; history's always been that way. But basically the weakest is Spain, the second weakest is Italy, third is France, Germany's pretty even, and then Scandinavia is growing.</p>

          <p>And in the North American markets, Jim, have you seen, as the rigs are sort of shifting away from dry into wetter gas, does that create challenges or benefits for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it creates both, okay. So the fracking business for dry gas is practically, completely gone, okay. And that's been a hurt to us. But in the so called wet gas, which has a lot of natural gas liquids and coal bed methane up in Canada is strengthening.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>We have a rather smallish &#x2013; we do have a contract from Qatar, and we do bring in some helium from Qatar, as well as all of our North American sources, but the problem is, and I'm not saying specific to Qatar, is that you're always buying it &#x2013; if they're not making natural gas, they're not going to be making helium okay. So you get in this bind where you're committed to providing product to your customer but your supply source gets interrupted, so you don't want to be too dependent on any one supply source. But it's definitely economic to ship it around the world, I mean, we actually export a lot of helium out of North America to Asia.</p>

This has not been that kind of a case yet, but we are getting price up on most of our contracts, but it's going to take some time, because customers aren't doing that well because of the recession.

          <p>As my follow-up, with respect to your Gulf Coast hydrogen network, are lower natural gas prices and therefore lower hydrogen prices, is that big enough to move the needle in terms of R&amp;M margins for your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that with low natural gas prices and low hydrogen prices, what they're spending on hydrogen as compared to what they're spending on crude oil gets to be a smaller amount, okay. And so when they do their optimization of the refinery in terms of looking at inputs and outputs that gives them some more degrees of freedom in how much hydrogen they would use. But it could also expand their margins a little bit.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of the David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, just on your backlog, it was down in the quarter by a couple hundred million dollars; given what you see on new plant startups and potential new contract signings, should that backlog by year-end be flat, up, or down from current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's a good question. Basically, the backlog was down a couple hundred million dollars because we started up more projects than we signed during the quarter, okay. And there will be other quarters where it'll go either direction. Now, so that's kind of what's going into the backlog. What's coming out of the backlog, or I guess what's the proposal activity remains to be strong, we think that the long-term growth around the world hasn't changed at all. But certainly in Brazil, with the recession, we've seen a pause in decision making, which is small compared to what we saw in 2009 and 2010, where we didn't sign very many contracts. But I think that long-term those projects will still be there. Now we're also seeing some delay in the startup of what's in the backlog, where some customers who just aren't ready to take product when the project was supposed to start. So some of that's going to stretch some of those 2013 startups into 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And Jim, just on pricing in Europe, given weakness of end markets. How much longer can you get pricing as volumes are down and weak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I think we're the only ones in Europe who are focused on pricing, at least positive pricing, and we did get positive pricing this quarter, and we're going to continue to try to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, U.S. packaged gas sales are higher than air gas, is that due to your helium activity is not being constrained, do you think, or are you gaining share...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're having more acquisition activity, and we've had higher same-store sales growth. So I can't speak for them. But I think we're &#x2013; we've got our eyes focused on the selling process and the acquisition process and a pretty good pipeline going there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that, we'd like to take one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that. Just quickly, Jim, you talked about hedging against the Brazilian real, can you talk about what kind of hedges do you have in place for second half and what impact do you expect from them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, with the accounting the way that it is, we really can't hedge that income because you can't get hedge accounting on hedging that income, which means that you really can't hedge across quarter end, you have to mark everything to market. So we've really kind of pretty much reduced our net income hedging to practically nothing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, we talked about strong volumes in North America in packaged gases, you mentioned automotive OEM as a strong end market. Are there any signs that you're seeing that in automotive OEM or other areas where U.S. is beginning to slow down due to the woes in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't seen any slowdown in volumes there and I think there's a whole range of industries, I used automotive OEM as an example, but there's machinery industries, farm equipment industries, mining equipment driving metal fabrication and welding. And maybe it won't be too long before we start to see a bottoming out in non-residential construction, which could also be a positive help in the future.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
