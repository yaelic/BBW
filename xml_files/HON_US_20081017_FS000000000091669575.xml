          <p>Thank you Shaun. Good morning everyone.  Welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  With me here today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson.</p>
          <p>This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website www.honeywell.com/investor.  Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today.  Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we will review our financial results for the third quarter, our expectations for the remainder of the year and some initial color on 2009, and of course allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote. Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Murray and good morning everyone.  Well, despite tougher economic conditions I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong results for Honeywell.  We continue to build on our multiyear track record of delivering consistent performance with organic sales growth in the quarter again supporting double-digit earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Over the past five years we've consistently outperformed in earnings growth and we're confident that we can continue to outperform despite a moderating top-line environment.  With 20% EPS growth this quarter on a 6% sales increase we've added to that track record.  Importantly, the quality of our earnings remains high with year-to-date cash flow conversion just below our annual target of 100% of net income.</p>
          <p>Our long-cycle businesses as well as those aligned with macro-trends like oil and gas, energy efficiency, defense and space and life safety continue to perform well.  This strength more than offset continued softness in our residential and industrial sensing end-markets as well as global flight hours where growth is decelerating as anticipated.</p>
          <p>We are actively monitoring short-cycle trends and are taking proactive costs actions including utilizing the $417 million after-tax gain from the sales of our Consumables Solutions business to reposition our company for continued outperformance.  We believe we'll continue to outperform for several reasons.</p>
          <p>As a company, Honeywell is well positioned to perform in this environment.  Great positions in good industries is more than a catchphrase.  We've positioned ourselves to participate strongly in robust macro-trends like safety, security, oil and gas, energy efficiency and defense and space that comprise about half of our portfolio.  We have improved our business diversity so we're not totally dependent on one area.</p>
          <p>The balance between long and short-cycle businesses about 45, 55 non-US sales in excess of 50% of total, a huge installed base this goes across a number of our businesses, developing new industries like gas detection and personal protection equipment and the balance between products and services, all of this helps to create a more robust enterprise.  Our investments in key initiatives like the Honeywell Operating System, Functional Transformation, Velocity Product Development, and our acquisitions process are showing strong results and they'll continue to do so in the future.</p>
          <p>Our conservative planning ensures that we always plan for a tougher market than we're likely to see.  So we have our costs in line and invest smartly.  Our strategic planning, operating plan follow-up, and Management Resource Review or MRR all strongly reinforce making commitments today while investing for the future.  A good example is the restructuring that was done over the last couple of years.  These investments have been a hit to earnings during the good years.  But they make us even better prepared for the tough years.  We continue to implement a disciplined approach to free cash flow generation, and to capital deployment.  We are now a terrific cash generator and very different from the company we were when we generated only 1.5 billion annually in free cash flow and paid over 40% of that in dividends.</p>
          <p>We've taken that big cash improvement and reduced our share count by 15%, increased our dividend 10% a year for 4 years and by the way even with those increases less than a quarter of our cash flow today is paid in dividends, and completed outstanding acquisitions using our rigorous new acquisitions process to ensure they pay.  We received more than $900 million in cash proceeds from the divestiture of our Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace, a great deal for Honeywell and we have been able to utilize this gain to support repositioning and other cost saving actions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the near term our capital deployment focus will be on strengthening our balance sheet and ensuring good liquidity as we enter weaker economic conditions.  And finally, everyone says it but it's especially true for us and that's the focus on having the best people, organized the right way and motivated.  It's tough to measure, but the effect is clearly there.  We have a superb leadership team and have business leaders who don't just give a good presentation but actually know how to get it done and stay focused.</p>
          <p>So, while we enter this period of difficult economic times, we are well prepared and are focused on the execution necessary for us to outperform in this environment.  So, with that let me turn it over to Dave.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave.  Good morning everyone.  Welcome again to our call.  Let's go to slide four entitled financial summary, let me take you through the highlights of our results before we go into a little bit more detail.  As Dave said we've recognized a gain on the sale of the Consumables Solutions business B/E Aero in the quarter and of course we've used this opportunity to take a number of actions that are going to benefit future periods and I'm going to detail those in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>The reported numbers on slide four include the impact of both the CS gains as well as the repositioning and other actions that we took in the quarter.  So on a reported basis starting with sales up 6% including a net 3% benefit from acquisitions and divestitures, 2% benefit from foreign currency translation and there was also, as you can see, a 1% negative impact as part of the one-time actions we took in the took quarter at Aerospace.  Therefore total constant currency organic growth in the quarter was 2% and I'll explain that Aerospace item in just a moment in a little more detail.</p>
          <p>Segment profit you can see in the quarter at 1.2 billion, margins now were down on a reported basis, however if exclude one-time impacts, I'll take you through a walk of that in an upcoming slide, third quarter margins really on an operating basis were 13.9%.  Net income was up 16% in the quarter with higher taxes resulting from the CS sale being more of an offset by lower below the line expenses.  We repurchased 20 million shares in the quarter.  So, lower share count helped drive earnings per share up 20% to $0.97 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, free cash flow of 556 million was down from the prior year primarily due to approximately 200 million of incremental cash tax payments in the quarter.  And as Dave indicated nine months year-to-date free cash flow conversion is just below our target of 100%.  Now, we feel confident in our ability to achieve the approximately 3.2 billion of free cash flow for the year at the midpoint of the guidance that we provided to you previously.  And by the way, working capital &#x2013; speaking of cash, working capital is again a good story in the quarter with turns improving for the total company, so, in summary, another good quarter overall.</p>
          <p>So, let's now go to slide number five and let me take you through a little bit more detail in terms of the walk starting at the top in terms of the recorded $0.97 down to an adjusted EPS number, which strips out the impact of both the CS gain as well as the repositioning and other actions that we took in the quarter.  You can see that the adjusted $0.97 at the bottom of the page compares to the guidance that we gave you for the quarter of $0.94 to $0.96.</p>
          <p>Now, starting at the top and just working down, again we completed the sale for 1.05 billion in July, we recognized a gain on that sale of 623 million or $0.56 net of $0.06 in incremental taxes above our typical tax run-rate of 26.5%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the next three lines, we outlined the actions we took in the quarter.  We recognized 65 million or approximately $0.06 reflecting the realignment of contract milestones within the development schedule for business jet platforms.  As you know, we won content on a number of B&amp;GA [Business and General Aviation] platforms within Aero over the last 12 months.  The 65 million reflects the accrual of payments due to the OEs partially offset their preproduction cost.  These accruals were originally forecast for 2009.  There is no &#x2013; importantly there is no cash impact of this accounting recognition in 2008.  And from a reporting perspective, this 65 million is a reduction to both Aero sales as well as their segment profit in the quarter and I'll talk a little bit more about that when we look at the true underlying operating performance for Aerospace when we come to the segment review in just a moment.</p>
          <p>The second item in terms of actions in the quarter we took the opportunity to execute 233 million or approximately $0.23 primarily related to repositioning actions.  It represents 163 million of severance-related expenses and about 70 million for facility closures and other costs.  Now, importantly the projects are going to deliver cost improvements in our manufacturing and engineering operations as well as support the rationalization of our global real estate footprint and again as Dave said earlier, these are ongoing themes that we've been underwriting over the last five years.</p>
          <p>These actions in addition to the more than 450 million of repositioning actions that we've taken now give us much more tailwind as we face increasingly tougher global economic environment.</p>
          <p>And finally we've recognized 269 million not including ongoing 40 million in the quarter of environmental expense.  So, if you look at the environmental line it's actually 309 million for the quarter, 269 million of that is included in this analysis.  Now this 269 primarily relates to remediation at the Syracuse, New York site as well as Jersey City legacy site.  In Syracuse, we were able to reach resolution on the technical remediation design plan as well as estimate the cost for remedial actions on adjacent sites.  In Jersey City we were able to update our cost estimates for remediation in several key sites.</p>
          <p>Now again, these actions, these accruals have no cash impact beyond what we've provided to you previously in terms of our '08 guidance and importantly no incremental cash impact for 2009.  They should reduce and this is very important.  Should reduce our environmental expense which as you know had a run rate of about 220 million, we spent about 220, 225 in 2007, we were on track for about that rate in 2008.  That will reduce &#x2013; these accruals will reduce that normal run rate by approximately 40 to $60 million annually.  And by the way we're also going to see some of that benefit flow through and we see modest of benefits of that through in the third quarter and we anticipate seeing some of that benefit in addition in the fourth quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>So, in aggregate we expect these actions, the Aero platforms, the repositioning of the environmental to provide an annual benefit in the range of $0.10 EPS to $0.20 with approximately $0.10 in '09 and reaching our full run rate savings in '10 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to some operational details for the quarter and also the margin performance on slide number 6, this is what I mentioned earlier in terms of really stripping away if you will or looking at the true underlying operating performance without the impact of the one-time items.</p>
          <p>So in addition to the CS gain there were several other items in the quarter that are impacting the results.  First as you can see on slide 6, was the aerospace milestone accruals, again a headwind of about 60 basis points, another headwind was our formula pricing agreements in specialty materials.  This is of course a good news story because we saw sales growth in specialty materials due to the formula pricing pass-through and higher raw material costs such as sulfur, natural gas, and phenol.</p>
          <p>Now as a result &#x2013; there is one-for-one impact on our sales and costs.  So they are &#x2013; while positive in terms of projecting our operating income dollars, it's obviously dilutive in terms of segment margin for both specialty materials and Honeywell overall.  And again this had an impact of about 20 basis points to our margin rate in the quarter.  Acquisitions were also a headwind approximately 30 basis points primarily related to acquisition accounting and one-time integration costs mostly associated with Norcross and Metrologic at ACS.  By the way, just as a side note, we're very pleased with those acquisitions and we have had &#x2013; Dave and I have had reviews with the operating teams recently.  And those transactions are coming out of the box very well in 2008.</p>
          <p>Finally, the hurricane impact is something that it's made a lot of headlines, we haven't really spoken about it, but to just give you an update, both Gustav and Ike had an unfavorable impact with some of our plant operations mostly within specialty materials as well as logistics in the Gulf in the quarter.  Now, the most significant impact was in Orange, Texas with the shutdown of a Specialty Materials facility.  We expect continued impact in that facility in the fourth quarter of '08.  We are in the initial stages of assessing the overall impact for our potential insurance recovery.  We will be able to update you in the fourth quarter as we complete the year in terms of both the final impacts of those hurricanes as well as potential recoveries.</p>
          <p>So, overall 140 basis points of impact which translates to an adjusted margin rate of 13.9, obviously strong performance, we are very pleased about and compares by the way favorably with the third quarter of last year, the reported 13.4 of last year.</p>
          <p>So, let's now go to the cash deployment slide.  This is something I think is very timely given the interest in capital allocation and liquidity.  As we look at our capital allocation in the quarter, you can see we had inflows of $2.1 billion.  The cash proceeds from Consumables Solutions as well as our free cash flow from operations and we had outflows of 2 billion mostly to fund share repurchases and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So, in the near term, and particularly as we enter this period of economic uncertainty, number one, we feel good, as Dave said, about our liquidity.  But, we plan to reduce short-term debt balances to increase the financial strength of our balance sheet.  As we stated in the past, we are going to continue to invest in our businesses and look prudently to invest in strategic acquisitions.  However, we think it makes sense to focus on capital structure and access to liquidity over the short-term.</p>
          <p>Just as an update and I know there is been a lot of questions about this, a lot of interest in this, so just a couple of updates while we are on the subjects of liquidity and access the capital markets.  We've had no issues to-date rolling commercial paper.  Into '09 we expect free cash flow, less dividend to more than offset the current maturities of our long-term debt.  And in addition, you should know and I think you know this from our filings, we've got 3.8 billion of committed credit facilities.</p>
          <p>Now, before we talk about our individual businesses and how they performed, let me spend a few minutes on Slide 8 just updating you on what we're seeing across the portfolio more broadly as well as just outline some of the actions that we're taking in preparation for what we all anticipate and are seeing in terms of the slower growth environment.  So, as you can see we've got there, what we're seeing, and also what we're doing.</p>
          <p>So, under what we're seeing, we are seeing of course as Dave said continued strength across our Aerospace OE, Defense &amp; Space, ACS Solutions, and UOP businesses.  Due to their long cycle characteristics, we have good visibility into these markets, the trends remain overall positive.  They contribute roughly just under 50% of our sales and income and they provide a stable and predictable earnings platform as we enter a period of uncertain economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Next, we really have not &#x2013; surprisingly seen no recovery and we expect none in the select residential and industrial markets, and we've updated you on that over the last 12 months, over the last four quarters or so.  So, really no news there.  We are seeing as anticipated some deceleration in the growth of global flying hours for both air transport and regional.  As we expected we saw some slowing in the third quarter.  We expect the fourth quarter exit rate, that is in the November, December time period for global flying hours to be somewhere in the 0 to 1% growth and we would expect that to translate into around 4% global flying hour growth for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are actively monitoring short cycle trends particularly in our OE products businesses, at Turbo and ACS and also in the aftermarket for business jets.  Clearly the European passenger vehicle turbo business saw difficulties in the quarter.  We are going to give you more specifics as we review Transportation Systems in just a moment.  But importantly we are planning for an even tougher environment in the fourth quarter for passenger vehicle turbo.</p>
          <p>For ACS we continue to pulse our channels and customers for those markets.  A good example I can share with you, we had this discussion with our business leadership the other day in our Environmental and Combustion Controls business ECC within ACS we had a discussion on how their business is performing in its various channels.  Our retail channel for ECC continues to perform very well as demand for energy efficient products remains robust.  It's amazing just even anecdotally what you are seeing in terms of from retailers in terms of positive response they're getting to our energy efficient products.</p>
          <p>In the trade channel and this is very interesting we saw strong trends in ECC through mid-September followed by significant declines for the remainder of the month versus the prior year.  So in other words a real tail-off is the latter part of September.  However in the first half of October, we've seen robust double-digit increases again and our customers are telling us that demand remains high.  So, obviously we're tracking this very closely.</p>
          <p>And finally for business jets, we continue to see relatively stable activity for larger jets where we play most predominately.  But we're tracking business jet utilization as well as used jet inventories closely for signs of possible broader weakness.  Now, it's unclear -- kind of the bottom-line is it's unclear, how some of these trends will develop over the short-term.  So, as Dave said for purposes of our planning and our guidance for the fourth quarter, which I'm going to take you through in some detail in a moment, we believe we're taking a more conservative view.</p>
          <p>So, now let's turn to some of the actions that we've implemented as we prepare for a slowing environment, the latter part of the same slide.  First of course is our focus on fixed cost.  This is not a new thing.  We've had a relentless focus on the management as you know of census and facilities related cost, which comprise the majority of our fixed cost.</p>
          <p>At this time we have hiring freezes in place, we continue to focus on keeping developed regions, expenses flat, while still increasing sales.  We're managing our global real estate portfolio to continue group top rationalization, obviously the third quarter opportunity that presented itself with the CS gain gives us significant capacity -- additional capacity and we are managing that portfolio with proactive lease and rental agreement renegotiations as we speak.</p>
          <p>Our business leaders are redoubling their efforts to reduce spending that's not directly related to serving customers, supporting the advancement of our technologies or the continued improvement of our operating facilities.  Each of our CFOs is actively tracking and reporting all indirect -- all of these indirect spending activities, they're aggressively with a leadership teams in our businesses, aggressively managing these costs with an emphasis on reducing all non-essential, non-customer related spending and by the way the trend there and we track it very closely has been positive, it's been contributing to that operating margin expansion I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Third we're reassessing CapEx, re-prioritizing all new programs through this year and the end of next year.  Our focus of course is on the long-term health of our franchise, we're going to continue to invest in attractive projects in safety and environmental related projects.  However, as we face the tougher economic environment we are making sure that our spending and our prioritization decisions are firmly grounded.  And finally as I said earlier, we're focused on managing our liquidity in this uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>So we're monitoring our portfolio, we're taking decisive actions to prepare for a more difficult economic environment.  With that let's now go through Aerospace and the other businesses starting with Aero on Slide number 9.</p>
          <p>Now importantly, and there is a little asterix there beside the Aero title at the top of the slide, we're excluding the business jet accruals that we detailed earlier as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestitures to give you really a true organic performance for Aero in the quarter.  You can see segment sales were up 5% organically, segment profit was up 5%, margins up 10 basis points to 18.4%.</p>
          <p>Some highlights regarding Aero.  Total commercial sales were up 7% organically in the quarter, continued strong demand on the OE side of the business, some softening in the aftermarket.  And again that was largely anticipated in terms of what we saw in the aftermarket.  Commercial OE sales were up 11% driven by continuing strong demand by OE customers.  AT&amp;R [Air Transport and Regional] OE sales were up 7.  B&amp;GA sales were up 15.  We continue, as you know, to win content on new OE platforms and of course very, very pleased to announce this quarter the contract win on the Gulfstream G250 with engines and APUs representing approximately a $4 billion win for Honeywell.  Terrific accomplishment by the team.</p>
          <p>Commercial after market sales up 4% in the quarter.  AT&amp;R after market sales were up 5%, greater than the global flying hours, which were up 2.8% by the way in the third quarter as anticipated and by the way to my earlier comments consistent with the approximately 4% growth we envisioned for total global flying hours for the full year '08.  Now, the important thing of course is we continue to benefit from our technology and our offerings, particularly in safety and fuel efficiency and that's supporting our growth in the aftermarket.  A great example was the recent FAA decision mandating all US registered air transport aircraft sold after 92 to install the nitrogen generation systems to reduce risk of fuel tank flammability.  This is an 800 million opportunity for Honeywell.  There is over 2500 aircraft in the existing fleet requiring retrofit over the next nine years.</p>
          <p>On the business jet side aftermarket sales were up 3%.  This reflects not only just continued underlying growth in the market that we've seen, but also our successful penetration of new products particularly in avionics.  Again the majority of content is on larger business jet platforms which continue to do well.  We are seeing clear signs of reduced activity in the aftermarket for suppliers for smaller jets as well as for older jets in the fleet and we'll need to continue to monitor these trends as well as the ongoing trend for larger jets.</p>
          <p>Defense and Space sales were up 2% in the quarter driven by Surface Systems, TIGER was an important contributor there as well Space with the Orion program.  On the margin side for Aero; volume growth, price and productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter.  So overall another very good quarter for Aero which also included importantly increased R&amp;D investment as we ramp up the development of attractive future programs including the Airbus 350, Embraer, as well as the FAA mandated Nitrogen Generation System.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to ACS, slide number 10.  ACS also had a strong overall quarter.  Sales were up 15%.  Our products businesses and by the way you can see the contribution from both acquisitions and foreign currency to that growth.  So we did have continued organic growth for ACS in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our products businesses were up 19% on a reported basis driven primarily by benefits from Norcross and Metrologic.  Organic growth for products up 2% with continued strength, we saw strength in China and the Middle East partially offset by lower growth in select US and European markets.</p>
          <p>New product introductions continue to support it, again example I cited earlier ECC continues to help us in terms of offsetting both North American and European residential markets, continue to amazingly enough still see good growth in both those regions in residential.</p>
          <p>Our Life Safety business remains robust with organic growth in North America, Europe and Asia.  The Solutions business, very positive for the quarter up 10% in the quarter.  We had both strong orders growth, in fact orders for Solutions up 18%.  In the Process business obviously the focus on oil and gas and refining and petrochemical segments was particularly strong.  We had double-digit order growth there.  The Building Solutions continues to see strong growth in North America with particularly strong interest as well as order activity for energy efficiency projects.  And by the way our service backlog also grew in the quarter reflecting continued strength on the retrofit side.</p>
          <p>Now when you adjust for acquisitions and foreign exchange, overall ACS sales were up low single-digits in North America, down low single-digits in Europe, but up strong double digits in the emerging regions where we continue to see overall strength.  ACS's profit was up 15%, margins were flat reported, but importantly up 70 basis points excluding the impact of acquisitions, very strong operational performance and that 70 basis points again is impact, dilutive impact of acquisitions to ACS margins is the 20 basis points that I mentioned earlier as the dilutive impact on the overall margins in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 11 and Transportation Systems.  TS had a difficult quarter, turbo was down 9%.  You can see their total sales were down 6%, turbo was down 9%.  We saw sharply as I said earlier sharply lower vehicle production rates in Europe.  US OEs also had a difficult quarter as you know.  We saw continued consumer shift towards lower displacement engines in Europe.  We also saw the impacts of the CO2 taxation and gas engines growing as a percent as Europe is experienced high diesel prices at the pump.  Now, new platform launches will be continued to be pushed out we believe as OEs struggle with lower sales of their current inventories.  However our content on future platforms continues to grow and we had a $2 billion win -- over $2 billion of wins in the quarter.  And that's clearly going to benefit future periods.  And that together with macro drivers such as energy efficiency, lower emissions standards, we believe we are going to continue to grow the Turbo business longer term but obviously near term we're seeing some real headwinds.</p>
          <p>In CPG, consumer products, they were down 4% and again we faced headwinds in the US automotive market aftermarket.  Volumes were down in car care and filtration as high gas prices and economic concerns continue to weigh on consumer confidence.  Friction sales were 3% primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and the pricing actions.  Turbo's profit was down -- segment profit was down 18%, margins were down 130 basis points to 8.8% due to lower volumes primarily in Turbo.  Obviously when we talk about TS and turbo buying data, it really speaks to the importance of the balance and the diversity they have in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Specialty Materials, sales were up 9% driven primarily by pricing actions at Resins and Chemicals as well as Fluorine.  At UOP sales were down as anticipated due to the timing of catalyst sales, which were down more than 40% in the quarter.  You'll recall the large shipments of catalysts that we had in the first half of this year.  In fact, catalyst sales you'll recall in the first half of '08 were up almost 50% compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Overall UOP continues to experience strong demand for its proprietary products and technology and backlog continues to grow at the business and outpace sales.  Resins and chemicals were up 52% in the quarter driven by capital sales as well as the impact of higher raw material pricing of a higher raw material costs, and the flow through as I mentioned earlier in terms of formula pricing.  Fluorine products were up 18% primarily due to favorable pricing actions and higher volumes.  And as we discussed earlier about formula pricing, the impact of the hurricane were diluted to the SM margins in the quarter and if we exclude these impacts, margins would be up more than 300 basis points.  I think it's actually more like 200 basis points in the quarter strong, operational performance.</p>
          <p>So, now with that background having reviewed the 4 businesses, let's take a look at the outlook for the remainder of the year, talk about the fourth quarter and the full year made on slide number 13.  Now we've experienced good momentum across our businesses obviously to-date with sales and EPS are very up and very healthy 10% to 24% respectively.  Our planning as we've both said conservatively as we enter the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to be up approximately 2% over the prior year.  Obviously, part of that too is now the change in foreign currency translation that we're seeing as we see the dollar strengthening against major currencies.  And we expect EPS in the fourth quarter to be up 7 to 11% in the range of $0.97 to 1.01.</p>
          <p>Now quickly Aero sales we expect to be up around &#x2013; to be around 3.3 billion, up around 2% on a reported basis with organic growth led by commercial OE and Defense offset by some slower growth in global flying hours and lower maintenance events at business jets.</p>
          <p>For ACS for the fourth quarter revenues are expected around 3.7 billion up 8%. We expect continued solutions growth based on orders and service backlog offset by continued slower growth in select product end markets. Again, as I said, growth in those select product end markets, but slower growth. At Transportation Systems sales of approximately 1 billion, down more than 20%, reflecting as we said the continuing challenging conditions primarily in European passenger vehicle for turbo. And finally SM we anticipate sales of 1.3 billion up 9% driven by formula pricing but also continuation of lower licensing revenues impacting UOP mix and again that's just reflecting the timing in the first half versus the second half of the year for UOP.</p>
          <p>Now due to the repositioning actions that we implemented in the third quarter, we'll also have some favorability in terms of the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter.  That will give us on a full year basis essentially flat with prior year ETR [Effective Tax Rate] of around 26.5. That lower effective tax rate in the quarter should give us in the range of 30 to $40 million of additional repositioning capacity, so we would expect to leverage that also in the fourth quarter to benefit again '09, '10 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So the outlook that we see for the remainder of the year and for the full year is in line we think with our planning assumptions for the fourth quarter, however we still expect to drive healthy earnings growth despite weaker economic conditions.</p>
          <p>And now before we go to Q&amp;A, I would like to just spend a few minutes on Slide 14 summarizing our preliminary views for '09. As a reminder, we'll come back to you on December 9th to go through a build up of '09 including assumptions and financial guidance for each of our businesses. But now I just want to provide sort of a macro summary -- share some of the mutual views on the outlook, the themes are really consistent I think with what we've talked about for the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter, so I don't think you will be surprised by anything here.</p>
          <p>Overall of course we expect a slower growth environment for the global economy with both developed and developing regions being impacted. We're planning for recessionary conditions in the US and Europe, which, that growth is slow in developing markets including India and China, although growth in these regions will still be relatively strong and the opportunities there for us continue to remain significant.</p>
          <p>As we build the plan for '09, we will project conservative top-line as has been our practice, we'll continue to align our cost base accordingly, our process as you know for planning is very rigorous, it includes detailed top down assessments and scenario analyses followed by detailed bottom up plans including contingencies across all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>We are going to continue remain very disciplines in capital allocation. We're going to invest obviously in our businesses to support future growth, but near term of course again we'll reduce debt balances to further strengthen our balance sheet. We feel prudent obviously in this environment to ensure the continuation of our strong liquidity and our A2, Aa2 long-term credit rating.</p>
          <p>Finally in '09 we expect continued benefit from the many repositioning and productivity actions we've taken. We've been proactively repositioning our businesses. We implemented over 450 million in cost actions in '06. Now with the incremental 567 million of actions in the third quarter, we're able to lock in additional benefits for '09 and beyond. These actions coupled with Functional Transformation will continue to drive, standardized work and improved service and enable us to achieve margin expansion in this environment.</p>
          <p>On the business side, we expect that Aero will continue to perform in an environment of increasing commercial OE builds and increased defense spending in '09. With more than 7000 aircraft still in the backlog we expect multiple years of delivery growth for AT&amp;R, for air transport as well as for business jets. And as you know, our recent NBAA Business Aviation Outlook survey forecasted that deliveries will peak in '09 at 1300 to 1400 new aircraft. In the aftermarket we expect that global flight hour growth will decline from '08 levels and be flat to modestly positive year-over-year.</p>
          <p>ACS should see continued global opportunity growth but we expect softness in select product end-markets such as residential and industrial, that's not going to change, our solutions businesses should remain strong, we've got robust order backlog, the benefit of technology and innovation as well as favorable energy trends.</p>
          <p>In Transportation, we see another difficult year ahead in '09. The long-term demand for energy efficient vehicles is there. That's going to remain robust, however near-term the growth will remain challenged, while global automotive OEs face unprecedented headwinds.</p>
          <p>And finally Specialty Materials we continue to see strong demand for UOP's proprietary products and solutions, however, slowing global economy will impact demand for key polyolefins products such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate within our Resins and Chemicals and our Fluorine business.</p>
          <p>So, overall we see a more challenging general economic environment in '09 but we remain confident in our businesses, our leadership team and the track record that we built here at Honeywell. We've made significant investments obviously over the last six years in product development, sales and manufacturing capabilities, the global expansion all of which we believe are going to make us well positioned to outperform in this slower growth scenario. So, we're looking forward to taking you through more details on December 9 and share with you more highlights in each of our businesses and the overall outlook for HON.</p>
          <p>So, with that Murray let's turn it over to Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, Dave Anderson all in based on the trajectory of what you are seeing with these puts and takes, how are you feeling about being able to hold earnings per share kind of flattish next year or even perhaps grow it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John I'd just say this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suppose you need to ask, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm throwing you a soft ball, so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter]. Yeah, a soft ball.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. We are &#x2013; it's really premature to comment on earnings per share outlook.  I think, what you are seeing in terms of our third quarter performance, the outlook for the fourth quarter the actions that we continue to take, the investments we continue to make, we're obviously confident that we're going to continue to outperform in the environment. We'll take you through the details of that on December 9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John and that's typically what we do is in terms of doing anything for forecasting the next year, we always do it in December and it seems like every third quarter we get asked and we always say we're going to do it in December. But at the end of the day, I think it's important to recognize how different the company is and the caliber of the portfolio we have now and how it's run. And I would take all of those into consideration and we'll talk to you more about it in December, like we always do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fine. I think we can read between the lines. Can I ask about this the B&amp;GA...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't blame you for asking, John, but we can't say anything. Maybe I should say, we're not going to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. The B&amp;GA accruals adjustments, we're not really familiar with this accounting.  Why does this hit the revenues, why are you doing this now and what platforms is this affecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John it's as we said the wins that we've had most significantly the Embraer and the Gulfstream wins and it's not exclusive to them. Those are obviously large new platform wins, typically come with contractual agreements that when we achieve certain milestones, we support the OEs in terms of their pre-production costs. What we've been able to do here is basically through the renegotiation and restructuring of those contracts is achieve those milestones earlier and therefore be able to accrue those expenses and the way it works is those payments are a one-for-one deduct from the bottom line, the top line and the bottom line. So, we are able to accrue for those earlier as I said with no cash impact in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, importantly those milestones related to these platform wins are really multi-year, so we have in terms of our agreements we have '08, '09, '10, '11. So, what we've been able to do is not only be able to recognize earlier some of these milestones and therefore make the accruals. The other thing it's enabled us to do is to really smooth out on a multi-year basis. So, that's another positive. We'll talk a little more about that in December, but that's another positive for us, when you look at the year-over-year impacts of these milestones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and if I can just get in one more, so when you guys gave the 94 to 96 cents guidance, obviously that did not have the impact of the Consumables Solution gain with the offsetting charges, and if you hadn't have those, you would have been planning for quarterly charges for repositioning and other anyway.  What would those have been in the quarter if you could, if there is any way to figure that out, if you actually hadn't had the gain, what would your normalized run rate have been for those charges would you have estimated in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have to disagree, John, with how you just said that, because you are pre-supposing that a number of this stuff would have existed anyway and if...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you pulled a bunch of stuff forward, I'm just trying to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way to look at it is we took the opportunity with this gain to position ourselves better for next year. So, in my view the answer is zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me &#x2013; can I add a little bit to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had, John, repositioning expenses you'll recall June year to date of $565 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, by the way that was well ahead of our typical run-rate. So what we did was really took advantage of that very strong operating performance that we had in the first half of the year. The repositioning that we would have done in the latter part of the year was really dependent upon obviously underlying operating performance as well as the quality of projects that present themselves. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And where we have gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And where we have gains.  So, really the answer is TBD [To Be Determined] and it always will be that way. But, clearly we benefited in the first half of the year in terms of the actions that we took, the actions that we would have taken in the second half were TBD, we've obviously been working on the Consumables Solutions transaction for a while. We've had a lot of time to thoughtfully review each of these items, and to evaluate it in terms of both the sort of immediate benefits as well as the longer-term benefits to the company. So, it's all of those things enter into the balance into the mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fair. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah I mean, just a further question on the restructuring expense, we're getting, given the deteriorating economy, we're getting a lot of companies announcing big restructuring programs to back out all of a sudden. You're one of the only ones that's really gotten ahead of this. So, I guess the question is, you talked, you called that one an incremental 30 or 40 restructuring you can do in the fourth quarter to offset some tax benefit, but given how much you've already done, what's left to do in terms of &#x2013; I mean I wouldn't expect I guess a big called out restructuring program from you guys -- is there really a lot more to book after you do this incremental piece in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't anticipate anything major Shannon because, you said it right is that what we've tried to do from the beginning here is recognize that even when times are good it doesn't always last that way, so at some point you run into more difficult times and the time to prepare for those difficult times is when times are good. So you've seen us during the last three or four years, we've been taking advantage of some of those better times, better FX and saying okay how do we use that to better position ourselves for when times get tougher. So I mean we took this gain as being the same &#x2013; the same opportunity. So no, we don't expect anything major here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Dave anything you want to add to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and then Dave Anderson on the comments around the actions taken in 3Q and the $0.10 benefit to next year, can you just help me understand that a little more? Because you said the actions in environmental would give you what looks like about maybe a nickel benefit next year, I think you're talking about the pull forward of the B&amp;GA leading to a $0.06 benefit next year because you took it this year instead, I mean that's already got us to 11 without any repositioning.  Can you just walk through the sort of components of the $0.10 and is there something built in there I am missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you are pretty close, we've got obviously the benefit of the environmental that we mentioned in my response earlier to the question on the B&amp;GA accruals what I said is the we've been able to call it sort of level out now, the anticipated milestones and payments and therefore the accruals or expense recognition that we'll have for those items, so when you look at the '08, '09, Shannon, it's not that full amount that we took, it's a portion of that because there would have been some payments in '09, so what we have been able to do is to make those more even on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>So that the sum total of the environmental, the B&amp;GA accrual and just a small amount on the repositioning and the repositioning gives us some benefit but not much in '09 because as you know there is pay-as-you-go cost that are on the front end of this that don't get taken through the repositioning that will actually flow through the P&amp;L of the businesses or here at corporate depending upon where the action's being taken. So, sum total is around $0.10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a last one from me. On Transportation obviously the auto business generally in Europe in particular has fallen off very rapidly.  In terms of getting at, I mean you got the platform investments, I imagine a portion of the restructuring gets applied into Turbo. How fast can you catch up with what's going on in that industry with the idea of we've seen margins take a pretty good hit here, we were hoping they would be actually up this quarter and obviously they're down a good chunk, I mean do you feel like you can get at that cost fast enough to prevent further sharp declines in the Transportation margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'd say at the end of the day we'd have to expect that Transportation will struggle in the fourth quarter and next year. We'll get at the cost as quickly as we can. It's not always easy as you know. But it's one of those things that &#x2013; and I think Dave said it pretty well early on, is that one of these things that we manage in the mix of the company and it's why we like to have a lot of bets in a lot of places and have a good broad diverse set of opportunities ahead of us. That's why we've actively worked that portfolio over the last 4, 5 years to have that right blend of long-cycle, short-cycle, global, U.S., building on an installed base wherever we can have it, putting ourselves in a better position in other industries and this is one that's going to be one of the downside items. But we'll be able to manage that just like we always do.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, this is one of those where with the wins that we've had, the technology that we have, when you come out into the 10, 11, 12, the numbers that are going to come out of this business are going to be terrific. So, it's just part of what we manage in total and yes this is one of those where the industry is not so good fourth quarter and next year, although I think the fourth quarter hit will be greater, because there is an inventory correction that's going on right now. Does it help Shannon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to get my arms a little bit more around just kind of this headwind issue. Dave Anderson your prior answer was pretty clear on what we just saw in Q3. I'm just thinking about kind of the other stuff going on, if we think about the 160 pay-as-you-go in the first half and another 40 in Q4, that's $0.20 that goes away if you don't repeat any of that. So my question is, will there be some underlying kind of normal pay-as-you-go as we get into '09?  How would that compare with what you're actually spending in '08?  And what about the payback from the pay-as-you-go that you've done, is that separate and apart from what we just heard about in that $0.10 or is there kind of another stream of benefits coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, why don't I take just a shot at this because I may need to clarify some of my earlier comments. What I said is that when we book the repositioning there are also expenses that don't qualify under the accounting definition of repositioning that are pay-as-you-go expenses that are borne by the businesses and so as a result when we look at the payback on repositioning, we include those items.  It's not always evident to you but we include those pay-as-you-go costs in the calculation of payback. So, for 2009 the point I was making earlier is that for 2009 there will some pay-as-you-go costs that will impact the payback of the actions that we've taken, the repositioning actions we're taking in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The point I think you are making is that for the repositioning the 165 in the first half and the 30 to 40 million that we anticipate taking in the fourth quarter, that could actually represent tailwind for us if we don't do repositioning in '09. So there is in round numbers $200 million of pick up that we would have in '09 compared to '08 if we decided because of all the significant actions that we've been able to take in '08 that we would have that benefit. And I &#x2013; you are exactly right. And that will figure into our math into our overall calculus as we develop our '09 guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I think the other big math question is pension for '09. Can you ground us a little bit on kind of the puts and takes I mean clearly it looks like you're going to have some discount rate benefit, you're going to have return on asset headwinds, how do you think all that shakes out if we were to lock into it today or give us some sense of how to think of the sensitivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we'll do and I'll comeback and give you a little more color on this, but what we'll do as is in past practice is in our guidance call in December, we'll show you what we think is the relevant range of discount rate and return on plan assets. So you can kind of pick your spot, if you will on the intercept of those two in terms of building your models and doing your analysis for '09. But, obviously those numbers won't be fully baked until we actually get to the end of the year in fact I think under the new pension legislation till January 15 we won't know the interest rate the way it works today.</p>
          <p>So, we'll give you that in December, in the December 9 call, Jeff. Just obviously, and we saw your note on pension, which was, I think well done, is for anybody with a defined benefit plan, these are challenging times given the fall off in terms of the equity markets, the global equity markets. So, for us, we're just going to continue to monitor that situation and then include our best judgment towards the end of the year as to what we think the impact will be for 2009.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we &#x2013; whether you look on the income/expense side, if you look at it on the funding side, as we began the year from a position of strength. So, when you look at it in terms of the year-over-year 'v', if we were just to do freeze frame as of 9/30 as of September 30th the reality is it would have both modest impacts to us whether either P&amp;L or from a funding standpoint in terms of '09. But that's &#x2013; the conditions have deteriorated since September 30th and who knows what's going to happen to conditions between now and the end of the year and we see such volatility in terms of market. So I prefer in terms of giving you any precise numbers just to wait until we get to December 9th show you that matrix and go through the details at that time.</p>

          <p>I would just add Jeff, we're well aware of the issue and it's one of those things that we manage as we think about how to have the company outperform in good times and bad, it's &#x2013; you've got stuff that's working for you and you've got stuff that isn't and that's one of the ones that's not for anybody right now.</p>

          <p>You know I think you saw a little bit just in terms of the top line of Aero in the third quarter, its also we've got an assumption that it will impact us through a portion of the fourth quarter, if it continues beyond let's say the middle of the quarter through the end of the year then that would have further, if you will, drag on Aero's revenues, not a significant impact in terms of Aero's bottom line. So it's within the range of &#x2013; included in the range of what we provided you in terms of the outlook.</p>

All of this sounds like you are pushing a bunch of cash flow into next year in terms of requirements and then also might you touch on asbestos it looks like that continues to be pushed in a positive way, so if we're thinking about where your cash flow is going to end for this year, don't you have a couple of downers for next year?

          <p>Howard, clearly starting from the very top cash flow in terms of net income, we'll be again getting into the details on what we're going to see in terms of year-over-year improvement on working capital gains, CapEx amounts, cash taxes, asbestos, all those things obviously and the ones you mentioned we're going to apply it on the cash flow outlook.</p>
          <p>Just as we mentioned earlier regarding the question regarding EPS, we're not going to foreshadow at this point, our cash flow for 2009. That being said you know our focus, our goal is on 100% cash conversion, free cash flow over net income. We are very focused on that, committed to that.  We'll continue to work that. So we'll give you the details of that.</p>
          <p>Regarding asbestos you are right. What we've seen is continued push out particularly one of the big variables for us sort of one of the binary items is the funding of the 524 (g) trust. We've continued to see push out on the timing of that. Again we'll have more color on that, more insight on that when we talk in December. That's an item that could impact 2009.  At this time we're still evaluating that, we'll give you our best judgment in December.</p>

          <p>As leadership team though, Howard, I would add all of us are always very focused on cash generation. It's one of those things that we've tagged from the beginning and we've always as a leadership team looked at it as what provides flexibility and that flexibility means a lot to us where we've become a very good cash generator and we intend to stay that way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then to follow-up on that, Dave, these are times that we haven't seen in quite a while in terms of either market &#x2013; I mean goods market volatility or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, ever for me, I don't know how old you are, Howard, but never for me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We're getting close in age. And, but in terms of what are you asking &#x2013; you talked about some of the things that you're asking your executives to do, but are you putting in flex plans? I mean it is important I think for all of us to believe that you have the ability to show up earnings in these difficult times and how do you manage the difference between ensuring the franchise stays strong and also makes the earnings number, because they're not always the same thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the things that we've always done a pretty good job of and we actually tried to explain this way to all our folks is trying to always &#x2013; the business is always trying to achieve two competing things at the same time, whether it's how do you have low inventory and good delivery, how do you have empowerment of people and still have good controls, but it's a management concept that we drive across the company.</p>
          <p>Along with that concept is how do you manage for the long term and the short term, you have to do both. And that's why you saw us during the good times making sure that we were investing strongly for the future, not just in repositioning but in new products and I think Dave's ECC example was a good one.</p>
          <p>But, always looking at it as to how do you make sure that you are going to be able to deliver not just this quarter, not just this year, but this quarter two years from now, three years from now and it's, I think just one of the tricks of business leadership, business management and we'll do that in these tougher times just like we did in the good times. And it's just one of those things you have to manage. Maybe it means if you had a program that you liked and you are going to invest, the plan was to invest 100 bucks maybe you will only invest 85, because you'll stretch it out some and the markets gotten stretched out. But it's one of those things that you manage I think as a well led enterprise and that's what we'll do next year also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, after covering cyclical names I guess for almost 20 years I heard the words "Inventory correction" and it makes me want to run away. Obviously with TS that's &#x2013; it's not a surprise given what's happening, but are we starting to see anything like that in ACS any of the other businesses where material costs are falling and customers may be heavy on inventory right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just to be clear, what you end up with is TS of course, our transportation is just a lot more volatile and it will be more volatile on the upside too. It's more volatile now on this correction. And I think Dave was pointing this out earlier but in ECC we did see that in the latter part of September orders had reduced a bit because of the inventory correction that distributors were trying to go through and it came flying back in October because of just the demand. So, no, we're not.  I'd say we're seeing it in autos; that's true, but no place else. Dave anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. I wanted to talk a little bit about UOP because that's a business that I think for most of us is really tough to forecast and when it was a JV, it was incredibly volatile and very cyclical, but you did note on Slide 14 that you are seeing strong demand as an outlook for '09 and given oil prices falling and lowering of CapEx levels by some of the big players out there, what gives you that confidence to really &#x2013; I guess two questions, what gives you the confidence and also really how much visibility do you have?  Is it such a thing you really can see into '09 or is this more of a two, three month of visibility business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The visibility into the long-term, the long cycle businesses is pretty good. That's why we feel comfortable enough with it and when you look at the portfolio within that in Process Solutions some of the oil &#x2013; other oil and gas driven businesses, a lot of that is driven by national oil companies where the money is actually still pretty good and financing is already in place, so yeah actually we feel pretty comfortable. Dave, anything you want to add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I am just going to stick on that theme a little bit. I &#x2013; so how &#x2013; what's different this time, I mean I understand there is more dirty oil versus &#x2013; or sour versus sweet or whatever you want to call it, but why is this business kind of wholly-owned under Honeywell substantially less cyclical than it was under the JV format?  Is there something you've done?  Is there a business mix shift that's occurred?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's both an external and internal aspect to that. On the external side, there is still a worldwide shortage and oil companies, gas companies know this. And the shortage has been ameliorated a bit by the upcoming reduction in the overall global economy, but it's going to come back and oil and gas companies, particularly the national ones, know that. And you don't adjust based upon the quarterly results in that industry because these are very long-term investments that they make. And they are smart enough to know that these times as difficult as they are, will end, demand will come back and that they need to be prepared for it. So, we don't see a lot of change there.</p>
          <p>To your point on the internal side, yes, it is a different business. Quite honestly when it was a JV, nobody paid much attention to it, because there wasn't much you could do to impact it. And it was more narrowly focused as an enterprise. If you take a look at how much broader their portfolio is today and the applications that they have, we expect to be a much less cyclical business than it was when we acquired it and it's been one of the things that we worked on from the beginning. Because we recognized early on this could be more cyclical and one of the things we needed to do was make sure that we branched out and diversified it further just like we talked about with the total company. So, yes, it is a different business. So, I think those two together make it just a different business than it was. Dave anything you want to add.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right and that last question will come from Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for squeezing me in there. So, just a couple of question here. First of all the pay-as-you-go expenses within the segments, you haven't talked about that a whole lot in the past.  Could you maybe quantify that and could they fall off as well next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the pay-as-you-go expenses Nigel are a percent of what our total repositioning is, it probably runs anywhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 20% of the total repositioning. In terms of next year they will increase next year because of the actions that we are taking, the accruals that we'll take this year. So, as the actual projects are implemented those pay-as-you-go costs will be flow through the P&amp;Ls of the respective units. So, that's something that we always manage, we always anticipate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. And then on the free cash flow, you bought back $1 billion of stock this quarter, you've got another $1 billion of free cash flow in 4Q plus dividends, how do you, from where you are sitting right now, how do you use that cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier the near term focus really is on bringing down our commercial paper balances, reducing our overall debt balances we think that's the smart thing to do. We've obviously benefited from the strong cash from operations along with the proceeds from CS.  That's enabled us to do deals, to buy back stocks through the first nine months of this year, but, for the fourth quarter, for the foreseeable future that's really our focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on that point, did you buy back stock during the quarter and given what's happened to the stock market since that point would you reduce CP more proactively in 3Q rather than buy back stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in this environment. But, the fundamental fact is that if you look at our cash flow to valuation it's just incredible.  None of us could have anticipated this level.  It's certainly not supported by the fundamentals and is about one-half of our historic average in terms of the trading, where we've seen in terms of if you will cash on cash. So, we think it was a smart move and it will continue as we said earlier and as Dave said earlier, we continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital allocation that's helping us...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I agree on the multiple, by the way. And then, just a quick one on the -- you talk about the ECC volatility, do you think that could have been caused by some of the tight conditions in the credit markets causing some weird behavior through distributors and have you seen any other weird behavior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it's interesting because just anecdotally, as we've discussed with the businesses as I mentioned, we simply -- I am really trying to understand given ECCs breadth and the multiple channels and geographies that they do business in. To really try to understand sort of the July, August and then September phenomenon and then particularly that as I mentioned that trade channel end of September phenomena, interestingly enough, they attributed some of that behavior on the part of their customers and part of the trade, the distribution trade to that very issue &#x2013; was concerns about liquidity, credit liquidity.  In fact what they found is it wasn't an issue for them, predominantly.  This is generalizing now and that's what created as Dave said some of that snap back because what they saw is real demand on the part of their customers for product and they needed to replenish.</p>
          <p>So, it's really a good news story, it's an interesting sort of slice, if you will into what's going on in the world today and it's also interesting in terms of sort of underlying -- underscoring the kind of monitoring, I use that term monitoring, we are doing in terms of businesses because they are really holding up well. And by the way, we are seeing in addition to strong orders, we are seeing strong revenues October to date out of ECC as well.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Murray. I think it's important what we think about Honeywell's records, we are not just a collection of businesses as we were talking earlier and we really are a different company than we were during the last tough times. And we are a company that you can count on to deliver in both good times and bad. Now, while we're as surprised by the extent of these tough times as anybody has to be, I can't say we were surprised that they came. I mean, they always do and we've been preparing for that using these good times to get ready not knowing when it's going to happen, but knowing for sure, they always come.</p>
          <p>So, we've got a couple of things. We have this balanced portfolio, we have this great positions in good industries really does make a difference and creates a much more robust enterprise, and you saw us talk around that a number of times, whether it's specific businesses or how we see the businesses together. But that diversity of industry, global, long, short, cycle really does create a more robust enterprise. We've also got a leadership team that knows how to make it happens and as we're fond of saying, the trick is in the doing. So, while these are clearly more difficult economic times, it does provide us with the opportunity to show you what we can do and that is outperform in good times and bad times, and I am not trying to come across as arrogant about this. But at the end of the day, we have been trying to prepare for this for a while and it's our job to show you next year and in this fourth quarter what we can do and we intend to do that. Thanks.</p>
