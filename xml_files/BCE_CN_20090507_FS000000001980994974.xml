        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to BCE's First Quarter Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Fotopoulos. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wayne. And good morning, everybody. Welcome to our call. With me here today are George Cope, our CEO; and Siim Vanaselja, our CFO. So today we want to take you through our first quarter results. We'll use a slide presentation that's available on our website, and then after that we'll move to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Because of our annual general meeting that would begin at 9:00 AM this morning, we will have an abbreviated question-and-answer session. So as a result we will end the call sharply at 8:45. So I please ask that you keep your questions short, to the point, and limited to just one so that we may get to everybody on the call.</p>
          <p>As usual before we begin I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements with respect to items such as revenue, EBITDA, capital intensity, free cash flow, and EPS. Several assumptions were made by us in preparing those forward-looking statements and there are risks that our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by those forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>For additional information on such assumptions and risks please consult BCE's MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31, 2008 as updated in our first quarter MD&amp;A all of which are filed with the Canadian Securities Commission and with the SEC, and which are also available on our website.</p>
          <p>These forward-looking statements represent the expectations of BCE and its subsidiaries as of today and accordingly are subject to change after such dates. Except as may be required by Canadian Securities Laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to note before we start that I am making these cautionary statements on behalf of each speaker today -- and that's it. So with that behind us, I will hand it over to Siim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Thane. And good morning, everyone and thanks for taking the time to join us this morning.</p>
          <p>I will start with financial review slide, on slide four. Overall, I'd say that Bell had quite a reasonable start to the year. Our residential services business is showing good resiliency to the economic downturn, I'd say given the importance of those services to our customers. And that together with wireless growth enabled us to maintain a stable level of overall recurring service revenues and healthy free cash flow and earnings generation for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The economy has led to more cautious spending and reduced business investment. In that context Bell's total revenues were down slightly by about 0.5% due to lower product sales which declined 8.2%. We are seeing reduced network and data equipment sales to business customers, who are deferring buying decisions and cutting back on spending in the short-term.</p>
          <p>But Bell's service revenue growth of 0.2% was in line with our expectations and we are particularly pleased with the continued performance of home phone, video, residential, Internet, IP connectivity, and ICT services.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for Bell was up 0.3% in the first quarter, but that's 1.5% before the year-over-year increased pension expense. With growth in contribution from our wireless segment, a continued improvement in the rate of NAS erosion, and the benefits of our cost reduction programs, Bell's EBITDA margin expanded slightly to 39.4%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year in the first quarter due to investment in the build out of our HSPA wireless network and as well the accelerated rollout of high speed fibre access to residential neighborhoods and MDUs.</p>
          <p>Bell's capital intensity ratio also increased to 13.3% and I'd say we should see this continue to ramp up through the remainder of the year to reach our guidance level of 15 to 16%.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS was stable year-over-year at $0.57 for the quarter. Higher year-over-year EBITDA and the impact of fewer outstanding BCE common shares were offset by increased depreciation, that was from the Nimiq 4 satellite, which you'll recall was commissioned last fall, and the new Bell campuses. And as well we had slightly lower interest income on our temporary cash deposits.</p>
          <p>Our statutory EPS for the first quarter was $0.48 compared to $0.32 last year, and that year-over-year improvement was due to the charge that we took in the first quarter of 2008 to accrue obligations under the CRTC's deferral account.</p>
          <p>And lastly on this slide, despite the year-over-year increase in capital spending and higher cash pension, as well as higher restructuring payments, we generated solid free cash flow of $272 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>So let me turn to the segmented results starting with wireless. Wireless service revenue growth was more modest compared to previous quarters increasing by a little over 3%. The growth in wireless service revenues came from strong data usage and an improving postpaid mix.</p>
          <p>But continuing pricing pressures with discount brands and the weaker economy contributed to lower voice ARPU. Wireless product revenues were up 12.2% and that reflected both increased handset sales, and higher average handset prices, as we penetrated more smartphone activations and those represented approximately half of our total gross additions, so I'd say good traction on the data side in wireless.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in wireless grew 6%, benefiting from lower retention costs and pretty disciplined handset pricing, and that yielded a revenue flow-through to EBITDA of 80% and a margin improvement of 1.1% to 44%, so reasonable wireless financial performance.</p>
          <p>In the wireline segment, as I said, we maintained good momentum in video, Internet and local voice, and all that led to about a 10% year-over-year increase in average revenue per residential household. The pace of local voice erosion continued to slow owing to fewer NAS line losses and we saw good traction from home phone offers and SmartTouch services.</p>
          <p>Despite the solid performance in residential, overall wireline revenues decreased 2.4% year-over-year, and that reflects the more challenging business markets. In particular, I'd say our SMB unit has been the hardest hit by increased bankruptcies and reduced employment levels, and we've seen those impacts, which has led to increased access line disconnections and relatedly the reduction in toll revenues.</p>
          <p>Our Enterprise performance was better, but also impacted by softness in equipment sales and volume declines in connectivity. Those pressures were partly offset by good growth in IP Broadband and managed and professional ICT services.</p>
          <p>And with labor savings from our 100-day workforce reductions and our focus on reducing discretionary spending in G&amp;A expenses, wireline EBITDA margin actually increased a touch year-over-year to 38.3%.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, I've provided a breakdown of the components of BCE's free cash flow for the quarter. As you know, there is seasonality associated with our cash flow, particularly in the first quarter. In the first quarter, we incur payments for income taxes, public utility taxes, property taxes, variable compensation plan payments and a number of other license and insurance payments are all made in the first quarter. So I think if you go back historically in BCE and Bell Canada, the first quarter has always been a slow quarter in terms of free cash flow generation, but this is very much in fact exceeding our targets for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So free cash flow before common dividends was 272 million; as I say, that's ahead of our plan. Compared to the first quarter of last year, the cash flow is down $32 million. I mentioned our increased capital spending; that used up $26 million more in cash year-over-year. And in addition, as I outlined at our Analyst Day meeting last February, our cash pension funding is up; in the quarter, pension funding was up $46 million year-over-year.</p>
          <p>First quarter cash flow also reflected higher cash restructuring payments related to our workforce and real estate reduction initiatives. As you can see on the waterfall chart, offsetting those pressures was increased underlying EBITDA and some favorability in working capital compared to the first quarter last year. That was from increased payables and tighter inventory management. So all in all, we're on track to deliver our free cash flow target of 1.75 to 1.9 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>So before I turn it to George, I do want to circle back to the principles that we outlined last February in regards to our capital structure model, where I certainly think we're delivering good execution.</p>
          <p>Our common share dividend increase of 5% became effective with our first quarter dividend payment on April 15. We've also now completed our targeted repurchase of 40 million common shares of BCE under our NCIB program at an average repurchase price of about 24.65. We believe that represents good value and is accretive to our EPS.</p>
          <p>With regard to our objective of maintaining high levels of liquidity, we've just completed the renewal of our 1.4 billion revolving credit facilities. That is now fully committed for a new three year term and this, together with the 2.3 billion of cash on hand at the Bell BCE level at the end of the quarter, as well as the substantial ongoing operating cash flow we expect to generate through the balance of the year, I think all of that provides us with more than sufficient resources to meet the 1.5 billion of debt maturities this year.</p>
          <p>And in fact, today you'll see in our announcement that we will early redeem BCE's Series C debentures in the amount of $650 million prior to their maturity later this year. And we think there is good financial return for us in doing that.</p>
          <p>So with that I'll hand it over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Siim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning.</p>
          <p>I'm on to my slide deck now which would be slide number ten and let me first of all start by just making a few quick comments on our strategic imperatives.</p>
          <p>On all five imperatives I believe we made progress this quarter; two here I'll just quickly comment on, core we think to the success of the company in the marketplace. One is the improvement in customer service. We continue to see with now 95% completion of our Same Day Next Day service on all three of our consumer household products.</p>
          <p>And that is driving a savings in costs, not driving costs up. In fact, we've seen a 14% year-over-year reductions into our call centers because of the performance that we're bringing to the marketplace now in terms of service. And again more work to do in that area.</p>
          <p>And then on the cost side, strategic imperative five, our wireline labor costs are down 7.4% year-over year, and our G&amp;A in the wireline business down about 12.5, approximately $80 million reduction year-over-year in our costs in the first quarter in those two lines in the wireline operation, enabling us to have our overall margin, as you see, increase in wireless as well and on the wireline side slightly.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, slide 11, we've just announced this morning, consistent with our strategic imperative to accelerate wireless, a decision we made obviously in agreement with Virgin Mobile and with Virgin to acquire the other 50% of Virgin Mobile we did not own. We've entered into a long-term brand arrangement with Virgin. The Virgin fee -- the fee that we are paying Virgin for the brand remains the same as it was in the partnership so that does not change. We will not be disclosing that amount for competitive reasons.</p>
          <p>We think it maximizes our flexibility for flanker brand management going forward, with over time the ability to consider moving to one flanker brand versus two in the marketplace. We also believe that it allows us to leverage our acquisition of The Source by bringing Virgin to The Source on top of the Bell brand in early January of next year.</p>
          <p>The acquisition price, net of taxes, is approximately $102 million, and Siim will be happy after the call to take the analysts through this in a little more detail if required. In terms of the valuation, we've in essence acquired the position for the investment that our partner had made in the company, and also it is well south of what we would pay on a cost of acquisition basis for the net adds that we add through the additional 50% ownership.</p>
          <p>It doesn't change our overall sub count, because as you know our total sub count included the Virgin 100% subs. We will not be disclosing the subs that we've acquired or that COA for competitive reasons, but I'm sure the analyst community can see at that price and with the acknowledgement from me that it's equal to the investment that our partners put in that it moves us in the right direction and gives us the right flexibility.</p>
          <p>In terms of the timing, why now? One I mentioned was with the pending closing of The Source, the ability to take the Virgin brand and the Bell brand to 750 new distribution points, with the pending world of our new technology HSPA in early 2010, with the introduction of a fourth carrier with the work we are seeing taking place in the marketplace by our competitors on the flanker brand side, and with Virgin beginning to build momentum in the postpaid market, we thought it was timely to move forward with moving the organization to a 100% owned asset for us.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide 12 just a quick update on The Source. We are on track to close in the third quarter, as we had indicated before. Two things to remind people, we really will not be in the stores with Bell wireless products or now Virgin wireless products until the first quarter of 2010, because of an exclusive contract that The Source has with our competitor, Rogers.</p>
          <p>One interesting new point of information as we've got closer to the asset is the amount of TV business that it does and about 90% of the TV business that it does is not Bell's today and we think that also represents a significant distribution opportunity for us for Bell TV satellite services and for future TV services we might bring to the market over time.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13, Siim already commented on the financials in wireless. I'll just make a few quick comments here. I think in terms of the net adds having postpaid increase year-over-year is obviously a positive for us. I hope you would agree that the strategic things we're doing this morning and in January with The Source, continues to drive us and put ourselves in the position to gain the market share we're targeting over time.</p>
          <p>I think the important thing for investors is the ARPU conversation for the industry. Our ARPU is down as well this quarter. What really took place, as Siim mentioned, we've seen a growth -- 36% --in data revenue. What we saw was out-of-bucket usage on voice plans were down, we think driven principally by the economy. Not as much yet the flanker brand issues because frankly that's hard to impact the entire base, so we believe it's more economic.</p>
          <p>Having said that, obviously pleased that we held COA constant, our term rate constant and more importantly with real tight cost management, we're able to have an 80% flow through and see our margin expand there. But it is obviously, in this economy the wireless industry is singing in Canada and we're not immune to that.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, as Siim mentioned, we continue to track as we had hoped in terms of our consumer NAS performance; you can see year-over-year a reduction in our residential NAS losses from 106 (sic) [106,000] last year to 78,000, so clearly moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Where we have seen softness is in the SMB market and you'll see 119 to 104 (sic) [119,000 to 104,000], so a reduction overall. But where we saw an acceleration was in SMB. And as Siim said, we believe it is clearly driven by the economy and we -- obviously if the economy stays soft we would expect to continue to see that type of impact.</p>
          <p>Also, in the long distance area where we saw some impact again was in the SMB side. So on the consumer side, meeting our expectations, frankly, ahead of our expectations, and strong, and on the small business side, clearly an impact from the economy.</p>
          <p>Overall, though, our sixth consecutive quarter of improving NAS results, a reduction in actual NAS losses year-over-year, consistent with our goals this year that we outlined at the Investor Conference.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 15, we had a strong quarter with our TV product video performance, excellent revenue growth again at 8.7%, ARPU up $4 year-over-year and starting to move in the right direction on net adds at 12,000 net adds in the quarter, obviously much stronger than last year, while maintaining a low churn and strong EBITDA growth. Our continued positioning on the HD and PVR in the marketplace is benefiting us.</p>
          <p>And then in addition, this morning consistent with our strategy of accelerating wireline, and as I mentioned at our Investor Conference, needing to accelerate our distribution arrangements, we've done that with The Source. We've done that this morning, we believe, with Virgin. And this morning we also are announcing, as Telus will be announcing, that we've entered into an agreement with Telus in Western Canada, where they will begin to resell Bell TV under their brand in their western territories.</p>
          <p>We will continue to compete with them in Western Canada and market in Western Canada, and obviously launch the Bell brand through The Source stores nationally. But in addition, we're excited about this relationship with Telus. We've had an excellent relationship with them, even though they're our competitor on the wireless network build, and in this area we think they'll be an excellent distribution channel for us going forward in Western Canada.</p>
          <p>And I'll leave this more to Telus to talk about because early this quarter some of the things we think they may be doing in their market in Western Canada.</p>
          <p>So I think strong momentum on the TV side for the company and stronger, we believe, going forward with that announcement this morning.</p>
          <p>In terms of our overall data business, a reasonable revenue growth on the service side at 3.6%, but as Siim mentioned, soft hardware sales doesn't necessarily flow through to EBITDA, but is indicative of the economy and I would also say consistent with our strategy to try to stay away from low margin hardware sales.</p>
          <p>Overall, our consumer high-speed business saw an increase in ARPU year-over-year of 10% and actually reasonable net adds in consumer. But the net adds of 6,000 overall again were driven by softness in SMB.</p>
          <p>So we would probably continue to say, we'd like to see more growth on the Broadband net add side, but on the residential side we probably would have actually said there was a reasonable quarter and impacted by SMB.</p>
          <p>FTTN continues to be on track in terms of our build out, and on schedule as we talked about at the last Investor Conference.</p>
          <p>So in summary on page 17, making progress on all of our strategic fronts, as we laid out, the service level improving in the marketplace and actually driving cost out of the company, enhancing our wireless distribution accelerating our wireless businesses with the type of announcements we made this morning, NAS continuing to decline despite some of the SMB pressures, HSPA on track for launch in early 2010, and overall, keeping a very disciplined eye on our cost, such that we're able to maintain margins year-over-year.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn it over to Thane and we'll take questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Vince Valentini from TD Newcrest. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. George, on the wireless side, I understand the voice ARPU pressures, everybody is seeing that, but the deceleration in your data revenue growth was a bit concerning to me, of 36% versus 54% you did in the fourth quarter. Was there anything specific there, or is that something you would hope to able to drive back up? Is there some sort of sensitivity to the economy in that number as well or is it just not getting as many smartphones out as you maybe would like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question, Vince. I think we just have to keep doing better at it. I have to admit I wasn't on the management side sitting with the guys saying, why was it 50 versus the 36. But to be clear, you're right, we've got to just continue to drive our share of the data.</p>
          <p>We think we will have that opportunity, obviously, on the HSPA side when we roll that out next year, but continuing to see really strong data growth in the organization. So I'm not frankly concerned with this. I think we are through the distribution channel working handsets we're launching in the marketplace. I feel really quite positive about that.</p>
          <p>I mean my real concern on wireless is really twofold. One I think we've all talked about, you've mentioned it, is the economy issue and secondly is the flanker brand pricing that we've seen in the marketplace. And over time that obviously has some impact on ARPU and hopefully will be offset by data but to this point has not, in addition to being offset at this point.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Allen from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, George. You mentioned the excellent relationship that you have with Telus and it seems pretty clear between the wireless and on the satellite side that the businesses can complement and strengthen one another. What are your current thoughts on a merger between the two companies? Is this the right time to be looking at it again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're focused on execution and now hopefully people have seen it in our results, execution this quarter consistent with our strategy. We have an excellent relationship. We also compete like them in the marketplace like there is no tomorrow in terms of getting customers. But where there is things that we can do to drive value for our shareholders, such as, we think, this resale arrangement today on TV or something like a network sharing agreement we're going to do. We believe those are shareholder friendly things to do and from a competitive standpoint drives competitive intensity now for TV in Western Canada. So the consumer actually ends up with more choice and our benefit here is that we have an extra channel of distribution selling in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you mentioned execution in the near-term as being a clear priority and I agree with that. Longer term, though, do you see the benefits of the merger between the two of them clearly benefiting the cost structure? And is it an eventuality that we see further consolidation in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're focused on executing value for our shareholders for the dividend growth strategy we talked about and the capital market strategy. So I really have no comments today on the idea of a merger with Telus.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Dvai Ghose from Genuity Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks good morning, George and Siim. A quick question on the NAS performance, very good on the res side as you've pointed out. I'm wondering to what extent you think that will be compromised by Rogers' new pricing which is just being unveiled, simpler, lower-end pricing. We saw the impact when Shaw, even Videocon brought in lower end pricing. And secondly on the business side again you attribute the softness to the economy, which is very understandable especially in the SMB side. But to what extent is it a market share issue with cable and is there a risk especially with DOCSIS 3.0 that cable starts taking some enterprise market share along with some SMB market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Thanks, Dvai. On the Rogers' new pricing, yeah, we'll have to see the impact of that. Obviously it's a competitive marketplace and so we'll have to react accordingly in the market.</p>
          <p>I would say that our improvement in service levels, we think is really responsible for what we're beginning to see in driving a reduction in NAS, improvement in Internet service that frankly our customers have told us that the best service level we've given them in four to five years on the Internet side is what we're going to rely on to a large extent to compete with, and quite frankly stay away from full-out price competition. So we'll obviously monitor those developments.</p>
          <p>On SMB, it appears, Dvai, to be less market share and much more economic, we saw it in the first quarter where inbound calls for new businesses, I don't want to overstate it, but let's just say we're very soft in Ontario and Quebec, as there weren't a lot of new businesses being created.</p>
          <p>And so that's really where we saw it. We didn't actually see an acceleration overall in our churn. It was the inbound from the economy that hit it. And then obviously, we have some customers who are getting into financial issues where they ultimately go out of business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. George, we've heard Rupert Murdoch, John Chambers talk about stabilization, perhaps signs of improvement at the margin. What are you seeing in your business trends in the last couple of months; are things stabilizing? And any sort of signs of hope for the second quarter and beyond? Or is it still a significant pressure as you go through the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think it's too early to make that call. We continue on the Enterprise side, although we had a stable EBITDA quarter. There is no doubt with the contraction in employment on the Enterprise side that new projects are slower in developing. So we think it's too early to make that type of call. And so we're planning through our cost structures in terms of implementation to stay ahead of that possible issues on the demand side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking the call. Wanted to ask questions on Solo and then Virgin Mobile and how you're branding that. Is there a point where you have too many brands and you kind of don't differentiate well? And then just on the Solo brand, are you focusing more marketing dollars on that brand in the tough macro? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I would say the strategy this morning of acquiring the remaining 50% of the Virgin Mobile brand is long-term we believe an indication that we -- I would agree with your point that at the end of the day, the requirement for three brands in the marketplace. We will consider that once we've done the closing, executed through this year and in the next year and then make a decision on the multiple brand approach.</p>
          <p>We think being able to put all of our resources behind the one ultimately may be the best thing to do in the marketplace on the discount brand side. I will say very clearly that Virgin will be taken to The Source stores and Solo will not go to The Source stores, so that we absolutely maximize the value of this acquisition this morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Question is on the credit side actually as it relates to the equity side spreads on your medium term debt in about 100 basis points since February, that's about 40 to 50 basis points tighter than average, at least from the calculations I've done. You've got a new credit facility, you've got tons of cash to be able to facilitate the remainder of the debt buyback for the remainder of the year. Is it possible that you increase the share buyback, at least later in this year, once you know what 2010 debt costs are looking like? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. It's Siim, I'll answer that question. We do believe that there is encouraging signs in the debt capital markets with the return of liquidity. As you say, credit spreads are narrowing. I indicated at our Investor Day that our clear intention is to repay the $1.5 billion of debt that matures in 2009; we will do that.</p>
          <p>In light of the strengthening of the debt markets, I would say that we will look at the opportunity to access those markets in the second half of 2009 and that refinancing activity would be directed towards our 2010 debt maturity. So if we're successful in pursuing that, we will have available a continued strong cash position for the company.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, and good morning. I just want to focus a little bit on the cost side, especially on the Bell wireline, looks like really good performance on the sequential basis on your operating cost down about 10% sequentially and down about 3% year-over-year. Can you guys talk about like, how much of your labor cost reductions have been flowing through the numbers and how much should we expect for the rest of the year and maybe help us quantify that a little bit? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll make a few comments. Our guidance of stable EBITDA and the stable revenue and you may remember on the -- in -- at the Investor Conference I mentioned that if not for the economy, in fairness I don't think our EBITDA guidance would be on the -- in the term stable because of the costs that we have removed in the organization and in all areas of production of cost.</p>
          <p>And so we will continue as we go forward looking for those opportunities. As you may recall, at the Investor Day we announced we had a retirement program that we had launched just in January. We've had 1,200 people accept those offers and they will, over a course of 18 months, leave the organization. We would anticipate ending this year through that program and other just not replacing people who leave the company, about another 1,000 people will not be in the organization by year-end, but that's in one sense already announced at the Investor Day, but confirmed through a successful program that we've had on the retirement program. So that will flow through.</p>
          <p>And then also continuing work on the buy side, on the vendor side, particularly in the area of IT, where we're looking to lower our costs there in operations. And as you acknowledged, since we appreciated in the first quarter, you can see that in our numbers where I mentioned our G&amp;A line and our labor line combined on the wireline were down a little over $80 million year-over-year, which is what we're looking for, real absolute dollar reduction year-over-year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Just on the satellite, this is the second very strong quarter on net adds for the satellite service, can you talk a bit about what's driving some of that in this environment. And related to that, I realize you want to leave details on the agreement with Telus to Telus. But, I think currently your &#x2013; Bell pays only a sales commission to Aliant on that resale agreement. Just wondering if you could talk on whether that detail as far as Bell is concerned, is the same for Telus? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the TV results we think are being driven, one, by we think from an HD perspective. It's the best product in Canada. And if you've haven't got our service, if you use it, I think you'll agree. And I think that's why we're seeing the customer acceptance and we've been marketing that very clear message all the time, Bell TV in HD. And so we see that in our results.</p>
          <p>The real important thing is the low, low churn rate we get in that business, allowing some of the net adds to flow through. And I would say in the last few years, we obviously weren't seeing that. So starting to see momentum there. And then the work we're doing on the service distribution side, I think are all helping to drive it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Telus arrangement, no, it's a very unique arrangement with Telus. They have a unique distribution position in Western Canada and it's a rebranding. So Telus will have, and I want to leave this to them, but they're going to rebrand it under the Telus brand and -- which is different than anything we do with anyone else in Canada. And it's a different arrangement because they're actually going to be -- if it's Telus' brand you can imagine they'll be sending the bills out, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But again I want to leave this to -- in fairness to them to talk about, because it's really their distribution strategy. For us, it's a strategy of how to access more customers, more revenue for our satellite, that frankly, if it has capacity, we should be looking for ways to leverage that. And I want to make sure to the analyst community that we're very clear that we are not in any way leaving Western Canada in terms of our selling of the product in the West. So it's an add-on distribution channel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. George, I wonder if you can talk about wireline replacement trends in your market. I mean in the U. S. we've seen much higher percentages of houses having wireless only; in Canada, it's been creeping up, and we've all been expecting that to start to accelerate. Can you talk about what you're seeing and what you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glen, we talk about it every month and to be -- quite frankly, we've not seen an acceleration this year over last year in that area. So we have not seen an acceleration and there is a couple of things that I'll just bring to people's attention.</p>
          <p>In Canada, literally every consumer rate plan now includes unlimited evening and weekends. So people already have unlimited calling for wireless if they choose to use it in the home. And so, people often talk about, wow, but if there's unlimited rate plans that come to the market like MetroPCS through a fourth carrier, that would drive substitution. It may, but it is important to understand we have had unlimited evening and weekend calling, and in most cases I think it starts now around 6:00 for the consumer and so they can use that.</p>
          <p>We have not seen a real acceleration there. Obviously, the difference between us and the U.S. market and we're going to do everything, obviously, that we can to &#x2013; to do -- bring value to that product and through our Internet services to make sure we have that contact in the home, so no acceleration yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

Just back on the Belus TV -- I mean the Telus TV and the Bell TV, I'm wondering if you can talk about how many MDU homes passed Bell now reaches and how that might have been last year and if that's maybe the angle that Telus will be able to take advantage of would they be doing the same sort of thing?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I want to leave that to Darren, I think, to talk about their strategy because frankly I'm not aware what their strategy will be other than we believe they will be successful in selling the product in their market or we wouldn't have appointed them as a distributor. So we think they will do fine. And so I'll leave that to them.</p>
          <p>In terms of in our market we do have a focus on MDUs with our Bell TV product and are seeing as we get access to those facilities an increase in penetration and at the same time as you know one of our strategies was to begin to take fiber right to the basements of multiple dwelling units so that we're set up for the future for the best broadband performance we can have and to complement that if required with other TV products over time. But I'll leave that question for you ask our competitor in the West.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much. I'd like to ask question on Broadband, if I could. You noted, George, that fiber-to-the-node subscribers were up for broadband services to customers. That would imply with 6,000 overall broadband adds, if I recall right, that your DSL was down. I was just wondering if you could draw some, put some color on what's happening and perhaps strategies you might use on the non-FTTN markets in the interim. Some of the U.S. players are obviously trying to reverse that negative trend on DSL. And if you could talk about some of the regional differences, because I know that the cable companies are obviously have different degrees of success whether it's Quebec or Ontario. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, a few things. One of the strategies on DSL, the part of the answer to that is the acceleration of our build out of our FTTN, because we clearly see a significant churn difference on FTTN clients relative to DSL. And we continue to see that. So we are accelerating our FTTN subscribers obviously not just through net adds which you raised, but also through conversions from DSL to FTTN because we see the churn rate drop and we see the ARPU go up and obviously the customer satisfaction changes.</p>
          <p>And as you know, in our world that client ultimately is or becomes a NAS client, so it's important we do both. So part of the strategy is accelerating the FTTN footprintis really the work to deal with those issues.</p>
          <p>And then also a lot of grooming we have done on the DSL side to improve that service in markets where we're not bringing FTTN but obviously those markets are more challenged than where we're building FTTN out.</p>
          <p>In terms of cable results, really the cable companies reports I'll leave it them to report on their operations. Suffice it to say we still have more work to do in Quebec and we're working hard at that. Seeing some progress I think particularly on TV this quarter but more work to do and we're looking forward to, as I said, expanding our distribution through The Source outlets that are there in the province of Quebec to help us even further in the next year.</p>

          <p>Other than improving the DSL performance itself, which is probably the right thing to do, is there other things you need to do on DSL, either price or promotion-wise to stem the tide for the time being until your FTTN is built out, or are you just -</p>

          <p>Well, we are focused on FTTN but if Kevin were on the call, he'd tell you there's clearly tactics that we are undertaking in the market every quarter, every day to try to hold on to clients, no matter which of the services they're on, but clearly we have acceleration of FTTN for the reason you're getting to which is the move as quickly as we can to it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So the last question is from Peter MacDonald from GMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Peter.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. On Virgin, any valuation information you can give us will be helpful, but just on the questions, when you say that you purchased it for less than COA does that mean average COA or the COA of a similar quality customer? And now that you control two of the flanker brands, are you hopeful that more rational pricing from that segment is achievable? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, on a &#x2013; there's two ways to look at it. On a net cost per add, it's so significantly below what we would pay to add those many subscribers. So to get those 50% of those subscribers -- as you know how the market works, you have to add so many gross to get to that net. And so it's under what it would have cost us per net add. And on the gross add side, it's certainly below our weighted COA average, and significantly below that, and consistent with the type of COA we should be spending for this revenue stream.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, the right relationship with our partner going forward. And if you think about us returning to them their capital investments, think about the amount of investment we therefore made the same investment to get it to this level, to then be able to acquire the strategic benefit of having the 100% of this going forward, the prices we're very comfortable with.</p>
          <p>And I do apologize a little bit for seeming so mysterious on it. But we really think it's in our shareholders interest not to disclose the subscriber base in this area because of our competitor interest in this. And given the price and our revealing that it really is equivalent to the cost that obviously we put in, because it's the same as what our partner has put in, but that would get everybody comfortable. And then of course the benefit of the tax loss carry-forward flows to us, because we can use this &#x2013; right away in 2010, we'll use the tax loss carry-forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on opportunity for more rational pricing in that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we'll just -- there is no -- it's a competitive marketplace and we'll see how it unfolds. I think it is fair to say people know we've been the responder to that market and part of the strategy today is we think Virgin is going to be a very great brand for us to have in the flanker brand marketplaces developed in Canada, and quite frankly, stronger than the flanker brand we have today.</p>
