          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q4 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our first speaker, Mr. Peter Voser. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. And good afternoon, everybody. Simon and I will take you through the results and portfolio developments for the fourth quarter and specifically for the full year 2010. And we will have plenty of time for your questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly, take a moment to read the disclaimer. The world is in an era of important geopolitical transitions, strong volatility and intensified economic cycles. Emerging nations like China and India are going through intensive developments. The recession interrupted the oil and commodity price boom but it may well return. This is a complex and volatile landscape for the energy industry and an opportunity for Shell.</p>
          <p>A year ago, I mapped out a three year plan for Shell to 2012. The focus is on three strategy priorities: improving our near term performance, growing the company by bringing new projects on stream and generating new options for future growth.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to say, that we have made good progress on all of these themes in 2010. Our 2010 CCS earnings excluding identified items were $18 billion and earnings per share increase of 56 year-on-year percent.</p>
          <p>This improvement comes despite pressure on downstream margins and natural gas prices. We have taken out $2 billion of costs and we sold $7 billion of non-core assets with exits from 12% of our refining capacity. We increased our upstream production by 5%.</p>
          <p>We made eight new discoveries and made strategic acquisitions in unconventional gas and biofuels. Project delivery is going well and I will update you on that including Qatar in a moment. So overall good progress on our plans in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me say that also although we made good progress overall in 2010, I'm not satisfied with the fourth quarter results. These results underscore why we have set out the three year plan for a better performance from Shell and we have more to do. We have reduced underlying costs by $2 billion in 2010, bringing the total cost reduction for '09 and '10 to $4 billion or about 10%.</p>
          <p>But we haven't stopped here. We have a series of continuous improvement programs on the way across the company. These plans in total are expected to deliver further multibillion dollar cost savings in the near future.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we should expect to see increases in headline costs in the areas where we are targeting growth. However, our continuous improvement plans should go some way to offset these trends.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on our asset sales program. 2010 asset sales proceeds were $7 billion, essentially completing our 2010 and '11 targets for $7 billion to $8 billion. This includes exits from seven of our eight non-core refineries and continued progress in refocusing our marketing portfolio. We have exited from 450,000 barrels per day of refining capacity in 2010, or about 12% of our total and this brings the reductions in 2010 to almost 30% or 1.2 million-barrels per day. Total asset sales in the last five years were some $30 billion which is a rollover of about 20% of our capital employed. From here, the pace of asset sales could slow although we expect some $5 billion for 2011 including some $2 billion of proceeds still to come from these done across the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to gross delivery. We have a sequence of new projects for 2010 and 2011 start up that underpin our production and cash flow targets for 2012. We've made good progress in '10 with six new startups. Let me give you an example. In Nigeria, the Gbaran-Ubie gas project has ramped up well and is on track for its peak production of some 250,000 barrels or BOEs per day. This adds to Nigeria's LNG supply capacity and we will feed electricity supplies for local communities. Now our most recent startup in early 2011 was in Qatar. Let me say more about that with the next slide.</p>
          <p>2011 is going to be an exciting year for Shell in Qatar. We have two projects there, both due for startup this year, Pearl GTL and Qatargas 4 LNG. Together, these projects which will cost about $20 billion for Shell and will add some 350,000 BOEs per day to our production, which is over 10% of our current production worldwide today. The first of these, Qatargas 4 LNG is now in the start up phase. We started to produce LNG at Qatargas 4 in the last few days and we're expecting the first shipment of LNG in the next few weeks. Our second project in Qatar Pearl GTL is also making good progress. Major construction on both trains is now complete. This was a mammoth undertaking, 52,000 workers at the construction peak.</p>
          <p>Safety performance has been excellent and we have set new records in 2010 with 77 million working hours or hours worked on-shore without the lost time incident. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we made considerable progress on commissioning. More than half of the roughly 2,000 Train 1 systems we need have been brought to what we call ready for startup status. We have completed our Train 1 steam blowing. We have started our first air separation unit, imported gas, oil and condensate to do the live commissioning and load the catalyst in over half of our Train 1 reactors. So overall, a very satisfactory performance for what is a large and complex facility.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on progress with longer term options. We are working hard to turn exploration success into commercial production. In 2010, we took final investment decision on two new deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. And we've made good progress with new exploration and appraisal with eight new finds and further operational success. Now we are studying all of these results and will update you on the resource potential during our strategy presentation in March, like in previous years.</p>
          <p>2010 was also a busy year for new deals. We have added new acreage positions in 2010, some 53,000 square kilometers. The focus here has been on building up new plays for Shell. We have also made progress on Iraq Oil and in our downstream of biofuels joint venture in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Shell has a long history of successful partnerships with national oil companies. I would like to highlight the new momentum that we have built with NOCs in 2010 including deals with Petronas in Iraq, in Qatar, where we are in talks for a new petrochemicals plant in Saudi Arabia going forward in the <mark type="inaudible" /> quarter; other is China. We have concluded a series of deals with the Chinese NOCs in 2010.</p>
          <p>This included an upstream partnership in Syria, the joint acquisition of Arrow, the CBM-LNG play in Australia, gas exploration in China and exploration in Qatar, linking Shell QP and Chinese NOCs. Finally on NOCs, last &#x2013; late last year we signed a new MOU with Gazprom looking at joint expansion of our upstream activities in Russia, so <mark type="inaudible" /> invests in the new international partnership.</p>
          <p>Now before I hand you over to Simon, let me say a few words about safety. Safety is at the heart of everything that we do here at Shell. We managed personal and process safety with the positive trend you can see on this chart.</p>
          <p>Macondo was the largest ever deepwater blowout and the largest peace time oil spill for 100 years. We can all talk about causes and make all kinds of explanations, but the reality is that the picture has changed for the deepwater industry. There will be increased regulations and more public scrutiny on safety. To put it simply, our industry needs to rebuild trust with the communities we work in.</p>
          <p>Shell has a good track record in deepwater and we always look for ways to improve. We have completed an initial review of the Presidential Commission Report into Macondo and we agree with the majority of the findings. In particular, we shared a conclusion that the U.S. regulations and the risk management practices of some companies in the Gulf of Mexico do lag behind the standards set by other companies and set by regulators in other countries. We support the Commission's recommendation to introduce risk-based standards specific to the relevant activities, similar to the safety case approach in the North Sea.</p>
          <p>Now we at Shell have been applying the best of the North Sea standards to our worldwide operations for many years. This includes the safety case approach worldwide. On Shell's wells, the roles and responsibilities are clear both for accident prevention and incident response and we have a strong safety record.</p>
          <p>Let me also update you on the near term drilling outlook in the U.S. offshore. In the Gulf, I'm pleased to say that Shell is the first company to have successfully submitted the plans for exploration drilling three wells in the Auger area in accordance with the new <mark type="inaudible" /> standards for the Gulf. These permits are now with the authorities for review.</p>
          <p>In Alaska, Shell has the leading acreage position in offshore Alaska and this remains an interesting area for us in the longer term. We have been working rigorously for the past five years to meet and exceed all regulatory and permitting requirements in Alaska. However, despite our investment in acreage and technology and our work with stakeholders, we have not been able to drill a single exploration well.</p>
          <p>Our plans for drilling in 2010 were put on hold following the BP Macondo blowout. Despite our best efforts, critical permits continue to be delayed and the timeline for getting these permits is still uncertain. Therefore and regrettably because of these uncertainties we have decided not to drill in offshore Alaska in 2012 and stop the spending for these activities. We need urgent and timely actions on permitting and regulations in order to go ahead with 2012 the drilling program and we are working towards that.</p>
          <p>With that, I pass you to Simon on the results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks, Peter and I'll just take you through the fourth quarter numbers and give you a heads up on some of the key figures for 2011. First on the macro, if you look at the macro picture compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, the oil and gas prices have increased from a year ago levels, although, actually in North America the gas prices did decline. Refining margins increased from a year ago levels and chemicals margins increased in the United States, but they declined slightly in the other regions.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Shell's fourth quarter earnings, the headline current cost of supply earnings at $5.7 billion for the quarter, they included identified items of $1.6 billion, primarily gains on asset sales, mainly Woodside. Excluding the identified items, the CCS earnings were $4.1 billion and that's an earnings per share increase from Q4 2009 of 49%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5.5 billion. And the dividend for the fourth quarter was announced at US$0.42 per share. And we expect to announce the first quarter 2011 dividends as an unchanged US$0.42 per share although this of course, is a decision reserved for the Board at a later date.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we introduced the scrip dividend for the first time. The take up of the scrip was equivalent to around $600 million. And that's about a quarter of the dividend and we are offering the scrip again, of course, for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the business performance in a bit more detail. Firstly, the upstream, excluding the identified items the upstream earnings increased by 25% to $3.4 billion in Q4. And that was driven primarily by higher oil prices, higher realized gas prices outside of North America, and by the 5% increased volumes.</p>
          <p>We did see increased cost in some areas associated with, for example, start of activities in projects such as Canada, oil sands in Qatar and in Iraq. Of course, we are building up that operating capability ahead of the new revenue and production growth that we expect when the projects come on stream.</p>
          <p>We had overall another good quarter for production. The upstream production increased by around 5%, Q4 on Q4. And LNG sales volumes increased by 11% for the quarter. Through the full year, the production averaged 3.3 million-barrels of oil equivalent per day. Output from the new field and field ramp-ups was 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and that more than offset the natural field decline.</p>
          <p>Production this year was also boosted by external factors such as colder weather, particularly in Europe and North America and improved security situation in Nigeria. And therefore production was ahead of our original guidance for the year. Having said that, the growth was typically from lower margin barrels.</p>
          <p>For the full year the LNG sales volumes grew by 25%. That was underpinned by increased volumes in Nigeria LNG, largely increased supply from new projects and better security but also by the full ramp-up of Sakhalin LNG in Russia which has been producing above nameplate capacity for basically all of 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S. upstream where the whole of our industry, of course, is being impacted by the BP Macondo blowout; and Peter talked about the longer term implications and I'll focus on the financial impact. So we didn't actually receive any permits for new exploration or development drilling during Q4.</p>
          <p>As a result, we took a $70 million identified charge in the fourth quarter for the cost of the idled rigs, the four deep water floaters that we have in the region. This combined with the charges in the earlier quarters, Q2 and Q3, and the production shortfalls that led to an earning loss for Shell in the full year of $260 million. The equivalent was 10,000-barrels of oil equivalent per day of lost high value production, mainly liquids.</p>
          <p>By the year end that was a run rate approaching 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And we actually had to postpone around $700 million of planned investment in exploration and development during the year.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we are expecting around a 50,000 barrel a day impact against the plans that we had prior to the moratorium and that's an increase in the guidance for the loss we've previously had around 40,000. So recognizing the slow pace of any likely restart in the Gulf and the lack of any permits being issued to-date.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the downstream. Excluding the identified items, the downstream CCS earnings, they increased from the fourth quarter 2009 at around $482 million. Within this number the chemicals earnings increased substantially. This is driven by industry margins, lower costs and our actions to enhance the portfolio to improve the structure of the margins including conversion to gas feed.</p>
          <p>And the chemicals margins did fall at the end of the quarter reflecting higher naptha prices following the crude price up. And that will impact on into the first quarter of 2011. I should also update you that we have substantial planned downtime in the Singapore chemicals plant in the first quarter of 2011. So both factors will play a part.</p>
          <p>In refining, we did see an improvement in the industry refining margins and certainly year-on-year improved outcome. But the refining conditions do remain difficult overall. Reflected, of course, in the losses and refining in the quarter, which were around $460 million. That compounds with losses around $940 million last year in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The earnings were also impacted by exchange rate movements and refinery downtime. We had maintenance downtime planned and unplanned including cat crackers. Cat crackers being the main revenue generator in several of our refineries and we had that downtime at eight refineries in the fourth quarter. And it's also typical that we concentrate or focus our maintenance activities in Q4 and in Q1, which is typically higher -- a lower demand quarter.</p>
          <p>And the increased costs associated with the additional maintenance and the opportunity loss, the margin loss as a result of not operating, that cost us around $200 million in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2011, we're expecting similar or even slightly lower refinery availability compared with Q4, 2010. So, again, impact on Q1 results.</p>
          <p>The marketing earnings were broadly similar to a year ago. But at the year ago and in Q4 this is below the long-term trend, several hundred million dollars lower. In fact marketing and trading results in the quarter were around $375 million. We did see lower costs and we did better year-on-year in retail, lubricants and B2B.</p>
          <p>But trading overall saw a less favorable environment and a less positive contribution. Marketing margins and underlying volumes did decline compared to the third quarter of 2010 and that was mostly driven by the steady increase in oil prices although that was also impacted by some of the weather conditions we saw in the U.S. and Europe. So those are the earnings.</p>
          <p>Turn now to the cash flow. Cash generation on a rolling basis, that's a 12 month basis, was around $40 billion including $7 billion of disposal proceeds also excluding the working capital impact in CFFO. Now that was broadly balanced against the outflow of $39 billion for the year. Upstream and downstream businesses cash generation was in fact ahead of their own spending requirements. We remain and have been and will remain in a capital intensive stage as we invest for the new growth. We continue to watch the cash position and the balance sheet very closely, particular emphasis on cost and of course capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>So if I turn to CapEx and look at the balance sheet, we ended the year 2010 with gearing at 17.1%. That's several percentage points below earlier projections -- slightly down from the third quarter levels, comfortably in the target range of 0% to 30%, helped of course by divestments concluded in the quarter. Our return on capital in-service, i.e. currently producing assets was 18.5%. Of course that's only about two-thirds of the balance sheet about 65% at the moment. The rest of the balance sheet remains work in progress to produce in the future.</p>
          <p>2010, was also a busy year for acquisitions. $7 billion of acquisitions not yet including the conclusion of around $2 billion of the Cosan joint venture in Brazil which should close in the coming months. Those acquisitions were matched by an equivalent number $7 billion of asset sales. Both of these additions and divestments part of the drive to enhance the portfolio, upgrade the quality at the margin and to improve the capital efficiency. For 2011, we are expecting in line with earlier strategic statements, net capital investment, $25 billion to $27 billion and in line with that long term strategic plan we talked about a year ago. And you can see some of the details on this chart.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we will see spending rates decreasing in some of the plays like Qatar and Canada heavy oil that have dominated recent spending but we will step up in areas such as Australia, Iraq and of course there is the $2 billion to complete the Brazilian biofuel deal. So within this mix, I expect exploration spending of around $3 billion again this year. And our overall North American tight gas spending, where you will recall we talked about quite a wide range of possible spend, we'd expect that to be around $3 billion again this year. So both exploration and the tight gas spending of around $3 billion, similar to 2010 levels, excluding acquisitions of course, because around $6 billion of last year's acquisitions were actually in that area.</p>
          <p>Okay, with that, let me pass you back to Peter to summarize before we move to the Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Simon. Just a quick summary from my side, our performance in 2010 on the lines that we are diluting on our strategy, we are making good progress with our three strategic themes and targets for 2012. Our earnings increased by 56% year on year, $2 billion of costs we took out so $7 billion of non-core assets, which exceeds some 12% of our refining capacity.</p>
          <p>We increased our operating production by 5%, made new discoveries and made strategic acquisitions in unconventional gas and biofuels. So overall, good progress on our plans in 2010 and Shell is back on track for growth. Thank you very much. Back to the operator for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And the first question comes from Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I think at the first half stage, you were then 12% of your 2012 sort of cash target. And obviously there seems to have been a move away from that in terms of the 4Q numbers. Obviously, Simon, you talked about some issues impacted the quarter. Is there anything else you would like to draw to our attention in terms of being not quite special items but slightly one-off or exceptional at this stage? And then the second question was how did you manage to spend $4 billion less than you had thought you would during the course of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will pass this one on too, Lucy. Good afternoon, Lucy, anyway.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Lucy, thank you Peter; thank you, Lucy. Just to reiterate, the cash flow performance and targets; in 2009, it was actually adjusted for working capital, $24 billion cash generation. That's the basis for the 50% and 80% growth targets at $60 or $80. Adjusted for working capital it was 33 in 2010. And coincidentally actually '09 was roughly $60 world and 2010 was roughly an $80 world albeit with -- in both cases gas and refining margins below where we would expect mid-cycle to be. That cash flow in any given quarter or half actually is impacted by working capital. I think you need to take that into account when looking at any short-term cash flow generations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think even making for those adjustments, which I would agree we always strip the working capital movements out. But certainly you seemed a lot closer to targets sort of in the mid-year year point. Now perhaps annualizing the 4Q would be unfair but even for the full year 2010 numbers clearly you are a bit farther away than you were at the midpoint of the year. And I just wondered if there had anything exceptional in the first half. Or something exceptional in the second half that perhaps is dragging back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me finish, Lucy. I was going to get on to the question. The impacts for -- of course, the first half we were producing better in the Gulf of Mexico than we were in the second half. So there is some impact there, <mark type="inaudible" /> is what we have left on the table. Tax payments typically are back-end loaded in the year. That is an always ongoing effect. Those two effects definitely come through. Q4, against previous quarters, I don't want to give you a very long shopping list but there are some things to think about.</p>
          <p>In the upstream, around $450 million income impact from startup costs, higher taxes and royalties and that's on the income statement, not just paid. And that's partly revaluation of deferred tax assets in Brazil and also lower contribution from gas trading. The market is just less volatile. And most of that in the upstream showed in UA. So it's $450 million there.</p>
          <p>I talked about refining. We &#x2013; the operational impacts basically left $200 million on the table. The DIE impact is another $200 million and marketing of course is coming in $400 million below the typical trading range of $800 million to $1.1 billion that we've done in most quarters. And when I say DIE effect, is effect of the foreign exchange movement. When the euro strengthens we get a benefit, when the euro weakens we get a negative, and we've had very significant euro-dollar impacts this year.</p>
          <p>In fact, the absolute impact of Q4 wasn't that big. So it's really the comparative impact that you see coming through. It's positive in Q3, negative in Q2 and a year ago it was roughly neutral as well. So that does introduce volatility. So yes, there are in Q4 several impacts, that all feed through to the cash flow. Most of them, if not one-off, they do not occur structurally every quarter in the same direction. So hopefully that helps.</p>
          <p>And second area, how did we manage to spend $4 billion less. Well, we go into the year with a $28 billion capital target. Peter keeps in his back pocket a hold-back to the $4 billion which is the maximum flexibility that we had. During the year, some of that was allocated directly toward the smaller acquisitions that we made. The larger acquisitions were then effectively offset by the divestment increase.</p>
          <p>The Gulf of Mexico saved us, in that sense, $700 million of investment and you will be pleased to hear we have taken some cost out. We delivered a few projects early, so there is a contribution from both cost takeout and projects starting up early. We also chose not to do one or two things. So overall, it all added up and our aim was to manage the net investment and the balance sheet accordingly. And you can see the outcome hopefully in the results.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I've got three questions hopefully, but all three of them quick. The first is just &#x2013; it's notable how little money you're making in North America at the moment. And I guess some of that, as you referenced, is Gulf of Mexico. But I noticed you're still going to spend another $3 billion in tight gas. At what point do you start to reappraise that portfolio shift that you've been conducting?</p>
          <p>The second is, can you just hazard a guess, at what you would think in normal circumstances your capital in service would be? And then the third is just, a question, a long time ago it always seemed to be that certainly at the fourth quarter, Shell had a lot more costs coming in. And I kind of worked on the assumption that the tight centralization that had come into the business and new accounting systems et cetera would do away with that. Can you just talk to how you can have fairly dramatic sort of shifts in how you're booking costs through a quarterly period, please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, John and good afternoon. I'll take number one and three and capital service I will leave to Simon.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about North American first. I think making money you can talk about it in terms of earnings or you can talk about it in terms of cash. Simon talked about the special stuff in Q4 and you have been with us obviously in North America, et cetera. So we are driving the operational performance and we are driving actually quite clearly our efforts to top performance excluding obviously the Gulf of Mexico issues, which we have had.</p>
          <p>So if you actually would take -- if you take a cash view on this, the Americas or UA actually performed rather well, substantially above the earnings as most of the hits which we have had were actually non-cash items, et cetera. So I think the way we or I manage at the moment, UA is clearly on a cost basis, but also on a cash basis.</p>
          <p>We obviously keep earnings in mind. But that's really how we are driving it and I'm pleased to the way they are performing on the gas side in terms of optimizing cash costs and costs in general. I'm pleased with the progress on total costs related to the rest of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Have to say obviously as we have AOSPs start-up across the first half of 2011. So we have the <mark type="inaudible" /> start-up that the upgrade is still to come. We had higher costs for that but we didn't get the revenue, so that had obviously quite clearly an impact.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I think we are on the right track. Measuring the cash earnings, which are substantial and then therefore, I think I'm pleased with the progress so far. Also we have in the UA actually, the highest percentage of known productive assets given our acquisition drive and our investments over the last few years. It is actually higher than in the rest of the group, so as you look at the returns, fewer earnings returns, you need to take that into account as well.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, I think we have improved because indeed in the past, this was a little bit of problem of Shell with the centralization of the systems, I mean the way we actually monitor our monthly account. We have improved; it's maybe not everywhere completely done, but we have improved considerably over the last two years. I wouldn't say that this is our biggest problem in Q4.</p>
          <p>I think some of the operational things that Simon has said were much more kind of at our minds when we looked at our results and where we see &#x2013; where we always check that we have the right strategic initiatives in place to sort out a few things, which we still have to sort out. So yes, it's a problem which we know. It's a problem we have worked on quite a bit and it is getting better. We are not yet completely there. Capital in service, I'll pass on to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. There is some linkage between the questions as well. The capital out of service at the year end, the balance sheet was $194 billion of capital employed; we had $44 billion work-in-progress projects ready to roll hopefully in the next year or so. More than half of that is in Qatar and Canada oil sands because the Upgrader is not operational. It will drop clearly as those three projects come on-stream. It will then go back up again as we continue to invest. This is our business model, so and that number will not reduce to zero. It probably will run at a level below 44, but more towards 30 maybe plus or minus. And let's see as it goes forward. We also have around $19, $20 billion of lease bonuses or acquisition premium.</p>
          <p>For example on east resources, lease bonuses and some of the acquisition premium we do amortize anyway. Because it's in North America that amortization before we actually produce does impact the results. So if there is an impact there that drives earnings down but has no cash flow impact in our upstream America result. That piece of capital becomes active as we bring the assets into production. So the piece in the gas, particularly the unconventional gas, as we develop and produce, east resource acreage for example, that will reduce and returns will increase. So quite closely linked answers and I don't know where that $19 to $20 billion will go. I hope we continue to acquire new acreage going forward as a similar level for that which we have done recently.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter and Simon. Can I ask you a question on refining because it's sort of eight or nine quarters now of losses in that business so, albeit at the bottom of the cycle. And I guess my question relates to the profitability doesn't look anywhere near as robust as some of your peers and I wonder how you think about the 2012 cash flow targets in that context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Allen. I will take this from a strategic point of view. We have clearly outlined and now we're rationalizing the portfolio and I have mentioned all these numbers. I think we are well on track there. The majority of our cost savings actually is coming out of downstream and a good proportion is coming out of the refining. We are adjusting all of it to this new refining capacity which we have and that takes its time. We have these outages and relatively high turn around work in the fourth quarter, but clearly there is more to be done on the refining side. But we have all of that at hand or in hand as we are moving forward to that. As I've said in previous calls and previous talks, a strategy update in March will be kind of the next use of downstream, how we take it forward.</p>
          <p>And I think once we have embedded our current portfolio of refining, there might be more to come on that side. But we'll talk about that either in March or further down the road when we are getting to that. So a lot has been done, availability was high, et cetera but we have some locations where we have these advantages; some of them are out of the system and some we are still working. So we need a little bit more time here. But it's clearly part of our integrated strategy and hence we need to make sure that we have got the right size of refineries with the right throughput and the right overall complexity and we are working on that. Some new stuff is also coming on stream which will be helpful in that sense as well. Thank you. Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. Maybe just one on chemicals and specifically the new MOU you've signed in Qatar. Obviously, chemical returns generally roughly around the cost of capital over the cycle of these projects, can you confirm that this new project in Qatar is going to benefit from advantaged feed stock raw materials through the natural gas stream?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you're talking about your natural gas there and certainly tight gas and expenditures in the U.S. I know you've been testing some areas specifically across in Europe and in Sweden. I just wonder, you didn't mention it today, I wonder if you could talk about some of that unconventional gas exploration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you Oswald for your questions. On the first one, if I heard you correctly saying you were kind of also implying that we were taking advantage of lower capital costs, et cetera. So I think we'll see what &#x2013; how these will develop over the next few years.</p>
          <p>On the feed stock question, quite clearly we do this together with QP and therefore we go from gas to chemicals, which has advantages. We have signed the MOU. We haven't signed ahead of the agreement and the final agreements are I think we will give you feedback once we have done that. But I think one of the advantages of doing this in Qatar is around the pricing of the feed stock but too early to talk in details about it.</p>
          <p>Just as on unconventional gas, clearly we have talked about the -- North America where we are making good progress. In terms of Europe, Sweden, that's exploration, pilot stage; we'll inform once we have come further there. So it's too soon to say.</p>
          <p>It is, I think in general, in a way a slow pace in Europe; quite clearly footprint issues. There are permitting issues, not just in Sweden but in many other areas. So we'll see how this develops. What it is much more exciting is China. That's where we have got quite sizable square kilometers of acreage which we had actually at the end of the fourth quarter, we started to actually reach the exploration, so we are very excited about those. Two blocks for shale gas, tight gas and the one block for CBM and we think that China has got quite a bit of potential in that sense and we'll report back on that once we are further in the exploration phase. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. One question just, maybe you can touch a bit more on what you're seeing in terms of the cost increases, not just for this year but in terms of '12 for you on those growth projects. And how much of those cost increases you think that could offset the cost reduction that we have seen on Shell over the past couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Alejandro. I give that to the guy who manages all of these kinds of things, to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter, thanks Alejandro, Good afternoon. Since 2008, the cost pressure or inflation did come out of most categories in the industry but is now returning. Two categories that we see significantly impacting the industry are steel and rigs. Steel impacts made 30% of our capital cost. Rigs is also a significant element, we're spending somewhere between $7 billion and $10 billion a year drilling. The costs for 2011 are largely locked in. Our rig costs for the next two to three years, and in some cases that's five years, are also largely locked in at reasonably attractive levels.</p>
          <p>Our average day rate on the fourth and fifth generation, the deepwater rigs is below 500,000 a day on average. Well below, in fact. We cannot completely mitigate against steel price rises that we see. Having said that, one significant advantage of our new organization has been the development and perhaps more importantly the execution of global strategies per category of contracting spend.</p>
          <p>We spend around $60 billion with third parties each year. We've developed category management strategies and global framework agreements, now over 100 global framework agreements with key suppliers, which is driving our costs down -- often have embedded in them low cost country sourcing such as from China, Mexico and elsewhere. And that impact is so far offsetting the inflation we see coming back into the market. And this does take careful management with chosen suppliers, but we're hopeful that we can not only continue the downward trend in OpEx, but avoid significant inflation on the capital account as we take new investment decisions going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we have to look at the upstream overall cost, we can see that trend of cost reduction kind of changing here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is difficult to see; it's even difficult for us to monitor the actual unit cost of any given units of activity. But for example, in onshore gas drilling we know we drive the cost down through better performance over time when we shared that with you before. Offshore drilling equally over time in any given activity we do take cost out. Each large project tends to be unique and difficult to benchmark. And what we will aim and do aim to do is to benchmark the project at point which we take decisions and at which &#x2013; the point at which we deliver them. I can share with you that our benchmarking done by the IPA does show us significantly improving in both upstream and downstream projects over the past four years, where we're in a reasonably good position there and we intend to stay there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon I had two questions, please. First of all, the depreciation charge year-on-year is up roughly 1.1 billion. Is that clean? Are there impairments in there? And should we expect a similar increase in 2011 as the new projects start up?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I don't know if you can update us at all on organic reserve replacement. I suspect not, in which case I have actually have a third question, which is this, that pre 2004/2005, Shell used to have serious and persistent operational problems in its refineries particularly in North America. Then you appear to have resolved that; it seems to be back. Can you talk a little bit about the specific operational problems that you're encountering in Q4 and Q1, 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Irene. I think I'll leave number one, depreciation and number three, the refining to Simon, and take the middle one, which is an easy one. We will, as in the previous years we will give you those numbers when we have the Strategy Update, i.e. when the 20-F comes out which is around the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then depreciation and refining and what exactly has happened in Q4 and Q1 to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Irene. 2009, 2010 depreciation both had impairment impacts and if you remove the impairment impact, it was also an asset sale impact. The underlying depreciation went down slightly from just over $12 billion to just under $12 billion. It's a fairly constant $3 billion per quarter charge, no expectation it will change materially in the coming year. Although, as the big projects come on stream, you will start to see that nudge up.</p>
          <p>The -- I can't really speak for pre '05 activities in the downstream, but in Q4 specific issues on refractor linings, furnace linings and cat crackers in Port Arthur driven by basically faulty equipment supplied five years ago, should have lasted 25 years and needs replacing after five. This is an industry problem; one or two of the competitors got exactly the same issue, with the same supplier. So not endemic; one or two of the other trends we've had &#x2013; unfortunately, we're not, as Peter said, not satisfied with the performance we've seen. We see it as a bump on the road, more than an endemic issue with the manufacturing side.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Theepan Jothilingam from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Peter, Simon. Couple of questions actually. Just coming back to startup costs, I'd imagine that's sort of increased through the year. I was wondering if you could give some sort of guidance on how you see that, so let's say 12 months on from here. Or how you'd suggest we model that into our numbers. Just a sort of follow-up, just in terms of the upstream any thoughts on how maintenance levels will be in 2011 relative to 2010? Do you see an increased level or not?</p>
          <p>And then a question perhaps for Peter. I mean, you've talked about the disposal program sort of slowing down. I can understand that perhaps in the downstream, but sort of looking at the upstream, it does seem to be a seller's market. I was just wondering, if you could give some thoughts around why perhaps Shell shouldn't look to use this as an opportunity to monetize some of its, let's say, bottom quartile assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Theepan, I'll start with the last one to give Simon a little bit more time to think about one and two. Portfolio management is key; from that point to view no change in the strategic emphasis which we're putting on the portfolio management. Clearly, we have a growth strategy and in order to deliver actually production growth over time. So there is quite clearly &#x2013; this is a distinction to some of the talks which are in the market about shrinking. I find shrinking rather easy, growing is a little bit more difficult. So from that point of view, we do clearly look at the portfolio management slowing down. What I said is, I just don't want you guys to think that we will do another 8 billion something like that in the next 12 months. We will do five. And then we will see how the market is over the next 12 to 24 months and then guide you further.</p>
          <p>For the moment, it's five in '11 and otherwise I think long-term go back to what we always have given as a guidance, which is slightly lower than that. But kind of, clearly focused on it and if the market is right we have non quarter assets or late life assets. We will not be shy to turn the portfolio over in the near future. But we will clearly keep a focus on growth and this is as we always said a clear driver for our 80% increase in cash flow in an $80 world by 2012. We will make sure that we actually deliver that. So for question one and two over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter. And start up costs, broadly speaking they are around $200 million in the upstream and the fourth quarter. You can expect that level to continue into the first quarter as we start up the Upgrader in Canada and the two projects in Qatar and the basically the work we are doing in Iraq. It's a bit plus or minus, but it does &#x2013; that's the order of magnitude. It will go down by definition as we get into the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And that's a pre-tax figure, of course. And divestment &#x2013; sorry, the upstream maintenance levels. We have no expectations that maintenance levels will be any different next year from what they have been this year. The two biggest issues in our upstream are fundamentally Nigerian availability largely driven by security and Gulf of Mexico return to activity. The rest of the portfolio is pretty much on track and is out there actually operating very well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two questions, please. First one is, could you talk a little bit about the associated gas deal in Iraq and whether you are confident that it will be finalized by the end of this month? And secondly, could you talk about the delays to sanctioning and CapEx overruns on cash against Phase II and whether there is any scope to relaunch the project? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I &#x2013; good afternoon, Kim. I take both of them. On the south Iraq gas deal, I think as we all have said there is great, great benefits to the Iraqi people especially Basra area in getting on with this project to generate domestic gas for power generation, later on export either LPG or LNG. We have had various rounds with the governments.</p>
          <p>And I think you are referring to say in most probably press release or press statements I have seen that it is ready by the end of February. I would just say, I think we have well progressed. We have &#x2013; it's negotiated. It's up to the Iraqi government to come to a conclusion under its solution. So the timetable is in their hands. I cannot say much more than that at this stage, but I'm somewhat optimistic that we will get it over the line soon.</p>
          <p>On cash, again to -- I guess first of all, let us also work on or let E&amp;I work and get the first place upstream. I think this is pre-FID. We are looking into various options; could be <mark type="inaudible" />, could be one project. So we'll -- we are in that phase at this stage and too early to talk about it for the longer term. So I think we'll update on this once we go further in the pre-FID work, so not much more to say on this one. And thank you for the questions. And the next question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Peter and Simon. Can I ask a specific question about Nigeria, you've obviously been selling undeveloped -- discovery sites to indigenous companies. I wonder whether you're going to go past that, or further than that and dispose of any of your existing production given the fact that as you've said earlier, it's fairly low margin.</p>
          <p>And second question about Australia. Perhaps you can just tell us how close you are to FID on Prelude and whether this &#x2013; and whether you could give us any indication of what the cost of that might be. And also where you are on the coal bed methane Arrow development? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I take the second one and the first one, Simon can take on Nigeria. On Prelude, we're making good progress in the whole FEED discussion and that you have said, this is a key FID target for 2011. We are getting closer to it. The prime work at the moment is clearly done around the technical side but also around the costing side and as you know we do not disclose cost by project any &#x2013; in any project but I think I would summarize it as we are making good progress on, A) advancing it but, B) also on optimizing the costs.</p>
          <p>So the second one was FID during 2011 on Arrow, making good progress. We &#x2013; you may have seen some of the press releases from Arrow. We have invited the companies for the FEED; that should happen during 2011. And as usual we will update you on the progress of what's happening in Arrow, the joint venture with CMPC during the quarterly calls to come, so not much more at this stage to say on that one. Thank you. And sorry, and over to Simon.</p>

          <p>Nigeria onshore, we have 38 blocks overall, very widespread portfolio across an area with a population of 35 million people and an area that exceeds the size of Belgium. So it's a very broad and diverse footprint that we have. Our strategic aim has been to reduce the size of the footprint by increasing the participation of Nigerian companies and stake holders in the production activity.</p>
          <p>Of those 38 blocks, last year we sold four blocks. And the results of which are in the 2010 financials. We currently have another four blocks on offer and that's what we may have seen some press about recently. We still have 30 blocks. The blocks sold and for sale represent less than 10% of our production there. So we're really reducing the footprint, increasing indigenous participation. And in line with the Nigerian government objectives as well, that has to be said. We don't have an intent to significantly change further the footprint; we're focusing on the core oil and gas areas. And that's the strategy as it stands today.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon and Peter, good afternoon, a couple of things. Simon, I wanted to go back to a comment I thought I heard you make in response to a question regarding 2011 DD&amp;A being roughly comparable to 2010 on a clean basis. Could you clarify that and explain how that is possible in light of incremental Athabasca and Pearl DD&amp;A which are quite sizable? And I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Put simply, both the Upgrader and Pearl will be straight line depreciation, not even into production, which means they don't kick in at a heavy level. Plus, and then this is not a projection at all, track record of adding reserves recently has generally meant that the depreciation has gone down slightly in the upstream year-on-year. Without giving anything ahead, the two -- that plus the fact that the big two are straight line means we won't see a big step up during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I am I guess a little bit confused by comment in the presentation regarding the exploration results in 2010. Eight discoveries yielding net 250 million equivalent of resource. This suggests that this is not exactly a high impact kind of program. Am I mixing apples and oranges by putting those two things together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could be there, Mark. We haven't given the total resource add from the exploration program. Big discoveries of course, we have from the tight gas activity. We'll give the figures when we finalize them in the March presentation. The 250 refers to Appomattox, which is a single discovery, the single largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One more &#x2013; just one more for me. The integrated gas earnings in the fourth quarter were sharply below anything we were looking for. Can I assume that that is where the lion's share of your reference startup costs had hit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Basically, it's a dividend from one of the LNG companies that was large in Q3 and absent in Q4, hopefully back again in Q1. Plus the fact that some of the ramp up in volumes was Nigerian, which was effectively going into spot markets. So the actual average realized LNG price was down on average slightly for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Versus third quarter or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Versus third quarter. Yeah, I'm talking that third quarter, Mark as opposed to year-on-year. The realized gas prices were quite significantly up year-on-year versus Q4, 2009. Sorry for not being clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Simon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Jason Gammel from Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, with the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska now, I guess more or less off limits for the next two years from an exploration standpoint. Can you talk geographically about where you could have high impact exploration? And then secondly, given the huge discrepancy on a BTU basis between natural gas and liquid product globally, would you be looking to invest incrementally in gas to liquids projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, I think I didn't say that it is off for the next two years. As I said, we are actually the first company which now has three exploration wells actually kind of in the public or in the public discussion now. So they have fulfilled all the agency requirements as published through a press release last Friday by the authorities. So we are in that phase, so we are really hopeful to get back into the Gulf rather sooner than later.</p>
          <p>And on Alaska, I have said clearly, it's again &#x2013; it's not two years, it's for 2011. We are preparing the permits so that we can actually drill in 2012. I just don't want to spend the money as we still have uncertainties, and you would have to spend $100 million to $150 million between now and getting maybe no answer. And then would have to actually dismantle what we have already built up and prepared.</p>
          <p>For all the rest of the exploration, I think we will give a key update in March as well. You can obviously see in the presentation slides, there are some indications there where we have clearly some new acreage et cetera. But we will give you a clear overview on how the exploration program will exactly work in the March presentations.</p>
          <p>Can you just repeat your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just given the large discrepancy in pricing on a BTU basis between natural gas and the liquid products, would you consider incremental investments in gas to liquids?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for that. I've always said I want to finish Pearl started up and have a very smooth kind of transitioning into full production there. Then we can have another look at what's possible. The most logical one would be a Train 3, as you may know we are constructing Pearl in such a way that the tie-ins for the Train 3 are already there. The land is also booked and reserved, et cetera. So that's quite clearly the one which would come to mind for the next step. Therefore, the answer is yes. If you have the right content with the right reserves, at the right pricing, so from a feedstock point of view then that could be attractive. But I think let us finish Pearl first and operate and then we come back to that.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from John Pierre <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. I have three questions. First question, can you indicate to us about exploration expenses in 2010 and the dedicated budget planned for 2011?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding the concessions in Abu Dhabi, which is expected to expire by the end of 2013, if I'm right. Can you indicate to us assuming that the concession is not renewed, the possible impact on your project churn and what would be your new 2014 production guidance and the impact on your earnings?</p>
          <p>And my third question is regarding your dividend policy. You're expecting a stable dividend in Q1 2011 versus this quarter; what are the key drivers that may influence your dividends for the future quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will leave question one and three to Simon. I will take two and then Simon you want to start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start. Exploration expansion is getting tricky to actually report now because the unconventional gas activity becomes exploration or development almost well by well depending on exactly where it's drilled in terms of recognized reserves. So I was thinking in more general terms, the amount allocated by budget just over $3 billion in 2010 and again in 2011 for -- through exploration activity, that's seismic and drilling, about half of that is spent on drilling. So there is no real increase. What actually gets reported as expenses does vary for that reason in unconventional gas. Abu Dhabi -- I'm so sorry, I will leave Abu Dhabi for Peter. The key...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, the dividend. The key drivers of the dividend, the dividend policy that we restated last year it's growing in line with the earnings and cash flow. We also said it is our intent to balance cash flows by 2012 at $60 such that we earn from cash from operations enough to support $25 billion to $27 billion of net investment and $10 billion of dividend. The big drivers of that cash flow growth together factor that. We like the equilibrium positions of the projects. As we go through this year the big three projects that drive the cash flow, the two Qatar projects and the Canadian oil sands should ramp up. That's what we expect as and when they come on stream. That, plus the balance sheet, plus the ongoing oil price development will drive the discussion about dividend growth. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on Abu Dhabi, maybe it's early to talk about this but the fiscal terms are based on a tax royalty structure with a fixed post tax earnings of $1 per barrel lifted. And yes, indeed it's -- the production license expires in 2014. And we produce 132,000 barrels in 2010. I think with that you can do all your sums and your totals. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Neill Morton from Berenberg. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Berenberg actually. Two quick numbers questions, please. Firstly could you perhaps say how much of this 5% increase in production in 2010 was due to colder weather year-on-year. I think Simon you may have given us a profit impact on that as well; that would be useful. And just secondly, could you quantify your expectations of production growth from new field startups and ramp-ups in 2011 versus the 170,000 barrels that you achieved in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, over to Simon and thanks for the question, Neill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. There were a couple of impacts that side there, control in terms of OPEC demand constraints and the weather -- basically 1,000 barrels a day increase year-on-year 2010 versus 2009. If you remember it was very cold not only in Q4 but also Q1. It's a lot warmer this year is all I would say on that. Sorry, could you just repeat the second question. I didn't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just expectations for production growth in 2011 from the startups and ramp-ups?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we would hope it would be higher in principle because we should get the better part of a year out of oil sands and we should see the impact of full year for example of <mark type="inaudible" /> of -- hopefully we will get back from Perdido and the Gasoil projects will start to ramp-up. I wouldn't want to give a <mark type="inaudible" /> production forecast for 2011. We said broadly similar but with a -- quite a wide range of potential outcomes both positive and negative, depending on for example the weather, Nigeria and security and the rates of those ramp-ups. So, broadly similar plus or minus.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had one quick clarification, on refinery availability in Q1, you said it was flat to lower. Was that versus Q4 or was it year-on-year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, it's good to be back. Three quick questions, if I may. First, on the tight gas, if I understand well you are guiding for the low part of the three to five year dollar billion CapEx indicated on the occasion of the North American slip fleet. If I'm correct, what is the read across we may take from this decision in term of gas spot price you expect for 2011 and 2012?</p>
          <p>And second question is can you give us an update on the exploration in Brazil in the BMS-54 and the third question is a follow-up of the Neill question regarding the production guidance for 2011. Did I understand well that you expect more of like a flat production versus 2010? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think Simon can do all of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter. Does the low end CapEx indicate low gas prices? Well, initially to some extent, yes. We are drilling where we need to hold acreage and where we've already got the costs down to the point where we can make money at $4 and that's what driving us. If the gas price goes up, well we will see where we go because it's relatively easy activity to ramp-up.</p>
          <p>BMS-54 exploration just a reminder, is an 80% Shell block now with 20% Total in.</p>
          <p>We have two prospects to drill. We drilled one late last year. We hope to drill roughly the middle of this year the second prospect. There are two reservoir horizons in both prospects. We are currently evaluating the first well. It looks prospective and we have indicated &#x2013; this is not a multibillion barrel prospect.</p>
          <p>But it looks very interesting at the moment. We need to drill the second well, do the appraisal work before we can really say anything further. 2011 production, yes the statement is broadly similar but with a wide range of -- a relatively wide range of outcomes. We actually increased our production in Nigeria onshore. We are now 100,000 barrels a day, or over 100,000 barrels a day in '10 versus '09. In the current security environment and with the Gbaran-Uble, the gas project up and running we could do that or better again in 2011. But there is an election in Nigeria this year and that's a level of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, we lose 50,000 barrels a day of high value production compared to what we would have expected to have delivered if there had been no moratorium. And we do not drive the pace at which we are able to restart development and production drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. It's unfortunate but there are a significant number of factors outside our control.</p>
          <p>Our aim and expectation for 2012 because we control most of the main drivers of 2012 is to deliver the 3.5 million barrels a day target, even though the divestments we've done will in fact reduce production in 2012 by around 80,000 to 100,000-barrels a day compared to what we had originally projected.</p>
