          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Enel Conference Call on 2009 Interim Results. This is Luca Torchia speaking.</p>
          <p>Let me hand over to the CEO, Mr. Fulvio Conti for an introduction of the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>A very good morning to everybody. Before handing over to Luigi Ferraris for the presentation of the six months result, let me give you a bit of a feeling of what we have in our hands here.</p>
          <p>Let me first of all confirm that we -- as you will see in the press release and the numbers posted in the Web that we are reporting a recurring EBITDA performance, which once again, one more time, is better than market consensus, showing an increase of 4.2% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Second point I would like to remark is that we are obviously decreasing all of our operational risk profiles, thanks to our geographical and technological mix, which is now available to our company.</p>
          <p>As a third point, I like to stress the direction of maintaining key priority in the reduction of our leverage while continuously deliver solid results and confirming the dispose of targets as well as the integration process which is ongoing. You will see all of these points in the following charts.</p>
          <p>I want to stress here the numbers that we're delivering confirm solidity and profitability of our strategy even in an unfavorable economic scenario.</p>
          <p>Having said this, let me hand it over to Luigi for the presentation and then I would be available for questions-and-answers. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio and good morning everyone. Let me give you a snapshot of the financial highlights on chart number two. First, let me underline that profit and loss numbers are based on Endesa consolidated at 67% while balance sheet is based on Endesa consolidated at 100%.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA, net of non-recurring items, increased by 4.2%. Group net income includes the positive contribution of Acciona put option, and &#x20AC;308 million of capital gain relating to the assets sold to Terna.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you, these amounts are not part of the ordinary income and therefore are not to be considered as part of our future dividend. Excluding the extraordinary items and discontinued operations, Group net income would be equal to almost &#x20AC;2.3 billion or 3% up versus last year.</p>
          <p>Now moving to chart number three, you have here an indication of our first half 2009 recurring EBITDA with Endesa consolidated on 100% basis.</p>
          <p>Now moving to chart number four, EBIT increased by about 11%, mainly due to higher EBITDA, partially balanced by our depreciation and amortization.</p>
          <p>Also, our net financial charges amounted to &#x20AC;209 million. This is mainly the effect of the following. First, higher income resulting from the fair value valuation of Acciona put option for &#x20AC;970 million in the first half 2009. Second, lower interest charges of &#x20AC;358 million, mainly due to both lower cost of debt at 4.6% and lower average stock of debt.</p>
          <p>Group's tax rate increased from 20.4% in the first half 2008 to 24.7% in first half '09. On a normalized basis, the first half '09 tax rate would be equal to about 33% versus 34 of last year.</p>
          <p>Before going through the EBITDA composition on chart number five, you find the reclassification of first half 2008 EBITDA in order to reflect the new organization of the Group.</p>
          <p>And now, let's have a look at our EBTIDA composition starting with chart number six. Our portfolio benefits from a unique mix of assets and technologies, which creates a good balance between unregulated and regulated activities. As far as unregulated activities are concerned Enel benefits from technological and geographical diversification, focused on minimizing the Group's profile -- the Group's risk profile, a well-balanced fuel mix with nuclear at 12%, hydro and other renewables at about 35%, coal at 27 and the balance mainly consisting of CCGT, oil, gas, open cycle. All of this coupled with our ongoing hedging strategy; allow us to expect solid cash flow also for the future.</p>
          <p>And now let me give you an update on our hedging strategy in particular for forward electricity sale. Let's move to chart number seven. As far as Italy is concerned, we have hedged 100% of our 2009 production and about 80% of 2010 production at an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;80 per megawatt hour for 2009 and &#x20AC;77 per megawatt hour for 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as Spain is concerned, we are almost 100% hedged for 2009 and about 45% for 2010 at an average price for 2009 in the range of &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour. Prices for 2010 are currently above the forward curve for calendar 2010.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we are about 75% hedged for 2009 and about 65% for 2010. In Slovakia, 2009 production is now 100% hedged while we are already 81% hedged for 2010 at an average price of &#x20AC;65 per megawatt hour for 2009 and 55 for 2010.</p>
          <p>All of this will have to explain our EBITDA evolution in chart number eight. Before detailing each division, let me underline that our EBITDA grew by 8.4%. All the first-half 2008 figures are given on a pro forma basis to take into account organizational changes occurred in 2008, as already explained.</p>
          <p>First, in Generation and Energy Management Italy, chart number nine. The increase in the generation margin reached &#x20AC;123 million, mainly thanks to forward contracts and more favorable fuel mix. The improvement of &#x20AC;225 million in gas sale is mainly due to favorable gas sourcing during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>The margin in the ancillary services decreased by &#x20AC;139 million also because of lower electricity demand.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number ten. Net of ancillary services, the unit margin in the domestic thermal generation is &#x20AC;26 per megawatt hour versus 23 in full year 2008.</p>
          <p>The overall generation unit margin net of ancillary services is &#x20AC;48 per megawatt hour versus 41 in the previous year, mainly thanks to the increase in hydro production.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis of the market division on chart number 11. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;160 million versus 295 of first half 2008. This is the cumulative effect of the following.</p>
          <p>First, the decrease of &#x20AC;75 million in the contribution of the pre-markets, mainly due to lower electricity margin as a consequence of a decrease in selling prices because of lower consumption of some specific customers, lower gas margin of &#x20AC;60 million and other items for minus &#x20AC;10 million. Second, the decrease of &#x20AC;60 million in the electricity regulated market, mainly due to positive, non-recurring items recorded in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 12 on domestic infrastructure and network division. EBITDA totaled about &#x20AC;2 billion, 5% up versus last year. Main items are the following.</p>
          <p>First, the improvement of &#x20AC;45 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to positive price components, partially offset by lower volumes. Second, lower connection fees, mainly due to the unfavorable economic environment. And by the way, let me remind you that these fees are not including the RAB system Third, &#x20AC;300 million capital gain from the sale of the high voltage network to Terna; and four, minus &#x20AC;230 million, mainly due to 2009 restructuring cost for &#x20AC;80 million as a result of our efficiency programs, and &#x20AC;140 million of positive non-recurring items recorded during 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 13 on international operations. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;698 million, up by almost 28% versus last year. This is the result of the following. In the Centrel region we continue to see a positive contribution of Slovenske Elektrarne of &#x20AC;33 million. In particular, first half 2009 EBITDA of this company was equal to &#x20AC;456 million. A good performance of South Eastern Europe with &#x20AC;26 million, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. In France, a positive impact of &#x20AC;16 million due to higher volumes, and in Russia, OGK-5 contributed for &#x20AC;83 million during the first half 2009.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the following division, a quick look at the Russian activities on chart number 14. OGK-5 reported first half 2009 EBITDA of &#x20AC;83 million, which represents a 30% increase versus last year on a like-for-like basis. This is the result of higher unit margins, better procurement conditions, increasing capacity payments and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Please note that these results have been achieved with a spark spread below &#x20AC;1 per megawatt hour and a dark spread close to &#x20AC;3 per megawatt hour. Furthermore, I would like to confirm you that the liberalization process in Russia is well on track. Today, more than 30% of the market has been already liberalized.</p>
          <p>And now, let's focus on Endesa results on slide number 15. EBITDA for 100% of the company totaled &#x20AC;3.7 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% versus last year. Both Iberia and Latin America are contributing to this growth. In particular, in Iberia, growth has been achieved, thanks to higher final price as a result of Endesa's forward selling strategy, offsetting the effect of lower volumes and pool prices, better generation mix more exposed to nuclear and hydro capacity, and furthermore, let me just remind you that reported EBITDA includes the negative effects of Royal Decree on CO2 for about &#x20AC;125 million.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, higher power prices and volumes in most of the countries as well as improved distribution margins boosted EBITDA by 15.4% versus first half '08, once more, improving the growth rate versus the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>And now, Enel Green Power on chart number 16. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;620 million, representing a 19% increase on a like-for-like basis versus last year. This improvement is due to the contribution of &#x20AC;87 million from Italy mainly driven by higher generation margin, &#x20AC;9 million from the Americas and &#x20AC;2 million from Spain.</p>
          <p>And now I will like to address your attention on the operating data of Enel Green Power on chart number 17. Enel Green Power is a world leader in the renewable industry with operations in 16 countries and a store capacity of about 4.6 gigawatts and an energy production of almost 10 terawatt hour as of the end of June 2009.</p>
          <p>Over the last year, we have increased our capacity by 350 megawatts and we still rely on a pipeline of almost 17 gigawatts. Total production amounts to 9.9 terawatt hour, 14% up versus last year. We also expect to further increase our capacity growth rate for the near future.</p>
          <p>The figures in the slides include 50% <mark type="inaudible" /> and do not include Endesa renewable installed capacity of almost 1 gigawatt and the pipeline that the company has retained after the sales of assets to Acciona.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, you see on chart number 18 that net of discontinued operations overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;55.7 billion. The &#x20AC;5.8 billion increase is mainly driven by the negative impact of extraordinary activities for &#x20AC;3.9 billion. In particular, first the acquisition of a further 25% stake in Endesa for a total consideration of &#x20AC;12 billion, including 100% debt consolidation and renewable assets sold to Acciona. Second, acquisition of ESB, Ireland by Endesa and other items for almost &#x20AC;1 billion; rights issue for &#x20AC;8 billion, and the sale of high-voltage grid to Terna for &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>On top of this, let me also highlight that we have substantially addressed our 2010 debt refinancing needs, mainly thanks to the dividends cashed in from Endesa, the additional funds from the sale of the high-voltage grid to Terna as well as the capital increase contribution. In the annexes you will find all the relevant details.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening and now we open the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>&lt;&lt;</p>
          <p>QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION&gt;&gt;</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Before starting this question, I inform you that there are people connected on the phone, but also via the website. So we will be collecting questions not only from people who are listening to this on phone, but also via the website. There is already a line of people out there ready to pose a question. The first one here is Bianchessi Antonella from Morgan Stanley .So Antonella, if you are ready you can start asking your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just more detail, can you quantify in terms of guidance for terawatt sales, instead of giving the percentage, if you can give the product aspect, mostly in the Italian market and mostly for 2010? And second, if you can just explain...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, Antonella &#x2013; Antonella,  sorry to interrupt you. But we lost your voice for a couple of minutes. So if you are so kind as to repeat your question? And speak slower please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the first point -- the first question is that if you can quantify in terms of terawatt hours the electricity sold forward in Italy for 2009, and -- but mostly for 2010, instead of giving the percentage. The second question is looking at your net debt target for 2009, if you can just elaborate a little bit on how you expect to reach net debt in the return 50 billion at the end of the year starting from 55.8? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Antonella this is Luigi. I will start from your first question in terms of terawatt hours, as of today we have sold forward with regards to 2010 in Italy 50.3 terawatt hours. When it comes to 2009, as we say that we have substantially sold forward 100% and we expect that the total output could be in the region of 85 terawatt hours, 90 terawatt hours all together all included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So -- sorry -- you expect a decline in production in 2010 versus 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect, of course, a slight decline -- a decline in the production in the region of let's say 6, 7 terawatt hours, without taking into account the potential upside coming from hydro production, assuming a normal year and not like this year.</p>
          <p>Second question about net debt, how we're going to reach the 50 billion target? Well, first of all, as of today, we do not have the full impact of the sales of the gas distribution business, which is going to generate in terms of additional deconsolidation of debt and cash in something in the region of &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Then we are planning, of course, to continue our divesture process and therefore we expect to have contribution by the end of the year, in addition our cash in of &#x20AC;1 billion mainly from Spain. Then of course, we have the divestiture of a minority stake in Enel Green Power which -- it is expected to be finalized by the end of the year, which I remind you is in the region of &#x20AC;3.5 billion. Now, on top of this, we also have margin to improve our working capital both in Endesa and in Enel. In Endesa, we have the usual regulatory items. Let me just remind you that the extra-peninsular receivable that we have -- which is in the region of &#x20AC;2 billion according to our GAAP or to Enel's GAAP is reported in the working capital. Therefore, should this amount be collected by the end of the year, we have an additional &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>So just to sum up, our projection say that we will be in the region of below &#x20AC;50 billion if we are going to cash in by the end of the year the disposal of Enel Green Power, if not we will be slightly higher than the &#x20AC;50 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question is coming from Marco Corsiglia, Intermonte.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning everybody. I have three questions. The first is on the ancillary services. If you could provide the absolute figure for the first half. The second is on Enel Green Power. Probably you can spilt the EBITDA between Italian and international operations. And the third is about international operations, looking at in the second half 2009, I would like to understand if you see some significant change in the profitability compared to the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, let's start from the ancillary service. The net margin that we have reported in the first half of 2009 has been equal to &#x20AC;260 million, which represents, as I said, a decline of almost &#x20AC;140 million. A portion of that, of course, forecasted and a portion of that something in the region of 40, &#x20AC;50 million, due to the demand decrease that we have experienced in this first half of 2009. With regard to the third question, what are our expectations with regard to the international operation, well we do not have any reason to assume that in the second half, the international division is not going to perform in the same way it performed in the first half. So I think that these margins that we have reported at the end of June are stable. Thanks also to our forward selling strategy mainly in Slovakia and thanks also to the capacity payment paid in Russia, which is really supporting our profitability in these days. On top of this, in Russia, we are also implementing our energy project and I think this will contribute to enhance our profitability. So the answer is we do not expect any decline in the second half. So it should be inline with the first. When it comes to Enel Green Power, out of the &#x20AC;620 million of expected &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; of reported EBITDA, 480 regards Italy and 140 regards the rest of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is coming from Antoine Pradayrol, Exane .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and thank you. Few questions, if I may. First one would be on your hedging strategy. Would you have any figure for 2011? And second, would be on the disposal process of Enel Green Power? You have been saying that you are in talks with several parties. You've also said that decision will be taken on IPO versus trade sale by the end of the summer. Can you please update us on that? And last question on the bond issue program that you announced this morning. If this is successful, do you plan to downsize your total disposal program? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me intervene on the second and third question, and then the first on the forward strategy, forward sales strategy, I'll hand it over to Luigi. When it comes to Green Power, I think I have commented earlier on and this has been confirmed by Luigi earlier on during his presentation that we have received sizeable manifestation of interest that we're working on and we will be working on during summer. I confirm there is a strong appetite for the quality of our assets, for the performance of our assets, for the technological diversification and for the geographical diversification. We believe that there is room for securing a strategic partner with whom we can develop further our company, who will be helping in taking us in other parts of the world with our technologies. I am referring in particular to the potential highly concentrated solar technology that we're demonstrating insistently, that would be coming in the future, available for further penetration in some parts of the world, in particular in the North and Southern part of the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
          <p>For that we continue to confirm to you that we will be spending summer during Euro vacation to peruse all the potential interests we've received so far to come close to a final decision ahead of final date of the year. We cannot discard any future development on floating  the company, if necessary. And there will be appetite for the overall investment population to look into our business. We want to maintain control, we want to maintain 51%, and we will take advantage of the resilient and fast growing business platform that we have developed.</p>
          <p>For the -- for the bonds, we have obviously received the authorization by the Board to issue mid-term, long-term bonds in the future. I think there is a strong appetite for our paper. I think there is a very well positioned demand for our paper, as you can see from the quotes on the existing bonds in the market in these days. We will be obviously taking advantage of that without any particular preconceived definition of maturities available and currencies available, therefore only euro long-term will be one primary target for us.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, we will continue, even though, we'll want to extend maturities and lock in the margins, we will continue to pursue the disposal programs as we have commented. I don't think, what we are disclosing it is something we're doing just for the pure need of cash. We're doing this because we feel that we can valorize some of the existing assets like Enel Green Power, and we can dispose off some peripherals and non-strategic assets. That will give us a more nimble and solid platform for future growth, so no changes to that disposal programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was the &#x2013; the other question with regards to forward sales in 2011. The answer is yes, of course, we are selling in 2011 as well, particularly in Italy. As of today we sold forwards something in the region of 11% to 15%, with an average price of &#x20AC;77 per megawatt hour.</p>

          <p>Okay. Next question is coming from Javier Su&#xE1;rez, UniCredit. Javier?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning to everyone. Several questions, if I may. The first one is on the margins that you are obtaining on the thermal generation activities in your recent margins &#x2013; on your recent market -- excuse me. Can you give me the latest numbers that you have on the spark spread and dark spread that you are getting &#x2013; obtaining in Italy, Spain and then Slovakia? Then the second question on the volumes, a follow-up after a previous question. Can you give us your latest expectation for the volumes of sold &#x2013; of electricity by the year end in Italy, Spain and in Slovakia?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on the level of prices at which you are selling &#x2013; forward selling your electricity. You mentioned that for the year 2010 in the Spanish market you are selling above the forward cost. Can you give us an absolute number on the level of prices at which you are selling your electricity forward on the Spanish market? The fourth and final question is on Endesa, you now control a 92% of stakes in the company. Can you give us an update on what Enel intends to do with the pre-close and what Enel intends to do with the Latin American assets? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let met start with the last one. By the way, as a marginal comment I don't want to -- just a little joke. You don't want to leave anything to imagination, I understand, by the quality of the questions you are giving us. But let me take the last question about Endesa. What we don't &#x2013; what we want to do, in a simple statement, more of the same. We want to carry on the development of company and the structure that we do have. We are not planning anything, any Mickey Mouse that comes around from the banking system as an advisorship. I think we're happy with what we do, have in our hands and the results are there to demonstrate it. So, let's stop all of this fussing around to telling us what we have to do. We want to just manage and operate the existing assets in our favor. Thank you. Luigi?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. Let's start from your first question. What are the spark spreads that we had in the first half? Well, let's start from Italy. When it comes to Italy, we had a spark spread taking also into account the upside that we have on the price because of our forward sale strategy. We have a spark spread in the regional &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour. That's what we had at the end of the first half of this year versus a dark spread of 25, &#x20AC;26 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>What are the guidelines for next year? With regards to the spark spread, we still see -- and of course we are selling and locking in spark spread at &#x20AC;18 per megawatt hour. When it comes to the dark spreads we are in the region of 21, &#x20AC;23 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to Spain. Spark spreads in Spain at the end of the first half of 2009 has been in the region of -- for Endesa, of course, has been in the region of 15, &#x20AC;16 per megawatt hour, also taking into account once again the benefit of the effect of the forward sales. When it comes to the dark spreads it's in the region of &#x20AC;11 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>For 2010, of course, we are selling forward in Endesa as well. We see a slight decline. So we expect something more in the region of &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour, if we again we factor in the advantage on the final price with regards to the &#x2013; with regards to the sparks spread. When it comes to the clean dark spread, we see something in the region of 7, &#x20AC;8 per megawatt hour next year. But again, as you know, the core production in Endesa has a different structure than we have in Italy and is less efficient.</p>
          <p>Slovakia &#x2013; Slovakia, let me remind you that most of the production is nuclear. We have hydro, so the spark spread is not meaningful for us. We have &#x2013; we can say a sort of almost negative spark spread, but it is not affecting our profitability, as you can see. So we can leverage on nuclear and hydro. This is basically the most of our production, and as we said, we sold forward at an average price of 50, &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour, which I think is enough to protect and maintain our profitability.</p>
          <p>Now, I think you had a question regarding the volume sold next year. Let's start from Endesa. Endesa sold forward in 2010, 30 terawatt hours, for the time being. And when it comes to Enel, we said that we are selling forward something in the region of 60 terawatt hour and we have secured almost 70 terawatt hours of this year. Of course, the level -- if you compare this amount to the level of production, it depends -- if you consider the pump storage and how you consider all the perimeter, but this is the absolute amount. And I think there was a third question with regards to the level of price in 2010 in Endesa. We answer that we expect -- we are selling forward at a price higher than the calendar. What I can give you is that the calendar for 2010, which is &#x20AC;47 per megawatt hour. Therefore we are selling higher than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Just a question on your bond issue program, you just announced <mark type="inaudible" /> the next 12 months, and I was wondering what are your strategic views concerning Endesa issuing its own bonds? Do you have as well set specific figure for Endesa on the standalone bond issuance? Also, I have a follow-up question on the disposal. As you said, you have around 3.5 billion by end of the year, I was wondering as well in here 1 billion that you mentioned for asset disposal from Spain. Is that figure including any kind of tariff deficit monetization in Spain? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle these questions. When it comes to Endesa, I think the current position of Endesa's profile of debt gives us 24 months of peace and calm, probably we don't need to rush and do anything and we will continue to monitor the situation without any need to refinance. When it comes to the Green Power the question is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>3.5 billion by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is disposal, we continue to monitor as we said earlier on, the opportunity to dispose off this minority stake. I don't think we need to do anything more significant on that. We also have some peripheral assets as we earmarked during our presentation, including Spain. It goes without saying that there is an interest for portion of our high-voltage grid and this might be concluded before year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's the tariff deficit &#x2013; any monetization of a tariff deficit in Spain will be extra, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not a disposal. As you know, the government in Spain is geared up to support through specific legislation, interministerial legislation involving industry and hacienda in industry and the economy to promote the formation of the company that should manage the so called factor &#x2013; let me put this way, of the credits. We think we are possibly getting there to be able to collect those funds before year-end and the government is trying to put forth all of the necessary piece of legislation to provide a solution for the industry, and in particular, for Endesa. But this is not a disposal. This is just, as you call, de-authorization. It will be sort of a liquidity instrument for us, which will obviously reinforce the Endesa's strong balance sheet and profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up on that. Okay, if that's disposal that's actually including in the net debt of Endesa and therefore your net debt. I want to just make sure that this tariff deficit monetization was or was not part of your assumption to reach net debt below 50 billion by year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically my question was even if you think that as a disposal, I just wanted to make sure that a monetization of tariff deficits will reduce Endesa net debt and therefore will reduce Enel net debt. I just wanted to make sure that is that not one of your assumptions to reach below &#x20AC;50 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, if we're going to get cash by the disposal of the credits, it goes without saying this will go against our debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, yes, but is it part of your assumption today...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a no-brainer. Can we move to the next question, please?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Can you please -- I've got four questions, if I may. Can you please rather quantify your guidance for full year 2009, both in terms of clean net income and EBITDA? My second question regards your Italian generation business. Can you give us some visibility in terms of what are your expectations in terms of thermal margins and total margins for the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>The third question regards the asset disposals program. You, in March, talked about &#x20AC;1.6 billion of further asset disposals and you didn't leave any, let's say, visibility. You've been talking today about high voltage grid asset potential in Spain. And also in Endesa presentation there was a chart about Greece. But can you provide us some more visibility if it's possible? And do you still plan to dispose 1.6 billon of assets by the end of the year?</p>
          <p>And finally, to come back to your Generation business, Dugam , in terms of the <mark type="inaudible" />, which was still strong in the second quarter as you indicated at the first quarter results, what is your expectation for the full year? Do you expect that to remain at the same level, to grow further? And maybe if you can give us the guidance in terms of what your expectation is for the Generation business in Italy results for the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle the disposal question and then I will hand it to Luigi on the rest. We are commenting on this over time and we'll continue to do so this morning that all announcements on individual assets disposal will be published, communicated, commented at a time when we'll be realizing it. I don't want to give you guidance on the quality and the addresses of the assets, if I have not started a well defined negotiation process, because this will be contrary to the full value abstraction that I want to achieve. So, please be patient with me, bear with me. We will continue to deliver, and as soon as we will be developing firm negotiations on the individual assets we will be commenting. I confirm the overall commitment to dispose off those number that you have seen in the March presentation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I would start from your first question regarding the guidelines in terms of net income and EBITDA for the full year. Well, I think if you look at the first half results, you have seen that if we assume to consolidate Endesa on a 100% basis we are at &#x20AC;8.8 billion in terms of EBITDA. Therefore, I think that we could assume that by the end of this year we should be able on a like-for-like basis to reach the frame of &#x20AC;16 billion that we had -- we had committed to for 2010 clearly, since we are going to consolidate Endesa only for six months, the difference will be just that. In terms of net income, we have reached &#x20AC;2.3 billion of net ordinary income in the first half. So, I think that in the second half of the year we don't see any reason of, at least confirming what we have done last year. So, I think in the &#x20AC;4 billion it would be feasible</p>
          <p>Second question, Italian generation margin, when it comes to the thermal unitary margin, we have substantially secured 100% of our expected output in 2009. We have also secured our margin of course. So we don't see any reason to see any major changes. And I think the same can be said for the total margin with the all exemption of course that something could change depending on the level of hydro production, which of course could be different in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to -- I think the last question was the guidance with regards to the generation business for the entire year. Well, I think that we should be able to at least confirm the 2008 results. When it comes to the profit that we have reported on the gas sales, as I said during the first quarter, out of this &#x20AC;225 million, &#x20AC;185 million for sure will remain for the second half, so will not be reabsorbed. We are assuming to lose &#x20AC;40 million maximum of this 225. So that advantage will remain also at the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Next question is coming from Matija Gergolet, Goldman Sachs .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Good morning. I've a few questions. First of all, on the CapEx number. I see you spent 2.5 billion of CapEx for the first half. I think at the March you guided for like 7.7 billion of CapEx for 2009. Please elaborate whether you are able to actually cut CapEx or proceed with this guidance. Now second question on &#x2013; kind of linked with the first one, in your press release you mentioned that you have taken several actions to improve the cash flow. Would it be possible to spend a half a minute or minute just now outlining what are these major actions? Is it cost cutting, or CapEx reduction, so if you could just elaborate what is it really different this year compared to last year when Enel is talking about improving the cash flows? And the last thing, just a small thing, but it is &#x2013; you have published this. So, on your disposals you mentioned that the Greek operations of Endesa have put this asset up for sale. Could there be &#x2013; I know that Enel also has a market in Greece, could it be just on inter-company restructurings or have this actually been earmarked for sale? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matija let me start with the last one. As I said, we are contemplating specific asset disposals. We are clear on what we have to dispose off. As I answered to the previous question, we will be obviously commenting on individual assets, but the time will be firm on negotiation path for the disposals. Now including in this item, you will find that we are dealing with the potential divestiture of the Endesa's Greek investment to our current partner, <mark type="inaudible" />. This is an ongoing negotiation. We think we will be possibly conclude this deal by September. There is nothing more than just the need to reshape our portfolio and Greece will continue to be part of our strategy. As you know, Enel has invested in &#x2013; in particular in renewables with strong wind programs, and will continue to be at the center of our strategy to develop further our presence out there on different basis. For the previous two questions I hand it over to Luigi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to the CapEx, we have reported &#x20AC;2.7 billion. First of all, let me remind you that the first six months are based on a 67% consolidation. Having said that, of course, we are clearly reducing our CapEx cash out. So we should expect by the end of the year, rather than showing &#x20AC;7.7 billion which is what we have reported in our business plan, I think we should be much more close to 6.5 assuming to consolidate Endesa on 100% basis for the entire year. So it will be lower, the reported one on a like-for-like basis versus the 7.7, we have certainly much closer to six.</p>
          <p>Cash flow improvement, well, you might recall that we have committed ourselves to generate &#x20AC;2.7 billion of cash flow through our project called Zenith and clearly we have already started to implement some of the actions and as of the end of June this year, we have already improved our operating cash flow or our working capital of &#x20AC;229 million and also we have already implementing action, which have started to generate saving for &#x20AC;130 million. So at the end of June our Zenith program is contributing to our results for &#x20AC;360 million in total, both in terms of working capital and additional EBITDA. The major area, of course, is the credit management and the inventory management. We've already implemented action to change the billing profile and this is starting to deliver the results. The first results have been delivered in June, and of course, we are continuing to working on the collection and on the regulatory receivable as well.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Most of my questions have been addressed. The only two questions I would may, the first one would be a clarification, please, on the volumes that you're expected to generate in your Italian generation business in 2010. You could give clarification on the total volumes or you want to just say volumes excluding <mark type="inaudible" /> just to have a clear idea?</p>
          <p>And second question would be on your guidance, you've been talking of EBITDA for 2009 that could be very close to the 16 billion that you're targeting for 2010 and clean net income of at least &#x20AC;4 billion. Does this have an implication for your targets for 2010, which are on those figures, do you see those targets as achievable or are you more positive about meeting those targets after first half performance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start for the EBITDA targets. We're simply confirming what we said in March, so we are confirming our original targets, as the results at the end of the June are better than expected, but as I said, at least we still confirm what we have said in March. When it comes to the volumes, we expect in Italy to generate something in the region of 80 terawatt hours this year. Next year, it will not be not very different, it depends of course on the demand evolution, we'll be more specific during the next business plan presentation, but for the time being we think it should be slightly below, something like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay sorry. I have a general question about the detail of the Terna report daily, we monitor them on a daily basis, and in the last week we have noticed that there is a recovery in demand, especially in the last week as the demand versus last year was up 2% and in the previous week was up 0.1% driving the total demand at a minus 2.5%, which is a reversion of trend. Can you comment it and well obviously do you see any reversion or any signal of recovering total overall demand in electric? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wish we could knew it. Of course, we agree with you, this July performance is showing some decline in the fall, so it's an improvement. As you know, we've been showing the numbers -- our demand dropping significantly in the first half of the year, mostly due to the industry -- industrial consumption, which is a reflection of the recession that we pass just through. We all hope that this, so called, green sprouts that we've been seeing around will blossom in the near future. As Luigi just commented on our projection for the next year, we take stock of the lower demand. We pursue a margin strategy ever since, we haven't changed that. And this has proven to be the right thing to do. So let's hope that the green sprouts turns into blossom and we will take advantage of the incremental volumes at that point in time.</p>
