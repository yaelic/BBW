          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Inditex Conference Call for the Fiscal Year 2011 Results. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session, comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for fiscal 2011. I am Pablo Isla and here with me are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, CFO; and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for 2011 show the global reach of our business model. Inditex continues its ongoing multi-concept, multi-channel growth. We are now operating a highly diversified business platform. 2011 has been a year of strong expansion for Inditex. We have achieved very relevant growth in sales, with positive sales growth in all geographic areas.</p>
          <p>We have also had a strong operating performance. The year has been marked by the satisfactory evolution of gross margins, increased efficiency and tight operating control. As a result, the group has generated a strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>Due to this fact and the significant opportunities to invest profitably, funds from operations have been devoted mainly to the expansion of our business. This growth has taken place through the addition of brand retail space in markets with high potential.</p>
          <p>Our financial condition also allows us to propose a significant increase in shareholder remuneration for fiscal 2011. We have finished the year with operations in five continents through eight formats and our online sales presence in very relevant markets. We start 2012 with a unique platform that can access growth opportunities globally.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight some key points of these results. In 2011, sales grew satisfactorily by 10% to &#x20AC;13.8 billion. Due to the strong sales growth, our higher operating efficiency, Inditex EBITDA increased 10% to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. Net income grew 12% to &#x20AC;1.9 billion or &#x20AC;3.10 per share. The return on capital employed reached 37%. As a result of our performance, Inditex Board of Directors is proposing a 12.5% increase in the dividend to be paid in relation to these results.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers and I will join you later for the outlook section</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our results for fiscal 2011 continue to show strong growth <mark type="ph" /> in all of the lines (3:23) on the profit and loss account. The regional strength has been satisfactory, with 11% in local currencies. Like-for-like sales have increased 4%.</p>
          <p>Inditex retail space has grown 9.7% to 2.8 million square meters. We have added more than 251,000 square meters to our retail park over the year. The ongoing expansion of our group has led to a global sales platform. It's present in 82 markets and five continents, both in the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres.</p>
          <p>Regarding the gross margin, you can say that we are pleased with the evolution in <mark type="ph" /> trend-tier (4:17) level. Inditex gross profit has increased 10% to &#x20AC;8.2 million. The gross margin has reached 59.3% of sales, similar to last year, as a result of the evolution of sales, our flexible business model and sustained commercial policies.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 10% in the year, due to the addition of new retail space and include all the startup cost of new stores and announced and the <mark type="ph" /> launched line sales (04:56) sales for the company. And the lines of the working capital continued to show tight control, reflecting the flexibility of the business model. In 2011, funds from operations has increased 3% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion, inflated by the current year tax payments not related to the business. Adjusted for this timing issue, funds for operations would have grown in line with EBITDA.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the strong investment of 2011 to ensure future growth. Ordinary capital expenditure to ensure future expansion was &#x20AC;864 million. Extraordinary capital expenditure regarding the acquisition of premises at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, 11 Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Milan and selected franchise operations for Zara, Massimo Dutti and Uterq&#xFC;e have reached &#x20AC;485 million.</p>
          <p>The data continues to show a strong financial condition. Net cap excluding extraordinary capital expenditure was down by 15%.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos Lopez, who will cover some details of the performance of the companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can see in this chart, Zara continues to represent approximately two-thirds of Inditex sales and the younger concepts, one-third. Let me add that all the concepts have increased their sales platform and deepened their global penetration.</p>
          <p>2011 has been a year of strong activity for Inditex. The group has opened 483 net stores across its eight concepts. Proving the capacity for business model to reach global growth opportunities, Inditex has opened stores in 49 different markets over the year to reach 5,527 stores worldwide.</p>
          <p>Zara sales in 2011 have grown satisfactory at 10% to &#x20AC;8.9 billion. EBIT has grown 12% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. The concept as a whole have had growth very much in line with the average of the group. Regarding the younger concepts, I would like to highlight the strong progression of Massimo Dutti and Stradivarius.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. Before closing, I would like to elaborate on a number of strategic issues for Inditex. Regarding the outlook for our group, let me tell you that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities. We operate a highly flexible business model and offer a strong fashion proposition with attractive pricing.</p>
          <p>Our business model avoids the main fixed costs involved in expansion, allowing us to take advantage of growth opportunities wherever they are present. Our global business platform is present in 82 countries in five continents through eight formats. And we have established online sales in the most relevant markets. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Regarding Europe, we continue to see significant growth opportunities in both Western and Eastern Europe. It is an area of growth for all our formats and we have an online sales presence in 17 markets. We see great potential to expand profitably in Europe for many years.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our priority is to leverage on the strong presence we have built over recent years. Asia accounts today for 18% of Inditex sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition, focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of the markets are in transformation. We currently enjoy a very strong position in the region.</p>
          <p>We are following a multi-concept expansion strategy in Asia, combining openings of Zara with openings for a number of our formats in the majority of markets. We have also started online operations in Japan last October. We see a strong long-term potential for Inditex in Asian markets.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight our experience in China in a very special way. 2011 has been a year of strong expansion. We currently operate 275 stores in 42 cities in China. 2012, we continue to see a strong growth. We plan to open around 130 stores per annum over the next few years. By yearend, we will present in more than 50 cities with around 425 stores. All Inditex concepts will be expanding in China.</p>
          <p>We also see strong growth opportunities in the Americas, with a number of attractive growth markets. Additionally, we have launched online sales in the United States last September and see a strong potential. We also see growth opportunities for the concepts. Massimo Dutti will be launched in the U.S., opening a flagship store in Fifth Avenue in New York City and Canada. And Stradivarius will be rolled out in Mexico and Zara Home in Brazil over 2012.</p>
          <p>We have also launched Zara in Australia, South Africa and Taiwan in 2011, confirming the global reach of our business model. The reception has been very strong. We will continue to add stores in all these markets over the current year. I would like to highlight that we have recently opened a global flagship for Zara at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York. This unique store of 3,600 square meters in one of the world's key fashion destinations will further enhance our global presence. 2012 will be a year of strong expansion for Inditex. Our opening plans include a range of 480 to 520 new stores globally.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure will be around &#x20AC;950 million. Inditex online operations have seen very significant activity and have very rapid rollout in the past years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales platform globally. Zara has been an online sales presence in 17 European countries over recent months. Zara has launched online sales in the U.S. and Japan in the second half of 2011. The concept has also launched online sales in Europe last year. In March 2012, online sales have been launched in Poland for Zara, followed by Zara Home. We will continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are operate in with the stores. The next aspect will be the launch of online sales in China for Zara in the autumn/winter season.</p>
          <p>Regarding shareholder remuneration, the Board of Directors will propose to the General Shareholders Meeting a 12.5% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2011 to &#x20AC;1.80 per share, an interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.90 per share will be payable on 2nd of May and a final dividend of &#x20AC;0.90 per share, including the bonus, will be payable on 2nd of November. The total dividend payment amounts to &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me tell you that the store sales in local currencies adjusted for the calendar effect of an extra trading day in February due to the leap year have increased 11% from the 1st of February to the 14th of March 2012. As you all know, the spring/summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period due to significant sales volumes. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

We remind you that online questions will follow. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>The first question comes from Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question is about the gross margin. Was there a significant currency impact in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, no. There wasn't any significant currency impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps you could explain the key factors within that rise in gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would like to say, first of all, is that we are very satisfied with the evolution of the gross margin during the year 2011, both in the first half and in the second half. After the big increase in the gross margin that took place in the year 2010, I think that to achieve this gross margin in the year 2011 is very remarkable.</p>
          <p>And as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different things. So it has to do with fashion trends, mark-ups, mark-downs. It has to do with many, many different things. It has a lot to do with like-for-like sales evolution. You can see that we have had a very positive like-for-like sales evolution during the year, 4% like-for-like and positive both in the spring/summer season and in the autumn/winter season. So it's a combination of many different factors, as we always say and no particular relevant currency impact in this gross margin evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just one more question about your openings. I see that you're increasing the Massimo Dutti openings compared to last year, but reducing the younger age format, Pull &amp; Bear and Bershka. Is that due to some interpretation of demographic trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Not really. I think you shouldn't read into one particular year number of openings, because it has to do with the normal evolution of fits of the brands. So no, it is not really any type of change regarding our strategy or our approach with the different brands. So with Massimo Dutti, we're seeing strong opportunities in many different markets and that is why we are talking about this number of openings. But no, no, I think it's better when we analyze the number of openings globally or the number of openings of any particular brand, I think it is much better to look at two to three years' period to see the evolution of the number of openings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Assad Malic from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. It was just really around the online business. I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on the margin progression coming through with online? You previously said you expected to be in line with the sort of group average. Is that still the case? And are you actually seeing any major deviation between geographies when it comes to online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, what I would like to say is that we are very happy with our online business. I have talked &#x2013; we have talked about this before in previous conference calls. We think online activity has been very positive from two different points of view. Of course, one has to do with the evolution of online sales. But the other one has also to do with online as a way to communicate with our customers. And for example, now we can say that we have more than 1 million visits per day to the Zara webpage. So it's an incredible tool for us to communicate our products or to communicate the looks and everything. So it's an incredible tool of communication with our customers.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; well, and you have seen that the progression in &#x2013; regarding our online activity is being quite relevant. We are expanding our online business in many different markets in Europe, in the U.S. And for this year, we are planning in the autumn/ winter season to begin our online operations in China, which is also a very, very relevant market and thinking about that maybe on the long term within the &#x2013; in this online activity in China will be quite relevant and quite complementary to our store opening plan in China.</p>
          <p>Talking about online margins, what I would say &#x2013; as we have said before, we prefer not to elaborate very much. You must have in mind that it is not at all dilutive and we continue focused on the execution in the U.S. and Japan. We are there only since the last autumn/winter season. This &#x2013; we have just begun our operations in Poland. We are planning China for this year. So at this stage, we prefer just to mention that it is not at all dilutive in terms of EBIT margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But is it correct that you're seeing a slightly better performance in terms of returns rates on products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, because we cannot hear you that well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say are you seeing a better level of returns &#x2013; product returns within online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the level of returns is very much in line with our expectations right now, because we have quite a significant experience. At the very beginning, what we could say is that we were expecting a high level of returns than the reality, but now, as that stands, we are beginning to have more and more experience. We are used to this level of returns. It's very much in line with our own expectations.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. It's Andrew Hughes from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You can hear me all right, can you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on cash flow, where your cash flow seems to be a little bit lower than I was expecting. And I was just wondering in areas like your creditor payments and the tax, whether you were seeing more pressure from &#x2013; I guess, from suppliers and possibly also from the government for faster payment of supplier corporation tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andy, in regarding the cash flow, what I would say is that we have generated a strong cash flow in the year. Basically, you have three factors when analyzing the cash flow for this fiscal year 2011. The first one is that you have an element of extraordinary CapEx of &#x20AC;485 million. If you deduct this, you would see that just the cash position would have grown by 15%. Okay, so excluding this factor, which is linked to the business, you have then two other factors which are not related to the business.</p>
          <p>The first one, you have penciled it in, is basically the calendar of tax payments. If you remember last year, net income grew 32%, and obviously linked to this cash obligation, tax payments in the cash flow have increased by 36%. If you go to the cash flow statement, you will see that the cash payments have increased by almost &#x20AC;200 million versus last year. So basically, we're talking about a timing issue that will be diluted over time.</p>
          <p>The second issue, which again, is not related to the business, is the fact that the payables have grown by 16% in 2010. So if you see in 2011 they have grown by just 2%, if you take a two-year average, you will see that we're talking about 10% growth, as you can see in the average of most of the working capital accounts over 2011 than 2010 combined. So basically, those are to timing and comparable issues that will be fully diluted over the medium term.</p>
          <p>So what I would say is that the company has generated a very strong cash flow. All the investment is focused on expansionary cash flow, both in starting &#x2013; sorry, in opening new stores and launching online operations, plus extraordinary organic CapEx in both acquired and some selected franchises for Zara, Massimo Dutti, and obviously these very important stores in Fifth Avenue in New York and Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Milan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. Are you needing to support suppliers at all, though, with faster payment on the fall line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. All the fundamentals of our working capital remain very, very stable. What we think is relevant is to &#x2013; obviously, the working capital is just a snapshot at any given moment. If you take the average of two years, you see that all the key lines of working capital, both payables, receivables, inventory, are growing at around 10%. So very much in line with the fundamentals of the business model.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. My question regards the balance sheet efficiency. You ended the year with a strong net cash position. You are increasing your dividend. Going forward, could you expect a more precise guidance in terms of what could be the way to enhance the balance sheet structure to turn it more efficient for shareholders? Could you increase your dividend payout in a more relevant way? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Well, as Marcos was saying before, we are generating strong cash flows year after year. And in terms of how to use our cash, we have of course one, first priority which is to invest in the long-term profitable growth of our company. But as far as this cash generation, it is quite strong. We can combine this investment in the long-term profitable growth of our company with an attractive and predictable shareholders remuneration policy.</p>
          <p>This year, we are increasing the dividend 12.5%. This means that we are paying more than &#x20AC;1.1 billion to our shareholders; that the payout ratio is 58%. You know that our stated policy is that the payout ratio would be at least 50% and then there is the possibility of extraordinary dividends and this year, we have added to the ordinary dividend this &#x20AC;0.20 per share, which means a payout ratio at 58%.</p>
          <p>If you analyze the evolution of the dividend in our company in the last few years, you will see that we are permanently increasing our dividend and this is the trend that you can expect in the coming years. So it is basically at least 50% payout ratio, but always with the possibility of extraordinary dividends, as it has been the case in the last few years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Morning, everybody. Just wondered if you could talk about the performance in Spain please, Pablo. It appears to have slowed quite a lot from what was obviously a very, very strong performance in the first half, up about 4% to what looks like minus 6% for Inditex in the second half. So, still outperforming the market, but at what seems to be a lower rate. I just wondered if that trend had continued into Q1? Are you still outperforming the Spanish market and how you see the outlook there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first thing I would like to say is that as we say during &#x2013; as we have said during the presentation that we have achieved sales growth in all the different markets. So our sales in Spain have increased this year. When you extrapolate the figures to try to find the final figure in the first half and in the second half, you must have in mind that the decimals, because here we have round figures and the decimals could play a role from that point of view. Globally during the year, our performance in Spain has been quite stable, positive, but quite stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So those percentages you give by geography then are very rough percentages, are they, the 25% and the 28%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So globally, our performance in Spain during the year has been quite stable, as I was saying, positive but quite stable. And what we are expecting for this year is something similar. If you analyzed our performance in Spain in the last few years, we have been able to maintain a stable level of sales in the Spanish market in a situation in which global consumption was going down, and this is the same that we are expecting for this year. As you know, Spain is a market that we know quite well. It's our domestic market and we have been able during these last few years to maintain a stable level of sales and this would be our expectation for the current year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And could I just ask about the Bershka format, please? That format, I think, saw a decline in profits again and obviously, last year was affected by the very difficult comparable. The year before that was very, very strong. But I wondered, I guess the question is what changes are you making to try to improve the performance of the Bershka format going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, regarding Inditex, I think one of the distinctive features of a group is in fact the multi-concept approach, which we believe gives a lot of strength and provides diversification and a better coverage of the market. So as such, we prefer to look at the younger formats together. If you do this, you will see that sales growth for the younger formats has been 11% in constant currency. The EBIT margin has been above 16%. <mark type="ph" /> On re-channel (30:49) capital employed has been 51%. Of course, in any given year, some formats will be above or below the average.</p>
          <p>In the specific case of Bershka, I would like to highlight that return on capital employed in 2011 was 38%, so still above the average of the group. In the year, Bershka has had a very strong expansion and it's not only this year. It's been in the previous year, it's carried out by the important strategic initiatives, including the opening of flagship stores, clearly, in Tokyo's Shibuya, in Milan, in Berlin. And last week, we've opened a flagship store for Bershka in Osaka in Shinsaibashi, the main retail district of the city. So clearly, we have very strong, ambitious goals for Bershka. We've launched online practically all Europe in recent months and we have, again, very strong plans to grow the company in the coming years. For example, this year, Bershka is going to open 70 stores in more than 30 countries. So the strategy keeps on to grow the company in a very significant way.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, morning, guys. It was &#x2013; a second question regarding the concepts, similar to the previous one, but on Oysho. It seems you had a tougher year, I mean, particularly, what's behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, what I've just mentioned before I think applies to Oysho in a way. We just have to look at the concepts all together, with very strong results for all of them. If you put them all together, obviously, in any given year, some concepts are going to be above or below the average.</p>
          <p>In the specific case of Oysho, I think that the calendar of openings is relevant, because Oysho opened 67% of total stores over the second half. So it's a slightly second half bias and obviously, you have to bear in mind the comparable ratios, because EBIT grew 77% in 2009 and 19% in 2010. So again, the strategy for the concepts, we believe it's better to have a look at all of them together. But obviously, in some concepts, given especially their size, a small change in EBIT or CapEx may result in some variations. But again, we have very ambitious plans for Oysho. We expect to open more than 50 stores this year and expanding the company in very relevant markets.</p>

          <p>Great. And just separately on the tax charge, do you have a tax rate you're expecting in the year-end?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Being in so many countries, our full year tax rate will depend very much on the final geographical mix of our business. For this reason, at this point in time, our best expectation for the full year 2011-2012 is tax rate between 23% and 20% &#x2013; 24% and 25%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you just comment on the significant improvement in the inventory position at year-end? Is there any one-offs there to be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know that we always say that the inventory position, that for us, it's much more relevant, the commitment that we have at any point in time. And we always say that it is much better to look at the inventory position also on a two years' basis. So at the beginning of the year, at the end of the year 2011, it was very low, but this is just a photo in one particular moment. So it is better to analyze it in a two years' basis. In any case, you must have always in mind the flexibility of our business model, the way we operate our business model in the &#x2013; with all the brands and this proximity sourcing that we have. So that is what you should have in mind.</p>
          <p>We also, you also have in this presentation the trading update. Of course, this is just the first six weeks of the year, but it's, I would say, quite a healthy trading update, but nothing else to say about the inventory position. For us, it is much more relevant the commitment that we have at any point in time and from this point of view, we are very much in line with what is the normal trend of our business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's very much in line with the store growth. I mean, it's, I think it is not so much worth it to talk about &#x20AC;20 million, &#x20AC;30 million of CapEx. We have &#x2013; this year, we have had 480 openings. For the next year, we are planning, between 480 to 520, so if we would be in the upper part of the range, we would be very much in line with our CapEx growth expectation for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. I was just wondering if you could talk about your medium-term space growth target? You have been growing space at 8% to 10% in the last few years. To what extent has that been a reflection of a tough pipeline, particularly shopping center development, and to what extent is that simply just a slowdown in your overall growth rate, because of the base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say that if we think about the next three years, for example, we'll continue seeing this 8% to 10% space growth. You must have in mind that we are presenting 82 different markets with all our brands in most of them. So the growth opportunities are there, so we don't see any problem with this 8% to 10% space growth in the coming years.</p>
          <p>If you analyze this year, we are &#x2013; the last year, the year 2011, we are in the upper part of the range and if we think about this year and the coming years, we'll continue seeing a space growth in this 8% to 10% range.</p>
          <p>You must have in mind that in China, we see strong growth opportunities in the coming years in all the different Asia markets, in all the different European markets, Western and Eastern European markets. And also of course, in the Americas and in these new markets that we have begun in the year 2011, Australia, South Africa. So there are plenty &#x2013; when you have a global presence, you have plenty of opportunities to continue opening the stores in a significant way. So when we think about the economy in the next three years, for example, we continue seeing this 8% to 10% space growth.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage of the year, what we would say is that we see a stable gross margin for this year. This would be our base estimation. But we are just at the beginning of the year and as we always say, stable for us means plus or minus 50 basis points where we would see a stable gross margin for the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, thank you.</p>

          <p>We are now finishing the telephone Q&amp;A session to address the questions received through the webcast platform. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We are now going to go through the questions that have come in through the webcast platform. The first question; it seems there was a strong acceleration in the fourth quarter sales. Can you give us some color on this? Was it due to like-for-like, space contribution, online sales, or any particular concept or geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would like to say about this point is that as you know, we always prefer to talk about sales evolution in a full season. In this case, the autumn/winter season we have had 3% like for like sales growth, which is quite relevant figure, having also in mind the comparable. And I think this is what is more relevant, much more to analyze sales in one isolated quarter. So globally, the second half of the year has been positive in terms of like-for-like sales growth and in terms of all the other elements of the profit and loss account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have the second question. Can you give us some feedback regarding your recent launches in new markets? For example, your launch in Taiwan, and what potential do you see in these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have talked about this in previous conference calls. We are quite satisfied with the reception we have had in the markets in which we have begun our operations during the year 2011. We can talk about Australia, with the openings in Sydney and Melbourne. We can talk about South Africa. And the most recent one in Taiwan, also very, very successful and our plans are to continue opening stores in these markets, as in many other markets. But <mark type="ph" /> the role (44:33) in this markets, of course, our plans are to continue opening stores in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have one final question from the webcast platform. What are your plans for logistics investments over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very similar to the current trends, of course. We are permanently investing in logistics, in the different logistic platforms that we have. Nothing really extremely relevant from that point of view. We will continue investing in logistics in a normal way during the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that concludes the questions from the webcast platform. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much and in any case, of course, we are ready to continue answering your questions through our capital markets team. Thank you very much.</p>
