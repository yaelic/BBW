        <plist>
          <p>Good day. Thanks for joining us today and sorry about the late start here. We had a little technical glitch on getting our slides put up. Again, I'm Don Voelte and in additon to me here today, of course, from Investor Relations we have Mike Lynn and Chris Bishop. I've also got Mike &#x2013; Mark Chatterji here to help me with the financial details as well as Lori Trumane . Agu Kantsler is also here to help us on the exploration side of the business as well as a few others.</p>
          <p>I want to go straight to the second page and just note the disclaimer and important notice, just to make sure that's on the record. Look I'd like to start off today with a couple of comments. I think number one, is the major headline today is that your investment in Woodside is executing better than ever.</p>
          <p>As we go through the slides today, I'd like to make a few overall comments before we jump from page to page here. First, I think, we've all watched in amazement the overall market over the last six to nine months. Now, I am not going to sit here and predict with any certainty the future, but I do know the following.</p>
          <p>First the trading range of oil is structurally displaced from previous cycles and norms. Second supply, demand and volatility still rule the market; and third, you can be sure that Woodside is using a much, much more conservative price assumption for planning and project economics than what we have been witnessing in the marketplace. We are staying very conservative to ride through the environment we see today and it is true following on oil, based on our Japanese crude cocktail basket, LNG pricing is following the upper trend of oil. It's looking good and domestic gas is really looking good.</p>
          <p>Now as I said internally, working for the company, Woodside Management employees are really delivering to the bottom line. But we also see externally two serious threats to our business.</p>
          <p>First, contractors are struggling to provide resources contracted; product quality, equipment availability and laborers of proper skills, bearing some training. It's serious and it's getting better &#x2013; it's not getting better, although numerous strategies and tactics have been employed.</p>
          <p>Cost escalation and scheduled delivery seem to always be under pressure. Now it's a major concern for everybody in our industry, but it's just a way of doing business these days. Woodside is actually building and executing in this space. It's doing it hard, but I think we are doing it very well.</p>
          <p>The second threat and I never thought I have to raise it, and in the Australian context, it's fiscalrisk which approaches sovereign risk from the government. Earlier this year, we experienced the shock of the condensate excise tax being suddenly imposed by the Commonwealth. Imposed without consultation and with a justification that's ill-conceived, the government has overnight imposed what they calculate to be a $2.6-billion impact over the next few years to the North West Shelf joint venture.</p>
          <p>Now, this is a group, we have to remember that invested $25 billion in good faith in Australia over this last 30 years. The taxation arrangements for the North West Shelf project have been in place for 31 years and the government derived a real benefit in the form of early excise and royal revenues, upfront revenues that wouldn't have been received under the more widely applied PRRT regime.</p>
          <p>More significantly, however, the taxation arrangements played a central role in creating the fiscal environment that allowed the project to proceed and provided the basis of continued investment over the past two decades and more.</p>
          <p>The tax setting supported the establishment of Western Australia's largest domestic facility. This is a facility that supplies between 60 and 70% of the state's gas supply. Now many customers have enjoyed long-term stable supply at prices that have been extremely competitive and that's a nice way of saying really low prices. However, with higher cost of supply already impacting the business, there was already significant upward pressure on Western Australia's domestic and industrial gas prices affected in a widely canvass in various forms.</p>
          <p>It is in this environment that there is new tax has been imposed upon us &#x2013; upon the venture. As with all businesses, Woodside must pass on increased cost including taxes to customers over time. All companies pass tax on. The idea that we'll somehow absorb this cost into our business is unrealistic. This unexpected new tax is no different than any other cost. It will partly pass on to customers over the next few months and years as we reopen and renew domestic contracts, and we'll recover as much as we can, if not all, of the new tax burden.</p>
          <p>One last thing, if there was additional revenue that the government wanted, we could have sat down and entered into a negotiation and delivered a win-win outcome. For example, improved fiscal terms a new projects could create significant tax revenues without imposing additional taxation cost, which will really help us &#x2013; could have made a better situation for something that we wouldn't have such a large cost to pass on to our customers. So we're just stating the obvious here is is that businesses pass on these type of costs and they pass them on to our customers.</p>
          <p>One last item, before we get started on the slide pack, is the emissions trading scheme or the Australian Government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Now despite the intention of the CPRS, the heart of my concern is that the plan as proposed in the Green Paper could, and I actually think will or would, actually increase worldwide carbon pollution if implemented in its current form. As it basically makes LNG opportunities much harder to be up and running and encourages coal.</p>
          <p>Now Woodside wants to be a part of the global response to the limited greenhouse gas emissions and reductions, we don't want to be just part of the response, we want to be a key player. Furthermore, we support a properly constructed emissions trading scheme. But the scheme being proposed in the Green Paper runs the real risk of damaging one of the best means Australia has in contributing to the fight to limit and reduce global greenhouse emissions.</p>
          <p>LNG is a clean &#x2013; a cleaner fuel, which is playing a key role in helping many countries lower their greenhouse emissions. A few statistic, for every ton greenhouse gas emitted in Australia producing LNG, we can avoid four tons of emissions in many of our customer countries by displacing coal and other fuel.</p>
          <p>In China, the benefit can even be higher. It can run up to 5, 7 to 9 times the benefit. Therefore, when we export more LNG to customer countries such as China, we deliver greater environmental benefits than penalizing our industry in Australia rather than placing additional cost on LNG production, I believe Australia should be looking to improve the competitiveness of its LNG project. There is nothing else that can view as much benefit to the reduction of greenhouse gases from Australia as producing more LNG.</p>
          <p>Now having said all that, I acknowledge it's only a Green Paper at this stage and the government has committed to consulting with the industry before moving on to the White Paper and then legislation. So there remains a lot of time here to get the policy settings right on this issue. I wanted to emphasize the point, and if I to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, LNG is part of the solution, it's not the part of the problem.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn then over to page three, slide number three and go through the headlines of the financial performance. We've had a really good first half; in fact I think it's a great first half with record performance in several areas. Our revenues are record $2.6 billion, up 45%; while net operating cash flow is $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Our reported profit is 67%; while our underlying profit is up 86%, those have been coming in around $1 billion for the first time. It's true, commodity prices have helped us, but I'm really happy to report that the percentage profit increase is higher than the percentage of revenue increased and that's by a large margin.</p>
          <p>This profit is not a windfall, it's payback for hard work and billions of dollars we've invested in Australia over a number of years. Making profit is a good thing. It allows us to grow. It enables us to invest in future projects. For example, the multi-billion-dollar fuel plant that we are building is expected to boost Western Australia's economy by about $28 billion and also provide about $8.5 billion in revenue to Australian Government. And also in addition, do what is most important for our economy, generate thousands of good paying jobs. Now our shareholders will benefit, no doubt about that, but with our reinvestment so will the community.</p>
          <p>Slide four. Last November, we told you we produced between 80 and 86 million barrels of oil equivalent. Now we have achieved record first half production of 36.5 million barrels and we have more to come in the second half. Otway has been producing steadily since February, we have additional North West Shelf equity productions May onward, and Power Play in the Gulf of Mexico came on in June. Our three re-drills at Enfield have been very successful and expect a strong second half from them.</p>
          <p>Now in the second half, we've already added new production from Neptune and over the coming weeks we will have additional production from Vincent, Angel and North West Shelf's Train 5. We are seriously studying whether we should increase the lower range of our 80 to 86 million target, but I decided that with three new facilities just starting production there is still considerable uncertainty in those new facilities, which is why we are retaining at this time our current range. However barring a major incident or event we're confident that we'll meet our production target by year-end which will represent an 18 to 22% annual production growth. When I look at our competition, that's not bad.</p>
          <p>In November, we'll be able to give you more guidance at the Investor Relations Day that we have every year at Woodside.</p>
          <p>On slide &#x2013; page &#x2013; on slide five. Last November, we told you it would be a challenging year. We promised you that in 2008, we would deliver and with increased production this year, through a full year, a nearly full year of Otway, a full year of Stybarrow, Neptune started up, Vincent is starting up, Angel is starting up and North West Shelf's Train 5 is starting up.</p>
          <p>We have delivered and we are continuing to deliver. Otway and Stybarrow are running really well, in fact I'd say Stybarrow has performed much better than we ever expected. Neptune and Power Play has started up and they are also producing fantastically. Vincent is in its early days, we've got the facility circulating gas at this point and getting ready, we are in sequence now to open up our oil at any time. We'll tell the market when we produce our first oil.</p>
          <p>On Angel, as Train 5 ramps up, we will bring Angel on, it's ready to go and it will come on production at the same time Train 5 ramps up. And I'm speaking of Train 5 well, I got to tell you, I was there last Friday up in Karratha, sea gas was going through the facility, we're basically going to go cold in the next couple of days. Following that we will start running in LNG, run down to the tanks and that will be when we advise the market the first production. Things look good Karratha.</p>
          <p>So, basically things are running really well, both in Woodside and our contractors, I think, are really putting it to the bottom line. I am talking more about the individual assets quite a bit for now, let me just say that our producing assets are going really well, and our projects are progressing on-time on-cost. And I think we've had a really good first half and I'm really expecting even a better second half.</p>
          <p>One area that we need to work on: our safety, environment, and integrity. Our TRCF at 5.2, which is our total injury frequency, it's just plain flat unacceptable. We've been investigating a lot of our serious injuries and high potential incidents, direct intervention by senior business leaders within Woodside has had an affect that's improving the performance, but still not to the level that we require.</p>
          <p>On environment, where we're always looking at the perfect day and the perfect week and the perfect month, we're not there yet. So we're certainly putting a lot of attention and effort towards it.</p>
          <p>Integrity; this is something new for you. With increasing focus on ensuring that our facilities are properly designed build to specification, maintained and operated safely, reliably and with maximum efficiency, we decided to publicly report our integrity KPI.</p>
          <p>Now we have very sophisticated systems which track our maintenance programs on all of our assets to ensure that we do the right work at the right time. As you can see currently this KPI sits at 96% for the year-to-date and the industry best practiced target runs about 93%, so we're doing okay there.</p>
          <p>Now, at this point, I'm going to turn over to Mark Chatterji, our CFO to go through the financial results for the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Don. I am going to start on slide number eight, which is our first half profit performance. First half profit before significant items rose 86% to $1.009 billion; the two significant items were gain on the sale of our Pluto equity interest, which is $19 million, and a loss on the sale of two Gulf of Mexico Shelf fields for $12 million. That gives you reported impact of $1.016 billion, which is up 67% from the comparable first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, slide number nine is a variance analysis showing you the variance between the first half of 2007 and the first half of 2008. As you can see revenue grew by $797 million, this gain was driven by an increase in both price and volume, partially offset by a decrease in AUD-USD exchange rate.</p>
          <p>The cost of sales also increased by $144 million. This is primarily driven by an increase in production cost, as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization. However, even amounting &#x2013; accounting for the movement in cost, gross profit increased by $653 million or 55% from the comparable period.</p>
          <p>Turning to other income and expenses, the net position for the first half of 2008, saw an improvement of $152 million against the comparable period with reductions in both exploration and evaluation expense and also other G&amp;A cost.</p>
          <p>The other large movement in this category is the variance due to the gain and loss recognized on assets sales. Now you'll recall, in 2007, for the first half, we had Legendre and PNG versus the 2008 significant items, which is the Pluto and Gulf of Mexico Shelf fields, I talked about earlier. Finally, there is some small variances in net finance cost and of course large variance in tax expense because record profits mean record tax payments.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number 10. Slide number 10 will take you to our production cost, both on a gross and per value basis for oil and gas. I'll start with gas. Gas production costs rose due to both the start-up Otway and maintenance spending in North West Shelf. Now Don mentioned upfront, maintenance is the priority for the company and this is especially true for North West Shelf, where we expect to continue to be producing hydrocarbons, several decades from now.</p>
          <p>Turning to oil production costs, increases have come primarily from a replacement of the gas lift riser at Corallina, successful completion of sidetracks on our Enfield wells, and also the start-up of Stybarrow facility. Now on a unit basis, the cost increase is smaller due to increase in production versus the comparable period in the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number 11. This slide shows our CapEx profile estimated for the full year 2008 and that during the first half of 2008, we spent $2.4 billion and we expect spending to increase somewhat in the second half. The lion's share of that spending is related of course to our Pluto 1 project.</p>
          <p>Woodside's 90% share of the spending on the project is $10.8 billion of that $10.8 billion, we expect to spend around $4.3 billion by the end of 2008. As for the remainder of the projected spend, North West Shelf accounts for around three quarters of $1 billion which is not only do the Train 5 and Angel, but also the NR2 project which was sanctioned in March and our purchase to Shell's interest into the North West Shelf oil assets.</p>
          <p>The last &#x2013; greater Enfield area oil spending is around $400 million and finally exploration spending should be about $350 million this year.</p>
          <p>Turning over the next slide. Woodside has declared an interim dividend of $0.80 per share, which is an increase of 63% over the comparable period. For this interim dividend, Woodside will make use of a fully underwritten dividend reinvestment program which actually takes me over to my next slide, slide number 13, which shows our net debt and gearing position.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased to $1.8 billion for the half year, while gearing rose to 25%. During the first half, Woodside closed US$1.5 billion financing led by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.</p>
          <p>During the second half, we expect to close additional debt financing, further balance sheet support will come from our decision to fully start to reactivate the fully underwritten dividend reinvestment program for this dividend which we expect will position us well from the gearing perspective as we enter 2009. It's important to remember that in addition to Pluto 1, we're looking to move the ball forward on our next LNG development. So keeping some powder dry is prudent.</p>
          <p>That's it from me. I'm going to hand back to Don. And he is going to discuss with outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mark. I'll give you a few snap shots now of what's going to be coming up over the next few years. I'll skip over to slide 15. I think it speaks for itself, going to next slide, 16. In today's $100 plus oil environment, every barrel's really important and valuable to us. The Wanaea-Cossack Lambert-Hermes field continues to produce really well and we are really happy to be able to double our equity interest there, especially at the acquisition price of about US$18 per barrel. We are going to pay this acquisition out in a few more months.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to look for unswept pockets for example with the Hermes appraisal well that we are going to be drilling here in the next few weeks. And there could be another one to three wells over the next couple of years to enhance recovery from these fields. And with this excellent production, we are looking to lot &#x2013; to extend the life of these fields by replacing the current vessel to Cossack Pioneer and that decision will be made we believe by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Now certainly with our Northern Endeavour, on the Corallina Lambert &#x2013; Laminaria field, we are still producing at this time to the Corallina gas lift riser, so that asset is currently producing, check yesterday I think was 12,000 barrels of oil per day. And we just drilled an appraisal well, that found an unswept oil reservoir there and in the coming months we'll exploit this and to supplement our production.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we will show you that we have been really pleased with the way the three redrills have gone on the Enfield, our rig strategy meant we're able to get a rig quickly on location to get production restored as quickly as possible. ENA01 and ENA02 which were sidetracked this year came back on towards the end of the first half and have been producing really well ever since. They are producing water as expected, but they are sand-free and the field is currently producing around 55,000 barrels per day, that's 100%.</p>
          <p>By the way, when we approved Enfield in 2004, it was a $35 of oil which we planned on, that's a long ways away from today's prices. There's always minor issues to deal with on producing assets, but the team work &#x2013; that works this field, working really hard and I'm pleased with the way things have come along.</p>
          <p>Next year, we some near field exploration target. We've just got the new 4Ds data. Our guys will be looking over it to see what they have with a view to identify further Enfield drilling opportunities.</p>
          <p>Over 18, next door to Enfield, the Stybarrow BHP operated. This field has exceeded our expectation, having started production in December of last year, it quickly ramped up to over 75,000 barrels of oil per day and it stayed around that level throughout the first half of 2008. And by the way, as I mentioned before, when we approved Stybarrow it was about a $55 of oil we had planned up.</p>
          <p>Now Stybarrow is starting to cut water now. So of course, it will have its natural decline. However, we do expect this field to continue to be a big producer for us in the near-term. In terms of future activities 4D seismic as planned for 2009 and we expect that once there is sufficient production history, there's likely to be some drilling opportunities that come out.</p>
          <p>And just for your information purposes, we are looking at the economics of developing our previously discovered Lambert field via Stybarrow, but more to come on that one later.</p>
          <p>On slide number 19, Vincent. We got to be a little bit careful on Vincent, the things are moving as we see. But Vincent when in the start-up note this morning, with gas having been introduced to the FPSO and preparation for first oil. So let me just say that gas is certainly in the facility at this time, and they are in sequence to start-up. And we'll let you know when we actually produce oil, we'll put a market announcement out.</p>
          <p>Now a couple of things to change. We have been able to accelerate the start-up of the second manifold, what we call manifold B to coincide with our first production. So instead of the four wells that we told you, there we are going to be producing new start-up. We are going to have six wells to start-up when we bring each well on individually.</p>
          <p>It's early days, but we hope that production ramps up to around 50,000 barrels per day and then we think the field will start to decline a little bit, but then we'll have two more wells that finish off manifold B that will come on later on in Q4. Now, let's say that we are planning to drill Phase 2 for Vincent and we expect to drill those additional Enfield wells in 2009.</p>
          <p>Over to United States; Gulf of Mexico different picture for us, we're making money over there. Quite pleased and now more quite pleased about that. But on slide 20, we now have two deepwater assets producing in the U.S., Power Play and Neptune. Power Play is small but low cost and it's a real nice enhancer, currently producing around 8,000 barrels a day on 100% basis.</p>
          <p>Neptune is really producing well right now better than our best estimate. Production started at one well and quickly ramped up to 5 out of 6 wells producing now. But we are at capacity and production is producing right at 50,000 barrels of oil per day and 30 million cubic feet of gas per day again on 100% basis.</p>
          <p>Neptune is potentially a compartmentalized field and to adequately develop it we're considering additional opportunities to drill several more wells. And again, like as I mentioned, when we FID Neptune, we planned on a $50 environment.</p>
          <p>So you can see from these last five slides or oil slides, our oil productions are going really well. Most of these projects had investment decisions between 2004 and 2006 and oil prices around U.S. 30 and $60. And I say there's &#x2013; that a lot of people talk about the $100 plus oil then you got to produce it to enjoy it.</p>
          <p>And as you probably noticed, we have developed an awful lot of additional opportunities for each of these oil facilities in the next months and over the next couple of years. I think this can only be good news for 2009 and '10 production prior to Pluto start-up.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn over to gas, on page 21 here, the Karratha gas plant has been running really well on Trains 1 to 4. Our folks up there are doing a great job and even a better job getting our domestic gas up to over 700 TJs a day to help out, while another operators experience some problems of gas here at Varanus Island. Last month, I just mentioned that we set an all-time production record at plant. So the folks are working it hard.</p>
          <p>Train 5, of course, that's what you're interested in. It's running ahead of schedule. We've had commissioning gas in the plant since the beginning of May, we're completed with construction and commissioning and we are expecting first LNG run down very soon.</p>
          <p>So we expect to deliver first LNG cargoes actual deliveries to our customers in October of this year. Cost still need to be finalized, but we anticipate coming in &#x2013; on the 2.6 billion target that we've been talking about the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Moving offshore, the North West Shelf, on page 22, Angel has progressed to mechanical completion now. That means the platform is ready to take gas. It's now waiting for scheduled maintenance we completed on Train 4, as this will be &#x2013; when we need the gas along with bringing on Train 5. So we expect production on Angel to began at the end of September.</p>
          <p>The NR2 project is also underway, fabrication of the platform top-sizing in South Korea, and the jacket in Bataan in Indonesia. This project is going allow us to a fair access low pressure reserves and allow continuation in one of the largest gas production facilities in the world.</p>
          <p>And here we come to a little bit of slideshow here, the Pluto, Pluto is huge for us, and I just say it's really progressing quite well. We're already about 25% complete.</p>
          <p>Now you can see here on slide 23. The LNG tanks in the foreground with the pads for the condensate fleet tanks to left of them. The start of the shore crossing and jetty construction works at the bottom left hand side of the picture. And just above the LNG tank from the far side of the road would be location for power, water and other infrastructure facilities including the slug-catcher piping.</p>
          <p>Train 1, will be just to the right at this area on the first plateau further &#x2013; and out there further to the right, you see a second plateau that will be the location for our Train 2. And there is right above the &#x2013; our LNG tanks, when you look up there's kind of a hill on the back of &#x2013; of property and that's where we plan Train 3 site.</p>
          <p>Now a huge amount of site preparation has been done. And they are getting ready up there for delivery of the first modules which will again appearing onsite fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, the next progression, I'll take you through quite quickly. The LNG tank are under construction, the two LNG tank each hold about 120,000 cubic meters of LNG, each of them about twice the capacity of each of the North West Shelf tanks. One other things we learned from building operating five of the six Australian LNG tanks and across the gas plant is the importance to getting these tanks built right and on-time. There are always critical paths. Understanding that we started these tanks before we even took FID and we've been able to now to remove them from critical path.</p>
          <p>Over on slide 25, we see the roof panels for the tank. The first roof tank is now closed in. During the next few weeks, we'll be air lifting these roofs into place. We've learned to benefit of getting the roof on early so we can work inside in any weather it's kind of like just building, just like building a house, framing it in, weathering it in. It's just a little bit bigger and a whole lot more expensive.</p>
          <p>On slide 26, the modules for our LNG plant are being built by Sino-Thai and Laem Chabang, in Thailand. Here you can see the construction in one of the major process modules. WithTrain 5 we had about 75 modules. We have about 75% modularized on Train 5.</p>
          <p>Now we've extended this modular concept to 100% and at Pluto will be have &#x2013; we'll have around 270 modules. And as I said, the first deliveries of these &#x2013; the piperacks will arrive in Dampler Port in just a couple of months.</p>
          <p>On 27, people often ask how we get a hold of enough steel, enough people for our fabrication needs. Well, we are showing you how we do that. Final tie is dedicated steel fabrication yards in Rayong and Ban Chang, specifically for Pluto project.</p>
          <p>And over on page 28, you will see our newly built pipe shop in Sriracha in Thailand which is fabricating all of Pluto's process piping.</p>
          <p>And over on page 29, the offshore component of the Pluto project is spilt between the topsides fabrication in the Ramunia yards in Malaysia and fabrication by CFC in China. J. Ray McDermott will install the platform, and Allseas will install the trunkline and flowlines and [May-Sturgi] in will install and assess the equipment.</p>
          <p>So on slide 30, how we are managing cost in schedule. At FID in July, we are committed to around 1.4 billion and had firm bids in for another $4 billion in contract management.</p>
          <p>To date we've committed to around $6.5 billion of contract, by the end of this year, we expect to have committed about 75% of our total capital estimate. Now this strategy has secured vital resources, equipment, people and this includes lay barges, drill rigs, turbines, <mark type="inaudible" /> expanders, everything that you would imagine that we would need. But make no mistake, the program work we have to do between now and the end of 2010 is very challenging. But we told you we built this project for a total cost of 12 billion including the long lead time items and we'd have first gas late in 2010. Now there is no change to this guidance at this time. Our guidance thus remained unchanged. We are on cost and we are on schedule.</p>
          <p>Over on slide 31, we gave you a little snap shot here of the news you an expect over the next year. At the top of this slide is from the offshore milestones and bottom slide are some of the onshore milestones. We've got a lot going on, but we have had excellent experienced people in the project and we are moving along in a very good manner. And I'm saying when you are up in Karratha, it just blows your mind all this unfolding before you arrive.</p>
          <p>On slide 32, I will show you a little bit different angle here but we've got a couple of other areas here to put in. I think the major thing on this versus the slide we showed before is we do have horizon where the domestic gas plant potential location is there to the right of the slide.</p>
          <p>On slide 33, we'll talk about Pluto Train 2. What we need to get it through and secure an additional trend. What we need is we need to secure supplies of gas. Now our engineers are working on the basis of design what we call BoD before we go in to see the front-end engineering, but before they can finalize their plans they need to know the source and most importantly the chemistry of the gas. So we need to know where the gas is coming from before we can take a final investment decision. We told you we were talking to the owners of gas in the area and we are on ongoing discussions with these resource owners.</p>
          <p>We also are continuing our exploration program. We are currently acquiring a 3000 square kilometers 3D seismic in the Columbard survey and Block 404 just north of the Bayu oil field. And out in the Cazadores area, we are assuring the Armagnac 2D survey which will gather about 7000 line kilometers of data. The line of several new exploration projects and we hope to drill these over the next 18 months.</p>
          <p>On Sunrise, page 34, it's progressing, progressing quite well. I continue to have direct discussions with my CEO, counterparts and the partner companies and we're &#x2013; I'll tell you we are 100% aligned in moving forward. It's pretty amazing that everybody is still agreeable to our solution that to get this on production.</p>
          <p>Now the Sunrise team has ticked off in August 2008 goals. The team has completed initial concepts bringing in detailed technical study. And risk analysis underway to the floating LNG and Darwin options.</p>
          <p>We end a secured final cost estimates and rigid schedules for each option by the end of the first quarter of 2009. Now the rig that we have to do in appraisal well will show up on location tomorrow to drill the appraisal well in the northern section of the reservoir. With this additional piece of the appraisal puzzle, we will work towards the concept select by the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>FID will require approval to fill development plan by both countries, which could be the end of 2009. As you know, the reservoir extends across the boundary between Timor-Leste and Australia. So, one of the benefit for the concept by floating LNG is the fact, the facility that we placed in either Australian or Timor will [insdiscernible] .</p>
          <p>On page 35 Browse, our Browse team continues to appraise the three fields. We have narrowed consideration to focus on two concepts. We placed another one kind of one whole for the time being. The two most viable locations are in the Kimberley. We're working with state government and communities to select the preferred site and bringing the gas down to the Burrup or to the North West Shelf Pluto area. And we're firming up cost at this time and looking at the commercial arrangement that would be acquired to do that.</p>
          <p>Now the decision between the Kimberley and Browse sites could be made towards the end of this year. What about the impact of the emissions trading scheme that I talked about when we first started the conversation. I'll just tell you this, Browse is big and it is costly and it is higher CO2 reservoir content than our other project. Of all of our LNG portfolio, Browse would be the project most adversely affected in an unfavorable emissions trading scheme program.The one that lacked fiscal certainty, if we don't get that then also that really impacts the ability of this project to move forward.</p>
          <p>As I said, Browse is big and is costly and we owned about 50% of it. If the current discussion paper does not incorrect, we'll need to consider dramatically reducing the spending that we've been going &#x2013; that we have going on this in 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>On slide 36, this is a reprint with revisions and changes, on a slide that you saw in November Investor briefing of last year. We said then we'd rest all three opportunities Pluto Train 2, Sunrise and Browse until it became clear which one would be the next tab off the ring. We said then and we're saying now we cannot execute these three mega projects at the same time, too much cost requires too many resources.</p>
          <p>Each development has their own strengths and each has their challenges. As currently proposed, the emissions trading scheme would have a largest impact on Browse LNG development. This enacted as proposed remained physically uncertain. There really could be some serious implications for our Browse budget starting next year. So Pluto Train 2 and Sunrise can move ahead of Browse in that scenario.</p>
          <p>However, these two are sensitive to an ill-conceived ETS system that fails to recognize the global benefit of LNG and the competition we face in countries. We've no plans to implement similar regime for our schemes any time soon. We operate in a challenging environment and the great deal of technical and commercial uncertainty, which push pressure on our cost and schedules. We use to doing with that uncertainty but it's never easy and now if you're adding this government uncertainty that's even more for us to handle. We're working with government and other stakeholders, so we can get right and continuing investing and grow Woodside, which in turned helps Australian economy and provides jobs to citizens of this country.</p>
          <p>Finally on page 37 here, in the meantime, we're taking a look at the returns to our shareholder. We're focused on ensuring that we have a great base business and we optimize our old developments. Our commodity prices are high, so that we can deliver long-term growth through LNG. It's tough &#x2013; it's really a pretty tough operating environment at this moment, but as you can see we're staying focused and outperformed most of our peers and even pleasingly all the measures.</p>
          <p>I'd like to just say that the recurring thing that the company is really well &#x2013; running well internally. I just want to mention that I believe that the Woodside team is producing really good results. This time our employees are executing getting dollars to the bottom line. We are operating our existing assets I think almost perfection. We're spending necessary money on technical integrity and maintenance, employee welfare and training and we're controlling and eliminating other unnecessary costs.</p>
          <p>We're streamlining our process and becoming much more efficient and more importantly we're managing our mega projects on-time and on-budget. Surrounding one's self with great people is a trick. I have a great leadership team and I think they are really clicking. Further development, building bench strength of people activities we're on to, and the results are gratifying. I'll just finish by saying Woodisde is getting very near the point that I've always dreamed it could be. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys and well done on the results. A couple of questions if I could? Firstly, on Pluto Train 2, you mentioned that you are in discussions with other resource owners. Could you give us an idea &#x2013; because you mentioned the impact of an ETS &#x2013; what sort of CO2 content these other gas resources owners have and are they impediments to going forward with using third party?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the best fields that we have for CO2 content of course are the North West Shelf fields, Pluto is almost as clean just a little bit more CO2. The fields that we're looking at are just around Pluto and they have a composition that looks very much on the CO2 side as Pluto.</p>
          <p>As to that the ETS it impacts all of the projects according to the Green Paper of course which is just a discussion paper at this time. So, it's not like any of these projects won't be impacted, but Pluto and associated gas in the area are probably the best in the respect of being impacted by the ETS system.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Don. A question on &#x2013; I heard you mention that Agu is there. I just wanted to ask some questions on the exploration program in the Santos Basin in Brazil. How nearby is that to some of the big discoveries we've heard about earlier this year? And could you give us some guidance on sort of targets? You mentioned gas, but could you give us some guidance on some of those targets please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're quite some distance from the 2D type discoveries. We're about 100 to 200 kilometers further in shore. And we do not have exposure to that sub salt play at Tupi It's a completely different play. The sorts of things we're going for are in the &#x2013; in the 1 tcf range and that would mostly be a domestic gas objective.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mark Greenwood, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good day. I got a question about the Browse project, just a couple of weeks ago the Gorgon project team gave an update saying that this project was &#x2013; or that the time is now somoving towards FID they had JV alignment and no mention of an environmental &#x2013; or an emissions trading scheme. When I look at the two projects they look kind of similar and that they both have a reasonable amount of CO2. They are both very large projects; very large capital budgets. Is there anything else unique about the Browse project that would make the Browse project more affected by this type of scheme compared to something like Gorgon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no the projects are very similar in CO2 content. In fact, Browse is as I understand has less CO2 content in it than Gorgon. I can't speak for Gorgon but I will just alert you to the fact watch for September 16 because Chevron and Woodside will be talking about the ETS in respect to the LNG industry along with some other industry players.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we will wait for that. And just to follow on if the Sunrise or Pluto 2 projects were to proceed faster than the Browse project, I was wondering whether you could deliver gas from those projects into your PetroChina or CPC agreements that you signed late 2007, early 2008 or whether those agreements were specifics to the Browse project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Mark, it's Mark Chatterji. Now, both of those agreements it's possible that as other projects move ahead in the pecking order, as Don was referring to, those contracts may move with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and just one more question if I could on the LNG market. Previously Woodside has spoken about I guess a window of tight supply demand and then it became a corridor with no Indian site to the tight market conditions. I am wondering whether that's changed. We have more and more LNG projects proposed competing for market in Asia and at the same time the U.S. is becoming more self-sufficient, less-reliant on LNG import. So, I wonder if you could just give us your outlook for the LNG market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, certainly from a macro perspective, we haven't seen any fundamental shift to the supply-demand balance. As you rightly point out there are a lot of projects that are proposed, but when you look at the actual progress of any of these projects very few are moving forward with any speed.</p>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind is, I think, we've talked about before, we have kind of &#x2013; obviously the same access to the macro projections that you guys have. We also though have kind of marketing intelligence that comes from direct conversations with customers and so we have an understanding kind of what people indicate kind of years into the future effectively through those marketing conversations and we really haven't seen a change in tenor from what we previously described.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Great operating performance over the half and the second half looks excellent as well. Just a quick question to Mark on capital expenditure, and specifically, the North West Shelf, it looks like there's been a significant increase compared to prior guidance there and I know you broke it down between Train 5, Angel, NR2 and the Shell assets, I just would like to know what's kind of driven that change? It looks like it's up 304 million?</p>

In this price environment certainly looks very doable and we've had good reception from operator.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Just a comment, on the recent director's report with respect to Browse and some of the further activity there which I see as regarding some results about reducing volumetric uncertainty. I presume that's a reserve issue, I am just wondering, if you can give us some more commentary on that. I would have thought you would object to <mark type="inaudible" /> LNG planning <mark type="inaudible" /> 20 tcf and I am just wondering what the program is there and what issues are if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are continuing to appraise. We've just drilled a really good well at [Talience 3] . We've got some other wells that we &#x2013; we drilled one other well. We've got three or four more wells we really want to drill. We had a very wide range of what Browse could be between the P10 and P90 when we started the appraisal program a couple of years ago. Let me just say and suffice it this time that if we had an extremely large change that was material of course we would come out and advise, but we normally just advise on our February end of the year reserves. You will see an update. We are drilling some pretty critical wells this year and the best I can give you is, is that we continue to see Browse as a viable economic project and basically one that's material to our company and we will advise reserves or movement of contingent resources later on when we put our annual reserve survey up.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Don, it's Angela. I just saw you were looking at closing LNG I guess as a back of the Browse. I am just interested to know how that would work up there I guess given the size of the fields. And also just your general sort of comments I guess about closing LNG and the contribution it might make as opposed to LNG developments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, basically we've put it in kind of the hold category at Browse and the reason is we're looking hard at what we think are the most viable. And the reasons &#x2013; one of the reasons the most viable is, is that to do FLNG on Browse is not just one FLNG vessel. It's three or four vessels unless we stage them. And the issue there is that how much risk do we want to put our company into in that &#x2013; until an FLNG facility of what you might call material size for us which is 3 million tons and above &#x2013; until they get into operation and kind of produce over a year to see how the technology works out. So I guess before we put too many eggs in our basket, we're very, very willing because of the technology advancement for Sunrise to take a look there with our interest there. But before we go in head over heels, we would want to see the technology proving out through operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one more on Train 5. You're quite bullish about the start up there. Can you give any forecast about how that might ramp-up I suppose and maybe how many extra cargoes we might see as a result of that in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say it this way. We've said in our text here that we're expecting LNG cargoes out in October. We'll certainly be making liquids before that. We take a very conservative look at how we ramp these facilities up and we do have a several-month ramp-up in our planning process how we count cargoes. But those things pretty much run or they don't run. And we expect to have to shut the Train down several times after start up to fix things or to take a look at this, that and the other thing. So I believe we've got a  number of something like 70% ramp-up for a couple of months and then at that point we pretty much assume we're in full go from that point forward.</p>
          <p>But I am not going to sit here and tell you how many cargoes. The cargoes &#x2013; it's a very sophisticated system and we have those cargoes clearly targeted towards market. We have contracted on long-term basis for most of them. I will just say it's a managed situation at this point and everything is going along quite well. In fact, in my mind, better than what I expected.</p>
          <p>I was up there on Friday. I just mentioned I walked through the plant and I told the Board of Directors yesterday, you can eat breakfast off the floor of the place. It's a real shiny new facility and we have gas been going through it. We've tested all the turbines, everything's runable. We're going to be going very shortly into rundown.</p>
          <p>So the folks at the plant are extremely excited about it. They think it's going to be a really, really good piece of equipment. I might just say that we've put the heavier duty linkages in the refrigerant compressors than what we've had in Train 4. So, we're hoping for a several year run. Obviously in Train 5 it's a brand new train. We will take it down after 12 months, take a look inside it and see what's going on but hopefully after that we won't have to take it down as we have had to with Train 4 and we'll have good runs for four to five years as we normally have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I squeeze one more and then ask for an update in the Californian LNG plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, California where the time clock is out at this point, we are doing another study for them. I'll just say that we are evaluating it carefully. Costs are going up. I will just say this that as the requirements of the Californians go up that makes this too costly to do. They are basically cutting off their own opportunities out there. So we're communicating with them, talking to them. Their concept is viable. At this point we think it's a good project. We might as we've said take on a partner somewhere along the way, but it's &#x2013; until we get a permit we won't even think about the ability to build it. We're just trying to get a permit at this time.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Di Brookman, Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. In regards to the $350 million preparation I was wondering if you could give us a rundown on where that's going to be spent.</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be in the vicinity of Pluto, if you can talk about the number of wells you might be planning for the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it'd be &#x2013; this year is a relatively low split for drilling simply because we've got back huge or we've had a huge volume of 3D acquisition to do. So if you look to the split for this year, it's roughly 20-25% to drilling, about 35% to seismic, 15% to TPA and lease and other expenses, given that we had a very successful central lease <mark type="inaudible" /> this year around 25 to 30% total for the year. The drilling split is less than we would like. We generally like to spend at least 50% of the money on drilling, but this is just a peculiar year for us in terms of seismic acquisitions, seismic reprocessing.</p>
          <p>With respect to the number of Pluto dedicated wells before the end of the year, we could sneak one, possibly two in. But we are waiting on seismic processing and seismic reprocessing to come in before we commit to that. So I can't promise anything. But obviously it's a &#x2013; it's an important topic for Woodside. If we can do it we will, otherwise we'd be looking at someway between six and eight Pluto dedicated exploration wells in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And in regards to the LNG ramp-up, since you are starting a couple of months early &#x2013; and I think the previous speaker was actually alluding to it &#x2013; there seems like there might be potential for spot cargoes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The previous speaker was me. This is Don. Di, I would just say that if there are any spot cargoes, there's probably not a better time to have spot cargoes. We think this year's northern hemisphere LNG winter season is going to be the biggest supply-demand gap that we've seen up to this point. We think it's going to be a pretty hard year to find LNG cargoes so everybody is going to want to have them. So, we are really into the slot of it now, of the &#x2013; of the trying to find cargoes for the demand at this point. So, it won't be any problems getting rid of the cargoes. That's for darn sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />, The West Australian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I just wanted to ask you a bit about the North West Shelf condensate tax issues. You suggested that <mark type="inaudible" /> to be passed on to customers. I just wanted to know; firstly, what you think it will mean in terms of WA domestic gas prices and what kind of increases you might expect to see. And secondly I think it was Don back in May &#x2013; made the comment suggesting you'd look at all options with tax <mark type="inaudible" />. Just wondering if you can say anymore about what those options might be, particularly if <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We don't want to be not cooperative. We really wanted to sit down with the government before they do something like this. We really hate the position we are in right now. It's just not a good place to be. But we've got to manage it and we have to manage it as business people. We've put a $25 billion investment in there; we have to make some money for our investors on it on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>So, let me just say how it comes down. We've had this condensate arrangement, which we thought was good for the life of the project. Those terms have changed. We all the way along have kind of looked at that condensate issue as some justification for what we've always sold in to the WA industrial and residential marketplace as pretty low prices and we felt good about that. The issue now comes up as we renew our contracts and we reopen them that with the change in fiscal terms, we have to recover that cost that's imposed on us and basically we believe we can. Our gas price that goes into the Dampier Bunbury Pipeline is a very low cost compared to what people pay for residential use here in Perth. In other words we may pay $2 or $3 or get $2 or $3 for our gas from basically through our wells, up through our platforms, through the pipelines, up through the <mark type="inaudible" /> domestic gas plant, it really doesn't make us much money to be quite honest with you, over the last few years or several years. The fact is, is that it's a multiple of that to the residential users down here in Perth because of all the other people that have their hands on that gas supply.</p>
          <p>So we've raised our gas supply to more what you might call normal world pricing, what other people pay in other cities around the world. I don't know how that will be impacted on the final in price done here in Perth because the pipeline folks, the utility folks, the power plant folks, the residential gas grid, it's how they take that price to move it on to their customer. So, I am not sure what the final price impact will be, all I am saying is, is that we are going to have a very &#x2013; we just can't go into a loss mode on that business up at the plant where we put it into the pipeline and we've had our cost there very low for a very long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any sense as far as of how much your <mark type="inaudible" /> that sort of $2 to $3 figure that you guys don't get. Do you have any sense of how that would be impacted that part of the price that domestic users <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I am not sure at all, because it's basically negotiations to be dealt with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what about on the other matters where there are &#x2013; I guess, you're looking at potential option Woodside might have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there are any other options at this point. I think the senate is going to take it up. That's pretty well for us. We could potentially do legal routes and all that, that's not Woodside. We got other things to do. We're going to basically go out there and look for a fair price for our gas in re-openers and that &#x2013; and basically we're just going to leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, if I can just slip, one more question in, just wanted to see, what your response to the Federal Government, <mark type="inaudible" /> Mike made comments back in May relating to your <mark type="inaudible" /> on higher gas prices and he suggested that he was thinking about passing them on to the state just wondering if you have any thoughts or any comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I don't have any comments on that. I was a bit surprised because I don't understand how it all works, but I don't think there is anything there.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Garvey, Australian Financial Review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, just following on from Kate's question there. I mean between this condensate tax and emission trading scheme coming in and the environmental issues <mark type="inaudible" /> Browse and the Kimberley and so on, how has your view on Australia as a place to do business changed over the last 12 months or so Don?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm an eternal optimist; I guess I have to be if I'm in this business. But I am not going to say the government's anti-business or anti-economic, fiscal policy etcetera, but I'm not sure any other government that I can think of around the world except for maybe &#x2013; well I can think of one other government, but what they call a $2.6 billion tax hit on a project without any notification etcetera, I just think that I expect that we're all kind of in a learning mode and I just hope that in the future they talk to us a little bit more before we do this.</p>
          <p>We don't want to be difficult. We think Woodside is a great company in the respect that we've done a lot for the economy. Let me just tell you, we &#x2013; nobody &#x2013; you can take the top 20 ASX companies. There is nobody that invests as much money in Australia as Woodside. We've got $23 billion of the projects that have been ongoing. And you can take the Rios, you can take the BHPs, any of the banks you can take anybody else and I challenge anybody to find anybody who's putting more money back into Australia than Woodside. We pay our people very well. We provide thousands of contractor jobs and construction jobs. We provide 60 to 70% of the gas in Western Australia. We are not a bad company. We are a good company. And I think the government is ought to appreciate us and appreciate us a little bit more than what we are seeing right now in this respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you mentioned that you may begin coming back on your planned expenditure for Browse from next year if there is not more clarity over the ETS. What sort of sums were you originally expecting to <mark type="inaudible" /> next year and what could they hold to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think, as Don said &#x2013; it's Mark Chatterji &#x2013; I think, as Don said, it's early days right now. The budgets are being formulated in terms of what they might be realistically as we speak. What Don was indicating is without some fundamental rework of the emissions trading scheme, it's very difficult for Woodside to justify substantial expenditures in Browse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And eventually you're looking at other options for your &#x2013; the remaining African assets, what sort of things, are you considering there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we announced to the market in 2007, when we looked forward, we believe that, LNG will occupy the company substantially for the next several years and that we wanted to start to focus on that LNG portfolio. We have actually exited certain assets in Africa already and we continue to review our options on the remaining that we have left.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from John Hirjee, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Hi. I got another question, this time for Mark. Mark, in terms of the oil hedges outstanding, can you confirm whether they are still applicable to Vincent's revenues or are they now a broader mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John just to be clear, I mean, they are not dedicated to one asset, they are really kind of oil hedging program that that applies to the Greater Enfield overall. And so when you kind of look at allocating the differential between the caps and than what we actually get, you can allocate them to Vincent, if you want, you can allocate them across the Greater Enfield area as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thanks. And Don a note in your financial report indicates that you've got an agreement with Shell with regard to Libya. Where are you at with Libya and does effectively the exploration program coming up in Libya is, sort of, signal &#x2013; if it's successful, move on; if not, get out. Is that fair to read?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, John could you say it one more time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's to do with the Libyan exploration program that's coming up, I think, in this second half. If it is successful how do you &#x2013; is that a trigger for you to stay there or is it you are on the last legs in Libya and looking to exit given you have an agreement with Shell for a write-up final offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I got you now. Look, the guidance we've given you is still good and that is, is that we're looking for the ultimate displacement of those assets. It depends &#x2013; we do have some more drilling to do over there, a few more commitment wells. We have a couple other things that we're looking at with the government. If it goes well, there could be, maybe a future there, otherwise we are looking to think up to and including the exit of Woodside from Libya. At this time it is undetermined and we stand with our previous guidance to market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one more question and then we'll &#x2013; sounds like maybe there is no more questions, but if there is one more.</p>
          <p>Okay. No more question. So thanks everybody for listening in and we'll try and bring through on the second half even better results than we've brought through in the first half. Thanks very much.</p>
