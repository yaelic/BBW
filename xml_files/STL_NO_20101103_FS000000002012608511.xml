          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Statoil's Third Quarter Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. My name is Hilde Nafstad, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations in Statoil.</p>
          <p>Before we start, let me say that there are no fire drills planned today, so in case the fire alarm goes off, you will need to exit through the emergency exits on each side of the room and continue on towards the same side.</p>
          <p>This morning at 7:30 Central European Time we announced our results for the third quarter of 2010. A press release regarding the results were sent through the wires and to Oslo Stock Exchange. The quarterly report and today's presentation can as usual be downloaded from our website statoil.com. There is a link directly to the presentation on the front page of statoil.com.</p>
          <p>I will ask you to kindly take special note of the information regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found on the last page of the presentation sets. Please note that the question can be posed by means of telephone; questions cannot be posed directly from the web. The dial-in numbers for posing questions can be found on the website. The operator of the conference call will explain the procedure for posing questions over the phone immediately before the Q&amp;A session starts.</p>
          <p>We have our CEO and President, Mr. Helge Lund, with us here today and he will give a brief introduction before Statoil's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eldar S&#xE6;tre, will take us through the second (sic) [third] quarter earnings presentation. Welcome Helge.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating at this conference. Let me make a few remarks before I leave the floor to Eldar to take you through the results in more detail.</p>
          <p>In Statoil, we have behind us an extraordinary quarter characterized by extensive but also planned maintenance activities, which have led to low oil and gas production as you see throughout the quarter. At the same time, we have strong cash generation. We have financial flexibility and the cost is under firm control in all business areas, and you have also seen that the HSE results are moving on a positive trend.</p>
          <p>Based on our financial flexibility and operational flexibility, we have also had a very active quarter in terms of strengthening and high-grading our portfolio. Our field development projects show good progress across the board. New field development decisions have been taken and we have been quite active in terms of high-grading the portfolio and the already listing of the SFR and the acquisition on joint venture at Eagle Ford are the most important step forward this quarter.</p>
          <p>New field developments will along with the ramp up of fields generate an additional 350,000 to 400,000 barrels per day in 2012 compared to what you see in 2010. However, this will lead to very limited expected production growth in 2011 due to the phasing of the start-up and ramp up of these fields.</p>
          <p>Earlier in the year, two well known factors have taken our production downwards in the guided range. Namely, the reduction of the production permit of Ormen Lange and the well incident and drilling challenges at Gullfaks. As you have seen from our announcement this morning, we have now decided to take our 2010 production guiding to 1.9 million barrels per day, and I can understand that some questions are raised regarding why we changed our guiding so late in the year.</p>
          <p>However, very recently two additional factors triggered the adjustment on the production guiding for 2010. After very, very careful considerations, the license groups for two of our big fields, Gullfaks South and Kvitebj&#xF8;rn very recently decided to perform IOR activities that will increase the short-term production, but increase the longer-term production and value creation.</p>
          <p>In addition, it has become clear that the operational problems that have been known for a while related to a faulty compressor at Kollsnes would have a longer duration and a higher impact than previously known. These factors combined with the usual uncertainty regarding gas offtake led us to conclude that the 2010 production forecast should be reduced to around 1.9 million barrels per day.</p>
          <p>And with those words, please Eldar, I leave it to you to take the audience through a more detailed explanation of the numbers. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Helge and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. As Helge said, this quarter has been characterized by an extensive and very well planned maintenance activities, which have led to a significant reduction in the quarterly volumes, both on the oil and gas side compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our cash generation and the financial robustness remained solid throughout the quarter. I'll come back to that. All business areas also demonstrated very good cost control, and the HSE results are strong and improving.</p>
          <p>This illustration compares our third quarter key earning figures compared with the same quarter last year, which you can see at the bottom. Net income is more than doubled from 6.6 billion in 2009 to NOK13.8 billion this quarter, while the net operating income of 22.2 billion is at approximately at the same level as we saw last year. The 1.6 billion of adjustments, net adjustments is composed of various elements, and the most significant one is reversals, according to the IFRS accounting standards of previous impairments and also cost provisions, also sale of assets and some positive impacts, net positive impacts from derivatives.</p>
          <p>These effects were partly to some extent countered by an impairment of the well-known Corrib gas field in Ireland. This brings the adjusted earnings down to NOK 26.7 billion, which is compared to 31.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The reported tax rate was 60.9%. After these adjustments that I talked about for the effects of tax on infrequent items and also net financial items, our effective tax rate on the adjusted earnings amounts to 68%, which is slightly below our guidance of around 70%. This reduction in the tax rate is mainly driven by a relatively higher income outside of the Norwegian Continental Shelf compared to income on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Adjusted earnings after tax were 8.5 billion versus 9.2 billion in the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>So let me now take a look at the cash flows. The cash generation from underlying operations, excluding variations in working capital, remains strong and amounts to NOK 132 billion so far this year. Taxes paid adds up to NOK 57 billion. Recorded gross investments was at 58.7 billion and net investments at NOK 54.1 billion. And we paid dividends in the second quarter of NOK 19 billion, which was related to 2009 and was in accordance with our dividend policy. Net debt-to-capital employed was 26% reported and 28% when we adjust for the tax payment, which is not synchronized to our earnings. And this is in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the production figures. Here you can see a broad categorization of the changes in this quarter's production volumes compared with the same quarter last year, to the left. And the reduction is around 17%, and we're talking about equity production and this is in line with our, with management's expectations.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we have performed extensive turnaround, planned turnaround activities on our liquids fields this quarter, with a total impact of more than 100,000 barrels per day and an increased impact of almost 60,000 barrels per day compared to last year.</p>
          <p>And typically, normally these turnaround activities during the summer season is much more evenly spread between the second and the third quarter than we have seen in this quarter with a massive portion of the seasonal maintenance. In addition, this quarter we have also performed extensive maintenance activities at our gas processing facilities. And that includes both K&#xE5;rst&#xF8;, Kollsnes and Vestprosess.</p>
          <p>There are major maintenance activities, shutdown turnarounds at K&#xE5;rst&#xF8; typically every sixth year, and the last one was in 2003. And this year, this maintenance activity, which too lasted for three weeks, was also combined with more comprehensive maintenance at the other processing facilities, for instance two weeks shutdown at Kollsnes. This has resulted in several of our main gas fields holding back production or performing planned maintenance in line with the scheduled downtime of the processing facilities. And the combined effect of this maintenance, from this gas-related maintenance is more than 90,000 barrels per day compared to the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>For commercial reasons, we do not guide in detail on the planned maintenance effects on our NCS gas fields, although we recognize that this might lead to some challenges when estimating the gas production from the outside. However, this effect is as planned and is included in our annual production guidance.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and as we've previously guided, we have a natural decline rate on the overall mature part of our portfolio of around 5% combining oil and gas fields. In this period, I could highlight a significant decline in the tail end of some of our Gulf of Mexico gas assets, like Q Gas, Spiderman and San Jacinto, of around a combined 15,000 barrels per day. And in fact, we do not expect any further production from the Q and the San Jacinto fields.</p>
          <p>The overall decline this quarter compared to last year is estimated to around 100,000 barrels per day. And this was only to a limited extent, offset by startup of new capacity of the Morvin field and ramp-up also on Tyrihans and Marcellus compared to last year.</p>
          <p>On top of the natural decline; we have had some negative impact related to drilling of wells on Gullfaks. This was partly caused by the incident that you know about at the Gullfaks the C06 well in May, which led to a shut-in of the whole platform for two months, and that extended into July. Gullfaks also experienced problems with the new build rig at Deepsea Atlantic resulting in a delayed drilling program, and we have just recently secured additional rig capacity for 2011. In addition, we have made a reallocation of NCS gas volumes of 20,000 barrels per day between the second and the third quarter, leading to a decrease in the third quarter reported volumes.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the expected higher level of the Ormen Lange production permit was not granted by the authorities, and therefore bringing the production in the third quarter down by approximately 30,000 barrels per day, partly also in order to repay the higher offtake that we have taken in the previous quarter of the gas year. The lower-than-expected production permit will also run through the 2010 gas year, which started October this year, and will thereby also impact next year's production.</p>
          <p>Then, I will briefly comment on the adjusted earnings per each of our business areas. We still show robust financial performance despite the lower production volumes this quarter. A continued strict cost control, as I talked about, also shows good results within all business areas as you can see from both our operating costs and our SG&amp;A cost developments.</p>
          <p>E&amp;P Norway's adjusted earnings were NOK 21.7 billion, which is down 14% from third quarter last year. And the main reason was the significant reduction in produced volumes. This effect was partially offset by 14% higher prices on both oil and gas. Exploration expenses and operating expenses were roughly at the same level as we saw in the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;P's adjusted earnings decreased by NOK 0.3 billion compared to last year. The entitlement production was around 36,000 barrels per day lower, while equity production was down around 5% or approximately 25,000 barrels per day. The main reason was decline, in particular a sharp reduction in production from the Independence Hub that I just mentioned, due to water breakthrough. In addition, we had slightly higher maintenance on the International assets and very limited contribution from ramp-up of new fields basically from the Marcellus gas production.</p>
          <p>Adjusted exploration expenses increased by 1.4 billion to a total of NOK 2.7 billion outside of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This increase is mainly due to lower capitalization and more being expensed, which has been capitalized in previous periods. Operating expenses are approximately at the same level, while SG&amp;A and depreciations are significantly down compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Natural Gas' adjusted results were NOK 2.1 billion compared to 3.3 billion last year. And the reduction was mainly caused by lower equity volumes from the Norwegian Continental Shelf, which directly affected both the results from our processing and transportation business by 0.3 billion and our marketing and trading contribution by almost NOK 1 billion, deriving both from lower scale due to the volumes and lower flexibility in the trading activities also from the lower volumes.</p>
          <p>Finally, Manufacturing and Marketing's adjusted third quarter earnings were 0.9 billion, which is up from almost zero last year and the improved results were reflected in actually all sub-segments mainly related to the improved results from our trading strategies, and higher fuel margins and volumes in our Fuel &amp; Retail business.</p>
          <p>Our Manufacturing business, mainly refineries, had slightly negative results also this quarter due to continued low refinery margins and turnaround at the Mongstad refinery.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we have also demonstrated very good progress, as mentioned by Helge, in terms of maturing and developing our portfolio for future production and value creation. As mentioned initially, Gj&#xF8;a is starting production any day now. Vega and Vega South are on track to start production during the fourth quarter. Our fast-track projects on the Norwegian Continental Shelf are also progressing as planned.</p>
          <p>And we are very pleased that steam injection now has started at the Leismer Demonstration plant in Canada, started in early September, and actually one month ahead of schedule. Peregrino in Brazil is also on track; with first oil expected towards the end of the first quarter next year. Several fields have been sanctioned this quarter. In Norway, the development plan has been submitted for Valemon, and the Marulk PDO has been approved by the Parliament.</p>
          <p>Internationally, both Jack and St. Malo in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the CLOV development in Block 17 in Angola have also been sanctioned for development. Continuous business development activities are also important to shape our portfolio as outlined in our strategy. And this quarter, we have strengthened and diversified our position in North America through the Eagle Ford acquisition of 67,000 net acres to Statoil. This transaction adds at least 550 million barrels to our already substantial North American resource base, and in strengthening our U.S. gas value chain and adding also liquids to the onshore portfolio in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our offshore heavy oil growth efforts is further enhanced by the acquisition of additional interest in the Statoil-operated Mariner field in the UK. And lastly, we are very pleased with the capital markets' reception of the new Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail company, following the listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange on the 22nd of October. And we are convinced that the listing will provide the company with the necessary framework for future growth and value creation going forward.</p>
          <p>Finally, some comments to our guidance. And my first message in this context is, as mentioned by Helge, that we have now concluded on a revised 2010 production guiding of 1.9 million barrels per day of equity production. This is down from the previous range of 1.925 to 1.975 as we have guided. And there are several contributing factors to this adjustment, and I'll go through them, and it represents &#x2013; the adjustment represents 2.5% adjustment compared to the mid-point of the previous range.</p>
          <p>Two main factors have been communicated earlier, as you have heard about. Firstly, the Ormen Lange license partnership had applied for an increased production permit for the gas years 2009 and 2010. This was not granted and results in lower production volumes for the year as a whole and for this quarter specifically. And secondly, the C06 well incident on Gullfaks has had a negative impact, combined with the lack of drilling rig capacity at Gullfaks. The initial rig was not able to drill the required wells and a new rig solution is now in place as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Recently, two additional factors have triggered the adjustment of the production guidance below the previous range. Firstly, after very careful considerations, the relevant license group we're talking about here have now decided that we temporarily have to reduce the production from parts of both the Gullfaks South and the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn fields. This is in order to maintain the necessary reservoir pressure conditions, so that we can drill new wells into and through these reservoirs in a secure manner, and thereby securing additional IOR volumes and additional values. The short-term effect of these IOR measures is that we will delay around 15 000 barrels a day of production for this year and it will also have some impact for 2011.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the Kollsnes processing plant experienced some operational problems related to the NGL processing following the turnaround in September. And it has now been concluded to &#x2013; that we have to repair a faulty NGL booster compressor and the driver, the engine, and consequently, the throughput will be negatively affected by this &#x2013; in this quarter, and the problems are not expected to be solved during the fourth quarter, although we will try to compensate for the issues as much as possible in the way we operate Kollsnes.</p>
          <p>These are the factors, which combined with the general uncertainty in relation to gas demand, that has led us to reduce our 2010 production guidance to around 1.9 million barrels per day. And none of these factors that I just talked about, triggering the down of or the adjustment had any impact on our third quarter production.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing project developments are making good progress. We expect to deliver additional full year &#x2013; this is full year average volumes, of 350,000 to 400,000 barrels per day in 2012 from this portfolio that you can see to the right on this picture, compared to full year 2010 from the same portfolio.</p>
          <p>The new capacity and ramp-ups will, however, be skewed towards 2012, leaving us with very limited production growth next year. We have also made a minor adjustment to our unit production cost guidance for 2010 to reflect the reduced production. And the other guidance that you can see remains as we have previously communicated. And we will come back to further guidance at our fourth quarter and strategy update event in &#x2013; on February the 9th 2011.</p>
          <p>So, with these words, I am ready &#x2013; and we are ready to take your questions, and I'll leave the word back to Hilde.</p>

For this session in addition to Mr. Helge Lund and Mr. Eldar S&#xE6;tre, we're also joined by our Head of Corporate Accounting, Mr. K&#xE5;re Thomsen. In order to pose questions, you'll have to dial in to the phone conference unless you're in the audience. The dial-in numbers are available on our website and I'll now ask the operator to explain the procedure for posing questions. After that, we'll take a few questions from the audience before we start taking questions over the phone. But please, operator, if you can explain the procedure for dialing in questions?</p>

          <p>Trond Omdal, Arctic Securities. First question related to the downgrade, latest three weeks ago of course, you announced on your website and the IR confirmed your guiding, what's the decision? You must have known about the decision related to Kvitebj&#xF8;rn and Gullfaks, so that one of the outcomes could be lower production. So, could you elaborate a little bit about that decision? The other thing, you say now very limited production growth next year. But you've had very low gas production this year, lot of maintenance, so and the Troll has been very low, so does that even include the potential of increasing gas production if the market allows it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the first one and maybe Eldar you can comment on the latter. As Eldar and I explained, our best assessment at that time early October was that we would be within the range despite the challenges with Gullfaks and also the production permit on Ormen Lange. And the decisions on Kvitebj&#xF8;rn and Gullfaks have been taken very recently and also matured, not matured before now. On top of that, we had the issue on the compressor on Kollsnes, that is not a new issue in itself, but the assessment was that we would be able to solve it earlier, which has now turned out not to be the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the gas question first. Obviously, we had a significant maintenance activity this quarter, 90,000 barrels per day as I talked about, most of that is on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and that adds up to on an annual basis slightly lower, definitely lower than that, but it's still maintenance activities, that might be lower next year. So when we talk about gas and talk about the sort of limited growth going into next year, we &#x2013; that kind of statement is taking into account &#x2013; consideration all elements of the gas equation to put it that way, both the flexibility that we have and sort of, in terms of moving volumes forward, from a value creation perspective, and also the fact that the production permit on Ormen Lange has not been granted or extended for gas year 2010, which goes into parts of 2011, which is relevant actually for this and also the maintenance, the plant maintenance of the gas side for next year. So it's all taken into consideration when we talk about limited growth for next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even allowing for your best assessment of increased gas production next year, you still see limited growth?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when we say something like that, we take into account all the effects that we know now. Obviously, this is something we will work on. We are in the middle of a planning process now and we'll feed in all the information and all our plans for the future, but the best estimate now is that there will be limited growth for next year to also taking into account all the components of the gas side, maintenance, production permits and also the gas flexibility as I talked about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Anne Gj&#xF8;en, Handelsbanken Capital Markets. When it comes to tax, you previously guided around 70% tax; your actual one on adjusted numbers is 6 to 8. But with your assumption of not much increase in production next year, is it then likely that we will have tax rate approximately at the same level that we have seen now 6% to 8%? Second question when it comes to cost, unit costs development is somewhat higher, is that mainly because you had relatively low production on Troll because it's rather low unit cost there? And the final question, I would say that it must me more and more difficult with its production guidance because of the natural gas market. And have you ever just discussed to go away from the production guidance target to guide on for example production capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the last two, Eldar, and then perhaps you take, address the first. In terms of &#x2013; you're right in the sense that it's more difficult to guide you due to the liberalization of the gas market and to optimize that in a way that was the reason why we moved from one point figure to a range. And I think that has explained itself subsequently that that was the right thing to do. How we would do this moving forward, we just have to assess continuously and we need to find a way of communicating this that gives the best overview for our investors in understanding our business. The slight increase in unit cost that we are now indicating for 2010 has nothing to do with the absolute cost level, but it's a volume-driven thing given the fact that we take down the production volume. So it's actually with the &#x2013; it's just a fraction of that, not an issue with costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tax rate, I think the tax rate for this quarter is particularly low because this quarter is special, most of this maintenance is on the Norwegian Continental Shelf part of the equation. So that gives us a relatively lower because of the sort of uplift and so on, on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. So it's more special this quarter. I think the guidance that we have given of 70 slight &#x2013; maybe 70%, 71% is still a very valid guidance for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just one quick question. I think just specifically give us a quick guide on when you expect your issues with the Ormen Lange constraints to start coming off unless you can start to see production growing more entitled with what you were expecting there. And the second question I have is, how management is thinking more about portfolio optimization at this stage. It seems like issues keep popping up in your mature asset base in Norway, and for one reason or another. How are you thinking at the moment about selling off assets and reducing your exposure to Norway? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of portfolio high-grading, I think we have shown over the last few years both on the divestiture side and on the acquisition side that this is an issue that we work with constantly to try to optimize the portfolio, balancing several sort of aspects. I cannot comment on individual plants or processes related to specific assets, and I don't want to discuss that either on a geographic basis. We are running portfolio reviews every year very rigorously and based on several considerations, including the one you mentioned, we decide what to do with our portfolio and you should expect us to continue to do that.</p>
          <p>In terms of production permits, it's the Norwegian authority that decide those authorities. We have no reason to believe that they will change their sort of historical way of dealing with this. Our assessment moving into this year was based on our best assessment on the production permit for Ormen Lange, our own assessment, not the operator, but this time we did &#x2013; we were not able to predict it in the right way. When it comes to more specific questions related to why the Norwegian authorities did it and whether they would like to change their policy, you have to address it with the Ministry. But as we see it now, we have no reason to conclude that they will change their practices.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, it's always better to have full predictability and this is as you have seen an important, one of the important considerations that we have to make, but you should assume management to be able to make good estimate of this when they come forward with new guiding.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions please. The first which is kind of an extension of that last one there. In your 2012 unchanged production guidance, what are you assuming about an increase in European gas sales over 2011? And obviously, Ormen Lange may or may not play a part in that. And if there is an assumption that gas demand is going to &#x2013; you may be selling more gas into Europe in 2012 over '11, could you just give us a feel for what kind of scale of increase that is? And then secondly, just speaking on the Independence Hub, is that decline and water entry pretty much as expected or was it earlier than expected and I surprised it might necessitate a revision of the remaining reserves there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Independence Hub, it's a &#x2013; we knew it was getting towards the end. But I think the time it took to get to the end was slightly shorter than we expected. So I think that's the best answer to it. We knew it has never been sort of a big part of our 2012 target or anything like that, but you know it came slightly, the water breakthrough came slightly earlier than we had expected and the search was a disappointment.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the 2012, I think this is a &#x2013; this is &#x2013; there are so many factors that goes into the adjustment two years ahead and the lot of assumptions that we have to make and basically what we typically do is to allocate certain risks to the various components and take a portfolio view and that's what we've done on the Ormen Lange, it might not come, it might come. On the gas volumes, what is the most likely, it's very difficult to say what is &#x2013; how sort of the gas flexibility is going to look, how the gas market, how the forward curve is going to look when you get into 2012 and forward. So, it's pretty much reflecting a risk base and neutral view on sort of the capacity that we believe we'll be able to produce and that the market will be able to take it. But in terms of other kind of operations and market operations, that is basically not reflected, it's more reflected in the range that we have used to illustrate 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry, could I just &#x2013; could I just have an add-on? Could I take &#x2013; the bottom end of the range doesn't reflect any assumption of increased gas sales into Europe because I mean, I know there are lots of moving parts here, but the one part I presume isn't moving is what <mark type="inaudible" /> gas increase you got in the bottom of your range number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's reflecting the sort of this underlying portfolio, the gas producing assets that we have in our portfolio and their capacity to deliver gas, and no specific sort of assumptions on gas markets and how they look and gas flexibility as such.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from John Olaisen from Carnegie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Couple of questions if I may, first on the production issues with Gullfaks and Kvitebj&#xF8;rn, you say that the pressure in the reservoir as such has come down. Could you tell us a little bit more about that, is that due to the field coming into more mature, field coming to more mature phase, was this a surprise for you or what's going on with the reservoir <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a surprise; this has been an issue with the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn reservoir for some time. So we have had this issue before, we had to shut down production in order to drill additional wells. Basically, one, it's more a question of when these conditions occur and when the pressure development comes to a level where it becomes too low and we simply cannot drill to the reservoir. You need a certain pressure in these type of reservoirs in order to drill into reservoir where there is already holes producing in it. And there is interconnectivity between the sort of the producing wells and the new wells. You will simply, you take out the pressure from the reservoir. So when you drill into those reservoirs, the drilling fluids will simply disappear and it's a safety risk, you can't do that. So you need a certain reservoir pressure in order to be able to drill in a safe manner, and if you don't have those conditions, you cannot drill at all, you cannot spud it. So basically this is a judgment as to when do these conditions occur and this has been the difficult consideration in this context. We had seen that this situation by combat we have seen it more later, coming later and now this is something we saw through the pressure observations that this is something we have to do now, and we couldn't risk losing the opportunity and the option to drill those wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. It's just that it's from two pretty mature fields and it's all coming at the same time I guess, it is a surprise to you after all, is that correct to assume or was it a surprise that pressures are low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is fine-tuning. Now, we have got &#x2013; this is not a surprise. We observed the pressure in our &#x2013; every day and so it's not a surprise that pressures are &#x2013; although this has to do with the specific sort of reservoirs and when you have these specific conditions that you either drill <mark type="inaudible" /> producing reservoir or you drill in another part of a producing reservoir. And once you do that, then there is connectivity and that doesn't occur in all instances. But in these two reservoirs, we have and they are complex, we have that situation. So then it's the question of really when does this happen, and it could happen &#x2013; we could take the risk actually and delay this for three months. We could take that risk and be happy about this year and it still could work out fine. But that's sort of fine-tuning of &#x2013; considering the risk has led us to say, we have to do this, this is the safe way, so we do it now and make sure that there is no risk we don't lose these wells. This is not a big surprise, but sort of that &#x2013; this consideration led to this conclusion now that was not expected. So it's more small adjustments to the reservoir developments than sort of big surprises into a reservoir behavior.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the last one, it's the average for the full year, so the capacity will be much bigger at the end of the year from these fields. It's the average production from every month they produce during 2012 compared to every month in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good. Do you have an estimate for what the aggregate plateau production will be from those new fields on a comparable basis, the 350 to 400?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, obviously we have, but you know that's &#x2013; prepare that kind of information now, so I think our focus was now to create confidence on the, more on the 2012, but obviously these assets are well known, so I'm sure sort of the technical capacity and description of these platforms that's something <mark type="inaudible" /> is not a secret.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, the first, I think around about by this time last year you would have been having discussions with a lot of your European gas buyers regarding some changes with the contracts coming into this year. I just wondered if you're having any similar discussions at this point in time or is there anything we should expect coming out of the January capital markets update? And then secondly, just on the Marcellus, it looks like you're steadily increasing production there over the last three quarters, despite the U.S. price declining over that period. Are you happy just to keep drilling to reach your target there and those strategy to potentially slow that down or at least seek out more liquids rich wells in the Marcellus? Thank you,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first question, we held discussions with most of our major clients during this year and last year to try to solve the best interest of both parties the current situation in the gas market as it looked at that time. Most of these discussions, the good majority is concluded and dealt with as we have communicated and as you recall partly was to take away some of the volume obligations and it was partly to move some of the pricing from the long-term contracts formula to spot pricing. And we have also communicated that this is a situation that we expect would last to 2012 in terms of the agreements that we have made. And it goes &#x2013; that follows with that that we have not have the same extensive discussions as we had the last time last year. So when we come back through the capital markets update in February, you should expect us to have factored that into our communication about volumes moving forward.</p>
          <p>On Marcellus, the view we have taken so far is of course that we have relatively marginal volumes at this stage on the Marcellus. We partly and we have a carry structure. So we have been focused on building an industrial position and partly also it's driven by lease expiry, so that there is certain incentives to push forward with production. As the industry are solving some of these issues and some of the other carry structures, including our own, is sort of concluded. I would expect that it's more sort of market-based approach you would see in the industry altogether in the U.S. as we move forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. In 2010, you had the provisional problem <mark type="inaudible" /> Kollsnes. To recheck then this operational issue, increase the challenge for you to maintain stable your production in a way as it is your long-term ambition? And secondly, you have quantified the near-term production decrease related to the enhanced oil recovery that you are putting in place in Gullfaks and on Kvitebj&#xF8;rn, could you maybe help us quantify the upside related to those program? And last question, to which extent <mark type="inaudible" /> that are leading you to downgrade today your production guidance? Could you help us quantify the impact of those elements into your 2011 newly set guidance of a limited production growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on maybe you <mark type="inaudible" /> elaborate. If we talk &#x2013; speak a little bit about the operational issues in 2010 at the Norwegian Continental Shelf, I think those have been very specific unrelated items, very specifically the well incidence at Gullfaks. We had one rig that we planned to do production drilling at Gullfaks that didn't work and there has been a legal process related to that. And then you have had this very specific Kollsnes issue. So I think you cannot infer or conclude that this is a pattern that will continue.</p>
          <p>When we have talked about and continue to talk about the ambition of keeping the production level for the next 10 years at the current level, we have tried to factor in these factors. And as I see it now, we have the resources. So the question is more and that we have to assess over time whether we as an organization are able to put in place sufficient mechanisms to counter the facts, the fact that our installations are getting older, and we have done quite significant measures so far in terms of changing the offshore organization. We have moved all our drilling engineer into one drilling unit to standardize and industrialize the well delivery and the quality in that. And as you know, we have recently embarked on a very aggressive process to halve the time it take from your discovery resource base until it gets it into production, the so-called fast-track project. So I think, we're working diligently and very focused to counter these forces. And we have no information as of today that lead us to change our ambition of keeping the production at this level. But it will no doubt require very, very high effort from the organization.</p>
          <p>In terms of enhanced oil recovery and the Gullfaks and Kvitebj&#xF8;rn issue, these decisions are made in a way where we try to optimize the resource, so utilization and it's done on a net present value basis individually. And you should not expect that immediately that this will lead us to change our guiding for 2012 or 2011, rather at this stage you should conclude that this is included in our statements about the future. And then we will come back in much more detail on 2011 and the period beyond in February. I think there was one more question, but...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I could add on the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn and on the Gullfaks South, it's a question of three wells that needs to be drilled and basically these wells they are into our plans. It was a question of when we start sort of to get the reservoir conditions to do it, but it's included in the guidance, in the long-term guidance. And as such, to make sure that we were able to do it is <mark type="inaudible" /> measure as such, and the same is the case for the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn <mark type="inaudible" /> one well. It's been planned for a long time, it's in the schedule, but this was to make sure that we had a reservoir which was &#x2013; had the right conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may just come back to my third question about the quantification of recent element that led you to downgrade your 2010 guidance, to which extent can you help us as well as 2011 guiding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I captured the question, but I think none of these things has any <mark type="inaudible" /> comments on the 2011. We have seen for a long time that 2011 and the portfolio, our portfolio and the build up of the new assets that's going into 2012 would start to a large extent during 2011 and into 2012. We have very limited capacity in &#x2013; additional capacity in place this year. And in order to have a really boost next year, we would have had to have a lot of new capacity in place this year actually. So and basically this year we are talking about Gj&#xF8;a and Morvin in terms of new capacity, and only for a small part of the year. So this is just to say something which is, if you put all these together and combine with the Ormen Lange issue that we also talked about, which is sort of putting pressure on the 2011 numbers, that's what sort of led us to reiterate something we have seen for a long time, and we have all stated that there is no linear growth taking us to 2011 <mark type="inaudible" />. And &#x2013; so basically there is nothing new in this from our side, except for the Ormen Lange and the project portfolio is developing, it's simply the profile of these new asset and when they can sort of give us the annual average production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, good afternoon gentlemen. I had a couple of questions, the first one is again coming back to gas, you've cited a lot of factors that explain the lower gas production in Norway in the third quarter. But one you didn't really mention was the lower customer offtake under your long-term contract. So I was just wondering if you could give us any color on this. And secondly, I see you've recently submitted an application to drill on the Barents Sea, could you just talk about your plans there and what's the prospectivity of the area? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can take the latter; perhaps the new gas <mark type="inaudible" /> will talk to the latter subsequently. On the Barents Sea, historically we have drilled I guess the industry in altogether between 65 and 75 wells, I think altogether in the Barents Sea. So far it's only the Sn&#xF8;hvit project that is sort of producing from that well history, and there is one more project now under execution, the Goliath project where ENI is the operator and Statoil is a big partner. We are now into a new phase where we will over the next year or two drill additional wells in the Barents Sea. That will be in several areas of the Barents Sea. And we will test some new place among others in the western part of the Barents Sea where we will drill a well where we think it's a high impact well called Skirugard later or during next year.</p>
          <p>Then we had the application, the recent application, the 21st round, I think it was in Norway and where we &#x2013; where the focus is really on the Norwegian Sea and some acreage that has not been picked up earlier in the Barents Sea, that is also is now positioned in this round. So I think, if I think about the strategy in this, we still have an incentive to drill around the Sn&#xF8;hvit and Goliath field to find additional resources.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we're testing some new place, particularly on the western side of the Barents Sea. And then of course in a longer-term horizon, the recent agreement that is subject to ratification in the Norwegian Parliament and the Duma in Russia of the disputed zone might create new opportunities for the oil and gas companies longer term. But this is a bit more longer-term issue as we first have to have the agreement ratified and subsequently we have to sort of been given access to that area and do seismic and exploration.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I think so far the Barents Sea on the Norwegian side has been &#x2013; I think we have not been able to identify the key to the Barents Sea yet, and maybe on the more disappointing side compared to what you saw 10 years ago. But we still have very specific plans <mark type="inaudible" /> within the next two to three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the gas offtake, it's &#x2013; I didn't mention it. When you look at the gas year, 2009 gas year, which ended this quarter actually, I think the overall gas offtake is pretty much what we have seen over the last year. No &#x2013; no surprises in either direction. It's true that the offtake in the third quarter, the last quarter of the gas year might have been slightly lower, not significantly lower, but slightly lower than typically. This has, however, not been the limiting factor of our production this quarter because of the extensive maintenance the production capacity and the processing capacity in Norway has been the limiting factor. So the extent &#x2013; to the extent there's been lower offtake, that has simply led to lower sourcing in the &#x2013; of gas in the market, third party gas.</p>

          <p>Trond Omdal, Arctic Securities. Question on the portfolio management, you have made significant divestments and strengthened your balance sheet considerably this year. While we see other of your players maybe with the exception of BP moving more into M&amp;A and looking at your reserve placement growth. So given that you now have a very uninspiring production this year and also next, could you explain your thinking, why you didn't prioritize acquiring more near-term production versus longer term? And also why &#x2013; is it the macro outlook that's made you strengthen your balance sheet compared to increasing production through acquisitions?</p>

          <p>First of all, I would like to say that I take &#x2013; and we take a probably quite pragmatic view as to how we develop the portfolio, I mean, exploration, business development and the merger and acquisition. And I think we still will do that. Secondly, I think we have been &#x2013; the last five to six years we've been pretty active in terms of building our portfolio also through acquisitions and partnerships. But on the divestment side or the &#x2013; that side we have done basically through two main sorts of efforts. The first one has to do with the Peregrino asset where we had a 100% position. We like the asset, it's a beautiful asset, we like it, we have I think together created value on that asset. But we would &#x2013; this is part of our risk management strategy all together when we look at our portfolio. And then we have the SFR sort of deal done a few weeks back. This was driven by industrial logic really that we felt that this company and Statoil could perform better as separate companies, and also that we felt that the market was not willing to put a value on that part of the business, and I think we have visualized that in a better way, the way it's structured now.</p>
          <p>In terms of how have the market been for acquisitions or assets recently, and I think our observation is that despite the financials crisis, there has not been &#x2013; we've not seen a significant impact on the asset prices over the last few years. In terms of just buying production, we have not had &#x2013; had that as a part of our strategy. We would like to move into areas that has a strategic perspective and where we believe that we can with our competence add value much more than buying a short-term income stream.</p>

          <p>Just one final question on Hadron, of course that was written down on the Q2, but there some of the comments on the NPD have been somewhat critical and also but overall that Statoil is not doing enough to do IOR on the Continental Shelf. Maybe somehow &#x2013; do you see &#x2013; is there anything in the Hadron story that could have been done better by Statoil or &#x2013; and also do you think &#x2013; well, I know the answer to that, but do you think you're doing enough to maximize the recovery on your assets in Norway?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think the history on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is actually an history of enormous focus on resource management, and I think Statoil has been a very important player in that. I think given how we see the oil and gas industry developing, I think we have all the incentives in the world to do profitable projects within this area, and we're constantly working on this by applying new technology, developing new technology and most recently we had a fill over in the corporate management team last Monday to be given an update on this. And then there will be other players that are critical to what we are doing, I think that is fair. Since we have such a big position at the Norwegian Continental Shelf and they're pushing us and they should. I'm not saying that we're doing everything as it should be done optimally, but I can only assure you that we have an extremely intense focus on IOR. I won't comment at this stage specifically on individual assets, but that is our thinking.</p>
