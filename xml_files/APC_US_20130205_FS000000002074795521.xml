        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Steve, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Q4 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And I'll turn the conference over to John Colglazier. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. So glad you could join us today for Anadarko's fourth quarter and full year 2012 conference call.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures, So we encourage you to read the full disclosure and GAAP reconciliations located on our website and attached to last night's earnings release. Also on our website, we provide a comprehensive summary of the company's operations activities in our operations report.</p>
          <p>In a moment, we'll turn the call over to Al Walker, who will discuss the company's 2012 results. And Al is joined by other members of our executive team, who will be available to answer the questions later in the call. Al?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning.</p>
          <p>2012 for Anadarko was, in a word, outstanding. First, we delivered record sales volumes of 268 million BOE, well above the high end of our initial guidance. Second, we replaced 162% of our reserves at a cost of less than $15 per BOE before the impact of price revisions.</p>
          <p>Third, we achieved a 67% success rate from our deepwater exploration and appraisal program. Fourth, we monetized more than $1 billion of assets and established a market value of more than $6.5 billion for Anadarko's remaining 91% interest in WGP following its IPO. And fifth, we generated $852 million of adjusted free cash flow during the year.</p>
          <p>Our record sales volumes growth was driven by our capital-efficient <mark type="ph" /> use of (2:22) onshore assets growing at 16% over 2011 with 25,000 barrels per day increase in this higher-margin liquids volumes.</p>
          <p>The Wattenberg field in Colorado was the single largest contributor to this growth, increasing liquids sales volumes by 11,000 barrels per day over 2011 &#x2013; total production of 18,000 barrels or 18,000 BOE per day, which generated rates of return in excess of 100%. This past year, we increased our net resource estimate in this field to 1 billion BOE to 1.5 billion BOE, and doubled the number of identified drill sites to 4,000.</p>
          <p>To the south of our core Wattenberg acreage, we closed a $114 million transaction for 59,000 acres, retaining a 20% royalty interest on our fee acreage, and believe by doing this, we have accelerated the value of these assets by using third-party capital.</p>
          <p>Beyond Wattenberg, we achieved record sales volumes in many other growth areas of our portfolio. These include the Eagle Ford Shale, our East Texas horizontal liquids plays, the various Permian oil-prone horizons we are actively developing, our Greater Natural Buttes acreage, and the Marcellus Shale.</p>
          <p>We have also continued to significantly improve drilling efficiencies across all our active areas. In the Eagle Ford, for example, we exited the year with our drilling cycle times reduced to an average of 9.2 days, giving us a 26% year-over-year improvement.</p>
          <p>Complementing the success of our onshore programs in 2012 was one of the most active years in history for our Deepwater international exploration and development teams; that included a resurgence in the activity in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Earlier in 2012, we achieved first oil at Caesar/Tonga, and we're currently  in the process of completing a fourth development well in the field. We also continued to make significant progress at the Lucius development, our next major megaproject in the Gulf, where the construction of the Lucius Spar is on schedule, and our first development well, as you saw in our release, encountered 910 feet of oil pay, exceeding what we have seen in the unit to date.</p>
          <p>During 2012, we promoted a portion of our interest in Lucius by closing a carried interest agreement with a new partner. This transaction should fully fund our capital through first production, significantly increases our project returns, and values our interest in Lucius at almost $2.8 billion, where we have very little amount of capital invested.</p>
          <p>We've also advanced the Heidelberg project to first oil, we believe, in 2016, awarding long lead items, taking a design-and-build-to approach, constructing another truss spar with capacity similar to Lucius at 80,000 barrels of oil per day. And we continue to be very active in the Gulf of Mexico, with high-impact exploration, appraisal and development operations ongoing at eight locations.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international activities, and starting with Algeria. We expect to achieve first oil production this quarter from the first of three facilities at El Merk, and steadily increase sales volumes throughout 2013 as this new facility ramps towards capacity. We remain committed to Algeria, our partnership with Sonatrach, and our operations there. As I am sure you can expect, we have taken appropriate action with Sonatrach and the Algerian government to enhance security for our people and facilities. We will refrain from discussing our activities on any specific &#x2013; regarding security at this time, and hope you will understand.</p>
          <p>So if I could, let me move on East Africa. Mozambique continues to be an incredible success story. Our discoveries at Golfinho and Atum double the recoverable resource estimate of our offshore Area 1 Block to a range of 35 to 65 Tcf. The projected timeline for the first LNG cargoes remains in 2018 as we've awarded competitive FEED contracts and reached a Heads of Agreement with Eni concerning development of one of our fields.</p>
          <p>In West Africa, our partnership submitted a plan of development to the Ghanaian government for the TEN complex. TEN will be the second FPSO development offshore Ghana following Jubilee, which is now producing more than 110,000 barrels of oil per day. We expect 2013 to be another very active year in our international drilling program with a significant number of high-impact exploration wells.</p>
          <p>All of the E&amp;P activities we described today provide confidence in our ability to achieve our goal of 3 billion barrels of reserves by the end of 2013. In 2012, we added reserves at competitive costs of $14.65 per BOE, excluding the impact of price revisions. Our proved developed reserves now comprise 74% of our year-end total, an improvement over the previous year's 71%.</p>
          <p>Natural-gas prices decreased by about 31% on average for the year, yet only about 2.5% of our reserves were impacted, almost all of which would return at today's strip prices.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we also followed through on our commitment to further strengthen the balance sheet. This was driven by our free cash flow and cash received from the successful Algeria tax resolution. By year-end, we repaid all of our borrowings under our $5 billion revolving credit facility, reducing our net-debt-to-cap ratio to 34% from 41%, and we ended the year with $2.5 billion of cash on hand.</p>
          <p>As we wrap up today's prepared remarks, I want to thank our employees and contractors for the exceptionally strong operating, exploration, and financial results we delivered for our shareholders again in 2012.</p>
          <p>Operator, if you would, let's open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions on Lucius. When we look at the 910 feet of oil pay there, how is that divided between the Pliocene and Miocene sections? And what does it suggest from a resource-potential perspective, both for Lucius and maybe on a risk basis for Phobos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I think there is no doubt that we couldn't be anything more than just delighted and tickled with how that well has drilled out. I'm going to let &#x2013; if you don't mind, I'm going to have Doug give a little more color on that.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, I'm not really sure if there is any takeaways for Phobos. I'll probably let Bob Daniels answer that, if you don't mind. And if I can, just leave you the impression &#x2013; I think we're all very excited. We think it means probably lots of good things for us, but it may be a little early to start trying to give additional estimates.</p>
          <p>So with that, if I can, let me turn it over to Doug on the Lucius, and then turn it back to Bob Daniels for the Phobos question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Al.</p>
          <p>Brian, you're right. We're very excited about Lucius. What we found in the Pliocene and Miocene sands there is very encouraging and exciting. The project is on schedule, on budget.</p>
          <p>And at this point in time, we have not broken out to split. What we can tell you, though, is just to reiterate the guidance that we see the field as a 300-million-barrel-plus development, and we're extremely excited about the options that the Miocene could add to the development planning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, on the Phobos question, we never really had a big concern about sand content in the Pliocene and Miocene down at Phobos. We've got a lot of confidence that we'll see a lot of sand down there.</p>
          <p>It's really &#x2013; the risk down there is whether it's going to be charged coming out through the Hadrian complex into Phobos. So we'll just have to wait and see on that.</p>
          <p>But remember at Phobos too, we've got a deeper objective also &#x2013; the lower Wilcox that &#x2013; or the lower tertiary Wilcox that we've got to get down to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great. Thanks. And then separately, when you think about your mix of associated gas, Marcellus gas, and other dry gas, recognizing you haven't put out guidance. But can you talk about your outlook for gas production trajectory? Does the associated gas in Marcellus win out, or should we expect overall gas volumes to fall going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, it's generally &#x2013; our expectation is that our gas production will be relatively flat. Time to time, it will be up a little bit, primarily driven by the outstanding results that we've seen in the Marcellus. It's offset by the declines we see in some of our mature fields like IHUB and our base fields onshore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, this is Al. We'll give you more color in a couple of weeks, but our plans are just to maintain the four rigs that we have operated there now. We're not taking it down and not taking up.</p>
          <p>But I don't think you should expect the industry, likely in this price environment, is going to do a lot with dry gas. But the one dry gas basin that does have economics is the Marcellus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning. My first question on the domestic property. I was curious &#x2013; some of these huge growers sequentially &#x2013; Wattenberg and the wet Haynesville &#x2013; sort of what can we see, sustainably on a quarterly basis? And what are sort of the limitations on growth here in the intermediate term, if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Subash, this is Chuck. Everywhere we're putting capital, we're seeing outstanding growth. And we're particularly focused on the liquids activity in the Wattenberg, Maverick, West Texas, and East Texas. That's where most of our capital is going, and we continue to see growth.</p>
          <p>We'll give you guidance in February where we're headed with regard to the company growth rate. But I think that the types of trajectories that you've seen in those assets, in particular, if you look back through the operating reports, are the kind of trajectory you would envision in the future. Because that's the kind of investment we're putting in there. The quality of the investments continue to be outstanding. And the growth rates, particularly on the liquid side, have just been remarkable.</p>
          <p>And our whole expectation here is to deliver very high returns on our drilling programs, and I think that's what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would like to add to &#x2013; the fact that in addition to the way we're looking at it from an upstream perspective, we also tried to marry that with the midstream. And that's why you've seen us do what we've done in the Rockies, with both Front Range Express and Texas Express. And then the plant that we're bringing on in the &#x2013; down in the Eagle Ford area mid-year.</p>
          <p>So our belief is, as we turn from 2013 into 2014, to reach that 3 billion barrels of proved reserves target we have out there for the end of 2014, that these midstream developments that we have been spending money on will actually feed a lot of growth, both from a production and a reserve standpoint, onshore, which will always, I think in the near-term, be heavily dependent upon the success that we see both at Wattenberg and the Eagle Ford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And a follow-up here on &#x2013; so maybe on monetizations this year. Maybe you'll talk to this in your 2013 guidance, but if you can comment on it now. Other than Mozambique, are there any other big projects &#x2013; for instance, I think Tullow talked about selling down TEN. Is that in the cards for instance for you guys? And if you can confirm whether TEN is somewhere around a $5 billion project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it probably is best &#x2013; if I can, I'm going to give you my views here, but the better views probably need to come from Bob Gwin. But I think &#x2013; because we only have a small interest at TEN, it's very different for us than it is for Kosmos. And even though they have the same amount, as well as Tullow.</p>
          <p>But as it relates to that particular development, I think we are encouraged by what we're seeing with the way the government's reacted to the plan of development, and I don't believe, Doug, we have any plans at all, in terms of selling down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's correct, Al. We're very encouraged and working with the partnership and the Ghanian government with the advancement of the TEN plan. At present, we don't see any direction that we would pursue that would involve selling down there. So we're not going to really speculate on what Tullow plans to do.</p>
          <p>But we are encouraged by it. We have targeted production in 2016. And so looking forward to moving that project forward. And we see that that capital range, rough estimate, is approximate to what we see that development to cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, beyond that, Bob -- following up on monetization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On monetization, I'd say the other asset to keep an eye on is Brazil.</p>
          <p>As you know, early last year we had identified Brazil for divesture. Soon thereafter, around the time we had our Investor Conference last year, there was discussion of ANP proposing a potential unitization between the Itaipu Block and the Whale Park Complex to the northwest. So we put our process on hold.</p>
          <p>Given that that unitization process has taken a little while thus far and we want to go ahead and move forward, we've decided recently that we'll get Brazil back on the market, and see if we can work some kind of a structure, such that any redeterminations around the unitization might be able to be adjusted pro forma sale.</p>
          <p>The timing of that is difficult. We're obviously targeting 2013, but there are regulatory approvals, et cetera, as we saw with the Devon/BP transaction previously, that cause us to think that would probably be later in the year, before it was actually closed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Subash, I'm sure there are other companies that do a good job actively monetizing and bringing forward value, but we've got to be at the top of anyone's list, if you go back to 2006 and the way we've done that.</p>
          <p>And just last year, looking at what we did with the OCI sale, as well as what we did in the non-core area outside of Wattenberg, what we've done with promoting down Lucius -- and my guess is you'll hear more about that in a few weeks when we talk about Heidelberg.</p>
          <p>I think you can continue to expect that we will be active in the management of our assets and trying wherever we can to accelerate value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Congrats and thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I cut out there, Al, so I don't know if you said anything particularly relates to Mozambique. But can you just recap where you're at in the monetization process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We're looking to sell down 10% working interest, going from 36.5% to 26.5%. We're in the process of marketing that with someone else who is also selling 10%, and our hope is that we'll have something in the coming months to discuss with you in more detail. But our view there is simply, if we can find the right consideration with the right terms and conditions, we would be interested in trying to reduce our interest to 26.5% from 36.5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any &#x2013; you said it's ongoing &#x2013; any -- you guys have any back-end timeframe, as far as when you want to get this done by?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will let Bob describe that, if I can. It'd probably be best to let Bob do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the only thing I would add is that we've talked in the past, and it remains accurate today, that we would like to do so around the time of FID, which we talked about being around the time at the end of this year. So as we move forward, it's a matter of getting into &#x2013; getting deeper into the process, finding the right partner, and then as FID comes together, we would expect it to be in place by then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Dave, as you might imagine, we get a lot of inbound interest, and I think our view was to finally formalize the process, invite some people in that we felt could, in fact, be good partners for us for, in some cases, different reasons. And we just started that here at the beginning of January. So we're kind of early into what I would call a quiet marketing of that 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then Barracuda and then Black Pearl, can you talk about how we should view that and how that changes your focus going forward? Do you just now move back North and concentrate on that area? Could you give us some more color around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, this is Bob. We drilled those two down there to see whether or not the liquid potential that we had thought could exist down there was actually real. And both of those wells were unsuccessful. We found really good sands. We found a lot of good things down in that area, but obviously, these two didn't work. We've got a lot of information now that's new to us, so we got to roll into our interpretations and see what it means to us going forward.</p>
          <p>We have moved back to the North and anticipate the rest of the activity this year will be focused on the North, where we are at Tubarao now, drilling an appraisal well. We've got some exploratory work to do even farther to the north, some prospects that we've talked about before.</p>
          <p>And so we've got an active program, but any time we invest that kind of capital and get that information, we need to roll it into our interpretations and see what it all means. We're very disappointed with what we found at this point, but we'll see what it tells us going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question. Brian, I guess, attempted to ask the question, but any guidance you want to give us for -- I realize February 20, you're doing the Analyst Day or a Conference Call. But can you give us any guidance around any change out from prior years, as far as staying within cash flow &#x2013; similar-type metrics or similar-type targets and goals for Anadarko? Any color you can give us on 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is really little that we'd like to share this morning. We'll be sharing it obviously in detail in two weeks.</p>
          <p>But I think the prior calls -- we've made the comment that we would expect to see a moderate improvement in our level of spending. And we would certainly expect to still spend within cash flow. Thankfully, the assets that we have are pretty robust from a cash-generating capability, due to the Brent-linked focus on oil and the cost controls that we've had in place.</p>
          <p>So we feel we'll be able to increase the budget, stay within cash flow, and continue to improve the balance sheet as we bring in additional funds from Algeria -- from the Algerian settlement -- much as we did this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'd add to that, Dave, is we're an exploration company. You can expect that we'll continue to be spending, in exploration, the kind of things we've done the last several years.</p>
          <p>Whether we can continue to sustain what is an incredible success ratio of 67% to 70% will be a difficult dive, but I think one we're prepared to take. I think our guys do a lot better than most at that, and that we are, at the end of the day, we're an exploration company.</p>
          <p>So you should expect we'll probably drill somewhere in the neighborhood of another 25 deepwater wells again this year, and we'll balance that with some good predictable, repeatable results onshore and in the Gulf of Mexico to give you the kind of things that we've expected to achieve with the guidance that we gave you back a few years ago, over our five-year horizon, which ends in 2014.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question on that 3 billion barrels of reserve target for end of 2014. Should I think of that &#x2013; there is some moving parts there. One is as gas price rises, you'll kind of rebook some lost reserves. The other is you're just going to go out and spend your F&amp;D and get a certain volume there. And the third is taking kind of lumps of reserves off of, say, an FID or a gas contract for Mozambique. How should I balance those, in terms of thinking about CapEx for the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think sort of the watchword on that is we hope and expect that this year, we'll start to net &#x2013; or plateau, rather -- our net spend. And continue to grow the gross spend.</p>
          <p>I look at Lucius, and I'd like to see us do more of that. I think we've got a good shot at doing that with Heidelberg. Bob Daniels does a good job of using third-party money on the exploration to reduce our dry-hole exposure. And yet gives us a lot of swings at the bat.</p>
          <p>So from a reserve perspective, we're going to continue to spend at about the level we anticipate this year, and continue to do enough to be able to get to that point of getting to 3 billion barrels.</p>
          <p>Now, Mozambique will be a fairly significant contributor to that for the first time post-FID, and maybe what we should do is give a few other people a chance to give you some more color on that. So let me have Bob Gwin talk a little about it, from what he sees in his model, and then maybe Doug Lawler can talk about it, from what we see in Mozambique specifically, since that's the largest contributor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, it's essentially more of the same across the portfolio where, from a reserves bookings standpoint, we're doing very well in the Wattenberg Field. Obviously with the growth rate we've got there, the economics are robust. Eagle Ford is obviously a very large contributor.</p>
          <p>Across the onshore U.S. portfolio, we've been in a very good position to continue book reserves. Those reserves continue to be liquids-related. We talked about the aggregate this year driving up in liquids from 43% to 46%.</p>
          <p>As we look to the Gulf of Mexico, that's a little lumpier, but obviously, we've had a long history there. And with the exploration projects that we have in place and the future sanctioning of a place like Heidelberg following up on Lucius, we will be booking oil reserves.</p>
          <p>And then Mozambique is going to be oil index and very significant, but that's obviously going to be a significant lump in 2014. That will be proved undeveloped, obviously. And most of the rest of what I've been talking about is focused highly on proved developed, as our PUD percentage continues to fall, and we think we take a relatively conservative approach on our offsets and our shale bookings.</p>
          <p>Shale bookings have doubled relative to the portfolio here in the last year, but they are still a very small percentage overall. So there's a pipeline of bookings there that we think is pretty substantial, and even well beyond 2014, as we continue to bring additional trains on in Mozambique and execute to plan around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you'll book &#x2013; you'll book Mozambique -- if you have X volume of gas contracts, you'll book X/3 post-FID? Or X/2? Or X/4? How do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't provided that type of detail yet.</p>
          <p>I think the key there to note to is that the appraisal activity has given us considerable confidence in our reserve resource potential in Mozambique. And we're proceeding with reserve certification. We expect to have that complete in Prosperidad and the Golfinho Atum complex this year. That's an important element as we proceed towards FID, along with several other issues there that need to be addressed with respect to marketing and how we progress that development.</p>
          <p>So I think that what you can expect is that -- from your question, there will be -- all of those sources will contribute. And with respect to Mozambique, we're on track and encouraged by what we're seeing there from the appraisal, and hopeful to have reserve certification very quickly.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. I just have a follow-up on a prior question on rail. With the 20,000 contracted in 2013, does that satisfy your takeaway capacity in each year?</p>
          <p>For 2013, you mentioned a rail realization uplift, which is interesting to me. And then question whether you think about rail asset infrastructure investment as a consideration, given your ability to sell that into your MLP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Evan, this is Chuck again. The 20,000 does cover our 2013 and 2014 expectations for production, in addition to what we anticipate selling locally and into the White Cliffs Pipeline. So we're working every element to make sure that we have the ability to export all our crude, and we're pacing our development along with those infrastructure additions.</p>
          <p>The rationale, as I mentioned earlier, is to get us broader exposure, not just to Cushing, but to other -- even potentially water-borne markets. So all that is to keep the market competitive with regard to this gigantic new source of crude volumes.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And I know you mentioned in your operations report, you tested seven wells in the Utica but -- and no real color there.

          <p>Most of them came online in the last quarter of 2012, so still early days. And you'll hear more about our Utica views as the year progresses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Question from me on the Eagle Ford. If you look at the peak volumes of 54,000 barrels a day versus the Q4 average of, say, 39,000, what were the drivers of that delta? I'm sure some of it was just bringing a bunch of wells on at one point in time, but it seems like still a pretty big delta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I think what you ought to read into the peak number is the capacity for us to -- our capacity to sell volumes. And the Eagle Ford, like many of these other large resource plays, continually have constraints in them with regard to new plants being tied in, pipelines going down for expansion, those type of things.</p>
          <p>So what we find is &#x2013; and it's particularly true in the Eagle Ford -- what we find is that our ability to sell our total flow volumes are oftentimes restricted. And every now and then, the stars and moons line up, and we can sell at full volume. And that's when you see the peaks.</p>
          <p>All that congestion that we see in the Eagle Ford is slowly getting worked out. And then growing pains, if you will, are slowly dissipating.</p>
          <p>Our big opportunity is coming up in the second quarter of 2013 with the Brasada plant. When we get Brasada and its export facilities in place, it opens whole new avenues for crude and condensate and gas to be evacuated from our Eagle Ford. And our uptime as it relates to our capacity will improve, and you'll see really nice gains in our production volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understand correctly, when that plant comes on, you'll see sort of a step-up inflection point, in terms of your sales getting closer to what these sort of daily task numbers are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think your comments before were on the Utica, but on the Marcellus, I mean the production uplift was pretty strong given the activity levels. What are the sort of leading-edge EURs right now for that Northeast section that you guys are drilling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well across Lycoming and Bradford counties and then down into Sullivan County, you're just seeing incredible wells. The economics are strong. It still has a good investment thesis for Anadarko.</p>
          <p>The EURs continue to deliver really good economics. We're seeing wells with over 8 BCF type EURs.</p>
          <p>And as importantly, in the investment decision, we're seeing our costs come down. And we're down probably in the order of $2 million per well over just a couple of years ago. And that, in combination with the gas flow rates that we're seeing, is 6 million, 8 million, 10 million a day per well, depending upon where you are in the sweet spot. Good EURs and outstanding capital efficiency. We're getting good returns.</p>
          <p>I think you'll see the Marcellus continue to grow. There is a bunch of infrastructure projects for evacuation up there. So all that combined makes it a really good opportunity for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just last from me, a follow-up on that. Similar to the discussion on the Eagle Ford, do you guys have a bunch of pent-up production that's just ready for infrastructure? So you talk about the bottleneck is getting better, but is there actual shut-in or curtailed production at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. It's &#x2013; the pace of completions up there have been such that we are able to sell a good share of our volumes. We haven't had the percent down time, if you will.</p>
          <p>There are a number of drilled but not completed wells that are still out there, that we're slowly working off that inventory. So that gives you a little bit of pent-up opportunity, but it's not fallow capital with regard that you have it behind a choke and you can't sell it.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Switching over to the Wattenberg for a little bit. With the number of wells that you guys drilled, identifying both the Niobrara and the Codell, can you talk about if you're seeing any deviations in those results? And what you're seeing as far as results from the extended laterals and down-spacing efforts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Dave, this is Chuck again. We're &#x2013; first of all, we're thrilled with the results at Wattenberg. The production continues to climb, and hope you saw where we produced over 103,000 barrels a day for the quarter. And the liquids is up 17% just quarter-over-quarter. So the thing is just humming along.</p>
          <p>And we're doing a lot of spacing tests &#x2013; the industry is doing quite a bit of spacing tests as well as lateral length tests. And what we're slowly pulling into is around 12 wells per section. Now, there will be sections that will have more than 12 wells per section, probably defining about two-thirds Niobrara, a third Codell. We've really pushed the limits on lateral length out to 9,000 feet and 10,000 feet.</p>
          <p>We do see better results with the longer wells &#x2013; the first few longer wells that we've drilled. It comes at a &#x2013; with the longer laterals, you have more kit, more completions to do. So there is a timing element involved. And so we're looking at the optimization of the economics on cost versus lateral length.</p>
          <p>The good news is that, if you look at the performance, it's really starting to tighten up. And we're getting better and better at getting these wells activated online, down line. The infrastructure is there. The EURs are starting to consolidate around this 350-plus-thousand equivalent barrels a day &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; 350,000 barrels for the wells, at about 5,000 or 6,000 foot lateral lengths.</p>
          <p>So it's just turned into an outstanding investment opportunity for us. We've essentially done away with our vertical program in the field, and gone strictly to horizontals. And everything we're doing right now is to find the constraining parameter, and then work through it, so that we can accelerate value delivery from Wattenberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Appreciate that. And then maybe diving into the cost on that a little bit. In your operations report, you highlighted that on a per-well basis, you're saving an incremental of $0.25 million, as a result of tying in the water trunk line. Can you talk about what average well costs are there now with that kind of a downtick in the well cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we just &#x2013; we have &#x2013; first off, I'd like to call out our drilling group and just congratulate them on the outstanding performance they've had out in Wattenberg.</p>
          <p>We continue to learn. We reduced our spud-to-rig-release time about 38% year-over-year, and our drilling costs are down about 15%. So we're always fighting inflation in oilfield-service costs and trying to outpace those with efficiencies.</p>
          <p>One of those is the water-on-demand process that we have now, where we can deliver water to our rigs &#x2013; to our completions through pipelines and aquifers, so that we have very low-cost delivery.</p>
          <p>Before we had to put a bunch of frac tanks on location, do a lot of trucking to get water to those completions. So we've done away with that cost. We've also done away with that footprint where there is not near as many trucks on the road. So it's a very environmentally friendly type of process that we're undertaking.</p>
          <p>And our goal is to put these Wattenberg wells online with a four handle right now. And we're running between $4 million and $5 million on each one of them, and we want the average to be on the lower end of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And then one last one.</p>
          <p>Just with a lot of the liquids drilling &#x2013; and I know a good portion of it is oil-oriented &#x2013; you did have some decent ethane rejection that took place in the quarter. Can you talk about that going forward? I know you've mentioned some of the projects you're working on, but is that something we should anticipate for a couple years? Or is that going to be cleared up by the projects that you outlined earlier on this call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really not an infrastructure issue. The ethane rejection is just purely associated with economics. And right now, particularly in the Rockies, we're better served with selling it as gas, as opposed to ethane.</p>
          <p>These markets move around quite a bit. We've seen this in the past. We're hopeful that the ethane markets will improve, but until they do, we're fine with selling it as gas.</p>
          <p>In these liquid-rich projects, we still get the value uplift from our propane, butanes, and so forth. So the economics are still there. And we'll deal with the ethane markets.</p>
          <p>But I think some folks think it's an infrastructure issue. It'll be resolved by a plan. It's really not. It's just &#x2013; it's markets. And we continue to recover ethane, mostly in our Southern region, and reject it in Northern, just because of economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Dave, if I could, it might be helpful if we had Scott Moore, who handles marketing for us, talk a little bit, if you would like us to &#x2013; our view &#x2013; we do have a constructive view on ethane longer-term. So maybe I should turn it over to Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the key point that Al mentioned is that we're well-situated for long-term growth in natural-gas-liquids demand. But low-cost supply from North America really sits at U.S. petrochemical sector for being in a strong competitive position long-term, and our midstream infrastructure keeps us well up for that growth.</p>
          <p>Obviously, with that kind of pace of expansion, demand is growing fast, and supply is growing a little faster in the near-term, and the timing of build-out between crackers and fractionation and processing creates near-term imbalances. Right now, the market's a little long, I think, relative to demand, but it'll work through that over the next couple of years. And in the long term, we really like that outlook.</p>

          <p>And I think, just to conclude on that, Dave, we're trying hard to find every opportunity we can to not be captive to Conway, and looking for ways to get to Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>If the industry finds solutions for getting things from Conway to Mont Belvieu, in addition, that's great. I think we'd rather try to take, where we can, the opportunity to try to control exactly how our NGLs &#x2013; in particular coming out of our Northern areas &#x2013; can get to Mont Belvieu.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, everybody, good morning. If I could go back to monetizations very quickly, Heidelberg &#x2013; what kind of working interest did you guys see as appropriate?</p>
          <p>And then as you go through this monetization kind of phase in 2013, I guess, over the next couple years, how do you prioritize your use of cash, in terms of where you'd like the balance sheet to be and so on? And I've got a follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, I think probably looking at what we did at Lucius is a good indication of how we would think about Heidelberg. It's not so much I targeted working interest reduction, but rather being able to sell down working interest to have our future development costs covered. And that is the way we think about how we would want to use other people's money.</p>
          <p>So that when you look at Lucius, you realize that we really have very little net capital invested in something that's worth $2.8 billion today. And I think you should expect we will do more of that. And that's exactly the philosophical way we've approached Heidelberg.</p>
          <p>And maybe I could turn it over to Doug to give you just a little more view in terms of what we see there, because he and Bob have been working on this quite constructively. And while we haven't turned it over to development, we do have a sense at this point for what the development costs are going to look like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Al. We're really excited about Heidelberg, Doug. It's going to another great project for us, and we've got it loaded right in the queue behind Lucius. We expect to sanction it this year.</p>
          <p>And as Al mentioned, we haven't provided any guidance on what we would look to sell down there. The key is to capture the greatest amount of value for the working interest. And if we can cover the capital going forward, we'll consider that a big win in our program.</p>
          <p>And Bob Daniels and I work real cooperatively and closely on that, to manage that third-party spend to capture the most value for Anadarko and bring it forward as quickly as possible.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. My follow up, if I could jump back to the Gulf of Mexico again, to Lucius and I guess the Phobos outlook. You drilled the Spartacus unsuccessful well, and of course, Lucius now looks to be substantially better. Can you help us join the dots as to what didn't work at Spartacus and what the read-through from Lucius could be to Phobos in terms of different horizons, different targets, and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug, it's Bob. On Spartacus, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:24) is separated from Lucius to the north and east. And we have a seismic amplitude there that lined up with a fault-bounded closure.</p>
          <p>And we didn't trap hydrocarbons there, so the seismic amplitude that we thought may be associated with hydrocarbons was not. And we have a leaky fault there, so we didn't actually trap any hydrocarbons in it.</p>
          <p>If you get down to Phobos, we're looking out a four-way structure, both at the Plio-Pleistocene and at the lower tertiary level. Relatively un-faulted &#x2013; in fact, not faulted in the Plio-Pleistocene. A few minor pulps in the lower tertiary, but nothing that penetrates on up.</p>
          <p>So they are very different play styles between Spartacus and Phobos.</p>
          <p>The difference between Phobos and the Lucius complex is there, you've got major faults that radiate out from the Wilcox, all the way up through the Plio-Pleistocene. And we think there the hydrocarbons that were originally migrated into the lower tertiary have leaked and have been trapped immediately in the subsalt section, which will be the Pliocene. And that's what sets up Hadrian and Lucius.</p>
          <p>To get that same sort of accumulation of Phobos you're going to have to take the hydrocarbons from Hadrian through a syncline and then back up into the four-way at Lucius, and that's what we are testing in the Plio-Pleistocene. Of course, the unfaulted lower tertiary Wilcox sets up nicely, given that we think that Lucius was breached, and this one does not look like it should have the same breach capacity.</p>

          <p>Yeah, thanks Al. Doug, there is no shareholder here that's more anxious to get a decision from Judge Gropper than I am. We're still very confident in how the case is laid out, the testimony that was presented, and all through the closing arguments, as well.</p>
          <p>The last reply briefs were submitted last week. And I'd love to say we'll have some clarity by somewhere around the second quarter. There is no firm schedule by the court, but hopefully, the sooner the better. As we've said before, we still have not put any reserve on this case because we don't believe a loss is probable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just some quick ones for Chuck. With respect to the price-related revisions, I assume mainly dry gas. Was a lot of that like Wattenberg vertical?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the price-related revisions were all associated with dry gas. As you know, John, the price from 2012, 2011 was substantially different. And we dealt with about a $2.75 deck in 2012, and well under $3 in 2011. So assuming that we get prices to stay generally where they are today, most of those price revisions will come right back to us.</p>
          <p>We also took off the &#x2013; if you look at the non-price related revisions, we also took off a vertical program in Wattenberg, as I mentioned earlier. That's something that we don't see us drilling, and so we did the right thing and took them off the books. That impacted our reserve replacement, but it's a one-time deal. And we'll of course fill in those same reserves with horizontal drilling &#x2013; and substantially more reserves with horizontal drilling &#x2013; as time progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. With respect to completion efficiencies, are you finding, with your well designs &#x2013; I mean you've talked about increasing your lengths. What about the size of frac stages? Are they staying the same? Are they going down? Are you using less proppant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we continue to do a lot of experimentation. And it's really play-specific &#x2013; which works best.</p>
          <p>And what we're trying to do is an optimization evaluation of looking at the cost of these completions against the EUR expectations. Because every time you change a parameter in the completions, you get a different EUR response.</p>
          <p>So it's really around optimization. And I think the industry will tell you that the bigger the fracs, the longer the fracs, the more sand you put in there, the more EUR you get. That makes sense, but it comes at a cost. So we're working the optimization angles. And there is all kinds of parameters we're dealing with &#x2013; frac length, frac height, cluster density, you name it, we're trying to optimize around it, and doing all the work in each one of these plays to get the optimum answer.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. This is Bob. I'll start from the exploration side, and if Doug wants to add anything to it. But we're not having issues, per se. What we understand is the process they've put in place, post spill. And that process is more time-consuming, more onerous from a documentation standpoint. But it's clear. We understand what we need to have and what the BOEMRE requires.</p>
          <p>It means that we have to plan our business much further in advance to start the process, and make sure that we have permits in place when we're ready to drill a well, and rigs available. So we're doing an awful lot of pre-planning. We know exactly where we're going to be drilling in 2013 &#x2013; well, I'd say almost exactly &#x2013; at this point. And we are already looking at 2014 because we have to have lead time to make sure that we have all the permits in place that are required.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I am just following a bit on John's question about the Gulf of Mexico. Obviously, a busy the first half. Can you just give us a sense of the sequencing of the wells you see around the Shenandoah mini basin? And in general in the deepwater Gulf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, this is Bob again. I am glad somebody asked about that.</p>
          <p>The Shenandoah mini basin is &#x2013; we've got three wells going down there right now. And this is playing off a discovery we made in 2009, where we had 300 feet of oil pay with very good reservoir rock properties and good fluids in our Shenandoah 1 discovery. We finally were able to get out there and drill our first appraisal well a bit and then we've got two exploratory wells going with Coronado and Yucatan.</p>
          <p>Coronado and Shenandoah are both at TD now, and we're really pleased with what we're seeing in that Shenandoah mini basin. Of course, we can't give any details because we're just in the process of acquiring the actual logging and fluid data, and that will take several weeks before we'd have anything that we could say is definitive. But with what've seen today, we're real encouraged.</p>
          <p>So I'd say that those two are down. Shenandoah is a little bit &#x2013; I'm sorry, Yucatan is a little bit farther behind. But it is out of salt, and we expect that to continue over the next several months. So look for more information as we complete our final evaluation, but we like what we're seeing to date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. A couple of follow-ups here. On the Wattenberg area, you mentioned you sold some acreage just south of the Wattenberg area. Have you all done any drilling down there? Or what can you say about some of the prospectivity in that acreage, relative to, say, Wattenberg?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is &#x2013; I'm sorry, Scott &#x2013; this is Chuck. What we've done is put together a lease package, and we sold it to increase the activity in the basin. We, of course, retained an override or royalty position in that from our land grant. So we have a lot of economic value still going forward in there. And we look at it as very prospective &#x2013; that we're going to focus on is &#x2013; as what we view as the big thing, and that's Wattenberg. And the reason we're doing that is to continue to accelerate the value delivery out of Wattenberg.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, this is Al. I would think of that as just our ability to use the land grant in a way to do R&amp;D with somebody else's capital. And we're very interested to see how that turns out. We do think it's prospective, and I think this gives us some option value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you all haven't done any drilling yourselves down there. Is that fair to say?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say very limited. Nothing that would be material enough to discuss. But I think our view is that, in order to do the work and stay focused on the core area of field, we thought this was the best way to do that, and be able to test some ideas down there.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, outside of Wattenberg, we have more than 500,000 acres. So we've got a lot here we would like to be able to use and get to know better by using other people's capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have more acreage down there &#x2013; if something kind of works, just to do your own development? I would assume part of that 500,000 acres is also down there yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can see easily see &#x2013; I think in our ops report, we have a substantial amount of acreage via the land grant and the mineral interest that we have that comes up, as well as other additional acreage. So if it were to work, we have plenty of room down there to go to work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And moving over to Marcellus, just so I understand, you had a pretty nice bump in production. And was that increase related to infrastructure specifically? Because it seemed like a really nice pop in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a combination of completing wells and increasing our footprint from an infrastructure perspective.</p>
          <p>As you know, there are several new pipelines that have come online, and the area has given us additional pilots. And we've just &#x2013; we finished up a bunch of completions that have given us a boost in production. As well as in the Chesapeake operated area, they've also increased their completion count and are just in a really good spot. So when they come on at 8 million a day, production goes up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so a combination of bunch of factors, okay.</p>
          <p>And then in the Haynesville, or I guess I'll call it the East Texas Area, production jumped pretty nicely there, as well. And that continues to be an area it looks like you're adding 35 million to 40 million a day equivalent per quarter. And the stuff is still call it 70%-ish dry gas there, it looks like, based on your ops report. Is that something, as you look forward into 2013, that the liquids still carries the economics strong enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the ops report, I think the thing to focus on is our oil volumes essentially doubled, and our &#x2013; as did our NGL volumes. So the play is delivering good economics, and we continue to invest on it.</p>
          <p>There is no dry and gas. All the gas production comes along with some really solid liquids production. And we just happen to be in a really nice spot, and our team has done a great job of monetizing that asset and delivering a lot of value to Anadarko and its shareholders.</p>

          <p>Can you share if you've seen a water level on that Western side or what kind of column you proved up there? And then with the appraisal well going down on the East side now, is that designed so that it could further extend the column?</p>

And just would like to stress that the optionality that we have there with the Pliocene development and what the Miocene adds to us, we're very excited about. And the program that we have going forward with additional four wells this year will help to continue to advance the development and appraise the options for upside potential there.</p>
          <p>So like all of our developments, the momentum that we're regaining in the Gulf of Mexico &#x2013; we plan on having optionality and potential for increased volume in additional wells with the facility, so...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Quick question. Could you just refresh us on the timeline for Phobos TBing, and kind of where &#x2013; TDing, excuse me &#x2013; and where you guys are in relation to that? Also, do you have a data room open for Heidelberg yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will start on the Phobos one. It's Bob. We spud that in December. We said it's going to be about a 120-day well.</p>
          <p>Remember, we've got the dual objective with the Pliocene and then also the lower tertiary. So we're a ways away, and we will wait until we get the TD before we &#x2013; and get full evaluation &#x2013; before we talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Al. As it relates to Heidelberg, we have started a process there. And I think you should expect some time in the coming weeks and not too long after that &#x2013; weeks and months plus &#x2013; we'll be ready to talk about it. But we're not this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And lastly, very high level, should we expect any slowdown in the ramp-up at El Merk or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, we're sticking with the guidance that we provided previously. We expect first production in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the time. I know we're running late into the call here. But I guess following up on some comments that were made regarding outlook for perhaps a plateauing of net CapEx spend in the coming years, can you walk through what your priorities might be for any free cash flow that might start to get spit out of the model? Looks like that could start to be substantial. Just curious if you have any thoughts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, this is Al. If we get to a point where I think management feels fairly confident that we've reduced some of our capital intensity in the coming years, I think our first priority would be to look at dividend yield increase. So that would probably be the first step we'd go.</p>
          <p>We've got a lot of work to do, in order to get to that point. There is an argument, you hope you never get to it. Bob Daniels continues to find a lot of things for us to put our development dollars to work on.</p>
          <p>But one of the things we are seeing is there's a ready market &#x2013; somewhere from post-exploration success to appraisal to development &#x2013; that we can start maybe more aggressively looking to bring third parties into the process, to accelerate our value and not have to be capital-intensive. And I think once we get that to where the six of us are, as management, fairly comfortable with it, we'll take that recommendation forward to our board and see what they have to say.</p>
          <p>But that would be sort of &#x2013; if you're looking down the road, that would be where we would be headed, if we can, in fact, convince ourselves of those facts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you've been in a mode of monetizing as a way to strengthen the balance sheet and bring in capital to fund and some of these future development projects. Is there a point where you might be in a position to get more creative on how to, I guess, address the portfolio or look to high-grade the portfolio from an acquisition standpoint? Or is it still harvest what you got, continue to prove up additional success with the exploration program, and then look to just kind of balance out your future capital needs? Just curious if that thought has changed at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it hasn't. I think we are the beneficiary of being an exploration company, and a pretty darn good one. And our ability to generate our own inventory of opportunities is probably one of the things that makes us unique.</p>
          <p>Today, our inventory looks pretty darn good. And I think we feel comfortable about our assets. There is really few things on the margin that we would like to be in that we're not. And my hope is and belief is that we will continue to do things through the drill bit to add to that inventory, versus going into the M&amp;A market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last one. Mozambique resource size is pretty substantial, with buyers having various opportunities for LNG sources going forward. A lot of debate and uncertainty about how the pricing of those projects will shake out.</p>
          <p>And there were some other comments made recently about how Henry Hub or some sort of a Henry Hub plus model might start to work its way into the pricing structure.</p>
          <p>Can you shed any light on how you see things playing out, or what you might need from that standpoint to move forward with the offtake agreements for Mozambique gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm going to let &#x2013; if you don't mind, Scott's probably the best to give you additional color.</p>
          <p>I think one of the things we find very encouraging &#x2013; and having been a part of some of the early discussions with prospective buyers for the LNG &#x2013; is that there is a very ready market. How it gets priced and the pricing mechanism for that, we are certainly in discovery on that at this point. We feel pretty good about what we're seeing.</p>
          <p>So rather than answering this, because I know Scott will give you a better answer than I will &#x2013; nonetheless, I will tell you that there is nothing so far that has disappointed us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Scott. We are quite encouraged with what we are seeing from the buyers. They like the world-class resource, the opportunity to access it, its geographic diversity.</p>
          <p>We've been marketing this in an oil-indexed perspective. There is much precedent in the market for that, and the buyers are familiar with that and the buyers are familiar with that, and structures that they might want us to look at that need to be competitive with that.</p>
          <p>But I think we are quite encouraged overall with what we see in the value of the realized for the LNG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I see we don't have any additional people in the queue, operator. Is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are no further participants in queue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, let me just close by saying, again, we've felt like 2012 was just simply outstanding. And as outstanding as that, I can tell you the management here and employees feel that 2013 could even be better. May even be one of our best years ever.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to stay focused on being able to generate very strong returns for you, and converting resources and accelerating value wherever we can. I think our track record of being able to do that, at this point, is pretty strong.</p>
          <p>And we are very excited about what 2013 is going to bring to us. And in a couple of weeks, we'll give you a lot more details, but thank you for being on the phone this morning.</p>
