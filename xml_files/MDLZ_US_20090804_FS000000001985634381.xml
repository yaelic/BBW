      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. Thanks for joining us on our conference call. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Tim McLevish, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Our earnings release was sent out earlier today and is available on our website, kraftfoodscompany.com. We have also made available on our website a set of slides that we will refer to during our prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>As you know, during this call we may make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today, so they contain an element of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, so please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Some of today's prepared remarks will include non-GAAP financial measures and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release.</p>
          <p>So with that out of the way, I'll hand it off to Irene.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon. I hope you are enjoying not having to wake up quite so early to hear our results. I know we are happier. Earlier today, we reported strong second quarter results, results that built on our solid first quarter. Our performance was broad-based across our businesses and around the world. And the results played through on both the top and bottom lines. As we have said our Q2 results began to reflect the transition from growth based on price to growth based on volume mix.</p>
          <p>As we begin to lap the significant pricing actions we took last year, contribution from pricing has moderated. And as a result of our targeted incremental investments, we are seeing sequentially improving vol/mix. Specifically in North America and Europe, our focus brands are growing in the mid single-digits. And in developing markets, our focus brands continue to grow at strong double-digit rates.</p>
          <p>Of course, we also benefited from the Easter shift into the second quarter. But this benefit was more than offset by our decision last year to discontinue a number of less profitable product lines. On the bottom line, our profitability increased substantially, despite the year ago benefits from certain hedging gains and a value-added tax credit.</p>
          <p>Importantly, margins expanded across all geographies. Gross margin rose by 30 basis points driven primarily by improved vol/mix. And operating income margin increased by a 190 basis points. The completion of our restructuring program certainly contributed to the OI margin gains, but improved vol/mix was an important driver as well.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead this strong operating momentum will continue. For the full year, despite a challenging economic environment and significantly lower dairy costs. We're maintaining our target for organic revenue growth of about 3%. Pricing will be less of a factor and vol/mix in priority categories, core brands, and key markets will continue to improve as the year progresses. And although we're seeing weakening category consumption trends in certain European and developing markets, we're offsetting much of that with gains in market share.</p>
          <p>At the EPS line, we're raising our full year forecast to at least $1.93 from a $1.88. This represents double-digit growth on a constant currency basis versus 2008. This forecast not only reflects our strong year-to-date performance, but it also includes increased investments in marketing and cost savings initiatives.</p>
          <p>In particular, we're increasing our A&amp;C spending to grow our share of voice. As a result, we expect 2009 A&amp;C to increase as a percentage of net revenue, even though advertising rates have come down considerably. In addition, we're accelerating some cost savings initiatives to stage our earnings growth in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We now expect to spend at least $50 million more on these initiatives in the current year. That's an addition to the approximately $200 million we announced in the first quarter. These incremental investments will accelerate margin growth and provide more funds to reinvest in driving our top line.</p>
          <p>Looking at these results within the context of our three-year turnaround, I'd say we're now in the home stretch. We've clearly hit our stride and have staged the business for sustainable, profitable growth. Our forecast for 2009 builds on the success of the past two years. We will again grow both the top and bottom lines, while expanding margins and improving market share.</p>
          <p>Equally important, though, we've made progress in a number of areas, rebuilding our brand equities, increasing our pricing power, strengthening our innovation pipeline, and identifying additional areas for future cost savings. As a result, we are poised to deliver profit margins at or above the industry benchmarks and to consistently deliver against our long-term earnings target of 7 to 9% growth.</p>
          <p>We're finalizing our strategic plan right now. And in the coming weeks, we'll share more specifics with you about our cost savings pipeline and about our game plan to deliver significant margin expansion in the next two years.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Let me start by saying that our Q2 results provided further evidence that our financial turnaround is on track. Our top and bottom line trends continue to move in the right direction. We're beating the expectations we established at the beginning of this year. And we've zeroed in on the specific levers that will deliver the growth we laid out in our long-term plan.</p>
          <p>On the top line, we achieved solid organic revenue growth. As you can see in this chart, organic growth in the quarter was 2.9% including a modest, but positive contribution from vol/mix. Higher pricing drove 2.7 points of revenue growth, but that included a 70 basis point hit from lower dairy prices.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Q2 organic growth was negatively impacted by about 40 basis points from a value-added tax credit in the year-ago quarter. Excluding these factors, organic growth would have been closer to 4%. Going forward, we expect vol/mix to become the primary driver of organic revenue growth and a significant contributor to higher earnings and profit margins.</p>
          <p>This change signals a more balanced growth profile on the top line for the full year, and one that's more consistent with our long-term model. Here is what we foresee: pricing plus productivity will cover our input costs. While volume growth and stronger product mix leverage our overhead costs to increase profit margins.</p>
          <p>As Irene mentioned, the Easter shift benefited us by about one percentage point in Q2. But again, this was more than offset by planned discontinuations of less profitable product lines announced last year. As you know, this lessens our volume and revenue growth, but the net effect is a positive to both mix and profit margins, which you see playing through in our results.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the drivers of earnings per share. As you look at this chart, there are two things I'd like to highlight. First, our year-on-year improvement from operations in Q2 was $0.05, mainly from improved vol/mix and cost savings. But this included $0.02 of headwinds due to certain realized hedging gains last year.</p>
          <p>Second, on a year-to-date basis, gains from operations were $0.10. This also includes the $0.02 headwinds from the hedging gains I just mentioned. Importantly, this operating improvement came while offsetting more than $550 million of higher input costs through a combination of pricing and productivity.</p>
          <p>The key takeaway is this, we're growing our earnings in a very high quality manner. Specifically, our top line growth is becoming more balanced between pricing and vol/mix. Margin gains reflect a strong contribution from improved vol/mix that's a function of both investing behind priority brands and walking away from unprofitable volume. We continue to fund higher marketing spend to fuel future growth. And we're carefully managing our overheads to further enhance our bottom line.</p>
          <p>As a result, we're comfortable in raising our EPS guidance to at least $1.93 for the year, while making further incremental investments in marketing and cost savings initiatives to set the stage for next year. We are also making excellent progress on cash flow. As you know, we've been very focused on improving this important financial metric. These efforts have certainly intensified since the financial crisis hit and we entered into cash preservation mode.</p>
          <p>The benefits from our actions are now showing up in a stronger cash flow outlook driven by contributions from earnings, lower capital expenditures and working capital improvements. As a result, we expect our 2009 discretionary cash flow to be higher than originally anticipated, approximately $2.6 billion in total. On an apples-to-apples' basis that will be up from 2.4 billion in 2008. That also represents good progress towards our target of $3 billion of annual discretionary cash flow by 2011.</p>
          <p>I will take a few minutes now to share some highlights of our business segment results starting with North America. Overall, we turned in solid growth in a difficult economic environment. As you can see, organic revenue growth was 1.8% including 0.8 points from pricing. It's worth noting that the impact of lower dairy prices in the quarter reduced North American revenue growth by about 1.5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>In our priority categories, revenue was up 5%. This demonstrates once again that our focused investments in product quality, innovation and marketing are working.</p>
          <p>On a bottom line, North America delivered a 170 basis point increase in operating margins to 18.5%. Operating gains from favorable vol/mix and lower overheads contribute 110 basis points of debt margin improvement. Going forward in the second half of the year, we expect vol/mix to drive growth, as segment pricing turns negative in Q3. This primarily reflects the impact of our adaptive pricing model in natural cheese. Before we get to individual North America segments, let's take a look at U.S. market share.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this slide, our 52-week share trends are beginning to stabilize and improve. About 41% of our U.S. retail revenue gained or held share. Clearly, we are not satisfied with our U.S. share performance, but it does reflect stabilization of market trends as consumers adjust to the significant cost driven pricing in 2008.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we see further market share improvements as we lap the pricing actions and declining consumer sentiment in the back half of last year. Now let's take a look at results by segment. In U.S. Beverages, strong vol/mix drove organic revenue growth of 6% specifically the restage of Capri Sun with a lower sugar formula drove double-digit revenue gains in our ready-to-drink category. In addition, solid performance by Maxwell House in response to our quality improvements drove double-digit growth in mainstream coffee as well.</p>
          <p>OI margins rose 60 basis points to 17.7%. Overhead leverage and the completion of our restructuring program contribute to the margin upside. And we continue to invest in incremental marketing behind our priority brands.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, we expect year-over-year improvements in vol/mix to continue, and the second half will benefit from new products and marketing programs in both powdered beverages and coffee. In U.S. Cheese, our Q2 profile demonstrates our adaptive pricing model at work.</p>
          <p>Organic revenues fell 8.7%, almost entirely due to lower pricing as dairy input costs have fallen dramatically. At the same time, volumes have stabilized. More importantly, we achieved a 16% increase in operating income, which reflects pricing that's better aligned with our input costs.</p>
          <p>In the second half, we expect vol/mix to turn positive as we focus incremental marketing investments behind advantage categories such as Kraft Singles and Philadelphia Cream Cheese. At the same time, barrel cheese cost has stayed close to government support levels longer than we would have anticipated. And therefore the impact of lower prices will be a greater drag on second half revenue growth. This will not however impact our profit stream. Our adaptive pricing approach for natural cheese is now enabling us to reduce volatility in our income stream. That will enable our U.S. Cheese business to be a more consistent contributor to our overall growth.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to U.S. Convenient Meals, where consistent gains continue. Our focused investments in quality and innovation drove improvements in vol/mix. This in turn contributed to strong revenue growth and margin gains. On a top line organic revenues grew 7.1%. DiGiorno Pizza and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh each grew 20% or more in the quarter. Oscar Mayer Deli Creations also grew strongly. At the profit line, operating margins jumped 260 basis points to 12.1%, higher pricing and better vol/mix drove the improvement overcoming input cost inflation and incremental marketing investment.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect the momentum we've established in Convenient Meals to continue behind strong revenue growth and further cost savings. On to U.S. Grocery, where we delivered solid gains on both the top and the bottom lines. Organic revenues were up 6.7%, as carryover-pricing actions drove strong growth. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese was up double-digits as it continued to benefit from value-oriented marketing, new formats and flavor extensions.</p>
          <p>Operating margin rose 120 basis points to 34.8%. Margin benefited from better price cost alignment and overhead leverage that offset higher marketing costs. Now let's look at U.S. Snacks. Organic revenues grow &#x2013; rose 1.3% in the quarter due to pricing and vol/mix gains. Biscuits had a strong quarter with revenue up about 5% driven by solid performance of our top five brands.</p>
          <p>The strength in Biscuits however was largely offset by a decline in nuts and bars. We expect these businesses to recover as the year progresses. At the profit line, margin fell by 160 basis points. However, this included a headwind of more than 300 basis points due to significant realized gains on certain commodity hedging activities last year.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of hedging gains, margins would have been up strongly from improved vol/mix especially in Biscuits and overhead leverage. As we move forward, we have new marketing campaigns and new products planned for the second half of the year and we expect these activities to drive solid top line growth and deliver margin upside.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada and North America Foodservice. Our business in Canada continued to perform well, delivering strong organic revenue growth. This was driven by higher price levels and continued vol/mix improvements fueled by marketing investments and improved customer programs. However, declines in Foodservice reflecting an industry wide slowdown into casual dining traffic more than offset the gains in Canada.</p>
          <p>In addition, the discontinuation of a less profitable product line negatively impact revenues by about two percentage points. Operating margin rose by 260 basis points, this was driven by three things. Growth in Canada, overhead leverage as we've taken steps to offset weak trends in the foodservice industry and lower costs from the completion of the restructuring program.</p>
          <p>Now turn to our businesses outside North America. In Europe, revenue rose modestly as we grew share in a very difficult economic environment. The 0.4% increase in organic revenue included two points of contribution from pricing. We are pleased that our investments in brand equity enabled our volume to hold up well in the face of strong pricing and a weakening economic environment.</p>
          <p>However, vol/mix declined by 1.6 points in the quarter largely due to our decision to forgo unprofitable volume. At the profit line, operating margins more than doubled to 10% despite additional investments in cost savings initiatives and higher marketing costs.</p>
          <p>This margin expansion was largely a result of improved pricing; favorable vol/mix and lower manufacturing costs, as well as the completion of our restructuring program and lower divestiture related losses. In developing markets, our focus on priority categories, core brands and key markets continues to drive strong growth. Organic revenues grew 9.3% with double-digit gains in priority brands. For example, in Asia-Pacific, Oreo cookies grew more than 40%. In Latin America, Lacta Chocolates were up more than 30%. In CEMA, Jacobs Coffee grossed top 10%, and Tang powdered beverages grew strong double-digits across each developing market region.</p>
          <p>Operating margins increased strongly 160 basis points to 13.3% and this came despite the absence of a $40 million Brazilian value-added tax credit a year ago. The economic environment remains challenging and we continue to see weakening consumption trends particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. Nonetheless, we remain cautiously optimistic about performance in the second half as our investments behind priority brands continue to grow top and bottom line results.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand it back to Irene for some closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. So I'll sum up our year-to-date very simply. We continue to deliver strong results across all geographies. We've raised our full year outlook to at least $1.93, while increasing our investments in the business. As a result in the next two years, we are poised to deliver profit margins at or above industry averages and to consistently deliver against our long-term earnings target of 7 to 9% growth.</p>
          <p>Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon Rob.</p>

          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to know about the revenue growth. It was just a little bit lighter than what we had expected. And I guess it must been due to the discontinuation. Was Easter originally supposed to be 200 basis points of a shift instead of a 100?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we essentially expected it to be about a 100 and as we mentioned, it was offset by the discontinuation of some of our less profitable product lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually felt quite good about our revenue performance in the quarter particularly in light of the fact that dairy was considerably lower than we had expected it to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rob I think what you're getting confused on is that, in the first quarter there was about a 200 basis point drag, but that was a combination of the Easter shift as well as the discontinuation of certain product lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that was both of those things? I got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then on the gross profit margin it's up 30 bips from a year ago. I think a lot of other companies are showing some big margin gains. Did the discontinuation of these items help your margin and if so was that in that 30 bips?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the net impact is positive from a margin standpoint. It's a little bit of a drag on revenue as we've said. And it's certainly is an enhancer to our bottom line operating margins as well as our operating income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so then, but gross margin up 30 basis points for the year. Would you &#x2013; it was that in line with your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually it was probably a little bit ahead of our expectations, because keep in mind some of the factors that come through that would have enhanced the gross margin last quarter that we've talked about in prior meetings such as the benefit from the realized hedging gains, et cetera. So the fact that it was out &#x2013; up actually overcame a number of pretty significant headwinds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That must have been within the hedging. Okay, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Hi Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just a few specific questions first. Did you mention how much advertising and promotional spending was either up or down in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are actually not going to give you a number for the quarter, what I did say is that we expect it will be up on the year. It was in fact up on the quarter despite the fact that the costs have come down. So we feel very good about the investment that we've made to increase our share of voice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for that. And then the corporate expense like was a lot higher even though I thought, Tim that I mean you had recognized a fair amount of pension expense in the first quarter. Is there anything in &#x2013; one particular thing that's driving that up so much from sequentially quarter-to-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No the pension &#x2013; the pension contribution should have been about the same as the first quarter. Mark-to-market gains and losses run through corporate until they are realized. So there was some impact from that that may have been the delta you're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly year-on-year it would have been up pretty significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And then just more from a, I guess a conceptual and strategic standpoint. Irene, the &#x2013; I understand that you are now managing the cheese business to reflect more of a &#x2013; the passthrough and focusing on the higher margin pieces, but should &#x2013; I mean with the pricing down 8% in this past quarter and volume still not really recovering in fact probably a little bit weaker because you had the benefit of Easter in there. I mean why shouldn't we have seen more of a recovery in volume within the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Well, Eric, I think you will see a progressive improvement in the performance. There is a number of factors that are at work in the second quarter numbers. We benefited from Easter certainly on our Cream Cheese business. It doesn't have much of an impact on the other forms, but the facts are we are continuing to de-emphasize some of our lower margin businesses and so the net of that puts a little bit of pressure in the short-term on the vol/mix line. You will see improvement though as that works its way through and I think certainly we have good visibility to our share performance as we start to look out into the current quarters as well as the out quarters and we are feeling quite good about the performance of that business. Most importantly though as Tim mentioned, we feel very good about our ability to manage the volatility of the earnings on the business as a consequence of the approaches that we have taken on adaptive pricing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Irene, on Europe, granted there was some nice improvement there, but I think you might agree with me that 10% operating margins are probably not where you want to be. Can you just give us a little color on how you see European margins evolving, I know you have a new person in there and presumably we will hear some from that person. But kind of what's your two-year goal there to improve Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Terry, we've been pretty clear that we are targeting to get ourselves closer to peer margins in that geography as we are elsewhere in the world and the reality is as you look at the performance in the second quarter, our operating income is up over 90% despite an almost 30% currency hit. So we actually feel quite good about the progress that they are making without a doubt 10% is not our end goal, but it's a significant improvement year-over-year and I think we've got the programming in place to continue to make progress on our margins in Europe, as well as elsewhere.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question for you just on promotions and the effectiveness around promotions these days in certain categories in 2009 versus maybe previous years where promotions and activity in store may not have made as much sense. For instance, is there an increase right now? Are you thinking about dedicating more resources in store behind Convenient Meal category, some of your categories within Grocery that may be more just pure and simple meals for the family and there's a better ROI attached to that than what you have seen before, and was there a higher impact on to your pricing from increased promotions in this last quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, we really feel very good as a result of the investments we've made in our businesses. We are in a much stronger position to be able to market these businesses and to &#x2013; and to essentially grow them with a variety of tactics.</p>
          <p>And so particularly, our value oriented businesses, our value meals, products like Mac &amp; Cheese, products like frozen pizza, beverages like Kool-Aid and Crystal Light and Country Time, those kinds of products are doing exceptionally well with value messaging, and we don't necessarily have to spend a lot more to promote them at this point in time. We've got very strong brand equity that we've been able to leverage quite successfully.</p>
          <p>The reality, though, is given the volatility of input costs, we have invested more in the short-term in promotions because it's been our mechanism to adjust pricing while we wait to see how the markets shake out. But out intent long-term is continuing to shift our mix from more short-term promotional tactics to longer-term equity building tactics like marketing and innovation.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of quick ones. Just on the commodity input cost pressures, did you have a full-year number that you talked about? I think at one point it was $200 million as the estimate for the full year. Has that gone up substantially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's gone up a little bit &#x2013; it's probably a three-year, a little over 300 million is our expectation today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's been 550 million year-to-date, so this is the point where it actually starts to turn negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll see it turn the other direction in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then you talk about increasing, or I guess since the last quarter, I think you've talked about increasing your investment in marketing and cost savings in the back half of the year. Can you give us some sort of number on how much that's been raised since we last spoke?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, none of the increase we talked about -- probably a couple of pennies of additional restructuring and a couple of pennies of additional A&amp;C investment, neither of which were in our prior guidance, far as expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And then finally, is there &#x2013; in the upward revision of guidance, is there any foreign exchange movement in there that, because that seems to have turned a little bit more favorable over the last couple of months. So is that completely foreign exchange neutral?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you kind of sequence it, as you know, in January we talked about $0.16 of year-on-year pressure from FX. What happened by the end of the first quarter, we had about another nickel worth of additional pressure, and we thought we would be able to cover that with operational improvements. So we kind of held our guidance at that point. But as FX has essentially come back to about $0.16 level that we originally started, now we let that $0.05 worth of operational improvements flow through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First question, in the categories that you expect to gain market share that you haven't gain market share. Can you talk about specific example as to what you're going to do to gain share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess I start with the cheese. The situation in cheese -- we will see progressively improved market share in our cheese businesses as we continue to focus our marketing efforts and our dollars on our advantage categories, particularly Singles and Cream Cheese. In a number of our other categories, I would remind you, Ken, that we have about 10% of our revenue that is moving share, but they're, in categories like, Mac &amp; Cheese, hot dogs, Velveeta for example, where we have very strong market share positions and we're growing very nicely at high single-digit rates. It just happens that the category is growing a little bit faster. So we've really seen a number of our categories continuing to improve as the year progresses, both through a combination of increased marketing support as well as the fact that a number of our innovations will hit in the back half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question I have is in terms of your hedge positions. How much are you incrementally more hedged this quarter versus last quarter? And does that preclude you from, or does that actually enable you to have more margin expansion in 2010 as they roll off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our hedge position is a pretty stable program. We're always essentially hedging until our ability to price to reflect changes in the underlying costs. But our position &#x2013; hedge position has not changed appreciably from quarter-to-quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a &#x2013; first a quick follow-up on Ken's question there, does that mean that your hedges don't extend into fiscal '10 at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There may be a couple of them that would extend into 2010, but that would be a more derivative product. I mean we may have a little bit of oil hedged out in 2010. Because that's a little bit less direct impact on our business, but it affects our fuel for our logistics and it also affects some of our packaging materials in the films. So we may extend a couple of -- a little bit of that out in 2010, but there really shouldn't be any direct input costs that would be hedged into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And the volume recovery is very impressive, or heartening. And talk about improved volume in the second half is great. Can you be more specific about what you think volume might do and just my vote that mixing volume and mix together is not at all intuitive to me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we've told you, our expectation, Tim, is that we will see the contribution of vol/mix driving our revenue growth in the back half of the year as we lap the pricing actions that we took. And we are quite confident that we have &#x2013; that we will be able to deliver that, because we've been focusing our resources on those categories, in those brands, and those geographies, where we have the greatest potential for revenue growth as well as the greatest profit potential. And we're seeing that play through in each of our core geographies in North America, our focus brands are growing about 5%, in Europe similarly. And in developing markets, our priority businesses are growing about 19%. So I feel quite comfortable that the focus that we've got and the investments that we're making in these core brands and categories and markets will be a good driver, and a key driver of our performance in the back half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Irene, can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of your margin expansion opportunities as you're finalizing your strategic initiative? I'm just curious as to what buckets of cost savings really are out there for you guys to achieve.</p>
          <p>And if you sort of look back a few years ago, when you had the cost savings initiative, it sounds like a lot of that sort of went back towards brand investments to improve your brand equity and improve your market share performance, and it sounds like maybe going forward, more of the cost savings will really flow to the bottom line, because you feel pretty good about your brands' strength at this point. Am I thinking about this in the right way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so, Judy. The reality is productivity has always been a hallmark of Kraft. Over the last couple of years, given the rise in input costs, we've been using a lot of that to offset costs. Now that we have stronger brand equities, we're able to use pricing much more effectively. And as we look forward, we're going to spend quite a bit of time at the back-to-school conference talking about our cost initiatives, but I would tell you that we are expecting to see margin expansion in a couple &#x2013; from a couple of sources.</p>
          <p>One is just the vol/mix improvement that will continue to play through as a consequence of our stronger brand equities. The second is we'll give you a lot more visibility to our end-to-end productivity. We talked a little bit about this at CAGNY, where we've got some very specific programming in a couple of areas, including procurement, manufacturing, and logistics and we'll talk some more about that, as well as a continued focus on managing our overhead costs. So that's what gives us great confidence that we can achieve at or above peer margins in the next two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it still your intention to include these costs as part of your EPS and not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's absolutely correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick follow-up on the mix component of it. I mean a lot of the companies, I think, are more realistic of mix not being as beneficial, just given the consumers are under more pressure and could remain so for the foreseeable future. How does that sort of play into your growth algorithm, the mix components specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in some cases, there was a point where a number of us thought about mix in terms of trading consumers up. In our case, it's just about not chasing less profitable volume. And so what you're seeing a lot of our businesses that are value oriented whether it's Mac &amp; Cheese or powdered drinks, for example, have very attractive margin. So as we continue to market those businesses, particularly in the current environment, we're benefiting from the mix &#x2013; we're getting a mixed benefit as a result. So we feel quite comfortable that mix will continue to be a benefit to us, and in fact, as we now lap a number of the more significant discontinuations that we made in the first half of last year, we'll start to see stronger flow through in our vol/mix component.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Irene, few companies have kind of proceeded down this path of sort of parsing their categories between, focus -- certain focus brands and certain categories and others that are a little bit less profitable and getting less focus, and I think the risk, as I see it anyway, is that communicating that to customers directly and indirectly tends to have an impact, and maybe can get a little out of control. I mean, how have you dealt with retailers in categories where you're maybe putting a little bit less investment? And I guess, how are you managing that risk that maybe those categories decline a little bit more than you planned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be clear, when we talk about focus, these are categories that are getting incremental investment. The balance is just getting investment that's essentially in line with the company average. So we're not talking about walking away from businesses. What we are talking about, though, is disproportionately investing, incrementally in businesses that we feel have greater growth potential.</p>
          <p>So it's not a difficult conversation with our customers; they are as anxious to grow some of these core categories as we are. But the businesses that are not part of our focus categories are still receiving support and in fact, they are some of the businesses that benefited from the investments that we've made over the last couple of years. We're just not looking to invest any further incrementally in those businesses. We feel quite comfortable that the level of support they have today is adequate.</p>

          <p>Thanks, and just one other one, if you wouldn't mind. You mentioned in your opening remarks, you're thinking about margins and productivity in line with the industry benchmark. Can you give us a sense of what those benchmarks are? Are we talking about operating margin and industry averages, or just any color you can give us around what your internal benchmarks are from that long-term perspective?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jonathan, as we mentioned, we'll be giving a lot more color on how we're thinking about it and more specifics, but the margins as we are thinking about them are operating margins. And as we've said before, we've set our sights on getting ourselves back at least to peer average margins, which we would define to be global food and beverage margins, and we see those in the mid-teens. And so that's the target that we've set for ourselves, and as a result of the good work that we've done on a number of the cost initiatives that I mentioned a moment ago, we have much better visibility to the impact of those kinds of initiatives, but we'll talk a lot more about that at the back-to-school conference.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the call. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, Tim, on the inflation &#x2013; input inflation outlook for the year going up from 200 to 300 million, what moved against you that caused it to go up for the year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's not really, I mean it's &#x2013; I mean, it's a variety of factors there. I can't point to one specific input cost that is &#x2013; that has changed, but that's kind of our latest view of the overall impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether there is something that we should be watching that could move that -- how much volatility might we expect in that in the back half of the year, I guess is what I'm after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel pretty good about that number. I mean it's, maybe a little bit more than the 300 level maybe closer on the 400 million for the whole year, but again, that reflects a decline in the second half of the year of some 150 million.</p>

          <p>Hey Bryan, just to clarify, I think Alexia said that we had a &#x2013; our original forecast was 200 million, that would be incorrect. In fact, our forecast at the beginning of the year was higher, it's actually come down a bit to that 300 million range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought it was $200 million at the end of the first quarter. For some reason I had that written down, too. But in any event, the other question, I guess in terms of getting back to the mid-teens operating profit margin targets over the next two years. If you guys hit your organic revenue assumptions, and you hit that target, it seems like EPS would grow faster than the 7 to 9%. Is that, am I thinking about that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, it would be at the upper end of the range. I mean, we are &#x2013; there's a little bit of variation in all of that, but I would say you're right; it would drive an EPS at the upper end of that 7 to 9% target range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Quick just follow-up. I know you'll get into a lot more of this in the coming weeks. But again, as we think about sort of how you get ultimately to the sort of the margin goals that you want to, just thinking about your North American margins versus those overseas. The bigger opportunity, right, from a margin perspective is overseas. It would seem like that's where sort of outsized margin gains and improvements really need to come from. Is that where you've identified, I guess, disproportionate amounts of cost synergies relative to North America as a percent of sales or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Disproportionate, I would say is accurate, Andrew. We would expect more to come from outside of North America. A big piece of it, as we talked a little bit about earlier, about Europe. I mean, developing markets has margin enhancement opportunity, but they're really the growth driver. EU has a margin &#x2013; OI margin improvement opportunity, and there is still some room in North America.</p>
          <p>We've said before that the 21 &#x2013; 22% is not a sustainable level, and that is very much reflected very high North American. We don't think that it's healthy to go back to those levels but clearly, we think there is upside across all of our geographies, probably the biggest opportunity is in Europe, and then developing markets, and then you're right, North America still sound, but it's not the preponderance of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay, and then in thinking about the 3% organic rate of sales growth this year with -- you had mentioned dairy obviously was a bigger hit to the downside to that organic growth rate maybe than you'd thought at the beginning of the year? So is it accurate to say therefore that I guess the operating side of organic top line growth outside of that dairy piece is better to make up for that, to keep the 3% organic growth for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean exactly right, that the rest of it has filled in a little bit better than we had originally anticipated to make up for the &#x2013; for the shortfall in the dairy &#x2013; and cheese, as a result of dairy costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And last quick one. Your pricing, your vol/mix went from minus 3.4 in the first quarter to plus 0.2 this quarter. And without I guess getting into specific components I mean, which &#x2013; is there a way to say which one drove the majority of that improvement? I mean was it primarily mix that drove that? Was volume at least sequentially better if not positive in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again we &#x2013; I will reiterate, I know that you &#x2013; some of you don't particularly care for combining the two, but we think it's a really a more accurate reflection because there are inherent trade-off between vol/mix that become actually misleading if you look at them individually, but in the first quarter vol was about 2.2% of the 3.4 and this quarter vol was essentially flat. So we picked up 0.2 from mix in this quarter and 1.2 from mix in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on the second half of '09, so year-to-date you earned $1 a share that leaves $0.93 for the back half of the year. I believe that you said that commodities will be a significant tailwind. And I think the computation is somewhere around a $200 million benefit in terms commodity deflation something we haven't seen in a very long time. Why then are the second half earnings at just $0.93 and in below that first half? I've gone back and looked at the pattern and there really is no significant seasonality pattern over many, many years at Kraft. So can you go into some factors here, is it just being conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there is a couple of things. You're right, when you go back to the seasonal patterns at Kraft it's &#x2013; you have a fair number of moving parts with restructuring reserves and charges and all those sort of things. On balance it's, front half, back half I would say on average is probably 50-50 a little bit maybe more weighted to the second half by a couple percentage, but on balance about the same. The dairy cost, the input costs going down in the second half of the year will also come with it some expectation as we talked about adaptive pricing in cheese or natural cheese. You will see some of the pricing come down as well. We are in fact anticipating that pricing in the second half of the year will actually be a negative contributor to revenues.</p>
          <p>We do have a number, as we talked about, as well of things we've got about $0.02 worth of cost savings initiatives that weren't in our prior forecast that with the strong performance we have, that we are taking the opportunity to accelerate some of the cost savings initiatives. So we have picked up about 50 million. We originally came out with somewhere between 150 and $200 million that we're investing in cost savings initiatives. We have kicked that up by about $0.02 or $50 million. And also as we mentioned earlier we are increasing our investment in brand building and increasing our A&amp;C by about $0.02 or 50 million. So that is &#x2013; makes up substantially the difference in first half &#x2013; second half. I won't consider it a &#x2013; I think it's a realistic expectation considering the environment out there and we feel pretty good about it quite frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bigger picture here on the commodity side, over the last four years by my calculations the commodity inflation hit to Kraft Foods has been just over $4 billion. Gross margins are down about 385 basis points ended '08. So, the lower, I mean I think there is just a wide expectation out there that a deflation in commodities is a significant positive for Kraft. Is this one of the fundamental drivers, Irene in your comments about the margin goals, and really I think you are leading us to the conclusion that at this upcoming conference you're going to spell out these margin goals in the next two years. And it would seem that that deflationary environment would be a key component of it. Am I reading that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say that, David. I think I talked earlier about what we see as the key drivers of the margin expansion. And we will give you a lot more detail on that in a couple of weeks. But I feel particularly good that we have staged the business for long-term growth because of the investments that we've made in our brand equity, the pricing power that we've been able to demonstrate. The fact that we've got a much stronger innovation pipeline. All of which make us feel quite comfortable that the vol/mix expectations that we have which will be the key driver of margin expansion are quite realistic. And then we are going to basically add to that some of the good work that has gone on in some creative ideas in end-to-end productivity as well as some of the actions we will continue to take to manage overhead cost. So it's really the combination of those three areas: the end-to-end productivity, the vol/mix improvement and managing our overhead cost tightly that is what will drive our margin expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of the margin expansion we have talked about and we will talk more about in coming weeks is attributable to operational improvements. None of it is a forecasting and expectation that we are going to see a tailwind from input cost deflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I were just to restate what you are trying to say then is that the things that are under your control are really the basis for the margin forecast, if I or any one of us were to take the view that commodities were deflationary and the view that this is a benefit to Kraft would you agree that that would be additive to what you all are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that anything that we have guided or set expectations is purely operational, they are under our control and we will &#x2013; we are committed to deliver them to the extent that there is changes in the input cost, some of that we'll play it through, if you had a dramatic change for instance, downward change in, dairy prices again some of that presumably would have to be given back to pricing, but again we built the strength of our brands, we've got innovative new products. We think we have pricing power, but we have to see exactly how that would play out in the environment if you saw a material change in some of those input costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of quick housekeeping questions and then a broader question, first it looks like you have about 26 million or so of asset impairment and exit costs this quarter. If I remember correctly there were about $25 million of restructuring type costs that were embedded in the P&amp;L in the first quarter, were there additional costs, restructuring costs embedded this quarter or should we expect now 200 million or so in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually I think the 26 million you are seeing is actually a credit of 26 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's attributable to some charges we took last year under the program and we found a better means of accomplishing that. We essentially sold the business rather than shut it down, our manufacturing plant, and so we took back and that was $26 million worth of &#x2013; worth of restructuring, so that was a credit. Embedded within the second quarter is about 40 &#x2013; $45 million worth of restructuring cost, you won't see it broken out in the &#x2013; on the P&amp;L because it's embedded within the individual line. As we've talked about moving away from, items ex-items reporting and carving out restructuring. It's embedded, but there is about 40-$45 million worth of costs in the second quarter and a similar amount in the first quarter. So year-to-date we're about $90 million and we are expecting that to step up in the second half. We originally said 150, 200 million so that would kind of normalize that but now we have stepped that up about 50 million additionally as we see opportunity to accelerate some of that restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to follow-up on the commodity outlook for the second half, could you give a rough feeling as to or rough guidance as to how much of the commodity deflation you expect to come from lower cheese costs which would obviously be passed on given your adaptive pricing model, is that the bulk of the $250 million delta in commodities or if you could give us some order of magnitude there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it's a big piece of it. As you know, dairy prices have come down pretty dramatically from the last half of this year to where they are at today. There has been some recent shifts in that as the regulatory environment has made some changes but I would say other of the input costs, some of them are moving upward a little bit. Some of them are moving downward. On balance I would say the cheese thing and that is the &#x2013; is the primary driver of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on, in terms of your &#x2013; your priority brands versus the rest of the portfolio, if I remember correctly, the priority brands represent something like 45, 50% of the U.S. business at least. It seems like you are showing some very solid, mid single-digit top line growth from those. Does the current &#x2013; do your current targets and does the current model work if the other 50% or so of the portfolio does not improve in terms of performance from current levels? Or is there some expectation that the non-priority or non-focus part of the portfolio is going to start to improve from these levels built into your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, our major assumption here Eric is that these priority brands will be the key drivers of our aggregate performance as they have been so far. So again if we look at our aggregate results in North America, for example, where our priority brands grew about 5%, they represent as you said, over half of our revenue. And then similarly we are seeing disproportionate contribution from these brands in the other regions of the world. So we are counting on continued strong performance from these focused businesses because that's where we are putting our incremental investment and essentially sustained performance from the balance of the portfolio, which is quite consistent with what we have seen so far.</p>

          <p>Yes, there is I mean that's from the last restructuring program that we finished last year. The kind of the full year 2009 effect of that is about $200 million. The cost savings initiatives that we are undertaking at the back half of the year that we talk about, the additional &#x2013; the additional 200 million &#x2013; $200 plus million is new programs that will benefit us in subsequent years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then again a quick follow-up on the cheese price increase we have seen recently, it's moved up pretty quickly obviously. Does that temper your comment about the negative pricing in the third quarter? We see that flow through in the third quarter or is that more of about a fourth quarter shift for you in terms of retail pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say where the cheese pricing is today is pretty consistent with our forecast. So the increase that we have seen really was reflected in our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. And the last question I had, just a bigger picture question regarding trade promotion IRI data at least says that you are &#x2013; in a lot of your categories are seeing increased levels of promotion and I wonder if you could make a general comment about that across your business and then also maybe competitively if you are seeing increased levels of promotion and price promotion in your categories? And, I guess, let's say ex-cheese because I think we see that happening in cheese pretty clearly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris as I mentioned we are seeing some increases in some respects because of the volatility of input costs. We have been using promotion tactically to adjust pricing. And so we are seeing some impact in a number of our categories. And occasionally, we are seeing some sporadic aggressive price points that are really being funded by our customers as well. So there has been some activity, but it is our long-term expectation that as the dust settles and we see input costs stabilize that we will continue to move our spending from short-term tactical spending to more longer-term equity building investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So is that a drag on your overall price realization in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not really because net-net, we essentially spent a little bit more in promotion. In some cases, we actually used that rather than take a risk price reduction. We actually used the trade promotion to adjust prices. So essentially our net price was essentially where we expected it to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Tim, could I ask you if I look out to next year now. And maybe it is a little bit early to be doing this, but it looks to me like you would have input cost inflation of at least 3% and maybe as high as 5%. I mean and that probably would be pretty manageable from a cost productivity perspective, but is that similar to what you would see at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vince, I mean, it's a bit early to be giving any indication or guidance on 2010 and our future. I would rather not make those prognostications at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Irene, if maybe I could just ask you on the, from &#x2013; I guess, from a vol/mix perspective, where are we in the pruning process? Are you done pruning, and it's just going to be a few more quarters before we lap the effort that you have already got underway or is there more to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will tell you the heavy lifting is pretty much behind us. And we &#x2013; as we exit the third quarter we will have lapped most of the significant reductions that we have made. We will continue on an ongoing basis to do some pruning, but we took out some significant product lines in a number of our businesses and we would not expect that to be replicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe the last question I had Irene. At what point does the growth in the non-measured channels, at what point do the comps there start to get tough? Because it just seems like there is still pretty good growth coming out of those channels and when will it get difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we're I mean I think certainly some of the trends that are fueling the growth of these other channels, the value orientation and just the shopper traffic we expect will be something that we will continue to see for the foreseeable future and it is one of the reasons that we continue to make sure that we are appropriately represented there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, perhaps one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our final question comes from Christine McCracken of Cleveland Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, thanks for taking the question, just not to get too specific, but would it be fair to assume that commodity cost favorability you are expecting in the second half should be heavily concentrated in North America with the dairy and pricing cost outlook and not in Europe where cocoa, sugar, and coffee are moving higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fair. I mean we are &#x2013; we have a much heavier. I mean in our cheese business and pizza business is more heavily weighted towards dairy input costs and you are right. We're continuing to see a little bit higher cocoa cost and sugar and so forth. So, I would say that's fair that North America would be most impacted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Separately, on DiGiorno and Deli Fresh, those seem to be more premium products that might be benefiting from the shift away from foodservice. You noted the weakness in foodservice is well known that that's happening, but when you look at the launch of new products that you're going to be coming out with here in the second half are you tailoring that innovation at all to kind of hit those same trends or are you expecting thinking kind of longer-term when you are growing those out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I would tell you that we have certainly we have &#x2013; we have a number of items in our pipeline that would be more premium kinds of offerings and we have chosen to just hold those in abeyance while we wait for the economy to recover. So, I would say the focus of our near-term innovation pipeline is on snacking, it's on &#x2013; on health and wellness products and continued focus on value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on &#x2013; on the frozen area, there hasn't been any noticeable kind of shift down in sales trends there? We have been picking that up here just in the last couple of weeks. Just wanted to follow-up with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we had I think it's our seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth on our pizza business and we are quite optimistic about the outlook.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
