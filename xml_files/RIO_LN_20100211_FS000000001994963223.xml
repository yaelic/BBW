          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Rio Tinto Full Year Results 2009 Conference Call. My name is Fay, and I'll be your co-coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to Tom Albanese to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone on the conference even though they are probably sitting in snow or maybe at home waiting for the snow to melt. You should all have a slide pack titled North American conference call available from our website.</p>
          <p>Beginning on slide three, I would first like to say a few words about our four colleagues who have been detained in China. One month ago the Chinese Public Security Bureau who are investigating the four employees transferred the case to the prosecuting authority. Today, we have had conformation that the case has been transferred to court for trial. Senior managers from Rio Tinto continue to remain in regular contact with the families of the detained employees and provide support to them. Our primary concern remains the well being and care of our colleagues so it'd be inappropriate for us to comment further as the legal process continues.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to safety. I'm also pleased to note that our safety performance continued to improve throughout 2009. Maybe you'll have the opportunity to visit one or more of our operations over the course of the year, you will therefore know how important safety is of the value and a key indicator of our management performance.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we did suffer four fatalities in 2009, which despite being better than 2008 it's still four fatalities too many. And it shows that we cannot afford any complaisant when it comes to safety and the welfare of our employees and our contractors.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide four, we illustrate peak points regarding our outlook for key commodities. We have seen a substantial recovery across most of our key commodities driven by the government stimulus measures in the light of the global financial crisis. We do believe the factors that drove recovery in the second half 2009 will continue through 2010, which remain in the short to medium term, especially in the second half of the year and into 2011 as government stimulus packages are reduced, potential progress of tightening and monetary in lending policies will be continued.</p>
          <p>However, the long term outlook remains attractive. We do believe the continued industrialization and urbanization China will lead to a doubling in demand of our key products for the next 15 years.</p>
          <p>India is also becoming increasingly important. We put a little bit of time and talked about India in our economic outlook. Analysts projected that India's GDP per capita should reach current Chinese levels in about 15 years. India's steel, copper and aluminum consumption per person in 2009 was only about one-tenth of equivalent Chinese levels.</p>
          <p>So even if you assume China continues to follow a lower metal intensive growth path in China, it will gradually become an increasingly important source of demand growth and towards the end of both this new decade and to the next one. We continue to believe we are in well position to take full advantage of these opportunities.</p>
          <p>Moving over to slide number five, Rio Tinto's response to downturn was immediate and decisive. We set ourselves challenging but essential target and delivered against them in 2009. We generated volume gains that will be for iron ore, copper, and gold. We also reduced controllable operating costs by 2.6 billion, higher than our target and one year early.</p>
          <p>In early 2009, we embarked upon the transformation of aluminum group which put us back into profit in the second half of the year with EBITDA improving by over 1 billion half-on-half.</p>
          <p>Delivery against these targets together with the resurgence in prices for most of our key commodities has led to the strong financial results that we've announced today.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto generated 14 billion in EBITDA in 2009, the second highest in the Group's history with underlying earnings of 6.3 billion. Strong cash flows, ongoing progress with divestment program and rights issue allowed us to divest net debt by 20 billion to 18.9 billion. Cumulatively, these achievements represent a very strong performance.</p>
          <p>So now, if I may, I'll talk you through each of the product groups. First of all, let's start with iron ore on slide number six. The Chinese stimulus measures began to take effect in the second quarter of the year, resulting in a significant uptick in the demand for iron ore. These conditions are expected to remain firm in 2010.</p>
          <p>Production has exceeded the employed capacity with Pilbara since the second quarter and we're now set  full year production and sales records despite severe weather and poor market conditions at the start of the year. The Operations Centre in Perth continued to enhance performance as it neared the final stages of construction and ramp up. We remain active across a range of sales mechanisms with our Asian customers and in late 2009 we made the first delivery of iron ore to India.</p>
          <p>Our iron ore business in the Pilbara is currently expanding beyond its 220 million tonne per year capacity. This will be achieved by first injecting a new incremental capacity of 10 million tonnes per year and then looking at further stage development to take us to 330 million tonnes per year by the end of 2015.</p>
          <p>Cape Lambert has a potential for greater capacity than this. And we envision further growth beyond 330 and have a number of options available to us. Beyond Western Australia our global growth options in India and at Simandou and Guinea remain intact. Significant progress toward the formation of the Western Australian production joint venture was made during the second half of 2009. We will cooperate fully with all relevant competition bodies as we work toward formation of the production joint venture. With synergies of at least 10 billion in NPV, it is difficult to imagine a more attractive transaction in the mining industry today.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to slide number seven and aluminum. In 2009, we saw significant turnaround, in particular during the second half of the year. The cost improvement initiatives launched by Jacynthe and her team have helped grew EBITDA by over $1 billion and underlying earnings by 800 million half-on-half.</p>
          <p>The synergy run rate for the end of 2009 was 1.1 billion and we expect to deliver 1.2 billion in 2010 against an original target of 1.1 billion. One-off integration costs are well below what we originally expected by some $500 million. Following permanent and temporary closures the annual run rate at our smelters was 9% lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year, the aluminum group achieved operating cash cost savings of about 1 billion, a sizable portion of our total cash cost savings of 2.6. And may I say that Jacynthe C&#xF4;t&#xE9; and her team did an excellent job in delivering these types of savings through the course of the year. I know many of you have visited the <mark type="inaudible" /> over the course in some of our investor meetings and I've been very pleased with some of the work that has been resulted in a very strong performance.</p>
          <p>Of course, at residual Alcan, we've also had to keep a close eye on our cash flows, reducing working capital requirements and sustaining CapEx, while maintaining equipment reliability and without compromising safety.</p>
          <p>Of course, we did see some recovery in aluminum market in the second half. There still remains a significant supply overhang in the industry both from historically high stockpiles as well as latent  production capacity. For this reason we will continue to keep a tight hold on growth CapEx for 2010 while ensuring that we preserve our growth options.</p>
          <p>For 2009, moving on to copper, the copper group had another good year with earnings of 1.9 billion. The surge in Chinese imports was the main development in copper market in 2009. However, the market does remain volatile as we've seen over the past few weeks the focus likely remain on level of imports from China.</p>
          <p>Higher volumes added more than 550 to the bottom line, primarily from higher grades and operational improvements in Kennecott Utah Copper as well as improved grades at Grasberg. Much of this increase came from our share of mine gold production which is seen at 1.1 million ounces for the year. Our operations at Kennecott and Grasberg together with Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia position us as a major producer of gold. In Escondida a permanent solution was implemented at the Laguna Seca sag mill and that's now operating at full capacity.</p>
          <p>Back in October, we increased our stake in Ivanhoe to 19.7% at a cost of $388 million. This followed the signing of an investment agreement with Mongolian Government for the development of the Oyu Tolgoi project. First production is expected in 2013 with a five-year ramp up to full production.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number nine. Earnings at the energy group were study with higher volumes compensating for weaker prices. Demand for the Clermont thermal coal, particularly from China increased in the second half and China also emerged as a significant met coal important in 2009.</p>
          <p>In Australia infrastructure constrains are slowly being resolved. In total, 5 billion in new infrastructure is planned for delivery over the next four years at New Castle. However, constrains will remain in the shorter term as real capacities expanding at a slower rate. 2009 saw the historic signing of port access agreement that provide for 10-year contracts to underpin future expansion.</p>
          <p>U.S. coal earnings reflected higher prices in contracts and the impacts of divestments. At our uranium businesses, ERA production was strong and continued to benefit from higher realized prices as legacy contracts continued to expire. At Rossing, lower market prices resulted in lower revenues.</p>
          <p>I would like to add, well on uranium, that my view uranium is an increasingly important part of our energy portfolio as we move progressively toward a carbon-constrained world.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number 10 and turning to diamonds and minerals, due to the reliance on the OECD markets, and particular the U.S. market, we experienced the toughest conditions for years. These businesses are primarily driven by the U.S. market, which only began to emerge from recession in late 2009. The pickup in the U.S. should result in a better market environment to diamonds and minerals in 2010.</p>
          <p>Of course like in other businesses we took action during the year. Our diamonds and minerals operating respectively in different locations implemented six to 12 week shutdowns to balance production with market demand. Our Iron &amp; Titanium business incurred a small loss following challenging market conditions, notably for metallic co-products and zircon. Rio Tinto Minerals enjoyed more steady earnings, with prices compensated for lower volumes.</p>
          <p>Turning on now to page, slide number 11. At the start of 2009, we had a net debt of 38.7 billion and gearing of 63%. During 2009 we reduced net debt by more than 50%, 18.9 billion. Gearing was also reduced 29% at the end of 2009. This was achieved through cash flow from operations further progress from divestment program and of course, the support of our shareholders who have participated in successful like this year. And as we said earlier today, we continue to target a return to a single A credit rating.</p>
          <p>On slide number 12, we provide an update of our divestment program. The divestment program made exceptional progress in 2009. This included agreements to sell majority of the Alcan Packaging business in two separate transactions. One of them closed in early February. In total we raised gross proceeds before tax of 3.7 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p>From the start of 2008, we've now achieved over 10 billion of agreed sales of which 8.8 billion are now completed. We have a number of other businesses we still intend to sell as and when the market conditions allow us to achieve an appropriate valuation. These include Alcan Beauty Packaging, our talc business with three order uranium mill and deposits. We're also pursuing options for the remainder of the Alcan's Engineered Products division and a number of smaller assets.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the underlying earnings on slide 13, the effect of the prices on our profitability was substantial. The impact of these external factors was compensated were impart by our excellent operational performance with iron ore, copper and gold delivering higher volumes. We reduced production at some of our higher cost aluminium operations, and reduced production levels in diamonds and minerals group as I've said as well, and now Alcan Engineered Products in response to the market environment.</p>
          <p>Lower energy cash costs from reduced spending on evaluation and exploration improved the earnings further. At 6.3 billion, 2009 full year underlying earnings were 2.4 billion higher than 2.8 once adjusted for the effect of movements in traded and non-traded prices and exchange rates. Our total cash costs declined by 5.6 billion between 2008 and 2009 as shown in slide 14. Setting the under controllable costs aside and excluding the impact on costs of changes in production level between the two years, we reduced our pre-tax cash operating costs by 2.6 billion. This exceeds the target we set for ourselves one year early.</p>
          <p>These changes have been achieved through the cumulative effect of many different initiatives clearly a significant reduction in our workforce numbers. We've also reduced spend on exploration, evaluation products &#x2013; projects and targeted SG&amp;A reductions at all our offices around the world.</p>
          <p>The Australian and Canadian dollars as those of you know in Canada have strengthened in recent months, which will have an impact on our cost base. In addition, input price pressures likely as the economic environment improves and it's also possible to see some good cost return to the business as we resumed some of our exploration and evaluation projects. However, we will remain focused on our targets and we will now allow waste or inefficiency to increase our cost base.</p>
          <p>Our first priority for allocation of capital has always been and remains to make value adding investments in our businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. The recapitalization of our balance sheet allows us to resume our focus, on new valuating investments in growth since selective, but targeted allocations of capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditure allocation for 2010 is approximately 5 billion. We may allocate a further 1 billion in capital expenditure to new investments allowing us to be responsive to quality opportunities as and when they arise.</p>
          <p>And we're consistently scanning the market for opportunities to undertake small to medium size bolt-on acquisitions and we will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to look for innovative opportunities to enter the new joint venture partners -joint venture opportunities with various parties including Chinese partners. We have in the past been access to new resources, new geographies and specific special expertise through such vehicles and we'll look to do so again in the future.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number 16. I showed the location of some of our high quality growth options. Despite the challenging market conditions we've encountered since start of 2009, we've continued to invest in the long-term growth of the company and we preserve the growth options for the future. Our iron ore business, the Pilbara is currently expanding beyond the 220 million tonnes per year capacity by first subjecting a new incremental capacity of 10 million tonnes per year and then looking at further stage development to take us to 330 million tonnes per year.</p>
          <p>Energy will complete the Clermont and Grasberg projects, with first call from Clermont expected to be shipped on time and on budget in the fist quarter of this year and at full capacity by 2013. And we have had one of the best portfolios of undeveloped copper projects in the world highlighted by our Oyu Tolgoi Investment. Construction planning is underway for the target of first production in 2013.</p>
          <p>Looking back on 2009 and moving to slide 17, we have delivered against our commitments that we've set ourselves at the end of 2008. We did reduce our controllable operating cost by 2.6 billion exceeding the target one year in advance.</p>
          <p>We have reduced our global head count by 16,000 roles in the first half of 2009 again ahead of target. We recapitalized our balance sheet to the success of the right issue and divestment program enabling us to cut our net debt by more than half. We did reach the 1.1 billion annual synergy run rate in our Aluminium businesses at the end of 2009, again ahead of target.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet was strengthened allowing us to resume some spending on capital projects leading to the CapEx for 5.4 billion in 2009. And we delivered a very commendable set of operating and performance results as momentum gathered pace to the second half following the recovery in pricing for most of our key commodities.</p>
          <p>The renewed strength of the balance sheet and the excellent performance of our businesses have allowed us to resume paying dividends for our shareholders. The Boards have approved the final dividend of $0.45 per share in total about 857 million and we expect to payout about &#x2013; at least 1.75 billion of dividend in respect to 2010.</p>
          <p>So if we can move on to slide 18 and wrap up, and then take questions. We expect 2010 to be a strong year for commodity demand driven by China, our biggest market although we do retain some caution over the volatility of the recovery as governments unwinds stimulus programs.</p>
          <p>Our priorities for this year remain unchanged mainly to focus on operational delivery and in particular the continued transformation of our aluminium business. It brings some of our growth options forward to discipline capital expenditure as the recapitalization of the balance sheet gives us greater flexibility.</p>
          <p>To complete the Western Australian iron ore production joint venture and to prudently manage our balance sheet we moved toward a single A credit ratings to the completion of our domestic program and strong operating cash flows.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, I made a personal commitment to further develop our long standing and broad based relationship with China our largest trading partner and shareholder. You'll now seen the announcement we've made last week, on the appointment of Ian Bauert as Managing Director in relation to China, I'm confident that Ian will use his many years of experience and expertise in working in China to develop strategic direction that help guide us in all aspects of our engagement.</p>
          <p>From an Australian perspective and as part of our commitment to China, Rio Tinto is proud to be a platinum sponsor for the Australian Pavilion of the Shanghai Expo coming up later this year.</p>
          <p>A delivery of the target we set for ourselves to 2009 and our clear priorities for 2010 position us as a stronger business well-positioned for the next phase of growth and demand for our products.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to hand it over to the operator, to take any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto at Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank very much. Hi, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom in the last couple of days we've heard BHP Billiton and Vale talk about a more &#x2013; adopting a more flexible pricing structure in iron ore, and we've also heard talk about met coal too. But do you believe that the spot market is becoming a more accurate indicator of the supply/demand in the market? And if so, could we see you guys adopting more flexible structure with regard to your negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Tony, first of all, and we've said this for many years that the benchmark system we'll have to evolve or it's going to break. I think there were a lot of stresses put on the benchmark system, as we all know, we don't need to go on today. And from my own perspective, I would expect to see that &#x2013; the negotiations being watched quite closely by ourselves and of course, others during the course of this year. We've had a long-standing approach for selling into different types of market mechanisms. As we flagged the middle of last year, we were predominantly selling to our long-term contracts either on benchmark pricing or provisional pricing tied to benchmark, but certainly in 2010, we are looking at that. We're looking at it in the context of the markets. Certainly, we're looking at that in the context of spot markets.</p>
          <p>And one thing I would say about the spot markets and this really has been I think reaffirmed over the past 18 months, and that is, as demand for iron ore progressively went down, then up, and then down and up during the course of the past 18 months, we saw different chunks of marginal domestic Chinese production come in and out of the picture. And what I think we've seen is a pretty close correlation by &#x2013; with spot pricing and the marginal cost of Chinese domestic production. This is exactly what we've said in our long-term modeling that prices will follow to marginal costing and this is exactly what we've seen.</p>
          <p>So I do think that what we're seeing now which is strong demand for steel and basically an increase in steel production on a global basis now leading to stronger demand for iron ore which is now leading to higher spot prices for iron ore. We're certainly taking that noted as we look at 2010 and the period ahead. And just to emphasize, our demand for iron ore today has never been stronger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you currently have an internal estimate? I know you have an internal estimate of what China is likely to import in terms of iron ore because, but could you share that with us? A figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that what we saw during the course of last year, and it was probably precipitated by the global financial crisis, is that it was recognized that the imported iron ore took a larger share of the total steel industry and it becoming increasingly important. So &#x2013; and I don't think the situation is changing much as we move into 2010. I think there is some question about what will be &#x2013; what will impact flows of Indian iron ore into China. From our perspective we continue to expand our business, and I would expect that there will be more tonnes going into the Chinese steel sector rather than fewer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you continuing to see the issues that China is facing, the quality issues and would you expect that that ability for China to meet their own needs, will that likely continue to decline over time as it has over the past 20 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, certainly we've seen grades dropping off. But when we &#x2013; also when we saw that the global financial crisis, a large chunk of tonnes disappeared for the domestic side, again consistent with marginal pricing theory. I think that production from China will ebb and flow with the spot markets. And again, as spot markets go up, you'll see that Chinese production come down and vice versa.</p>
          <p>That all being said, I think with these recent spot prices, we may not have seen the immediate supply response of domestic Chinese production now, but we would anticipate as the winter season completely moving into the spring month that there will probably be some more Chinese domestic production coming into the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just if I could segue over to kind of portfolio management activities that you guys have done. Obviously, you've got net debt down very, very substantially and you've recapped your balance sheet. Just a question, we see your competitors obviously becoming very active in the fertilizer area and even though you have sold potash assets in Argentina and Canada, how do you feel about the fertilizer business for the long term? Is it something that you think is well positioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tony, I was the project champion that got us into the PRC project in 2001, so I've been following potash for most of the last decade. There are three fertilizers, minerals, macro-minerals and there is a bunch of micronutrients. Of those three I think that potash has number of very strong attributes and also very closely aligned with the mining industry. It's geologically fairly scarce and restricted to certain types of deposits. And it's also something that is not easily substitutable by say, other feedstocks. So if you look at say phosphate for example, there is lots of phosphate around the world and lots of alternatives for phosphate consumers, and besides that you've got to take phosphate through a fairly capital intensive DAP process after that. Nitrogen, there are some natural nitrate minerals but most of the nitrogen comes as the byproduct of the oil and gas industry, so it's not playing to our strength.</p>
          <p>Phosphate, it's a mineral product, not a lot of downstream processing to put it on the soil, that's a good news. The bad news, of course, as you know that potash and potassium tend to be banked  in the soil so that if a farmer has a bad year, they will basically continue to put on the nitrogen and the phosphates but they'll basically reduce their consumption or eliminate their consumption of potash in that given year. So when you have a global financial crisis like we've had, every farmer around the world stops applying potash at the same time. So it is subject to some fairly high swings and volatility that the industry needs to be aware off.</p>
          <p>In our &#x2013; looking at the potash market and the PRC project, I think we recognized from the beginning that that was predominantly a feedstock and naturally the feedstock for the Brazilian markets. And I think in the course of our discussions with Vale last year, they had &#x2013; they saw a strategic advantage and there's probably some government support Brazil for self-efficiency in that ag sector. So they had some strategic imperatives to get into that particular business particularly an Argentinean potash producer.</p>
          <p>So I think we saw the value. We like that value. It was very, very helpful for us as we were needing at that particular period of very difficult economic conditions to bring down our debt and that was the right transaction. Longer term, I do think potash is a place to be. In our decade of being involved with potash we discovered the world. We have a pretty good idea of where there be some additional basin and I've told our geologists to go out and find some potash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good, very, very good. And one final question before I turn it over is, on the Alcan Engineered Products, I heard you say that you are pursuing options and towards the divestiture there, and I am actually hearing that you're pretty advanced in the process. Can you confirm that for me?</p>

          <p>Hi, Tom. Two questions for you. First, can you give us a sense of what is your &#x2013; I mean existing 2009, starting this year, what is your EBITDA breakeven cash cost in the aluminum division and if you could put that in that context with I think a number you mentioned somewhere in the 60 something cents or pound at the half-year results briefing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sayan. Thank you for that question. And what I'd like to do is I'd like to give you the numbers in terms of dollars per ton just so that I am -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- thinking in that perspective. I just want to draw your attention back to &#x2013; it actually was Jacynthe at our interim results. She reported our EBITDA breakeven at the end of June. And the reason she reported at the end of June was that we were only beginning the process of cost reduction efforts in the first part of the year. It do take some time to start ticking in. We were seeing them coming in June and we thought that was reflective of the breakeven cost for the business at that particular time and what we'll be trying to do as we move through the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>I think we also flagged at the interims that we were &#x2013; while we like that number and we expected to have continued momentum for continued cost reduction in the second half, we were also beginning to be watchful for the currency headwinds that were beginning to come eminent for &#x2013; apparent to us in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So if I can start off by saying if you take that 1350 per tonne at the end of the June and create a  but-for case of June exchange rates continuing in the second half in that unflexed currency world with the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar being June levels, that 1350 would have reduced the 1280. Unfortunately though, we had our strongest currency in Canada and Australia, so the overall number for EBITDA breakeven in the second half &#x2013; and that stayed relatively stable during that period, was about $1,450 per tonne. So we did lose some ground from June overall EBITDA numbers predominantly because of those moves in the Canadian and Australian currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And one other question, I mean, given the potential delays or any potential delays that are beyond your control in terms of getting approval for this JV with BHP, are you going to put your own sort of expansion plans on hold till the JV is formalized or like BHP announced some of their standalone plans that could be merged into the JV later on, can we expect some concrete iron ore growth plans from Rio Tinto standalone in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sayan, we have very concrete growth plans for 2010. Let me just walk through them in some detail. We had already said we're running in excess of a 220 million tonnes per year run rate, and we had flagged in the results seminar last autumn that we were looking at two smaller, but incremental expansions really debottlenecking the Dampier port to take that 200 to 225 by early next year, and then 230 by early 2012.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we have been doing the engineering work, and we've come up with a better solution for the bigger expansion in Cape Lambert. So where we &#x2013; what we're doing is the engineering work, I'd anticipate we'll step that up in the coming months with some further commitments, and that would expect to get up to 280 million tonnes by 2013, and then it will get us to 330 million tonnes by 2015. And again, we have further expansion opportunities at Cape Lambert and in other place that we'll be looking as we look beyond that, but our intention would be to pursue those growth opportunities with or without the joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're basically going to go ahead with the planning and whatever the execution pathway is, irrespective of the timeline of the joint venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And we've said back in June of last year, when we announced the joint venture here, we're going to be running the business to maximize the business as we run through the various regulatory approval processes.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tony Robson at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Tom by the way for making your time available to the North American market. Much appreciate it. The EU review of the iron ore JV under Article 101, any idea of the timeline, please if you could remind us of that, I'll assume also that they have enough teeth to stop it, if they should so rule, do you have any chance of an appeal against their ruling, is my first question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, Tony that the European Commission came back to us a few weeks ago and said they were going to &#x2013; they decided to pursue the Article 101, which would have been previously referred to as 81, and that represents essentially a joint venture review approach, which by the way replicates exactly what we said in the beginning. This is simply a production joint venture. This &#x2013; they are not looking at this as a full merger, which would have been the approach considered a few years ago, but focusing on it as a joint venture. It's not quite as structured a timeline as a full merger review, which is why we went from saying that we were targeting mid-year to targeting the second half of the year. And again, we're just getting into that process, now the engagement is there, and we're doing filing with all the other countries. So that's pretty much what we said. We don't want to speculate on how this will play out, because we want to be respectful of the regulatory process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A follow-up question been given to me by others, not my view, that the $5.8 billion that you'll just receive from BHP Billiton with respect for equalizing the divisions between the two of you is not enough for Rio Tinto, that's a bad deal for you guys, given that you've got a much larger production capacity now, better infrastructure of course, and maybe greater optionality given especially two ports how would you respond to that criticism, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tony, first of all, I want to say that it's &#x2013; we all should recognize that there are some very strong synergies to harvest here, and I've spent quite a bit of time, I continue to spend a lot of time meeting with our shareholders and they recognize the benefits of those synergies, and I think, those are transformational synergies as we look at not just over the next few years, but the period well beyond that point. Now it will be the future managers of that joint venture, who will come up with some of the real optimized solutions as we go forward. I think, that 5.8 billion, it was based upon an assessment of long term value of the business, and essentially truing up that long term value to a 50-50 basis. Long term prices assumptions haven't really changed that much. Long term valuation assumptions haven't really changed that much from the analysis that we would have done back in June of last year. So we want to keep going forward, and first and foremost, capture the value from the true up, but also and most importantly grab those synergies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally hearing some news that between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, your operations, your protocols, your accounting methodology in the iron ore divisions in October are quite different, maybe some issues there will require more work than you had initially thought, does the executive changes of &#x2013; was it last week in part stem from this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Tony, I think we would have recognized all along that these are two big businesses themselves, and the joint venture constitutes a much, much larger business and like we would have done with the planning for the Alcan acquisition in the final &#x2013; the execution of the synergies, the more planning you do sooner, the quicker you get those synergies. And we recognized that we had to begin building team under the Chief Executive on the principles that we talked about back in last June, so that they can get down and do the work if required for that effort.</p>
          <p>And I would say that, that's what we've announced at the internal appointment, I think it represented a good mix of people from both sides. Those of you that have been following the aluminum business, you know that Phillip Strachan, who has been the CFO of Rio Tinto Alcan since the acquisition, has done a superb job in towards the planning and the execution of integrating synergies and bringing together a whole range of different accounting systems. And I think he is the right person for this role going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from line of <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for being available once again. Two questions. First, BHP disclosed that they sold 46% of their iron ore on spot or quarterly or outside the benchmark system in the half year. And I think 27% of their metallurgical coal. If you could tell us how much of your sales are outside the system, that'd be helpful in assessing the health of the system or the benchmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John. I think first of all, I want to focus here on the iron ore business because we've talked about so far what our intentions were in terms of benchmark during the second half. In the second half and as I think we first started talking about this in the August interims. We said that we would be intending to sell the bulk of second half production against long-term contracts, either through the benchmarks in those countries where we had negotiated a benchmark settlement or in the case of China where we hadn't negotiated a benchmark settlement on a provisional pricing basis that was tied to the other countries' benchmark settlement.</p>
          <p>We said we are going to do that and that's what we did in the second half. We are very mindful of the markets as they are evolving and of course 2010 and of course we are going to reserve our right to look at it and find a way to optimize our markets as we saw fit. But if we look at what we did in terms of our markets and I can't say I know the detail what others would have done, precisely what it was, but we've said we are going to deliver to long-term contracts that's what we did.</p>
          <p>If you match that with our strong production and you match that with a strong emphasis on cost reduction, we had a good EBITDA margin in the second half and I think on balance for the full year it was roughly 60% EBITDA margin which is a pretty good outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, the recent Chinese iron ore import statistics were a record 62 million tons for December and 46 for January. The combined capacities of yourselves and BHP in Australia and now that Vale has reduced output, their capacity is about 45 million tons per month. Do you &#x2013; how do you interpret the Chinese import statistics? Do you think that they are not accurate? Do you think that various companies are selling from inventory? Are there unusually large amounts coming from suppliers other than the Big Three, they are just extraordinarily big numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well they are big numbers, John but I'd also say if you look at them in the context of reported and visible stocks, those reported visible stocks have actually been relatively stable in this period of time. Port stocks have been relatively stable. We see now some increase in floating stocks but I think that's more infrastructure driven than anything else. We have had to work hard to grapple with the reconciliation of monthly numbers which have been swinging quite a bit and the relative stability of those stocks. So I think it usually takes two or three months to sort of have those numbers catch up on themselves and I wouldn't put too much mileage. But again, we saw the drop-off in January, but we also saw a number bigger than most would have expected in December.</p>
