          <p>Good morning and welcome to the presentation of Vodafone's Results for the Six Month period ended September 30th, 2008. And thank you very much for attending my first webcast for the financial community as Chief Executive of Vodafone. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Let me go through the agenda for the morning. I will start first with the highlights of the results and summarize our revised guidance ranges for the current financial year. Then I will pass to Andy, who will present detailed financial results. And finally, I will get back and I will give you first an overview of our operations in Europe and in emerging markets, and then a detailed account of the strategy review exercise that we have conducted in the last two or three months.</p>
          <p>I really look forward to your comments and your questions. And I just would like to remind you that at 11 o'clock we'll observe the two minutes silence for Armistice Day.</p>
          <p>So let me begin with the summary of results. Revenues, EBITDA, operating profit, free cash flow, EPS, all have experienced double-digit growth in the first half, albeit thanks to foreign exchange benefits.</p>
          <p>On an organic basis, Group revenue has increased by 09 percentage points and 2.6 on a pro forma basis including India. EBITDA has declined about 3%, and operating profit about 1% on an organic basis.</p>
          <p>Group cash flow generation remains strong and has increased 16% to &#xA3;3.1 billion, benefiting from foreign exchange improved tax settlements and lower interest charges. EPS increased by 17.1% of which around 14.5 was due to the foreign exchange benefit.</p>
          <p>The Board has reviewed the price on dividend policy in right of recent Forex volatility, the impact of acquired intangibles and the current economic environment. And we have concluded that it will provide more certainty to shareholders if the Board adopted a progressive dividend policy instead of the 60% of earnings formula. Essentially this is a policy for which dividends will rise smoothly overtime, and the interim dividends will rise by 3.2%.</p>
          <p>By now most of you have probably read and analyzed our statements, so I really would like to start by giving you my condensed view of the status of our operations and our performance across Vodafone in the first half.</p>
          <p>First, I would say that despite revenue trends that have been softer than expected in Europe, we have a good position and we have again demonstrated the ability to generate good cash flow, essentially through cost optimization through more sharing of our platforms and through good purchasing.</p>
          <p>In terms of macro performance, I look at our performance as good in three out of five of the large markets where we operate, stabilizing in Spain, and weaker than expected in the UK. We have taken all the actions as I will describe later in the day, but it will be -- it will take some time to see the benefits go through.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, the turnaround has not yet materialized. We are putting a lot of effort now on fixing what I would call the basics, which basically is network, distribution and commercial offerings to our customers, we have impaired Turkey's value, largely, but not exclusively, due to changes in the discount rate and we will cover this again later.</p>
          <p>And finally in the broad overview point, data and emerging markets continue to be engine for growth, offsetting voice pricing pressures. So in order to deliver our cash flow guidance that I will illustrate in few seconds, in the second half it will be essential to have very strong focus on execution in all our markets, and of course, an ability to manage external pressures through very good cash management.</p>
          <p>Now updated guidance for the current financial year, revenue will be between 38.8 and &#xA3;39.7 billion. Operating profit will be between 11 and &#xA3;11.5 billion. CapEx range is revised downward to between 5.2 and &#xA3;5.7 billion. And the free cash flow range increases to between 5.2 to &#xA3;5.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The decrease in revenue guidance reflects the more challenging market conditions in particular in the UK and in Spain. The lower revenues result in lower operating profit, but we have reduced the impact by cost reduction and direct cost saving and decreasing free cash flow guidance reflects lower CapEx, better tax and a Group focus on free cash flow generation that we are enforcing.</p>
          <p>I will now pass to Andy for his financial review. Andy?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you very much, Vittorio. And I will just do a quick overview of the key financials, couple of comments on liquidity and add a little bit of detail on to the outlook position.</p>
          <p>So first of all, the key numbers 19.9 billion of revenues and 5.8 billion of adjusted operating profit. Top right hand chart here, you can see the walk so 17.1% headline increase in the revenues. And if you go across you can see that 12.5% of that was made up of the FX benefit, particularly the euro. 3.7% of it was the contribution particularly from the India and the Tele2 acquisitions and the underlying organic growth was 1.1%.</p>
          <p>If you actually put India into the equation for both six month periods, then on a pro forma basis, the growth was 2.6% for the two half years. The EBITDA margin was 2.2 percentage points down across the Group, in line with our expectations and I'll talk to that in a little bit.</p>
          <p>On the adjusted operating profit, the bottom right hand chart here, the headline was an increase of 10.5% in the adjusted operating profit for the Group, 12 percentage points of that came from the foreign exchange. The acquisitions did not have a huge impact on the operating profit and the underlying was a 1% decline in profit between the two periods.</p>
          <p>Now, as Vittorio has mentioned, we have decided to take a charge -- an impairment charge against the carrying value of the asset in Turkey, &#xA3;1.7 billion. The largest part of that is because the long-term market interest rates have risen over the period, since the end of March. And that, when we apply it in the discount calculation, has resulted in about two-thirds of that value reduction. The other one-third is to do with the operational performance and outlook for the business that Vittorio will talk to in a minute.</p>
          <p>The adjusted earnings per share, 7.52 pence per share, is an increase of 17.1% obviously fueled significantly by foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>So let's start with the revenues in Europe, so the key numbers in Europe, the revenues were up by 14.3%, 13% of that came from the foreign exchange particularly the euro. We averaged a rate of 1.26 for the first half of this year which was 14% down from the equivalent period last year. The impact of the Tele2 acquisitions was about two percentage points of growth and if you strip those out the underlying was a 1.1% decline in the revenues in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at it another way, the regulated incoming revenues themselves caused about 1.3 percentage points of reduction in revenues between the two periods. So all the rest of our products particularly the data products, the growth there very, very strong, 23% increase in data revenues, covered the reduction in the revenues on the outgoing voice and on the roaming.</p>
          <p>The chart on the top right is then looking at sequential quarters and comparing the growth rates with the equivalent quarters in the previous year. We talked in July about a 0.2 percentage reduction in the first quarter revenues, the equivalent number for the second quarter was 1.3%. The 1.3% had a stable impact from Spain and about half of the 1.3 came from the performance in the UK business.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, if you look at that rate of revenue change by customer segment, the consumer segment revenues were flat to very slightly down. The business customers that we've got, our revenues were up about 3% and actually our large business, international business accounts within that were up more like 8%, so a very strong performance on the business front.</p>
          <p>Moving then onto the revenues in EMAPA, headline growth there 25.7%, significant growth still, 9% of that came from foreign exchange, 7.7% of it came from the acquisition in India, leaving an underlying organic growth of 8.8%. That was very much driven by the increase in the customer base and also by a very, very strong performance in data with data revenues in EMAPA up by 56%. Again, on a pro forma basis, so putting India in to both periods in full, the growth was 14.4%.</p>
          <p>The chart on the right again the quarterly changes there, you can see that the rate of increase slowed slightly in the last quarter, primarily due to reductions in the growth rate in India and in Turkey with the other businesses basically continuing to grow as they were previously.</p>
          <p>Now, onto the EBITDA. On left hand side for Europe the EBITDA grew by &#xA3;0.4 billion to 5.2 billion for the period, significant impact from foreign exchange here, 0.7, which more than covered the slight reduction in the revenues on voice et cetera, that I talked about a second ago. We invested slightly more in customers, which I'll talk to on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses remained exactly stable year-on-year. And importantly, we did invest a bit more into the fixed and DSL space that did not have a significant impact upon the EBITDA. But on the top of the chart you can see the margin movement in Europe which moved down by 2 percentage points over all of which 0.8% was because of the mix of the lower margin DSL businesses.</p>
          <p>In EMAPA, on the right hand side, the growth in the EBITDA there was &#xA3;0.3 billion, increased to 1.7, the increase was split fairly evenly between the ongoing businesses and India and foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>The overall margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points to 31.5% and that was predominantly the margin change in India that Vittorio will talk about later. The rest of the businesses in EMAPA were actually pretty stable on their margin.</p>
          <p>European cost. We have split these out into two parts. The left hand side are the customer facing costs, and the right hand side are the technology, network, IT and support costs. So just on the left hand side, the yellow are the purchase costs of equipment and the commissions that we paid to third parties. And you can see those rose very, very slightly year-on-year, about a 1% increase in unit volumes, about a 1% increase in unit price. Our volume has been kept down to only the 1% level partly because of the push to SIM-only.</p>
          <p>The top part of that chart in blue, are the cost of our customer care centers, our sales and distribution and our marketing and those have been kept exactly flat year-on-year. As have all of the costs in the right hand side of the network, the IT and the support cost. So all of those cost areas kept absolutely stable year-on-year and I think you should look at this in the context of voice volumes that have gone up about 9% and data volumes which have very nearly doubled during the period.</p>
          <p>So adjusted operating profit up &#xA3;0.6 billion to 5.8 billion. If I go across the chart here, slightly lower EBITDA contribution, higher in EMAPA, slightly lower in Europe. Depreciation and amortization costs basically stable year-on-year. Strong contribution from associates, Verizon Wireless in particular, which I'll come on to on the next slide. And then moving across again a big foreign exchange benefit primarily from the euro, albeit in the second half we will get some further benefit from the dollar if it stays at its current rates.</p>
          <p>So Verizon Wireless published their numbers a few days ago, another period of very, very strong performance. Top left hand chart here is the revenues, $12.7 billion in the quarter, now running at an annualized rate of over $50 billion a year. Top right hand side you can see the share of the net contract additions of the big four players in the market, 63%, bearing in mind they have about a 30% market share, it is basically punching at about double their normal weight.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin has been stable during the period, hence the overall EBITDA has gone up and in terms of contribution to the profits, Vodafone 20% on an organic basis, 25% on a reported basis, these now account for 25.5% of our adjusted operating profit compared with 22.5% a year ago. And on the bottom right, you can see the EBITDA less CapEx, a sort of proxy for cash flow, which is now comfortably running at over $1 billion per month. The Alltel acquisition has now received regulatory clearance and the expectation is that that deal should close somewhere around the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now moving onto financing costs. On the bottom here financing cost are &#xA3;743 million, a reduction year-on-year of 150 million. Some of that was to do with the items at the bottom of this table so the put accounting for the India option and also to do with foreign exchange. If you therefore focus on the adjusted financing cost line in the middle, you can see a reduction there of about &#xA3;40 million year-on-year at &#xA3;483 million.</p>
          <p>A number of moving parts in here, higher euro interest rates, lower US interest rates, a slight change in the mix of our overall profile of debt towards dollar denominations, and some mark-to-market gains during the first half of the year. We'd expect the second half financing cost to be a little bit higher because we would not anticipate the same mark-to-market gains in the second half and also we received the dividend from China in the first of half of the year. Worthwhile noting, I think, that around 70% of our interest costs are fixed going forwards for about an 18 month period.</p>
          <p>Now on taxation, we have achieved an effective tax rate of 26.5%, slightly better than we had been expecting for the period and a significant 3.5 percentage points better than the effective tax rate we had in the half year, a year ago. Primarily due to two reasons, firstly some countries have reduced tax rates during the period, most notably Italy and Germany. And secondly, we have made further ongoing improvements to our own internal capital structure, which have also given us an advantage. So the 26.5% rate directionally we think that that should be good for the rest of this year and actually we think that should now be sustainable as we go forward on a medium-term basis.</p>
          <p>Now as ever a brief update on the tax disputes that we have on the go at the moment and the answer is not a lot of change on any of them at this point in time. The CFC case is now hopefully in the second highest level of court hearing. We remain very comfortable and confident with our position on that, but still expect it to take some time to resolve.</p>
          <p>The Indian court case we are awaiting judgment on the first round of that probably over the coming weeks or days. And then in terms of the other sundry settlements we are continuing to work our way through those, a slightly lower level of settlement in the first half of the year, a little bit more settlement in the second half, but roughly about 0.5 billion a year that we are settling those.</p>
          <p>So, adjusted earnings per share up 17.1%. 2.8% of that underlying performance, some of that obviously bolstered by the benefits on the financing costs and the interest. 14.5% of it from foreign exchange and a very small element from the share buyback which obviously only impacted one small part of the half year. So we get a slight bigger impact from that in the second half of the year, but overall an underlying increase in the earnings per share of 2.8%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, Vittorio mentioned this earlier on, been giving this big focus during the period, 3.1 billion of free cash <mark type="audio gap" /> cost which is an increase of 16% compared with the previous year, so slightly more operational free cash flow generation from the core European businesses.</p>
          <p>In the EMAPA region, we invested about 300 million more into CapEx in India, but basically self funded that. The dividends were lower in this first half of the year because of the dividend flow from SFR, which is as expected, but nonetheless that was a reduction.</p>
          <p>Interest costs, a slight benefit that I referred to a minute ago, and then tax we have got a significant cash flow benefit from that which gives us the closing 3.1 billion number. The overall free cash flow per share pre-spectrum cost about 5.85 pence per share up 16.4% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure. So Europe on the left, EMAPA on the right, headline level the capital intensity, capital spend as a proportion of revenues basically constant year-on-year. In Europe, it was 8.4% in both periods. In absolute pound terms that was an increase of 0.1 billion that was in part FX, it was in part the DSL and Tele2 investments and in part putting in an ERP system or starting to put an ERP system in to the Group.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, for EMAPA, again the capital intensity percentage there was basically the same as it was a year ago. The actual spend was about 0.3 billion higher and that was all targeted at the Indian market, where we have been investing in the new Spacetel circles and we have got a six month cost in here for this year whereas a year ago, it was a five month cost on the capital for India. So India is the whole of the reason for the increase in EMAPA.</p>
          <p>Net debt, &#xA3;27.7 billion at the end of September, 2.6 billion of which was the put option in India, so underlying debt at &#xA3;25 billion. A number of moving parts in here, M&amp;A was a net outflow of about &#xA3;800 million being primarily Arcor and Ghana. There are a couple of line items in here for Qatar, where we have and in and an outflow, but the net is an outflow of about 50 million as we expected.</p>
          <p>We did almost all of the <mark type="audio gap" /> by the end of September, so we have the outflows from that. And then we have a foreign exchange movement of about 1 billion, representing primarily the movement on the dollar. So overall, comfortable with the debt position and very comfortable with our low A credit rating, especially in the present environment.</p>
          <p>Let me just talk briefly on the issue of liquidity, which I know has been a very real topic, more generally. Top right hand chart here shows the maturity of the various debt instruments that we have got out.</p>
          <p>Key messages are that in no year do we go above 3 billion and on average we have got about a seven year life. On the left hand side, you can see the snapshot at the end of September, just over 1 billion of cash at that point in time.</p>
          <p>Commercial paper about &#xA3;2.3 billion and indeed we have been accessing the commercial paper markets even over the last few weeks and have issued several $100 million worth of commercial paper during that period.</p>
          <p>The bond side we have &#xA3;2.5 billion of bonds that will mature in May 2009 and we will probably access the markets at a point in time. The markets clearly at the moment are fairly tight, but this is possible to do, the pricing may be higher and we will look over the period between now and May to make sure that we have that funded. Or in the event that we do not do that we have got $9 billion of committed undrawn bank facilities spread across a large range of banks and institutions, which have got a life of three to four years. So I think in overall terms, our liquidity position is fine and we continue to have a strong balance sheet position.</p>
          <p>Now on the outlook, Vittorio just painted the high level picture here, just to give a couple of points more detail on this. We have taken the revenue guidance down slightly, but all of the other metrics basically are the same or on the cash flow slightly higher. Some of that is operational reductions and some of that is FX improvement. But overall, just observe that whilst the revenue is a little bit weaker, overall we're turning that into slightly more cash than originally envisaged.</p>
          <p>So just to walk through the key numbers here, we've taken the revenues down by 1 billion primarily because of Spain and the UK and India. We have within that got some reduction in the number of devices and handsets that we are selling as part of our deliberate commercial strategy. So that is an element of it. And essentially, on the revenue line, midpoint of range we are anticipating a similar rate of organic change in revenues to that that we experienced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The M&amp;A column here not particularly significant, but have added in various contributions from Ghana and Poland and the Neuf Cegetel deal that SFR have done.</p>
          <p>And then on the foreign exchange lots and lots of moving parts on this, we are now assuming that for the second half of the year the average exchange rate on the euro will be 1.26, and we are assuming that for the same period the average dollar rate will be 1.67. So both of those numbers a bit lower than we had when we gave the original guidance at the &#x20AC;1.30 and $1.96 rates.</p>
          <p>CapEx we have reined in, we have reduced the amount of CapEx even though we're spending a bit more in India and we have been very focused upon our interest and tax costs, and hence overall, why we have managed to nudge up the overall free cash flow guidance by 0.1 for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>So in summary; strong headline numbers with a significant benefit from foreign exchange and the geographic dispersion of our assets. Data growth very, very strong across the Group still and our push into the business and the enterprise segment is also bearing fruit. Cash flow has been a huge area of focus as has making sure we've got appropriate liquidity and also driving the tax rates further down.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will now hand back to Vittorio.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. I will now run through the performance of our larger operations and then present the conclusions of the strategy review. It will be slightly longer than usual. But I am confident that we have enough time for a good Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So let me start with some overall comments about Europe. Europe remains a story of cash generation. In the first half, we have generated &#xA3;3.6 billion up from last year. Capital intensity 8.4%, which is lower than our yearly target of 10%.</p>
          <p>Organic service revenue growth, if you take out or actually you equalize the impact of Easter on the number of working days has been at minus 1% Q1 and Q2. EBITDA margins down as expected a couple of points, and 40% of this decline being linked to DSL. So these are the broad numbers about Europe.</p>
          <p>Let me start by diving into the UK. Now the UK, in UK we have experienced a tough first half. Revenues, as the chart indicates on the left side, have declined 1.7 -- organically 1.7 percentage points after adjusting for the VAT credit of last year.</p>
          <p>We have got a good performance in contract additions, but we have been hit by churn in the high value customer segment. Roaming revenue has been weak, mainly due to the regulations, or the impact on price, but also due to the fact that we have seen reduced business travel. And in general these three things have resulted in lower service revenues.</p>
          <p>Now we also have some good news in the UK. Data revenue continues to grow at 30%. We have today more than 0.5 million data cards in the UK. And this is a good reflection, I think, of our pricing strategy on data and our good quality of network.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margins, I'm moving to the right hand of the chart, have declined on the underlying business 2.3 percentage points. This is linked to mainly three things. The fact that we had to renew contracts, 18-month contracts that had been established in 2006, as a part of the move to the 18-month period, higher advertising spending to support our commercial efforts, and network costs to support the data story. And then there is the one-off VAT 0.8 that you see in the chart.</p>
          <p>So, market conditions have been highly competitive in the UK. And I have to say, we have not moved fast enough, as we have done in the previous year. You might remember we were growing at 6, 7, 8% for two or three quarters, and we have EBITDA slowdown. We have taken actions already. We have improved our consumer contract offers. We have increased the emphasis on SIM-only. We have improved the conditions for top-up.</p>
          <p>In enterprise, we are pricing more aggressive in UK, and our pricing policy for enterprise today is not to lose customers, profitable customers on pricing grounds. And as you might have seen outside of the room, we are now focusing on our device ranges. We have the BlackBerry Storm, the exclusive BlackBerry Storm, exclusive to Vodafone and Verizon and many other devices in all the segments of the range. And, of course, the UK team has been working on cost in particular in technology and G&amp;A cost.</p>
          <p>So as summary, I'm still convinced the UK remains structurally a challenging market. And therefore, Vodafone has to be more commercially agile in the market, leaner on cost and especially if consumer confidence worsens in the country.</p>
          <p>Spain, what has happened in Spain. When we announced the first quarter KPIs, there have been a lot of questions about the steep change in our growth between quarter four and quarter one. So I think I should devote some seconds to going through what has happened.</p>
          <p>Spain, in Spain, we have grown for 16 quarters more than the market. And we have done it focusing on what I would call the mobile only segments of the market. So essentially SOHOs, migrant workers, what local is called Autonomos. We had tariffs for Autonomos. And these are segments which are also due to the way the Spanish economy is structured which are also generating a lot of international calls.</p>
          <p>So when the slowdown has hit the market, clearly these segments have been hit more. You might remember that in those days in July, we said it has been -- we said one-third, one-third, one-third. One-third is the economy, one-third is the promotion and one-third is competition. So now today, I can be a bit more precise about exactly what has happened. Precisely the timing of the promotional activity has caused a 3.1 percentage point decline. The stronger competition including the loss of Yoigo has weighted 2.5 points and the migrant worker segment has weighted 2.1 point and we call this the impact of the economy. So these are today's if you want the facts and the analytics. My simple conclusion is we have underperformed the market.</p>
          <p>So what actions have we taken after this. First of all, let me say that the actions that we have been taken are working and the rate of decline in the market is stabilizing and actually it's slightly less in quarter two than quarter one, minus 2.2 versus minus 2.5.</p>
          <p>We're doing well in contracts and also in data revenues despite the fact that the number is not particularly good. This really is two different things connectivity -- data connectivity keeps going well. And on the other hand we have been -- we are seeing a decline in infotainment and the impact of some price caps that we have put in the market to protect actually high data users so to avoid the so called bill truck.</p>
          <p>Prepay, which is the segment where migrant workers tend to be concentrated is down 11% year-on-year, but the quarterly trend is flat. So, while we see still a lowering of international calling from the immigrant customers we are not seeing, neither large decreases in contract numbers nor a worsening trend.</p>
          <p>Moving to EBITDA on the right, excluding the impact of Tele2 and DSL and the universal service obligation charge that is now levied in Spain, the margin fell 1.8 percentage points due to increased A&amp;R spend again in the contract space where we have been doing well.</p>
          <p>So, in Spain after the sharp decline, we have acted quickly. We have increased immediately as soon as we saw the decline on net promotions. We have improved the Vitamina pricing in Spain. We have pushed SIM-only products.</p>
          <p>We have included or introduced zonal pricing and we have launched DSL and especially this Vodafone DSL, which is a Vodafone router integrating HSDPA and DSL, which we think is particularly well taken in the Italian market and therefore we are bringing it everywhere.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have acted in Spain. We have taken the necessary steps to address the pressures. But it will take time to recover, and so we expect Spain to continue to be challenging over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Germany, in Germany our position is good. In the second quarter, service revenue declined 1.8, similar level to the past two quarters. Contract revenue is broadly stable. Thanks to this family of SuperFlat offers that I will cover later. Data growth keeps being good and the only segment where we have declined is prepay, 12% decline due to the strong competition that we have from discounters, and notably from Aldi.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Germany, EBITDA margin in Germany is up 0.6 percentage points, thanks to the reduction in A&amp;R. Now this reduction in A&amp;R is really linked to two things. We're pushing more SIM-only and we are subsiding less prepaid. Arcor is now the number two player in the market, in the DSL market. And although I have to say competition remains intense and the rate of market growth is declining and we expect to decline due to the fact that penetration has increased.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, what we will do in Germany. We will continue to drive in the contract space with SuperFlat concept. We have just launched as a response to the pressure that we have in the prepaid segment. We have launched a new aggressive CallYa 5/15 prepaid tariff, which is really aimed at regaining ground in the prepaid market against the Aldi's of this world. And of course we continue to integrate Arcor, where we see cost benefits in the network and the services part.</p>
          <p>So in general, we expect German trends to improve later this year, and I would say that while we have to be cautious in the current climate, so far we have seen limited measurable impact from the economic weakness.</p>
          <p>Italy is another positive story. Our revenue is up 8% in Italy, seven of this is really linked to the Tele2 acquisition. So, organic service revenue is up about 1%, 0.9 to be precise. And here we have different trends. First of all, strength in contract, we have pushed contract and business. Growth of revenue is 15%, growth of customer base is 34%.</p>
          <p>We have shifted away from a volume orientation in prepaid to a value orientation. And we have a very, very strong data growth, 37% is at this point the highest in our mature European market, clearly driven by a very strong drive of PC connectivity. Interesting enough, you might remember that Italy was the first market where we have started going on television with consumer propositions in data and this is proving to be the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have now in the market a Tele2 DSL offer and a Vodafone DSL offer and between the combined we have 650,000 DSL customers in the country.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margins in Italy have declined 4.5 percentage points mainly due to the Tele2 acquisition and the remaining 0.8 is really A&amp;R again linked to the driving contract. So Vodafone Italy continues to execute well. We expect further good performance going forward even though as for Germany, we have to be cautious given the GDP forecast for the country that we all read.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to emerging markets. Broad comments about emerging markets. Emerging markets, again, we are displaying robust growth. This is a growth driven by customer additions and so penetration mainly. Emerging market is cash generative, despite the fact that we are investing big amounts in network to support the expansion.</p>
          <p>Update since April, we have got the license in Qatar. We have completed the acquisition in Ghana. We have increased our stake in Polkomtel and last week we announced the purchase of the controlling stake in Vodacom.</p>
          <p>There are two operations that I think is worth focusing a bit of attention, India and Turkey. So I'll go first through India. Now, India is a great market. India is a great market, strong fundamentals, strong fundamentals for voice, great opportunity for data, which clearly is the next big thing in all the emerging markets, and the thing which is to me very important is penetration is still only at 27% as of end of September.</p>
          <p>In the first half our revenue growth has slowed to 41%, essentially due to tariff reductions that have taken place in the market in the first quarter. These tariff reductions have got a higher effect on the second quarter with growth going at 36%. And we are -- we have maintained competitiveness. We now have in the markets where we operate in the historical 16 circles 21% market share and on a nationwide basis we have a 17% market share.</p>
          <p>Bit of explanation on the EBITDA evolution in the market. On the right hand side, you see 5.6 percentage points decline. Here there are three things that explain this decline. The first is the outsourcing of IT to IBM. This is the classic OpEx versus CapEx tradeoff. Overall, we saved money but on the P&amp;L, the impact is 1.3 points.</p>
          <p>The second is the expansion in the seven new circles where we were not before, the so called Spacetel circles, which clearly in the beginning have -- has costs but doesn't have revenues. And this is 1.4 points. And then the remaining 2.9 points are exactly the impact of the price reductions net of the savings that clearly come from the increased scale.</p>
          <p>We have invested 600 million in CapEx in the first half and we expect to invest for the full year over 1 billion. We are permitting an accelerated base station rollout, 2,000 base stations per month, which we think is very important given the competitive context.</p>
          <p>Indus Towers which is now our company, has started operations in July and shortly the shareholders, the partners will contribute the assets to the company.</p>
          <p>So in essence, our focus in India remains growth, penetration in existing and in the new circles. The opportunity in India, I am convinced, remains very large. And it is particularly attractive for players like Vodafone, players who have the scale to support competitive pricing to our customers. We therefore expect absolute level of revenue growth to remain strong despite the pricing pressures.</p>
          <p>The other country that was worth a bit of diving is Turkey. As I said at the outset, Turkey's performance has been disappointing. In the second quarter, our service revenue left hand of the chart have declined 2.1 points year-on-year on an organic basis, and this comes after a 3.7 in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>I could quite frankly mention several external factors that have determined this performance. I could mention the timing of Ramadan, which was not fortunate. The termination rate cuts, the GDP -- the change in GDP forecast, but I don't want to hide behind these factors.</p>
          <p>The performance in Turkey, our performance in Turkey has not been where it should be. We have added 2 million customers in the quarters. But due to the fact that one year ago we had weaker controls in our indirect distribution, we have got a big churn and we are actually negative on net adds.</p>
          <p>It is taking longer to fix the network and also to have a solid distribution platform for a country of 70 million people. So in this context, our EBITDA margin actually slightly improved to 19.6 even after very high taxes that are a characteristic of the market. But clearly, profitability is not the issue for us in Turkey.</p>
          <p>Our priority is now in Turkey to invest, to improve the perception of the network, and to improve our distribution. So that we can deliver more services and better services to the Turkish customers. So how are we addressing it?</p>
          <p>First, we have established a technology roadmap and we have a program, which will in six months bring the network up to the level where Vodafone expects it to be and the customers expect it to be.</p>
          <p>Second, we have a number of initiatives to ensure that we bring to the countries the right commercial offers for the right customers. And third, we are working on both direct and indirect distributions to deepen and make it stronger.</p>
          <p>There is number portability coming, 3G options coming. It is important that we get these three building blocks, the network, the distribution and the commercial offering right in place. This will take time. This will take time, but Turkey is and remains a very attractive market, 70 million people, very young population, all the elements for a positive growth are there. So my conclusion on Turkey is that in Turkey, we know what we have to do, we have done the right things and we are confident that we will get it right.</p>
          <p>I am at the end of my operational review, let me summarize in simple words, what our operational imperatives are.</p>
          <p>I would say our operational imperatives are fairly straight forward, improve our market position in Spain and the UK, complete the turnaround in Turkey and continue to perform well in Germany, in Italy, in India and, of course, also in all the other markets.</p>
          <p>In order to do this, we have commercial plans in place, where we need we have technology plan. And I have to say, we have also strengthened the management of these operations. First of all, by focusing the regions on a smaller number of countries and by rotating leadership skills to suit the diverse needs of the market. And I think that shortly we will also announce the appointment of a Turkish CEO to strengthen the local team.</p>
          <p>So now I have to run through the revised strategy. Before getting to the strategy, I would like to spend few seconds to share with you my personal perception of our telecommunication industry. Seen from my perspective, which is the perspective of somebody who comes from the personal mobile angle of the industry.</p>
          <p>I would say that in the context of turbulent times, we should not forget that we operate in an industry which continues to be able to generate strong and consistent cash flow. Basically, on delivering very compelling services that serve a fundamental human need, and this is to me is the crucial point. Now, somebody believes that voice is increasingly mature in developed markets. But there is the data opportunity. The data opportunity or data revenue growth is strong, is stronger in mature market and will be strong in emerging market.</p>
          <p>And I truly and strongly believe that as we all can see, if we walk into a shop or if we walk into a train, that ubiquitous connectivity is basically a one way road. Once you start using it, you just cannot give it up. And for sure -- and I am very confident nobody will give it up just for saving the cost of a couple of drinks in a month. And this is what I really strongly believe, it's a one way road and the cost of -- and the benefit of this ubiquitous connectivity compared to the costs, are incredibly compelling.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in the emerging economies, mobile connectivity will be the main or in some cases the only way to access the internet to have a communication platform for work and for personal living.</p>
          <p>And even if growth does not show up maybe for periods due to general conditions, the mobile side of the industry has flexibility in managing the cost base. If you take CapEx, perhaps half of CapEx are pure maintenance, are fixed CapEx, and the remaining part are driven by volumes or by development.</p>
          <p>And if you look at OpEx and I will elaborate further in my presentation, if you look at OpEx 35% are truly fixed. So we individually have levers and collectively if you let me use a simple expression, we have some taps collective as an industry that we can open or close depending on development and depending on the economic phase.</p>
          <p>I do believe that we operate in an attractive industry. And I do believe that this is an industry with economies of scale serving essential services with flexibility on the cost base. So where does Vodafone stand in this industry? I think Vodafone has some very distinctive attributes, which put us at the center stage in this industry.</p>
          <p>And quickly going through them, we have demonstrated that we have a strong cash flow performance. We have a diverse portfolio of assets in mature and emerging markets, and most other places we are either number one or number two.</p>
          <p>We have been pioneers in the data world, both at the network end, 3G, HSDPA and at the service end with all the initiatives that we have done. We have a strong brand in consumer space, but this strong brand is becoming stronger and stronger and more credible also in the enterprise and business space. And finally, we have demonstrated that we have advantages of scales on infrastructure and on purchasing.</p>
          <p>So, my view of the industry balancing the right and the left hand side of this slide is that, this is an attractive industry, which provides essential services with a very, very compelling way and a compelling -- serving a compelling -- in a compelling way a very basic human need.</p>
          <p>And Vodafone on the other hand is very well positioned, because on all the key elements on this industry we have demonstrated that we have some strength. So, we can make a good investment case, if we execute efficiently. So, execution will be a word that you will hear from now on quite a bit of time.</p>
          <p>The new strategy had to reflect these things, had to reflect the new economic environment, our strength and what we believe is the future of our sector. So the departing point for our strategy was the May '06 strategy. The May '06 strategy has served us well and I don't need to go in great detail into all things.</p>
          <p>We have -- we were starting from high prices and low volumes. We have reduced price by 17%, increased volume by 21. We have declared cost targets, which we have delivered. The flat OpEx or the 10% capital target, which somebody said was unachievable in those days, but eventually I think we are at 8.4, as I said.</p>
          <p>We have increased our emerging market exposure through the exciting -- I would call it exciting addition of India and the promising addition recently of Vodacom. And we have moved into total communication, having today a business, which on an annualized basis worth 2.8 billion in mobile data, and having DSL capabilities everywhere.</p>
          <p>We have sold 3 billion of non-core assets. We have grown dividend, made sizeable capital returns to the shareholders. And in the process, we have retained the single A Rating, which in these days seems to me fairly relevant.</p>
          <p>So how has the environment changed in this period? Now the environment clearly has changed. The evident thing is that prospects for economic growth have changed. There have been issues with inflation raising in emerging markets, maybe a bit less now, but still there with energy concerns, especially where we depend on diesel or where people depend on basic food for a large part of their spending.</p>
          <p>Competition remains, I would say, strong, double-digit price declines are expected and the norm, and these offset growth in usage. We have discussed with many of you the concept of elasticity and how much elasticity can -- how much price declines can be balanced by volumes. The concept has been proven difficult, difficult to measure and also difficult to demonstrate.</p>
          <p>There is more converged offerings and when I say converged offerings, I don't just say fixed mobile offerings, but also platforms like the iPhone or Android, which give multi-platform access to the same services. And resellers and discounts have a bigger role in the industry.</p>
          <p>And finally regulation. Regulation keeps having an important role not just in defining the mobile space, but also defining the way we interact with -- in the DSL broadband space with large incumbents. So we had to review the strategy to reflect the new market conditions and to reflect what we thought was the right thing for Vodafone.</p>
          <p>Our November '08 strategy can be illustrated in a fairly simple way, with one target and four pillars. The one target is really focusing the whole of Vodafone on driving free cash flow generation and execution focus -- and a strong execution focus.</p>
          <p>In order to do this, we must drive four things. First, strong operational performance both at the revenue level and at the cost level. Second, pursue the existing, the already existing today growth opportunities that we see in our communication space, mobile data, enterprise and broadband.</p>
          <p>Third, we need to deliver appropriate returns from our existing emerging market assets as a priority and look at expansion opportunity, if and when they arise cautiously and selectively.</p>
          <p>And finally, we need to reward our shareholders and be disciplined on how we use their money. And I will start describing the first element of driving the operational performance which is value enhancement.</p>
          <p>As I said, the May '06 strategy had revenue stimulation as a key pillar, which really was driving -- about driving voice usage through price reduction. However, price per minute falls continue to erode margins and they are not compensated by enough elasticity. And this is clearly indicated in the left -- in the left hand of the graph, which correlates outgoing price and the outgoing usage.</p>
          <p>We also need to address the remorseless rise in customer investments that has been the main driver of margin erosion in the recent years. This of course, will always be influenced by market factors, but it's critical that we get smarter and more focused on our investment and our subsidies.</p>
          <p>We have to optimize the value of relationship. This means moving away from per minute pricing and having lower prices as a result of loading our offers with more value minutes or megabytes or whatever is going to be the measure.</p>
          <p>Extending such offers across the communities, family members or company employees, allocating better our commercial investment and rewarding longer relationships for the customers. One of the way that we call it -- we call it much more for more. More people in the family, more services you get much more.</p>
          <p>From a price perspective this means that Vodafone wants to be always price competitive in the high-end and in the medium-end of the customers. And we should not be afraid of lowering our prices, as long as we achieve three things; we load our infrastructures more, we balance our commercial cost, and we improve the lifetime and therefore the scope of our relationship with the customers.</p>
          <p>We have the network capacity to do this, and this is consistent with any industry where scale does matter. So you probably will say, fine, good theory, how does it work in practice or does it work in practice by the way. And let me give you a German example where, in Germany we have developed the SuperFlat concept that I illustrated in the beginning. This is a head of household type of tariff where as I said you add bolt-ons, more services or more family members and you get better conditions.</p>
          <p>As the graph shows with the blue bars, we are getting more revenues for more usage and much more compared to the existing entry tariffs. Now what the graph does not show is the commercial investment, which is related to that which of course is commercially sensitive.</p>
          <p>But I can tell you, it is much better for us as well. So this is a tariff, which is better for the customers, but is also better for Vodafone. And you can expect to see more, not exactly this in every market, but more of this philosophy around.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the second element of operational success, we need to work on cost. Let me start with a bit of a description since there has been some speculation on our ability to work on cost, on our -- a small description of our cost base. If you take the &#xA3;27.4 billion of cash cost that we had last year putting together OpEx and CapEx. The reading horizontally, the weight is 30% direct cost, which mainly is interconnect, 34% customer related including A&amp;R, 17% technology IT G&amp;A operations and 19% CapEx.</p>
          <p>If you look instead vertically, what drives this cost, you will see that a quarter of these costs are generically usage or volume driven, 41% are market related and 35 are fixed.</p>
          <p>Now, let me cover first the market related. I already said the market related costs are or have been responsible for the margin erosion of our industry recently. And as I said, we have to acknowledge that market conditions and being competitive clearly influence a large part of our decisions to have commercial cost. But we also have to acknowledge that it is too easy to accept that this is outside our control. And we become passive in this area. So value enhancement as I described before is essentially -- is an essential part to addressing these costs and remaining competitive at the same time.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the fixed cost, so what is strictly under our control. Now, here are some cost programs that we have in the Company, as you can see these cover all areas, technology, logistics, everything the general administration support functions.</p>
          <p>The concept here is to really drive down cost and achieve regional scale with a goal to save &#xA3;1 billion by year '10-11 relative to '07-08 number, and use these savings to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we have in our business to fund some of the growth opportunities, and of course to offset the revenue pressure. Now, the overall effect on our cost structure of the initiatives would be the following.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we really want to ensure that operating costs remain broadly stable from last year to '10-11, and many of the programs will also have an impact on CapEx. The 10% CapEx that we had in the past is confirmed. As I said before, 5% is basically maintenance, about 20, 25% is volume related and a part of it is expansion.</p>
          <p>We think that we can maintain that target, and by the way if you look at Germany last year, which is a place where we have a big presence and converged operations. If you put together Arcor and Vodafone we already last year were at 10%. So we think it's doable.</p>
          <p>Different approach for emerging markets, now here the opportunity for growth is there. So here the target is not to reduce cost or to keep cost flat, the target is to have cost growth lower than revenue growth.</p>
          <p>And of course, we have to put more CapEx, Andy has shown before, 21% of revenues. But we don't see any reason why long-term mature -- these markets when they mature should not go -- trend towards the 10% number.</p>
          <p>So this is our approach on cost, I now want to address the growth opportunity. Now, the growth opportunities have been really and strongly prioritized based on where we think Vodafone has advantages. And we do think as I said before that our advantages are in network scale, in brand and in customer base and customer assets.</p>
          <p>First, mobile data. Now mobile data, we already have delivered. We have &#xA3;2.8 billion, best-in-class products and networks. I believe that there is a great opportunity in Europe. In Europe, we have doubled from 4 to 8% the data subscriptions in our base in one year.</p>
          <p>If you look at the left hand side of the graph, you see penetration of mobile PC connectivity devices plus 84%, if you look at handheld business devices, plus 96%. What does this mean? This means that more and more people walk around with data enabled device in their pockets or in wherever they keep them.</p>
          <p>And more and more people, as much as it happened with voice and with text, six, seven, eight years ago, are getting accustomed more and more to use these devices.</p>
          <p>I really think that this is an important opportunity for us. How we will drive this opportunity? I would say, first of all focusing on devices. It's important that we have the best. We are working on Netbooks. In these days in the UK I think the Dell Netbook is selling 2,000 per week. We are working on USB keys or dongles. We are working on phones and clearly there is a huge work of segmentation and development that will take place.</p>
          <p>We have demonstrated, UK is an example, Italy is another one, that we can be creative and aggressive with pricing schemes and we have to do it, because the more you get into deeper and deeper segments of the society, the more you need to segment your pricing.</p>
          <p>And we have reorganized our competencies and our efforts in the IP services space, both in consumer and in business through Vodafone business services and Vodafone Internet services, which are our two units who are in charge of developing IP based services for our customers linking our building, our CRM, our data bases into the customer experience.</p>
          <p>Second opportunity, enterprise. In enterprise, this is another area where we have done well. We have a &#xA3;7 billion business here. We took a disproportionate share of mobile data growth and this demonstrates I think the credibility of the Vodafone brand in this space. The pies on this chart represent an estimate of the &#xA3;175 billion market that enterprise have. Where you see the green part, is the mobile part, is a relatively small part.</p>
          <p>Now here on the left hand, we have done pretty well in the corporate segment. We established in 2006 Vodafone Global Enterprise. Now is growing still 8%, very strong position in large multinationals, and with a deepening value, deepening cooperation with Verizon, which is adding a lot of value here.</p>
          <p>What is the next step is working on SMEs and -- sorry, first of all, of course the first step is to continue to work well on multinationals and continue to leverage on that. But the second thing is to now extend our services into SOHOs and SMEs. And this is what Vodafone Business Services is about. It's a local operation. So we will operate locally. We will leverage on our business divisions that we have created in all the markets where we operate. And we will clearly leverage on our assets, strong sales force, trusted brand and share services and products especially in the IP space where this is today possible.</p>
          <p>Third opportunity fixed broadband. Now fixed broadband, in several markets fixed broadband is becoming an increasingly important part of our communication <mark type="audio gap" /> particularly for enterprise and for high value customers. We believe that we can generate incremental value by selling broadband into our mobile customers and also by attracting new customers to the shops as is happening these days in Germany where as I said we are now the second provider in the country.</p>
          <p>We have network, we have distribution and we have scale to work on DSL. In some countries we have decided to own DSL broadband assets, but we are technology agnostic. Our choice is and will always be to invest based on three criteria, basically, geo-density -- local geo-density, local pricing level and local regulation. So we will pursue this opportunity where this makes sense financially and where we have the right assets. Our approach to broadband here is and will be a market-by-market approach.</p>
          <p>Now turning to emerging markets. I already said that we will be shifting our focus from expanding to prioritizing execution in emerging markets. Why do we think -- why do I think that this is appropriate, I mean, this chart illustrates why. And the easy answer here is because we are in the right places, because we are in India and India is an incredible growth opportunity, because through Vodacom and though our initiatives we are in the Middle East and Africa. We are exposed to China through China Mobile. We are exposed to the US through Verizon Wireless. We are not in Latin America. But basically this chart says Vodafone is where it should be.</p>
          <p>If you think about the seven Spacetel circle of India, we call them circles which is a bit of a funny name, but in reality here we are talking about 300 million people. So Vodafone is adding coverage of 300 million people. The GDP clearly and the GDP per capita is different than a mature market, but this is the scale of development in India.</p>
          <p>Therefore, my primary focus in emerging market will be to ensure that we execute on our business well. And in order to do this we have reorganized &#x2013; you have noticed, we have reorganized as I said our EMAPA operation into smaller regions with greater focus on fewer markets each.</p>
          <p>Growth in this market, as I said, will remain strong, but we have the mobile data opportunity. If you look at Vodacom, what Vodacom in South Africa have achieved by becoming the first provider of broadband across all technologies through mobile, through mobile platform. This gives you the idea of the potential. And the important thing, the important success factor here will be the ability to bring lower cost devices to these markets.</p>
          <p>When I go to India, when I go to Kenya, when I go to South Africa the one thing that they ask is of course penetration and coverage, because that's essential. But the next thing is when are you going to bring me a low cost data enabled device? So we are convinced that this is going to be an important thing executing and as a priority executing in these markets.</p>
          <p>Talking about expansion, we have criteria to screen the opportunities. These are the classic criteria you would think off. And of course we have M&amp;A financial criteria that are in place to look at specific opportunities. We have identified only a small number of large markets of significant size and this could be explored in the future, selectively and cautiously.</p>
          <p>In the markets where we are not present and where we don't want to put equity, we have the partner market operation, which is we think a very effective way of bringing our services to a market and giving to our customers access at good condition to that market without committing equity. And the MTS deal, which is a huge deal that we announced two weeks ago, is I think the best example of that. So, in summary approach to emerging market is focused first on execution and then cautiously and selectively on expansion.</p>
          <p> Fourth element of our strategy is capital discipline. We will be about cash flow generation one question, which is logically is, what are you going to do with the cash? Now first of course is profitably investment in our existing business. This means supporting our businesses. This means going after the three growth opportunities that I have illustrated. And of course there is the spectrum where we -- our position is that while we are comfortable with the spectrum allocation that we have, we might in a country-by-country -- on a country-by-country basis look at specific opportunities.</p>
          <p>The second priority is to clearly enhance returns to our shareholders, primarily by the way of dividends and then we have M&amp;A. First, I would like to say that within existing markets I see consolidation as a positive for the industry. And I would support in-market consolidation, active or passive as a concept. The synergies that we are looking or we are seeing in the Alltel case within Verizon are clearly indicating that in-market consolidation creates value for shareholders. There are also other examples that we are seeing and in our own world even integrating Arcor and Vodafone is creating synergies. So our position on consolidation is that we support.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets, I covered before, and this leaves with portfolio management. Now on portfolio management, we review every controlled asset in the Vodafone portfolio, and the check is does the asset return the local cost of capital, and is the asset worth more to somebody else? And if the answer to this question requires it, we will -- we have to take and we will take the appropriate actions.</p>
          <p>We also have few non-controlled assets; Verizon Wireless is the first, still delivering double-digit revenue growth in the process of completing, as I said, a major value creating acquisition Alltel.</p>
          <p>We recently have deepened the cooperation with Verizon Wireless in areas like technology, devices with the Storm that you can try outside, and on global accounts. The Board reviews Verizon Wireless regularly. And we remain open minded as to how to maximize the value to our shareholders, taking into account the complex and tax efficient structure that we have. So, we are today convinced that our current position is the best for Vodafone.</p>
          <p>We have a good partnership and a strong operational cooperation with SFR as well, supported by a good shareholder agreement, and most importantly by a very aligned strategy.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have an important investment in China Mobile. Now China Mobile, I don't need to tell you is the number one player in a growing market, enjoying large scale advantage. And here again we have a good partnership, very important cooperation on the healthy development.</p>
          <p>But more recent and I think very promising, we are extending the cooperation to services through the joint venture that we have with China Mobile and SoftBank. Our investment provides exposure to a leading player in a fast growing market. So in conclusion the Board continues to review our position in this company regularly.</p>
          <p>In summary, if I had to say what I would like you to take away from today, I would like you to have a clear idea of what my management and myself will spend our time on and what are our priorities. And our priorities are put here in a chart. We will work on strengthening our businesses everywhere and of course most importantly where we underperform, focusing our management on value, and making sure that we implement the 1 billion cost program.</p>
          <p>We will work hard to improve contribution from data, enterprise and develop broadband as part of the changing profile of Vodafone, focus on delivery in emerging markets and look at expansion cautiously and selectively, and of course maintain clear priorities for surplus capital. Our ambition is to confirm, or to sustain the free cash flow generation in the 5 to 6 billion range, which has been for last year and is for the guidance for this year.</p>
          <p>And I would like to ask you to let me conclude with my personal ambition, personal of Vittorio Colao, my ambition is to lead Vodafone in an industry that I do believe is still attractive, and to fully exploit during my tenure Vodafone's strong advantages on brand, on scale and on commercial assets; and in my mind to lead a company, which is simpler, much faster and a winning player in a very exciting industry.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and I would like to ask Andy to join me for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes. Can I ask you please to introduce yourself for the people in the webcast? Laura [Laura Janssens, UBS]?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Can I ask four, if that's okay? First of all, on the dividend, 3% growth that you've announced for the interim, should we think of that as a good proxy for what you mean by progressive in the medium term or could it be a little bit more conservative given the current market uncertainties?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the release you mentioned that you'd support in-market consolidation, there could be opportunities in your two weaker markets in Europe which are the UK and Spain, T-Mobile and Yoigo, I was thinking about. Without being specific are these the kind of opportunities that you could have in mind?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, I'm trying to think about how to think about your CapEx flexibility going forward and I guess the easiest way to ask this is would you have reduced your CapEx guidance for fiscal '09 if your operating profit guidance wasn't coming down?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on the debt, given how much Forex is moving, I was wondering if you could update us on the structure of your debt? I thought it was all swapped into euros, but I noticed there was a dollar impact in the presentation, so if we could just have an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the first two and then I call on with Steve Pusey, CTO, sitting here the CapEx question and then I will leave the debt for Andy. So Laura on dividends, I think that we have a -- first of all, let's see where we start from. We have a good track record of dividend growth. We have increased dividend significantly over the past years. We have a fairly relevant payout as a percentage of cash. Our updated dividend policy wants to give certainty to shareholders, the 60% of earnings was clearly subject to fluctuations. In this way, we think that basically saying that we will rise smoothly over time, we give certainty about what we want to do. The 3.2% has come out of the Board. The Board has considered a number of factors and we consider that we are at the right level of growth at this time. So it's a consideration of many factors not a specific factor and as you can imagine, there's the underlying performance, there's the external market, there's credit, there's plenty of considerations. The important thing is that we wanted to give certainty to our shareholders that we are committed to have rising dividends.</p>
          <p>On in-market consolidation, I would not make a specific comment about markets. I am sure you do not expect me to make specific comments or specific things. But what we wanted to signal is that we are evolving our position. We always have said that we want to be passive beneficiary of consolidation, which is -- could still be the case by the way, because it's not a bad thing to be a passive beneficiary, but clearly we see consolidation and the values that can be created in consolidations as very important now. And therefore, we are open-minded at considering active or passive and it's going to be a market-by-market thing. So it's very difficult to give an answer concerning any specific market.</p>
          <p>On CapEx, I might ask Steve maybe to say a few words but our position is we don't think we need to cut CapEx. As I said half of the CapEx are basically needed to keep the business going and then the rest is either volume driven or new development. We see that we have been investing at the right level. We come out winners in the quality of our data experience in almost every country. We have 37% growth in Italy, 30% growth in the UK, 20 -- 4 5% growth in the other market. Our customers are very happy with the level of services we are giving them. And we still have plenty of space in terms of capacity, maybe I don't want to go into difficult territory for me, but the total capacity of our network is much more than what we're using today. I think we are at 30%, Steve, probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Steve Pusey, hi Laura. I think that Vittorio is absolutely spot on, our capital intensity reflects our need. We are very happy with our position with service and the growth, particularly driven by data across our European footprint, as well as of course inclusive of our investments in DSL which are within those figures. So we are comfortable with our position. We've got excellent customer service against that. We're at about 32% overall capacity in our networks, of course, that's the European average which gives us plenty of room for growth, of course, we are always addressing the hotspots where we find our data traffic and that's certainly a position we are comfortable with.</p>

          <p>Steve, can we pass to Andy for one minute and 35 seconds answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A one minute and 35 second answer to our debt profile position, okay, I'll have a go at that one. What we are endeavoring to do is to make sure that we have got the funding for the various parts of the Group broadly aligned with the long-term cash flows. Obviously, only a small proportion of the Group at the moment is sterling denominated and therefore, we have a mix of currencies around on other fronts. At this point in time, we're probably around 70% euro funded, about 30% US dollar funded, 10% in multiple other currencies and that all adds up to about 110%. So there is about 10% held in cash in the UK so that we can pay dividends and other things in the UK. So part of it is dollar denominated, that has been a big advantage in terms of getting the lower interest cost during the period. It's equally meant that at the end of the year with the FX conversion that that has put the overall debt level for the Group up a little bit. So that's broadly the profile and I've talked far too fast, so I've run out of time.</p>

          <p>Robin Bienenstock from Sanford Bernstein. You've talked lot about enterprise revenue growth, I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about enterprise margin evolution?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, shall we just wait for giving my answer after the two minutes that I would like to ask you to observe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. So answer on enterprise customers and the profitability of enterprise customers, I think, again, you never want to categorize, but you can see enterprise customers really divided into two categories. There is very profitable, mostly local or at least not very big customers where profitability is pretty good. The issue is to be there, to be local and to be able to provide simple solution. The idea behind that is these are companies that don't have a CIO, don't have a strong expertise in total telecom, typically have not been served very well by an incumbent, because these are almost captive type of environments. And we are proving that we are stronger and stronger thanks to our local presence. These are our mobile customers of today. And they have stronger and stronger needs.</p>
          <p>There is another set of companies, which can be very appealing, because they are large, they are very big and for serving those customers, the important thing is to keep the cost to serve under control, because in percentage terms, they can have much smaller numbers. Now, the number -- the revenue deal might seem very big, but the cost to serve can push down the profitability a lot. So we have been very disciplined in approaching the latter type of companies. The Vodafone Global Enterprise operation is very focused on providing few services in a very, very competitive way, but in a very disciplined way also from a cost point of view. While, now we want to expand more in the SOHO/SME place, where the cost to serve element is less relevant, because we already have in place the sales networks, and if the product simplicity and the product ease of use, which is essential.</p>
          <p>The evolution of our networks, the all-IP, IMS based network that we are doing in Europe, will enable the development of products ideally one-time in a single place and then the deployment in many places, so it's very different level of profitabilities those two segments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you a follow-up question just on Germany and your example of SuperFlat, the SuperFlat tariff. You talk about a decline in price elasticity across Europe and then you talk about revenue enhancement from tariffs like this SuperFlat tariff. But Germany as far as I can tell is the only market in Europe where in fact you're seeing price elasticity that is greater than one with very, very deep price discounts. So, are you saying from this that actually you're moving towards larger flatter bundles across Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What we're really saying -- I am not sure that in Germany you can say that over time price elasticity has been stable above one. I wish I could be able to say --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm not saying that. What I am saying though is that if I look at the collection of bills that we have from customers for 2007,  the only place where we saw price elasticity greater than one on a constant basis was in Germany on companies that made discounts of greater than 25, 30%. That's looking at specific customer bills for 2007, obviously we didn't see so much that in your...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at years and years of things, but the point is the following. What we need to balance is really four elements. It's not just price and volumes, but we need to balance price, volumes, commercial cost and lifetime value of the customers. These are the four things that matter. You can have a situation of a negative price elasticity and a loss of margin, but still you can make a good case by working on the other two things. So the approach that we are taking now, and Germany was just one example, is an approach of balancing the overall economics of the account.</p>
          <p>Going back to your point on enterprise, in enterprise it's almost more natural to do it, because you look at specific deals, and what you find out is that while in some cases people might think, well, this is a very low price for a company. The lifetime value of the contract is much better because the other elements of the equation work better. So this is the type of philosophy that we are introducing in the consumer space. It will require a lot of work because it's a lot of segmentation and it's a lot of systems behind it. But we are getting there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Paul Howard at Cazenove. Couple of questions just about Europe, you paint a picture of Europe, where you can keep operating costs stable but the top line is still declining. Do you see stabilization anytime in the foreseeable future on that front? And in terms of scale in Europe, you say scale is important. Why limit yourself to certain customer segments? Why not adopt more aggressive strategy to keep that scale above your competitors in Europe? And then finally, with that in mind in country consolidation, I guess you wouldn't rollout exiting certain European markets on the same basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me Paul start with the revenue stabilization. I don't think I want to make a multi-year forecast. What I see is that in certain markets prices have come down quite a bit and usage has gone up. In other markets prices are still high. We will need, as I said in my previous answers to make sure that we maximize whatever we can take in each market depending on the level. And the result of this stabilization, I mean, if you ask me long-term of course when prices will be down at the Indian or the American level, I can see a better revenue profile, but we are not there yet. So it's going to be, it's going to take time.</p>
          <p>Scale, I am not sure where we -- you have got the impression that we don't want to get scale. The answer is that, yes, we want to get scale, but we want to get scale in profitable segments of the market. I mean Europe is now fully penetrated, more than fully penetrated. There is the data opportunity which is good because if you look at the penetration of data is still pretty small. But especially considering the cost of the data devices not all segments will be as profitable as the best ones. So we need to be focused and selective on getting scale. So scale is an objective, but we need to achieve scale where scale is profitable.</p>
          <p>In-country consolidation is good. Yes, as I said, I wouldn't make comments about specific countries, but the Board, our Board has to review all businesses on a regular basis. So if a business as I said is either underperforming or somebody believes that the business can be worth significantly more to them, I think the Board is open-minded to look at everything. Yes let me change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the data opportunity -- Alan Burkitt-Gray from Global Telecoms Business Magazine. The data opportunity also means an appetite for faster and faster data. We have seen Telstra in Australia the other day announcing a huge increase in its target bandwidth for its HSPA (sic) [HSDPA] service. Do you see that you are going to be doing that forced into increased capital expenditure to satisfy this demand for broader and broader -- faster and faster broadband and what is your judgment on faster HSPA (sic) [HSDPA] versus longer term strategies like LTE and what -- when do you see commercial LTE emerging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me say that Vodafone has always been in front of the pack in the data space. We have been among the first to introduce HSDPA. We have been among the first to upgrade to 3.6, now we are bringing 7.2. In one of the previous conferences meetings, I think we said that 7.2 was a hotspot type of thing. Now it's becoming more and more of a normal thing that we put into dense places, I think the coverage is 12, 15% now. So we are going up and up. We are looking at the next level. So now 7.2 is being deployed, but we are already looking at what is called 14.4 which really is 10, I think, and then we are already thinking -- I'm sure in Steve's department there's people thinking about the 28.8. So there is plenty of room to go with HSDPA. Therefore, it is already part of our CapEx. I mean, it's already part of what we do. And we are very convinced that mobile data is a compelling experience and it's a very important experience. We are there.</p>
          <p>Now LTE, LTE is an evolution we have not yet committed. We are part of the trials with China Mobile and Verizon Wireless. We look with interest and at LTE, LTE will bring another level. We are talking about depending whether it's on 10 or on 20, you can talk about 50 meg -- or 50 mega bit per second or even more. We will keep looking, but for the time being we have a good platform, HSDPA, there are several steps that we can make. Yeah, and then we'll...</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Robert Grindle from Deutsche Bank. Will the activation of Indus Towers where you contribute your assets still be a free cash flow, neutral event or will there be a benefit coming through there? And why is it taking so long in Turkey to fix what previously was a very under underinvested asset. I think it was a turnkey project. Why is it so complicated? And lastly, can we expect management remuneration to more closely track your new focus on free cash flow rather than the mix of top line and other metrics you've had in the past. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me take your questions in reverse order, starting from the easy one. Management remuneration is and will be more linked to free cash flow, ours is already there and we will move the whole company more towards that, so easy answer.</p>
          <p>Second, a fairly easy answer, why is it taking so long in Turkey? Quite frankly, we had underestimated the complexity of -- or the state of this network situation. I mean, honestly we have started we thought that going quickly with &#x2013; we did also a pretty good deal with Motorola. But we both underestimated, us and Motorola. And now we are running. So, the network element of the thing, I think, has been very important. The brand has been taken fantastically in Turkey. The switch to Vodafone brand has been good. If anything, we have not been up to the expectation. And now we want to be there and we are doing the right things.</p>
          <p>Indus is a special case because Indus is clearly a -- an infrastructure company. So the profile of cash flow of Indus will be different, you need -- it's a company, which of course will create value for shareholders by multi-tenant agreement on the towers. And therefore you need to put the CapEx in earlier. We will be working on how to crystallize and monetize the value that is being created. But it is a slightly different cash flow profile. Will, I think you had a question, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Will Draper at Execution. I want just to ask a few things on India. Firstly, with the entry of Telenor and the toughening of market conditions there, how do you feel about that medium-term guidance that was given out for 25% market share and 35% or mid 30s EBITDA margin? Is it time perhaps to have a think about that? Secondly, what are you expecting for 3G auction costs and the timing? I think that's coming imminently. Thirdly, is India a market where you would consider in-market consolidation to be an attractive option given the extremely competitive nature of the market and the large number of players? And then lastly, is it a market putting it the other way that you consider exiting at some point to generate funds for further investment elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, how do we feel about Telenor getting into the market? I mean there is plenty of competitors there. So, we feel like it's going to be a one more competitor. We are still pretty confident that what we have been doing, which essentially if you look at it is really two things. We are pushing ahead with CapEx and with rollout. So 2,000 hours per month, getting into space still, getting another 300 million people potentially covered and accelerating the rollout, on one hand, and on the other hand becoming more aggressive with prices is the right strategy exactly for the reasons that you are indicating. New people are coming, you rollout faster, you lower the prices, you create and built market share and then we see.</p>
          <p>On guidance, we are not changing our views. We still believe that if you take out the one-off effect and the other things, this could be a 30 plus profitability market. On 3G auctions they are coming in early '09. But I cannot really make any comment about expected values or any intention for reasons that I am sure you understand.</p>
          <p>In market consolidation in India, will it happen? Yes, it will happen. I think it's not now. I mean this is the phase of build out. This is the phase of penetration. This is the phase where you need to bring the market from 27% penetration to whatever it's going to be, and there's a number of years for that to happen. And then things will happen. Now recently, they just made active network sharing a possible -- possibility in India, which could actually change a bit the dynamics of these new players in different ways. So if you ask me long-term, too many play -- very long-term too many players in India? Probably, yes. But there is something in between in my view. Exiting India? I honestly don't think why we should talk about this today.</p>
          <p>Yeah. One more question here and then we need to move here Terry and then back to Justin. Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah. It's Darren Ward at Liberum Capital. My question is about SIM-only contracts. You seem to be quite a fan of it. It seems to be the perfect business response to a recession. Can you tell us what's been happening to the percentage of gross adds in Europe coming from SIM-only for you? And I've been talking to some of your competitors recently, they seem to have a limited appetite for it. Do you think you could try to lead the industry in that direction a bit? And what do you think could happen to the -- your proportion of gross adds coming from SIM-only contracts going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I -- as everything in life or in business life, I am not for dogma, I am for practical things. The practical thing is that if you look -- if you walk into a UK shop in these days, people come in and they say, 'I would like to have a better tariff, I would like to spend less and maybe if I renew my handset six months later is fine'. So this is what I hear. So SIM-only and special conditions for non-hardware based contracts I think is a smart response to customer needs, and is consistent with the concept of leveraging the scale of what we have, which is the network and giving the customers what they ask for.</p>
          <p>Is this a dogmatic approach? Absolutely, not, I mean we will as always have customers who will want to have a new device, whom we want to attract, by the way, on our own new devices like the Storm that you have outside here. So the answer is SIM-only is going up, is going up significantly, I don't know if Andy you have the exact percentage but it has gone up significantly. I see that several of our competitors are going in that direction. Some less convinced than us, but that's fine. I mean it reflects the different nature of different customer bases. But I would not make it as Vodafone wants to be a SIM-only company, we don't. We are so big and we have so many segments of customers that we need to give to every segment what that segment is asking for. So it's one of the many ways of addressing this phase.</p>
          <p>Just for geographical balance, Terry?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Terry Sinclair from Citi. Can I first ask given that you've got fast data growth but material voice in Europe, how that plays into your appetite for more European spectrum? Is it getting more muted or more vigorous as data grows? And secondly a couple of questions for Andy, how should we think about the optimum leverage of the company? Given that you've got a 70% fixed rate bias at the moment in an environment where interest rates are now coming down, how quickly could you move into a more flexible arrangement if you wanted to? And perhaps in light of that, the very low tax rate you scored in the first half, will that last longer than the second half?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the answer on spectrum is easy. In general, we are comfortable with the spectrum allocations that we have and there are some moving elements. However, we will look at a country-by-country basis, because we all know that spectrum over time is always valuable. So at, I would say reasonable levels, we might decide in some countries to get some, but as I said we are not starved for spectrum. Andy?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so your two &#x2013; well let's take your last one first, the simple answer is, yes, we do expect that to last beyond the current year. I think the new structures we've got in place and the new tax rates in some of those countries we can reasonably expect now to be there for the medium-term, so not just a one-off blip.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage and interest rates, I mean overall debt levels, I think we are in a fine space and in the present environment and comfortable where we are at. We look pretty carefully in terms of interest rate, the amount we fix with the amount we leave floating at rates of interest compared with historical trends and every quarter as we go through that we will form views on it. So, each quarter we will be deciding whether we're going to fix board again for another period or not. And you're quite right, and in a period of declining interest rates then we may well change that mix as we go forwards, but I think it's put us in good stead over the last few years that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Justin Funnell at Credit Suisse. I think many shareholders will welcome the strategic changes on portfolio that you're talking about today. I guess the debate will move quickly on into how fast. It's not exactly a seller's market right now. Arguably, waiting this long to sell assets is not ideal timing. So should we be looking at this as a medium-term objective? Or do you see offers on the table right here, right now that you can look at?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the cost cutting target, is it perhaps a bit conservative? Your own operating costs depending on your definition you're using were broadly flat in Europe in the first half. We're presuming there's an acceleration of cost cutting efforts going forward with the appointment of Michel Combes. So is that a beatable target you've given us today on the keeping operating costs flat? Or in fact, is it actually a embedded fair issue of revenues in that number?</p>
          <p>And then just finally coming back to spectrum, obviously you're increasingly caveating your free cash flow guidance excluding spectrum. There's some big spectrum decisions coming up I guess, not just Europe, not just India, but Turkey. Can you give us a ballpark number, what should we be expecting to spend on spectrum over the next few years, just to avoid us being surprised later on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the -- if I understood correctly your first question is how fast would you consider selling assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I would really -- I will really give you the simple answer. The simple answer is, first, we should be convinced that some assets are not performing and don't fit the strategy. And second we should have somebody who is interested. So it's a very classic process that requires reviewing our assets, reviewing our plans, and if something is not there, as I said we are open minded, and we will look at it. But I cannot comment on specific things, because it would be clearly odd to do it without having gone through the processes.</p>
          <p>On cost targets, I would resist a bit the concept that Michel has been asked to join the company just to cut costs. This is a concept that has been floating around in the financial community and I -- while of course I expect him to work on that, there is a bit more to do than just cutting costs in Europe. Cost reduction is important, as I said because we have to face where we are. We have programs and the programs that we have described today and the number we gave today are things that we are comfortable we can execute. And please keep in mind this does not cover the commercial cost, because we did not think it would have been neither a wise nor a particularly serious thing to say we're going to cut commercial costs, because those are to some extent determined by the market conditions. So the answer is we have to work on what we control strictly and make sure that we maximize the commercial value of what we offer at the other end.</p>
          <p>On spectrum, I can pass the question to Andy, but I refrain again from expressing a number. We -- as I said we don't need desperately spectrum and therefore we'll approach these options with a very disciplined financial case in mind. For sure we need and we want to have the necessary raw material for our services, which is spectrum. But today we have in most places, not everywhere, but in most places we have what we need. Shall we move, Nick and then Andrew?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to pick up on that point about capital allocation, obviously it's good to see change we can believe in from Vodafone in terms of the capital allocation policy in shifting from expansion to execution. But I guess one question is what the price of any change in policy is going to be? Because it's not necessarily the choice of buying or not buying that's the issue in the past, but the price at which that's done. And so historically the sales, I guess one could say have been at low multiples and the purchases have been at very high multiples, which from a -- if a fund manager did that obviously, might not be the best -- right way to run the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So on that subject, I mean is there any point still allocating capital to fixed? I mean you haven't really talked about that very much, but the Tele2 acquisition was quite recent, but it's hard to see how that's benefiting the company. Equally is all in-market consolidation good? T-Mobile in Austria might say, maybe not. I guess the Danish in-market consolidation is questionable. Even Verizon Wireless Alltel is going to result I think in quite a big exceptional charge that you'll have to take at some stage. So is in-market consolidation good in all circumstances and how is the fixed line investment really benefiting Vodafone today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As I said before this is not about dogmas, it's about very practical and very fact based disciplined evaluation. What we have changed, I think from the past is a position on consolidation. We used to say, no, just passive beneficiary or whatever happens. What has changed is that we have seen in several cases, and I agree with you not all cases, but in several cases, significant value creation created by essentially cost synergies.</p>
          <p>Now you asked me how are we doing in our acquisitions. I can tell you the Arcor integration plan is delivering exactly actually a bit more cost savings, exactly what we had thought about when we purchased the last bit. Italy Tele2 is doing well. We are on track with the plan. What will be delivering in Italy or in Spain Tele2 is a bit more than just that because to be honest Tele2 relative to Vodafone, we are talking about small things. It's much more on the being able to complete the offer for the customers being able to glue different type of offers, mobile, broadband into family concepts rather than the sheer cost element of it. But again, as I said in my earlier answer we have financial criteria. We will look at the situations case-by-case. It's very difficult to make a dogmatic general position. We just want to signal that we are recognized that there is a delivery element, which is very important to factor into our valuations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just double check on the Verizon integration cost? Do we have any steer yet what that's going to be, because I presume there's going to be a one-off charge for the integration of Alltel?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. I mean they are just fine tuning that as we go through it at the moment. So with the close coming up over the next couple of months we'll be clearer on that. We'll talk about it when we've got more specific information.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Beale from Arete Research. On Verizon you've given some slightly conflicting messages. You said both you're open minded and it's a deepening partnership. I guess it's difficult to see it being both. I mean, in devices you've obviously integrated a lot more. You've got LTE in the medium-term is bringing you closer together. You supported a bunch of acquisitions that they've made. I mean, should we not be reading it as that you are getting steadily closer to them rather than being truly open minded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I gave you conflicting messages, because the reality is what it is. We are close to Verizon and there are opportunities to cooperate more with Verizon. So what shall we do? Not leverage on these opportunities. Should we not go to rim and get the Storm? Should we not cooperate on global accounts? Should we not try to make sure that when we converge from a technological point of view, we have the same platform and same thing? Of course, we should. And actually times are evolving in a direction where we can cooperate more.</p>
          <p>Now that does not mean that from a value and from a shareholder point of view we keep an open mind on what happens because clearly, this is a investment, this is not a business that we manage. It's a business that they manage. Therefore we have to keep an open mind on what happens. But I would think that most shareholders, most investors would not like that we do not cooperate with Verizon and don't leverage on what we have today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't suggesting that, I just thought it was more natural that you are getting closer rather than actually thinking about disposal. I mean that was my read into the situation. But also just in terms of M&amp;A generally are there assets today that you think there is a ready buyer and that don't meet your return criteria? I mean are there assets that actually fall into that category for you right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The easy answer is that if the Board had seen us as underperforming and had offers to make, we would for sure look at those assets and decide to do something. But again this is a continuing regular process. So it's part of the life of the company.</p>
          <p>Yeah, there and then we go back and we come back that place.</p>

With the increased focus on free cash flow, it just seems that the revenue guidance is less and less relevant, but at the same time in Q1 and Q3, your updates are mostly focused on revenue. Just wondering if moving forward, if there is a way that there could be some changes coming in terms of how you think about the guidance, I guess, probably for next year now?</p>

I agree directionally with you the key thing really is about the cash flow, the profitability of the business and we will be getting some views as to whether the revenue guidance actually adds a whole lot as we go forward.

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Michael Armitage, Blue Oar. Just to pick up your closing comments on wanting to leave the business more flexible and simpler. And you mentioned right at the beginning investment in an ERP system, I wonder if you can just give us a whole shopping list of things that you see happening organizationally to deliver &#x2013; well, to take Vodafone from being a very large pretty cumbersome beast to one that's very agile and responsive? I mean, I am thinking is it more devolved or is it more command and control? Is it investment in IT and reporting systems? Is it greater delegation to mid-management? Is it elimination of content obsession? I mean, what do you do to make it a simpler organization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would give you the simple answer. We need to share as much as possible the technical platforms, because clearly that's where we create the cost benefit and by having the same technical solutions deployed, even if physically they are not the same, you can at least purchase them together, and you can leverage on your scale. And this is on the back end. On the front end, I am very convinced that we need to leave the markets managing the customers, and we need to leave the markets basically doing the right things, depending on the local culture, local pricing, local competition, and whatever is the situation they operate in.</p>
          <p>And as a glue for the company we need and we have a big project that Andy is leading. We need to have very, very effective shared ERP systems to reduce the number of people, and the number of interactions between different parts of the world, just by sharing a common management system. As you would do if we were just funded today and we started operating as a single entity today.</p>
          <p>So it's really three things; very strong direction to sharing and putting in common everything that is on the back end where the big costs are and Steve usually leads most of these things in a, I think, fairly effective way; strong autonomy to the markets to really do what's right for the customers and what is right for the market; and IT as an important element for keeping G&amp;A cost and overhead low. Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, It's Mark James from Collins Stewart. The 40% of costs that are market driven, you say it gives you scope to adapt to the event of greater economic pressure. I just wanted to be clear, do you think those costs will grow faster or slower than revenues for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's market driven. It's a market-by-market thing. And it's market driven, it's competition driven. So it's very difficult to give an answer. I think that the best players in the industry will manage to control the dynamics of those costs better than the others. But it is an interactive type of game. It's difficult to give the answer. I think in meetings like here several times, I have said that in certain markets, it seems to me that the dynamic of those costs is not right, but is still there. So I will refrain from making a prediction.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Hutton-Mills from Tasker Funds. A couple of quick questions, just returning to the theme of costs. In terms of the billion, can you give us a little bit more in terms of profile, is it going to be front-end loaded, is it going to be back-end loaded? Also is there anything you can say more about geography? Will it be more focused on regions which have been somewhat disappointing, or is it across the board?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps to return to Justin's underlying question, I mean, how aggressive do you feel this billion is? Are you very happy with it, do you think that if global growth was to disappoint in some way you could be more aggressive on that target? And then lastly, just in terms of the regions, as you look across your different regions, which region would you say you are, say over the next 12 months, where are you most confident on margin improvement and where are you least confident on margin improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, why don't you take the cost questions and then we will give an answer to the last one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean there are a huge number of projects that we've put in motion now to drive the next tier of costs out. A couple of years ago we put in place a lot of things that have been very successful at holding the operating expenses flat despite the volume growth in the business. And there is a whole new swathe of ideas that we shared with you here. And some of those are quicker to implement than others, some of them are going to take some time but we are certainly not going to have these being back-end loaded, we will do as much as we can to make sure that we get traction on them as early as possible.</p>
          <p>In terms of geography, I don't think I look at it specifically in terms of geography, obviously, the bulk of the cost sits in Europe, but we are doing a lot of comparisons for all of our operating businesses against external points of comparison. Each of the businesses has got the metrics to know where they are short or where they are doing better than the competition. So quite a lot of this is actually being clinically targeted at particular businesses and particular process within businesses. How aggressive, I mean, ask people in the business. They feel this is being pretty aggressive, but frankly cost is a journey. And I think just as we go forwards, if there is even further revenue pressure on the business, obviously, we will have to look for the next tier of things, but at the moment this tier of the billion will be a good occupation for a number of us, for a period going forwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the regional question, I have to say, again it is what we would expect. Middle East, Asia is driven by India, which is growing very well. And Egypt is doing fine. And Pacific we still are growing well. So I see it as a growth story and a positive story. Central Europe and Africa has Turkey as a key focus turnaround. I would not be surprised if we had to invest in Turkey. We continue to invest to improve our position in network and in distribution. And as I said in the presentation, if you ask my concern clearly not margin in Turkey, is the opportunity that we don't want to miss.</p>
          <p>And in Europe it will be essential to work on costs. I think the coming year, the coming 18 months it would be essential to work on costs. So they are depending here I am -- have to go back to the earlier comment. It depends on how fast and how deep, Michel will really be able to do it. While in the meantime we work on data and on enterprise and on broadband. But this is a bit the different profiles of the different three regions. Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Petri Allas of Redburn. Two questions if I may. First on the issue of past negativity on becoming a bit pipe and now clearly that's much less of a worry as long as you are efficient and a good quality bit pipe. What's the role going forward for content applications for you or with your partners or indeed are you moving towards neutral open access world on that?</p>
          <p>And then the second question going back to the SuperFlat tariffs and such in Germany and other countries, to what extent are you seeing potential acceleration in fixed substitution? And are you explicitly going to push for that given that you have less of a legacy to worry about than many of the number ones in the European markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Bit pipe, nothing wrong with being a bit pipe, if it's an efficient bit pipe. What I have a problem with is the adjective that usually is in front of the bit pipe which is dumb, the dumb bit pipe. That I don't think is the case. We want to be a smart bit pipe, where smart means that we have few elements of our delivery which we think are extremely powerful and extremely important for the customers. And you are talking about the billing capability; you are talking about the profiling capability, to some extent you are talking about the location information. These are things that will make the difference between a dumb pipe and a smart pipe. So we want to be efficient, given, but we also want to be smart because that is what will defend the value in our business. So no problem with a pipe thing, a bit of problem with the degree of brain that we want to have and we have the ambition to have.</p>
          <p>Do we want to work on operating systems? No. We don't have the ambition to influence. We work with everybody and all operating systems are fine. Do we want to work on applications to make the customer experience seamless and working well between the address book, the billing, the location? Yes, that we want and that is what the group that works for Frank R&#xF6;vekamp headed by Pieter Knook is working on. It's working on making that layer which is necessary between the operating systems and the customer experience work well and work with the value added from Vodafone.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, I see it -- yeah, yeah, I sure -- I see it as an advantage that we have, to be honest. I mean, as I said before, we don't have to be dogmatic. I mean if a market is more driven by fixed mobile substitution, we can play more fixed mobile substitution, if a market has segments that actually are more for the converged or at least for the unified relationship, we are putting in place the assets to be able to provide that. But again, we don't have a big legacy to defend and we can do the right things. And again, in Germany it's interesting because to some extent in Germany, we can play both strategies because we have Arcor and Vodafone assets put together. But we also can push more SuperFlat tariffs. So I think it's an advantage relative to the incumbent competitors.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Stephen Howard here at HSBC. Two questions, firstly on the scale side of things, I am glad to see this getting so much attention. I was wondering if you'd agree with the following proposition, which is that historically Vodafone maybe hasn't made the most out of scale, in terms of the unit cost advantage to make life uncomfortable for its competitors. I can see that it's done a lot for you in terms of profitability, but would you agree that in the past it hasn't perhaps been leveraged as aggressively in the marketplace as it might have been? I am just trying to gauge how your attitudes there may now have changed and how much more aggressive you might be prepared to be.</p>
          <p>Second question just regarding to regulation, there have been a couple of interesting documents out recently, quite a robust piece I thought from Ofcom, also Arcep talking about termination rates. I was just wondering if we could have an update on your thought process there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I am not sure I agree with the fact that Vodafone has not made -- as I said in my presentation, when we announced the OpEx and the CapEx targets there was a bit of skepticism. And now we are proving that we are doing it. It just takes time. I mean, this is a huge company. It takes time to -- we have put together the company from different legacy systems, with different infrastructure and it takes time to make it a machine. The work that Steve Pusey is leading is actually to have a single new generation network in Europe, which takes time, because you have to -- and you also want to do it without throwing away money. So I don't think I would agree on the fact that we've had -- didn't have the intention to do it, it just have to do things in steps.</p>
          <p>On regulation, I don't think I have a lot of updates. There is on MTRs an aggressive position of the commission. There are countries who have already made decisions in different directions. The commission doesn't have the power to enforce this thing, they have a suasion role and it will take some time. So I cannot update you much more.</p>
          <p>On SMS and data roaming, it's 1% of our revenues. I think things will progress as we have said in the meetings that we have got one-on-one and things will go, the way they have to go. We -- today I would say I don't see a big impact, I mean, anything different from the last times. This is my conclusion.</p>
          <p>I will take one more question but really the last one because unfortunately time is running short. Please.</p>

Unless Vodafone really thinks there's nothing left that it needs strategically in its footprints in anyway, it strikes me as slightly odd that this would be the time to put out into the market that you won't be making any significant acquisitions, if I've heard you correctly, because the implied statement is that you don't see anything else you could possibly need. This looks like an opportunity over the last three months, and perhaps the next 12 months, that might not be repeated in any sensible horizon.</p>

          <p>I don't think we have ruled out acquisitions. We just have said that we have first to deliver where we are, because where we are, as I said before opening seven new circles in India is basically like doing a big acquisition, because you are adding a lot of coverage and a lot of infrastructure. I just said that we need to be cautious and selective in approaching. And also we have to think that not many big countries have been -- are left basically. So what we wanted to highlight that the execution has a priority and the delivery has a priority and then in looking at the few remaining large opportunities we will be fairly disciplined, because we are aware that first we have to deliver where we are. Does that answer your question? Good.</p>
