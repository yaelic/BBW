          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M fourth quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 24, 2013.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. On today's call we will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 performance along with the 2013 outlook. Inge and David will each make some opening comments; then we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.</p>
          <p>Recall that during the fourth quarter, we announced a realignment of our major business groups. Segment reporting for the new organization will begin in the first quarter of 2013. Today's results are presented on the basis of our existing segment structure. We will furnish supplemental historical business segment sales and operating income information reflecting the segment realignments in an 8-K, and expect to see this filing sometime around mid-March.</p>
          <p>Let me mention a few upcoming dates and events. First, our 2013 earnings conference calls are set for April 25, July 25, and October 24. Also, we will host an investor meeting on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17. I know December calendars fill quickly, so please hold these dates. And more details will be available later this year.</p>
          <p>Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to slide number three, and I will turn the call over to Inge.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today.</p>
          <p>For 3M, 2012 was a year of preparation, progress and performance. We developed and introduced our new vision and strategies, and we aligned our organization more closely with our customers and markets. We combined several businesses for increased scale and relevance, and we formed new businesses in promising markets. We brought new strength to marketing, sales, and e-business, and we gave new emphasis and leadership to Lean Six Sigma. And we put in place a dedicated team to more efficiently integrate our acquisitions. Today, that team is hard at work on both the FSTech [Federal Signal Technologies Group] and Ceradyne acquisitions. You will recall from our November meeting that Ceradyne is both a good business and a strong technology play to build out 3M's ceramics platform.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased that in 2012, we brought portfolio prioritization into the forefront of how we manage the company. This is important for long-term success, and we are using the process to improve short-term results as well. In a few minutes, I will discuss several actions we have recently taken.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most significant progress made last year was the strengthening of 3M's commitment to innovation. We expect R&amp;D to approach 6% of sales by 2017, and you see some evidence of our increased investment in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Finally, as you all know, we reset our financial goals for the next five years. We now have targets that are both realistic and aggressive, with real possibility of upside. All these actions are evidence of preparation and progress.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize our 2012 performance. Please turn to slide four. For the year, earnings per share were up 6% to $6.32. Operating income rose to $6.5 billion, or a 5% increase. We maintained outstanding margins of 21.7%, with five of our six business segments delivering above 21%.</p>
          <p>Sales for the year were nearly $30 billion. In organic local currency terms, sales increased 2.6%, with particular strength in Latin America/Canada, up 11%, and the United States, up 4% for the year. Asia-Pacific was flat for the year in organic local currency, impacted heavily by a soft global consumer electronics industry. And Europe/Middle East/Africa was down 1%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 2.4%, and acquisitions added nearly a point.</p>
          <p>We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which was 86% of net income for the year. And finally, return on invested capital for the year was 20%.</p>
          <p>In summary, a solid year of results during uncertain economic times; the 3M team is well aligned and the company well positioned to win in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to David for more detail on our fourth quarter 2012 results. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with slide number five, where I will break down the fourth quarter change in sales.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter sales rose 4.2%, our strongest increase of any quarter in 2012. Organic growth was 4.3%, as volumes rose 3.6% and selling price increases were a positive 0.7%. Acquisitions added nearly one point to sales growth in the quarter, and foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by one percentage point.</p>
          <p>On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada was once again our fastest growing region, with organic local currency growth of 9.7%. This performance was broad based, with all six of our businesses generating positive organic growth in the region, including double-digit increases in Health Care; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Consumer and Office; and Electro and Communications. Brazil and Mexico both posted impressive results. Brazil grew 11% organically in the face of a still recovering economy, and Mexico grew 10%.</p>
          <p>Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in Asia-Pacific. Japan declined year on year, reflecting continued tough economic conditions, and the rest of APAC rose nearly 10% on an organic basis. For non-Japan Asia, this was the best quarterly growth performance in nearly two years. China was a significant contributor, with organic local currency sales growth of over 16%.</p>
          <p>We also had another very good quarter in the United States, with organic sales up 5.2%. Consumer and Office led the way, with strong double-digit performance.</p>
          <p>In EMEA, or the combined Europe, Middle East, and Africa, fourth quarter sales declined 1% on an organic local currency basis. Western Europe was down 0.6% year on year. The economies there have stabilized but are not yet growing. Our teams in the region continue to focus on market share gains and productivity.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the income statement. Please turn to slide number six. Sales for the quarter were $7.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% in dollar terms. We generated $3.4 billion in gross profit and maintained strong gross margins of 46% for the quarter. SG&amp;A spending rose 1%, and we've increased R&amp;D investments by 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Operating income increased 5.8% in Q4.</p>
          <p>Operating margins were 19.5%, up 30 basis points year on year. Four primary factors contributed to the margin change. First, as I mentioned earlier, we grew organic volumes by 3.6% in the fourth quarter, which we leveraged into approximately 50 basis points of higher operating margin.</p>
          <p>Second, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 1.4 percentage points to fourth quarter margins. Selling prices increased 0.7% year on year, largely due to carryover price benefits from actions taken earlier in 2012. Raw material cost deflation was approximately 3.5%.</p>
          <p>Third, acquisitions in total reduced operating margins by 50 basis points. As Inge mentioned, we are in the process of integrating two recently closed deals, Ceradyne and Federal Signal Technologies. Both integration efforts are going well with no major surprises. And from a financial perspective, we are right where we expected to be at this point in time. Adjusting for these deals, operating margins would have been 20% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, we experienced lower factory utilization in Q4 versus the same quarter of 2011 which, combined with the other factors, hurt fourth quarter operating margins by 1.1 percentage points.</p>
          <p>All things considered, we delivered full-year operating margins of 21.7%, right near the midpoint of the 21.5% to 22% range we were expecting.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 4.4% to $1.41. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% year on year, which added $0.01 to EPS. The fourth quarter tax rate was 28.7%, up two percentage points year on year, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter concludes another successful year for 3M. And with our plan in place and our organization aligned, we anticipate a strong 2013.</p>
          <p>Let's review fourth quarter performance on a business by business basis. Please go to slide number seven. Sales in the Industrial and Transportation business were $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% on an organic local currency basis. We achieved good growth in a number of businesses, including Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Abrasives, Automotive OEM, and Personal Care Products. We posted double-digit increases in two businesses, specifically Liquid Filtration and Aerospace and Aircraft Maintenance, where we continue to win business and penetrate further into these important markets. Our Renewable Energy business declined 12% on an organic local currency basis.</p>
          <p>On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales in Industrial and Transportation increased 6% in Latin America/Canada and the United States and 4% in Asia-Pacific. Industry and Transportation's fourth quarter organic sales were flat in EMEA.</p>
          <p>Operating income was $469 million, and margins were 18.8%. Adjusting for Ceradyne, Industrial's operating margins were similar to fourth quarter 2011 levels.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to Health Care. Fourth quarter sales increased nearly 6% on an organic local currency basis to $1.3 billion. Health Care generated $430 million in operating income in the quarter, up 11% year on year, and operating margins were 32.3%. Continuing the trend from recent quarters, the growth in Health Care was very broad based. All businesses posted positive organic local currency sales growth in Q4, led by Food Safety, Health Information Systems, Skin and Wound Care, and Oral Care.</p>
          <p>On an organic local currency basis, sales increased in all major geographic regions, with double-digit increases in Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific. In developing markets, Health Care drove nearly 15% organic local currency sales growth, continuing our recent success in these areas, and we expect the momentum to continue. In developed markets, our Health Care team continues to generate solid profitable growth despite ongoing government austerity efforts in many major countries; in summary, a superb quarter for Health Care.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 9% on an organic local currency basis, and operating income rose 29% to $230 million. In the United States, sales increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Holiday sell-through was good, and we saw some holiday related sales shift from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. This shift boosted our Q4 growth rate by an estimated 1.5 percentage points year on year.</p>
          <p>We continued to benefit in the U.S. from a strong flow of new products in Consumer and Office, such as our recently introduced line of Command Clear Wall Hooks. We are also getting excellent traction in safety products for the retail channel, most notably in protective eyewear under the 3M TECH brand. Finally, Filtrete brand filters grew well in Q4, boosted by colder weather patterns in many parts of the country.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in Consumer and Office, we also drove double-digit organic local currency growth in Latin America/Canada and low single-digit growth in both Asia-Pacific and EMEA. On a worldwide business basis, our strongest growers were Consumer Health Care and DIY, with positive growth also in Home Care products and Stationery and Office Supplies. All in all, this was a strong quarter for our Consumer and Office team.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at our Display and Graphics segment. Sales in the fourth quarter were $910 million, an increase of 8.3%. Optical Systems had a good fourth quarter, with sales up double digits and stable profit margins year on year. Optical finished the year largely as we had expected. We also posted positive organic local currency sales growth in Architectural markets, Traffic Safety Systems, and Commercial Graphics.</p>
          <p>Display and Graphics grew 12% organically in Asia-Pacific, 10% in Latin America/Canada, and 5% in the U.S. EMEA sales were down 2% year on year.</p>
          <p>Operating profits in Display and Graphics were $152 million, with operating margins of 16.7%. Margins declined 2.5 percentage points year on year, primarily due to the FSTech acquisition along with startup costs in a couple of businesses.</p>
          <p>Let's examine Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Fourth quarter sales were $904 million, down 2% on an organic local currency basis. We posted good growth in most businesses, with notable strength in Infrastructure Protection and Personal Safety Products. Sales declined in our Security Systems division, as the market remained soft and the business has been under strategic review. Inge will address the actions we are taking to better position Security Systems for success going forward.</p>
          <p>On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 13% in Latin America/Canada and 1% in Asia-Pacific, and declined 7% in the U.S. and 5% in EMEA.</p>
          <p>Operating income in Safety, Security and Protection Services decreased 5% year on year to $162 million, and margins were 18%. Margins declined 50 basis points, impacted by the aforementioned challenges in Security Systems.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's review Electro and Communications. Sales in this business totaled $776 million in the fourth quarter, up 1.8% in organic local currency terms. Operating income totaled $142 million, down 6.5% year on year, and margins were 18.4%. On an organic local currency basis, sales increased in Touch Systems, Electrical Markets, and Telecom. Sales declined a bit in Consumer Electronics, and we are anticipating first quarter will be similar.</p>
          <p>In geographic terms, Latin America/Canada rose 10%. The U.S. increased 4%. And Asia-Pacific rose 1%, while EMEA declined 3% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Let's move on to cash flow, so please turn to slide number seven. From a cash flow perspective, the fourth quarter was quite similar to the same quarter in 2011. Free cash flow was $1.23 billion, up $10 million year on year. We invested $507 million in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter, down $10 million versus fourth quarter of last year. Full-year CapEx was $1.5 billion, which was in line with our expectations entering the year. Free cash flow conversion was 124% in the quarter versus 128% in last year's comparable quarter. For the full year 2012, free cash flow conversion was 86%.</p>
          <p>We returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter, including $714 million in gross share repurchases and $407 million in cash dividends. For the full year 2012, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders, or 86% of net income.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our review of the fourth quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.</p>
          <p>Before we get to your questions, I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2013 and how we are working to strengthen 3M. I said earlier that 2012 was a year of preparation, progress, and performance. With the planning behind us, 2013 is a year of putting our plan into action and truly competing to win.</p>
          <p>To win, we are strengthening our portfolio and, at the same time, working to resolve some challenging business issues. For example, in November we announced a combination of our Security Systems division with our Traffic Safety Systems division. In recent times, these businesses have not performed to the standards we expect, and we are addressing these issues head on. Government spending for Security has decreased over the last few years, and those same factors have also affected our Traffic Safety Systems business. In the big picture, bringing these two businesses together creates an opportunity to optimize the overall business and increase efficiency.</p>
          <p>We announced last week a restructuring in these businesses that will result in the reduction of around 300 positions worldwide, and we will take a related Q1 charge of $8 million.</p>
          <p>In a company of our size and breadth, there will always be some businesses under strategic review. And while the specific solutions may differ, the underlying principle is the same. They will not stay under strategic review for long. We will take action. And in context, these situations are few when compared to 3M's overall portfolio of outstanding businesses.</p>
          <p>For 2013, we will continue to drive our strategies, invest in innovation, commercialize new products as quickly as possible, and work to take market share everywhere. We have confidence in our plan and our people and in the planning estimates we gave you in December, which you can see on slide 10.</p>
          <p>We expect 2013 earnings per share in the range of $6.70 to $6.95. We look for organic local currency growth of plus 2% to plus 5%. The tax rate is expected to be 29.5% to 30%. And finally, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%.</p>
          <p>As for the near term, we are naturally a bit more cautious. There remains a degree of uncertainty as we see some economies growing and others are slower to recover. The same dynamics can be found in specific markets. Health Care is doing well, for example, while Consumer Electronics yet has to recover fully.</p>
          <p>Specific to the first quarter, we anticipate approximately $30 million of restructuring and one-time acquisition costs. This includes the $8 million in restructuring cost I mentioned earlier. The point is we will execute our plan to keep improving and growing the business.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention. We will now take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Inge, just in Industrial, sequentially the business sales declined $73 million, but operating profit declined $106 million sequentially. Can you just describe exactly what drove that dynamic Q3 versus Q4 in Industrial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had some businesses that grew well and continued to grow well, like Automotive did well. I think one other impact is the RED [Renewable Energy Division] business that we had an issue with and had during the whole year. And the way we look upon RED is that it's a relatively small division for us generally speaking. It's a $400 million U.S. business, and you can look upon the segment as two segments, one as conservation and one generation. Conservation is like the window film for us. That was flat. On the generation side, which is wind and solar, as you know in the global market, that is a declining market, so we were down on that side. So I think that was a big piece for us during the quarter for Industrial in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could, David, as we look at Industrial performance in the quarter, the sales were quite reasonable in terms of 4% growth year on year. Certainly, Q4 we always see a decline in activity, including margins. And as you know, as we called out, we were also impacted by the costs in Ceradyne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. And just, Inge, on Consumer Electronics you mentioned it will likely be weak through Q1; any further insight into when it might pick up via your customers' order book or conversations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it looks like 2013 will look like the beginning of 2012. It looks the same. So we don't know when it is coming, but probably sometime at the end of Q2 is the indication that we can see at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Inge, back in November you gave us some good insight to your thinking around businesses under strategic review. I just wonder if there's anything else moving around there. I think at the time you said there was about $2.5 billion of sales that were maybe in the crosshairs. Could you just give us some color on how big Security and Transportation is now that you've put them together as a percent of that and if there are any other businesses moving around in that thought process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, as I said, we are taking action relative to that. And as I said, that's about fixed combined or close in order to see the advantage of the businesses and if we can fix them moving forward. So I think this is a first good step for us. We believe by combining those two divisions that there is very good synergy for us in between the two businesses.</p>
          <p>Just to make a comment around it, both those businesses are businesses that are based on material as the core, so we're very strong in both those businesses in the core relative to material. And then both businesses are the type of reaching out and go into more solutions around electronic. So that is the advantage of combining them in order to look upon the synergy. So when we look upon it specifically, you have elements of the customer-facing opportunity, which I think is still very precise in terms of execution. And then you can get leverage around technology, business processes, compliance and then manufacturing and supply chain. So when you do that, combine them, you will get more efficiency.</p>
          <p>And also from an organization perspective around the world, where we have all the subsidiaries, it will work very well for them because they get more focus, more dedication and can execute better. And in many pieces there, as you know, is project management, so you need to have specialists that are working with them. So you combine those two businesses, we feel very good in terms of this is something we can fix. This is something where we will win and we will move them forward.</p>
          <p>Some other businesses, without calling them out, we are working on them in order to find solutions for them as an outcome around a strategic review. These were two of them we looked upon in order to make sure that we can win for the future. And I will update you as we go as other actions will be taken.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at the businesses under review, we had called out as part of that the Security division was in there, and that was a business I think $400 million to $500 million of revenue out of $2.5 billion. Traffic Safety was not part of that group. But inevitably, as you look at how to get the right alignment across the businesses in our total portfolio, we made that change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And then, Inge, can you or David provide a little more color on what you're seeing in China, the organic growth in the quarter? Are there any particular end markets that are standing out? And I guess everybody's question really is, is there a legitimate recovery of some sort now underway there as opposed to the hopes for one that everybody had last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw a recovery. And as you saw, we had growth in the quarter of 16% in total. Our base business, which is excluding electronic, was 10%, so it's a good uptick for us. I will say then that's the best quarter for us last year, 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2013, our base business, I would say, will continue in the same mode as we saw here in the end. We don't know yet in terms of electronics, so electronics maybe will still be a little bit of a challenge as we move into the year. But for the base business, we see a recovery coming, and we feel optimistic about that. But we're still cautious, as you said, because when you look upon it quarter by quarter, it's not all China, if you like. There's a different baseline that we need to grow out from. But we can see recovery coming in the base business, and that is a big portion for us. And so we see sequential improvement in that as we move ahead for the base business going into Q1. Electronics is a little bit more a question mark for us as we speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could add to that, the base being Industrial, we saw good growth again in Health Care in the quarter in China, as we've seen all year. And also recall or you may recall we had a very weak quarter in China last year in the fourth quarter. So quite obviously, there's a bit of an element here of the year-over-year comparison.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Health Care, those are stellar margins, above 32%. Typically when we start seeing the margins bump up that high, there are some cautious comments about sustainability; that you may be making some investments in this business. But how would you frame for us in terms of that level of profitability and the outlook over the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Deane. As I commented in the speech, we are encouraged, of course, by the fact that we see broad-based growth across all of the divisions in Health Care again now in Q4. We did see a little bit of a pull forward in sales into Q4, in part due to those activities that will be impacted by the medical device tax. So you saw it tick up a little bit in terms of growth, and we know about 0.5 point of that growth was associated with that pull forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of margins, we continue to believe now that in 2013, we do expect the margins to run at 30%-plus for the time being. But looking at this one, obviously, we had &#x2013; everything came together at the same time in that quarter. And so I wouldn't suggest to you that you would bank us continuing to operate every quarter at that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair, and then a broader macro question. I think a lot of folks on the industrial side were braced for some anxiety in December related to the fiscal cliff, and I certainly didn't see it in your organic revenue growth at 5.2%. But could you provide any color in terms of customer behavior? Was there any holdout or push-out in orders other than that Health Care being pulled in, but broadly anything that you think may have been delayed that may then snap back in January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I would say, Deane, we saw &#x2013; if you look through the quarter, the trends during the quarter were quite stable. We didn't see any particular effects that we could point to other than the one I just mentioned in Health Care. Obviously, the other piece, of course, we were very pleased with was the holiday performance for Consumer. But beyond that, were there other notable ups or downs or inflection points? I would say we didn't see any. And therefore, as we look at our guidance into 2013 by sector, we think that the growth ranges that we called out in December still look good in terms of what we expect in 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question. Just in terms of the overall margin walk, you had this utilization and other bucket. The volumes were up nicely and accelerated. What is going on in the utilization? Did you actually choose to take your production a little bit down to get rid of inventory, or is there something else going on in that bucket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so if you look at the margin walk, we did have about a point there related to utilization, and it was really a couple of things that are the biggest pieces of that. One of them is we included in there some costs related to startups of some new factories we're starting up. So we've got in particular &#x2013; if you look at Singapore, in the Traffic Signage business we have a new factory that started up here in the fourth quarter. So that impacted our utilization because there are costs as you ramp up the business. There also was a new project we've got in the Electronics space in touch panels that impacted utilization in a similar way.</p>
          <p>And then we also had &#x2013; if you look at our utilization year over year, in a couple of areas we did see a lower level of activity, those being in some of the Consumer Electronics related spaces. So if you look at utilization in the semiconductor space, amongst our customers, that was lower in Q4, and that impacted our business. As well as Inge was referring to RED or the Renewable Energy business; we saw some lower utilization in some of those factories. So that was really what drove that impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just looking specifically at the Display and Graphics margins, you had a few factors in there. You had FSTech; you had some of the startup costs there. And then I guess Traffic Safety also probably had down margins. So can you just give a little more color on the buckets of those and how much they contributed to the margin decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. So if you look at it, we had a year-over-year decline in D&amp;G of about 2.5 points; as I mentioned, not related to divisions such as Optical, where we had very stable performance in terms of margin and very much what we expected. The two biggest factors there, as I did mention, almost half of it was the impact of the FSTech acquisition. And the other piece was more related to these startup costs, which I mentioned, that impacted the company overall. And we had a little bit of product mix, but I would say it's the third of the factors if you align them in terms of significance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a first question on your pricing, so you had pricing up 140 basis points &#x2013; or the pricing spread 140 basis points on back of two quarters at 160 basis points, which is great performance. But how much of that is &#x2013; or how do you think about that relative to commodities giving you any kind of tailwind there and your ability to price on the commodity discussion and your ability to price going forward? How much is a function of that versus new product intros? And what's giving you, do you think, the pricing power across your businesses? And what's your ability to maintain that given how critical that has been to the margin performance quarter on quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So yes, so you've got the figures. We've tried to lay those out quite clearly. The trend, as you know, is while we did have 0.7% price performance in the fourth quarter, that's primarily the impact of price increases that were taken earlier in the year. And with the situation on raw materials, as I've said I think in November, we expect the pricing impact in 2013 to moderate further.</p>
          <p>As to our ability to hold price and avoid commoditization, of course as you know, the business model is exactly geared towards offering innovative solutions that differentiate our products for our customers and provide value that they're willing to pay for, so no difference in that model next year versus any time in the past.</p>
          <p>In terms of raw materials, we do expect the tailwind of raw material price declines that we experienced in 2012 to substantially moderate. That's why we said in our guidance for 2013 that we think that impact will be pretty neutral. So how do we feel? We think it will be less of a contributor, the combination in 2013 than we experienced in 2012, but also not the kind of headwind we had the prior couple years. And we feel good about our ability to deliver on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing part of that though, do you think that 70 basis points &#x2013; as you look forward, do you think you can maintain that kind of pricing alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our plan for 2013, we do not expect to see price increases for the year as high as that 0.7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what kind of inventory restocking impact or destocking did you see across the portfolio over the last quarter? And do you see that &#x2013; has that been trending differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't &#x2013; other than a couple of specific areas that we've tried to talk about today in specific businesses, the general trend we've seen, we would say, if you look at the sales trend, pretty stable for the company through the quarter. And I would say we didn't observe anything notable in terms of unusual inventory patterns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just sneaking one more on the guidance, you've got 2% to 5%. You just did 4% on organic growth, so presumably we're expecting certainly a sequential move the other way. Is that fair, or how are you thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the overall guidance, 2% to 5% for the company in 2013, we still think is the right way to think about it. If you look at the Q4 performance in terms of sales, which obviously we were quite pleased with, moving from 2% on average during the first nine months up to 4%, if you parse that out, about half of it was related to the performance in the Consumer segment, which as I think we've talked about or we've inferred, we think that was related to some fairly specific factors in Q4. And we continue to think 2% to 5% growth for Consumer in 2013 is the right way to think about that segment.</p>
          <p>And then the other contributors, the most significant one to that tick up in Q4 was the performance in Asia, most significantly the base business in China. And as Inge said, we've taken some reasons for some optimism that we're seeing a recovery, as I think others are talking about. We're cautious to start running away with that as something that's going to continue to trend more strongly. But again, we're encouraged by the indications.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>I think you can &#x2013; first of all, we stick to our guidance we gave you in December. We are, of course, pleased with the outcome of Q4 in terms of our growth. We are cautious as we move into the year here and operate in the same way that we moved into 2012 very successfully.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could you maybe provide a little color on how the quarter progressed? Obviously, you had a very good organic growth quarter. Did you see any pickup in December, and then maybe an early read into what you're seeing in Jan.? Have the trends that you saw in the fourth quarter, have they continued? Have you seen any pickup? Any thoughts there would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Sure, Ajay. Yes, I would say again, and not to repeat, but we saw &#x2013; if you look at the selling rates more on a daily basis, we didn't see anything changing in Q4. Now there were some issues around how many selling days there were as between October, November, December; so you get some different outcomes if you looked at it on a monthly basis because December actually had a lesser number of days than last year. But as we look at it on a very granular basis, we didn't observe any trends that were implying some new level of inflection in our overall business in total; and again, obviously some pluses and minuses, which we've tried to call out here today. If I then roll forward into where we're sitting today in late January, we see relative stability in terms of the overall business. And again, I don't see anything that I would point to that would indicate some new information for us here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then on the Consumer business, I know there were a couple things that helped the quarter. But even ex that, it looks like you had a really good top line. So does that change how you're thinking about the business, how that business does this year? Your guidance is 2% to 5% for that segment. Based on just that performance, do you think you could be conservative, any thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we are very pleased with our performance from Consumer. And it's probably the business during this year that really put a very good plan together and were able to execute it very successfully. And as David laid out, there were some specifics in Q4 that boost the growth for us. However, it was very good growth in both businesses there and in all geographical areas. And as you recall, why we eventually can see a little bit of uptick as we go further out is our relatively low penetration in International. So we will keep the guidance for now, but we can say very clearly that we are making headwinds (sic) [headway] both in international and in the United States, and had both very good growth in the United States, as David called out in our Q4, in a highly penetrated market. And then we have still a lot of opportunities in international.</p>
          <p>And I think the thing that, what is happening is that business has improved consumer insight. They have added design as a big element to the business on top of the innovation that we can provide from the company to them, and then the very strong category management capabilities that we have in that business. So if you look upon Consumer for us, long term it's a very, very good business for us with good upside. And both that business and Health Care, as you know, for us is what we call very much local domestic businesses that we were able to grow. And both of them have still big opportunities in international. So we're very encouraged as we move ahead, but we are not changing the guidance in terms of growth as we speak here today.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, good, and then just a couple quick ones. Since you gave 2013 guidance, the yen has been on a tear. Does that change in any way? You've got quite a big exposure to Japan; it's about 8% percent of your sales I believe. So does that change anything in terms of FX impact or perhaps margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not sufficiently material to us right now, Nigel, that we would feel that we'd need to call out a change. Obviously, we're monitoring because the yen has weakened already and there's obviously a lot of talk about it further weakening. If you recall, we hedge about 50% of all of our exposures, so that gives us certainly the ability to navigate and adjust the business if we see something more structural happening, but not material right now that we'd need to talk about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Nigel, I would add too. It's 8% percent of sales, but we do have a 25% minority partner in Japan, so a quarter of the profits belong to the minority. And so from a sensitivity standpoint, the move in the yen is going to be less pronounced than it would be with the likes of the euro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then staying on FX, there is some linkage between U.S. dollar movements and pricing, particularly in regions like LatAm. Has the stronger dollar over the last couple quarters had any impact, albeit at the margin, on pricing in those regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In some of our contracts we do price &#x2013; peg to the dollar. So in fact, to the extent that the currencies weaken, we saw in local currency terms prices increased. And likewise you would see some reductions in pricing, which would be reflected in the overall 0.7% that we mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just finally, we finally saw a renewal of the R&amp;D tax credits. You've got a pretty big R&amp;D investment. Has that changed at all your tax view for 2013? I know you maintained the line at 29.5% to 30%, but does that maybe put a downward bias on the tax rate in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what I would say is, first of all, we came in for the year at 29%, which is right in the range of 29% to 29.5% that we had indicated for 2012. It is true that if I look at &#x2013; there is a modest effect for us of the carryover impact of the deferral of these extenders into 2013. But as we look at it, the number of different factors that impacts the tax rate during the year lead us to conclude at this time that we think the 29.5% to 30% outlook for the company is good. And quite honestly the information I have in front of me, I don't see any reason why quarter to quarter that that rate is going to be vastly different from the full-year rate guidance I've got out there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned a couple of the moving parts on the first quarter. I think the normal seasonality is up, I don't know, double digit, 10% to 15%. But you mentioned I guess $30 million of incremental restructuring. Are there any other moving parts into the first quarter, or should we just expect normal seasonality here on an earnings basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say what we see right now is pretty normal seasonality, Steve. The one area that we're cautious about, which Inge mentioned, is in the Electronics space. We do see some ups and downs there, and we think that we may have some lower level of demand in some of those sectors. For example, as I mentioned, semiconductor utilization has been running a bit lower. I think that will impact us in Q1. But overall, we think it's fairly normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So like low $1.60 per share kind of numbers, if that's just a 10% to 15% increase from the fourth quarter, just on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't do guidance on a quarterly basis, so we'll probably keep that at least for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one last question just on the inventory dynamics. I guess looking back there, your portfolio is like Electronics, Health Care, and then some Industrial businesses. Just looking back over the past year, did you think you have seen an impact from inventory dynamics outside of Electronics, mostly in the Industrial businesses? And maybe, just in the postmortem of the last year and a half of a volatile economy, is there any way to quantify how much that might have been if you had any, or was it even material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say yes, good question, Steve. In the past, we've spent a fair amount of time talking about inventory dynamics and the effect on sales. If you look at the sales through the year, pretty stable, obviously at the low end of what we were looking for as the economy was basically downgraded through the year. If I look at our growth performance overall as compared to the overall industrial economy, it was a little bit towards the low end of that range. And I could infer from that that there was probably either neutral or some level of destocking through the year that might have affected us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no material destocking that would lead to any significant benefits on a restock. Clearly, looking at some of the more OEM component guys like Kennametal or somebody like that, sales down 15%, you guys didn't really see that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a couple of clean up questions. In terms of this one percentage point drag, and you seem to have indicated that most of it comes from &#x2013; a lot of it comes from the startup costs, should we expect those to moderate throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's fair to assume. We'll always have startups. We've had certainly record levels of capital investment here in 2012. And as we've told you, we expect our CapEx to rise in 2013. And what I would say is there are up and downs in terms of both the startup costs, so we happen to have some startups in the fourth quarter, sometimes coincidence with both the lower production requirements seasonally in the fourth quarter. Sometimes we'll take advantage of a holiday shutdown to plan around those startups. So if I looked quarter by quarter, it may be &#x2013; quite honestly, I haven't done the deep analysis. It may be true that you see seasonally a bit more startup costs in the fourth quarter. But we will have &#x2013; throughout the year we'll have that type of activity certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the drag should be the highest in Q4 in theory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a fair way to think about it, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question I have, just an observation. If I look at your organic growth, it's the best since Q1 2011. And if I look at the pricing, interestingly enough, it has been on a downward slope and it's now probably the weakest since Q1 of 2011. How should I think about dialing up pricing up and down to drive the organic growth? Is there a linear function here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say not on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think the facts we're staring at here in Q4 are a perfect example of that, which is there's not a short-term and direct correlation. i.e., we've taken quite a significant amount of pricing earlier in the year. The decline in that is more of a function of the fact that we have a lot of earlier price adjustments, which now mathematically result in the lowest price increase in Q4 and if you look at the sales growth, as we've talked about some specific factors around what's going on with some improvement in the base business in China as well as the Consumer business. So I think it's a good observation. I wouldn't draw a direct cause and effect in the short term from them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I should be thinking that NPVI [New Product Vitality Index] strategy continues to be successful, then you guys can get both, in theory, top line and pricing long term?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I guess can you provide an update on your supply chain initiative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we continue to build that out. As you recall, we started that maybe four or five years ago. And one thing that is important is for us to build what we call those super hubs, where we are coming closer to the markets and the customers around the world, due to the fact that that is where we see the big growth. So it's an ongoing process. I don't think they'll ever be ready with it because if it were ready, I think the market is stagnating at that point in time. But we make very, very good progress, and even now in last quarter, we started a new investment in Turkey where we're building out a good hub for both Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa. So it will be a bridge in terms of our initiatives for that part of the world from a supply chain perspective.</p>
          <p>We have also a big initiative going on in Europe where we've tried to consolidate our supply chain in Western Europe specifically in order to be more efficient and coordinate that in a better way. So it's an ongoing process. We're making very good progress in the process there, but there's still more to do. And as I said, I think it's one of those that you will never be ready.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then what are the prospects for market share gains this year across your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our plan is aggressive in terms of what we need to do in order to take market share, and specifically in developed economies. There is not much growth in the market, so we have very aggressive market share plans in that part of the world. So if you look upon it like a 50:50 base, as we say, you need to take 50% of your growth from market share and 50% based on penetration. And I think in most businesses, we still have a good upside relative to market share. But the other thing you have to think about our business model is that we are working in different categories. So we have a type of consumables that is going into Health Care and the Consumer market, and some consumables that is going into manufacturing product that is used in order to help them to improve productivity and efficiency. That's one piece of it.</p>
          <p>The other piece is where we are spec'd on big platforms. So the point is for us, it's growth in total. In some businesses, we can go right down and calculate the market share. Another thing, we create new solutions on platforms that are running for a long time. But if you go into specifics on consumables, in both consumer Health Care and Industrial, we have aggressive market share plans, and we still believe we can deliver on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A quick question on inventory. It came down; your company inventory came down sequentially. Of course, that's typical for the fourth quarter, but it finished a little higher than we've seen in previous years. Are you comfortable with this level here, or how do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I would say, as you exactly observed, we typically have seasonally here, Adam, a decline in inventory in Q4. If we look our at turnover metrics, they look very comparable to other years, other fourth quarter type performance areas. We did mention that we do expect here in the near term to have some specific areas where we might have some further reduction in activity in the first quarter, specifically in some of the consumer electronics area. But overall, I would not say there's anything fundamentally different going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks, that's helpful; and then shifting to Europe, a bigger picture question. Now you mentioned that you're seeing a bottom, but the region isn't really growing out in Western Europe. And of course you're forecasting, I think, a negative 3% to a positive 1% growth for next &#x2013; or for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How does the development that you've seen, that bottoming, how does that fit into your expectations? Is that right in line with it, or is it on the top or bottom of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm not sure exactly if I'll answer your question as you're trying to pose it. But if we look at Europe right now, we've had a couple years now where &#x2013; or about a year and a half where we've printed negative growth performance. It has moderated, obviously. And as you pointed out, we're calling out a range that centers on minus 1% next year. So everything we can see, we're running pretty stable there.</p>
          <p>There are some ups and downs as between north and south; but overall, when you look at the portfolio, pretty stable. And what we've really been focusing on with the business is to make sure that we're as competitive as we can be as a company in Western Europe. So we're looking at how we can take advantage of opportunities to leverage our business across the entire region. We're looking at areas of growth because inevitably there are opportunities to grow in the region. And so in areas like Health Care, we've seen some growth opportunities. And we're also looking at how we can optimize and make sure we're making a reasonable return, so we were pleased this year that we did see our margins improve despite weaker sales performance.</p>
