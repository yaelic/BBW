          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Clayton , and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer-session.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results and Outlook Conference Call. With me today on the call are Larry Hunter, our Interim CEO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; and Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America.</p>
          <p>In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Larry, Pat and Bruce for some introductory remarks, but first, I'll read to you the following. On this call, we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of the DIRECTV Group's and DIRECTV U.S.'s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules on our website for the non-GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm pleased to introduce Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll briefly review our third quarter results, and then turn the call over to Pat for a more detailed discussion of DIRECTV U.S. operations. After Pat, Bruce Churchill will provide a summary of our results in Latin America, and then I'll conclude with our operational priorities and a quick update on the Liberty transactions.</p>
          <p>All around, I thought DIRECTV both in the U.S. and Latin America had really solid numbers in the third quarter. Both of our companies have generated strong topline and bottom line results reflecting the strength of our brands and services, which in turn drove substantial cash flow growth. In fact, on our consolidated free cash flow was at a record high in the quarter. On our last earnings call, we talked about our goal to strike a better balance in the U.S. between subscriber growth, margin expansion and cash flow growth in the second half of the year. Our third quarter results reflect the successful execution of these strategies and goals.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth of 9% was solid and points to the strength of our industry-leading content, HD, DVR and interactive services. These along with the benefits from marketing to the DIRECTV AT&amp;T bundle contributed to the increase in gross adds to 1.1 million subs. We achieved record high penetration level for HD and DVR services, which points to our strength at the high-end of the market. About two thirds of our new subs signed up for advanced services this past quarter compared to just under 60% a year ago.</p>
          <p>More importantly, penetration of subscribers getting both HD and DVR services, which are our most valuable subs, was up 50% from a year ago. Net additions of 136,000 were lower than last year primarily due to a modestly higher monthly churn rate. We've talked about our spending our upgrade and retention dollars more efficiently and as a result during this quarter we tightened up many of our offers to existing customers. As a result of these stricter policies, our upgrade and retention cash expenses declined by about 7% compared to the prior year, which contributed to the small increase in churn.</p>
          <p>Clearly a highlight in the quarter was our strong cost controls, which drove higher year-over-year pre-SAC and OPBDA margins for the first time this year. Lower upgrade and retention costs were just one of the many areas where I felt we did an excellent job managing costs. For example, we drove SAC below $700 for the second consecutive quarter despite the record high HD and DVR levels. In an industry where our competitors are talking about double-digit increases in subscriber programming costs, we had an increase of only 1.2% on a per subscriber basis in the quarter. The one area where our costs were higher than planned was in subscriber services. However, we feel this is money well spent as our service levels are dramatically improved over last year.</p>
          <p>In addition, according to the recent J.D. Power results, DIRECTV's service quality remained significantly better than most of our competitors. The strong topline growth and cost controls contributed to our best ever quarter in terms of cash flow. At the DIRECTV Group level, free cash flow, which also includes DIRECTV Latin America's results as well as interest and taxes, nearly doubled in the quarter, and that's up more than 30% over 1.6 billion for the first nine months of the year. And this cash flow is being put to good use as we bought back almost $1 billion of stock in the quarter representing the largest dollar amount of the year.</p>
          <p>So at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat and Bruce and then come back with a few concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And like Larry, I thought we had a very strong quarter. Clearly the highlights in the quarter point to our competitive and operating strengths, which demonstrate the very substantial cash flow capabilities that our businesses are in line to deliver.</p>
          <p>Looking first at revenues, the 9% increase over the prior year was consistent with our expectations as the larger subscriber base contributed about 6.5% growth, while ARPU was up 2.1% in the quarter. Gross additions were particularly strong growing 8% over the prior year as we continue to benefit from the strength of our brand and industry-leading advanced services, as well as from the increased sales from the DIRECTV-AT&amp;T bundle.</p>
          <p>Our direct sales channel once again had a year-over-year increase in gross adds despite the increase in subscribers coming from the AT&amp;T sales channel. This reflects not only the strength of our direct sales channel, but also the fact that the majority of subscribers coming through the telco channels are not cannibalizing sales from our other channels.</p>
          <p>In other words, subscribers attained through the telco channels are generally incremental and represent customers that we would not have otherwise attained. This is because the sales are usually connected with a specific transaction, such as when a customer moves or calls the telco to change the service plan.</p>
          <p>Although still relatively small, we're also starting to see some nice growth coming out of both our commercial and MDU or multi-dwelling unit channels. The commercial and MDU markets are very large yet our market share is extremely low, which translates into significant growth opportunities for us in the coming years.</p>
          <p>In addition, the overall quality of new subscribers remains very high, both in terms of credit scores and advanced services sales. As Larry mentioned, a record two-thirds of our gross adds signed up for HD and/or DVR services. And for the first time ever we saw more new customers sign up for both HD and DVR services than either HD or DVR standalone services.</p>
          <p>Turning to our monthly churn rate of 1.72% in the quarter, the modest increase over last year is consistent with our goal to strike a better economic balance between churn and the amount of money we spend to upgrade and retain existing customers. As we talked about on our last earnings call, we tightened up many of our offers to existing customers. We do this regularly to adjust to changing economic and competitive conditions.</p>
          <p>As a result, fewer of our customers are receiving free upgrades. And more of our customers are paying higher fees for equipment and truck rolls. In some cases, these stricter policies will result in slightly higher churn, particularly as some of our lower quality customers shop around for better offers. But this is a trade off we're willing to make as we strive to minimize the offers given to customers who have a track record of calling us on a regular basis seeking discounts or free services.</p>
          <p>In terms of ARPU, growth in the quarter of 2.1% was largely in line with expectations and up a touch from the growth we saw in the first half. As usual, there were many offsetting trends, but in a nutshell, the modestly higher ARPU growth compared to the level seen in the first half were mostly due to higher pay-per-view revenues, primarily due to the Mayweather fight as well as lower credits relating to the tighter retention offers I just talked about.</p>
          <p>Somewhat offsetting these favorable results was the impact from one less week of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues in this year's third quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, we are continuing to see weakness in sales of premium movie channels, however we're executing better and have slightly slowed the year-over-year rate of decline.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the bottom line, I thought we did an excellent job managing costs in the quarter, particularly in the areas of SAC, retention and programming. The cash SAC of $697 was particularly impressive when considering the record demand we've seen for our most expensive HD and DVR boxes. The main reason for the lower year-over-year SAC is that the significantly higher savings attained from using refurbished boxes and the continued cost reductions on new set-top boxes are more than offsetting the higher costs associated with increased sales of advanced boxes.</p>
          <p>Also strong in the quarter was our pre-SAC margin, which increased 170 basis points to over 36%. The largest contributor to the higher margin was lower upgrade and retention costs as we talked about earlier. In addition, we did a good job managing our programming cost in the quarter. When looked at from a cost per subscriber perspective, our increase of just over 1% compares very favorably with the 5.3% seen in the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>Subscriber services on the other hand continue to run a bit higher than the prior year and our target. But as Larry said, we feel this is money well spent. Achieving the gold standard in customer service remains one of our highest priorities and we feel that we are making steady progress toward that goal.</p>
          <p>So, when you combine our solid topline growth with higher margins and lower CapEx, you get a 41% growth in cash flow before interests and taxes at DIRECTV U.S. in the third quarter. And at the DIRECTV Group level, free cash flow, which includes DIRECTV Latin America results, as well as taxes and interest, grew even faster at 94% to a record 643 million. Included in these numbers are lower Q3 tax payments due to a variety of items, including the timing of payments, lower EBT and credits from prior years.</p>
          <p>Based on these favorable trends, we are now expecting a full-year cash tax rate in the low 20% range compared to last year's rate, which was almost 29%. In terms of our stock repurchase program, we repurchased 943 million in the third quarter, bringing our total share repurchases over the past three years to almost 500 million shares, while reducing by one-third our shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>As you may know, we halted our buyback program a couple of weeks ago when we started mailing the proxy. At that time, we had approximately 300 million remaining on the original 2 billion share repurchase program approved at the beginning of the year. We look forward to resuming our buyback program after completing the Liberty transactions later this month.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, I thought we had another very strong quarter further demonstrating the strength of DIRECTV's brand and operations, our unique competitive advantages, as well as the tremendous and sustaining cash flow generating capability of our company.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn the call over to Bruce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat. Let me spend a few minutes talking about DIRECTV Latin America. And as a reminder, all of the figures I'm about to discuss exclude results of Sky Mexico, which we account for an equity basis. Overall, I think DIRECTV Latin America, which I'll refer to as DTVLA had a very strong quarter, both in terms of topline growth and bottom line cash flow.</p>
          <p>Looking first at subscriber growth, we set an all-time record for gross additions with 385,000 in the quarter, up 22% from last year's third quarter. Although we saw solid growth in many countries, including Puerto Rico and Colombia, Brazil was the primary driver with a 38% increase in gross adds. Much of the growth in Brazil is due to increased demand for our HD service, as well as a new package that we recently launched called Sky Digital Lite, which is targeted at the middle market or what we call the C-Class market, which is a somewhat lower, yet still attractive demographic than our traditional A and B classes. In addition, our prepaid product is also designed to serve this market.</p>
          <p>Also contributing to the strong results is the fact that Brazil's economy, financial markets and currency have continued to strengthen resulting in a very positive business environment. Average monthly churn in the quarter of 1.75% for DTVLA was 16 basis points higher than last year, if you exclude the 57,000 subscriber adjustment that we took last year. This increase was almost entirely due to the rapid growth of our prepaid subscribers in the region.</p>
          <p>Excluding churn related to prepaid subscribers and the subscriber adjustment last year, postpaid churn was about 1.53% in the quarter versus 1.51% in the third quarter of last year. This is at or near what I consider to be our sweet spot of 1.5% for postpaid churn. The combination of higher gross adds and lower churn resulted in net adds of 162,000 in the quarter, bringing our total DTVLA subscribers to 4.3 million, representing growth of 16% over a year ago.</p>
          <p>Including Sky Mexico, we now have over 6.1 million subscribers in the region. As I mentioned both our prepaid and advanced services have been fuelling our growth, so I thought it would be helpful to provide a little more color on these trends. Total DTVLA prepaid gross adds comprised of about 20% of total gross adds in the third quarter compared to about 14% a year ago. Most of our prepaid subscribers are coming from Brazil and Venezuela. However, we have also recently launched a very popular service in Puerto Rico that has exceeded our expectations and is helping to drive growth there. In addition, the sales of advanced products continue to contribute to our strong topline growth. At the DTVLA level, we are now seeing about 20% of new subscribers sign up for HD or DVR services, which is over twice the rate of a year ago.</p>
          <p>Most of the DVR growth is in PanAmericana, where we have been selling the service for the better part of two years while most of the HD growth is coming out of Brazil, where the service was introduced in the second quarter of this year. We recently enhanced the HD service in Brazil with the addition of several new channels, including HD programming from Globo. We expect to further extend our competitive advantage by adding significantly more HD channels in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the financials, DTVLA's revenue, earnings and cash flow were all quite strong in the quarter, particularly considering some of the weakened currencies in the regions and cash repatriation charges in Venezuela. Revenues of 761 million were up 16%, driven by our strong subscriber growth and a small increase in ARPU. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, revenues would have increased by over 25% reflecting price increases, increased penetration of advanced products, and a larger subscriber base. ARPU of roughly $60 was negatively impact by about $5 in the quarter due to the unfavorable exchange rates mostly in Brazil and Argentina. Excluding the impact of FX, DTVLA's ARPU would have increased about 9% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit before depreciation and amortization declined 9 million in the quarter to 199 million. But that includes a 48 million charge related to the exchange of Venezuelan currency into U.S. dollars as we continue to repatriate cash from Venezuela. In last year's third quarter that charge was only 17 million. Excluding these charges, the OPBDA margin would have been over 30% in the quarter, which reflects the underlying strength of our business. Year-to-date, we've incurred 168 million in charges from repatriating cash from Venezuela, compared with only 26 million through the first nine months of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow before interest and taxes including these charges in Venezuela grew over 60% in the quarter to 81 million, as strong operating results more than offset an increase in CapEx mostly related to higher gross adds and the sale of advanced services.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I'm very pleased with the results in the quarter as I believe they demonstrate DTVLA's competitive and operating strengths. We're also very pleased with the overall macroeconomic conditions throughout the region, which are generally stable if not even favorable. With these strong internal and external trends, our outlook remains extremely bullish as we expect even stronger results in the quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn the call back to Larry for some concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our key near-term operational priorities followed by a quick update on the Liberty transactions. Top on our priority list is to continue delivering strong bottom line results, while introducing new products and services that will further extend our video leadership position. Some of our recent launches have done just that. Streaming NFL games to cell phones for our NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers has proven to be even more popular than we expected. On a typical Sunday, we now have twice as many customers watching games on their cell phones, and in particular iPhones, as we had last year watching on your PCs. Also getting good reviews has been the launch of TV apps a few weeks ago. Similar to the app store concept with the iPhone, customers can download apps providing a wealth of information to their big-screen TV.</p>
          <p>And a couple of weeks ago, we exclusively launched the fourth season of Friday Night Lights. But perhaps more exciting are some of the new services we'll be launching over the coming months. In a few months, we'll start shipping receivers that will provide customers with whole home functionality, including multi-room viewing, broadband connectivity for services such as VOD and TV apps, as well as access to connected PCs to view pictures, music and other media.</p>
          <p>Also in a few months we'll be greatly enhancing our user experience by introducing an industry-leading search engine that in many ways will look and feel like a PC search. The advanced search experience will not only make it significantly easier to find exactly what you are looking for, but will also include photos, DVD, cover art, as well as recommendations for similar shows based on your preferences.</p>
          <p>We're also planning to launch a new movie service next year where customers will be able to access and order thousands of movie from either their PC or TV to view on their big screen TV. This service will be greatly expanded upon the successful launch of our next satellite, D12, which becomes operational in the first half of next year. This new satellite will also increase DIRECTV's HD capacity by 50% to over 200 national channels.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Liberty transactions, as you probably know, we've received all necessary governmental approvals and have scheduled a special shareholder meeting in two weeks on November 19. We expect to complete the merger between DIRECTV and Liberty Entertainment right after receiving shareholder approval. Regarding our search for a new CEO, the process is going well and our goal is to have an announcement in the near future.</p>
          <p>Finally, I know many of you have asked about our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. We recognize the importance of providing clarity on these topics and intend to do so shortly after the newly merged company holds its first board meeting later this month.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I thought both our U.S. and Latin America businesses had very strong quarters demonstrating our competitive strengths, favorable operating trends and most importantly our commitment to deliver significant cash flow growth and to use that cash in a prudent manner to increase shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn the call over to turn Jon so we can begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry. And before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in a listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call, either directly or in substance other than the representatives of the DIRECTV Group. In addition, we are webcasting this call live on the Internet, and an archived copy will be kept on our website.</p>
          <p>Operator, we're ready to take the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from Rick Greenfield with Pali Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Couple of questions, you mentioned all these new initiatives for next year in terms of more advanced set-top boxes, what surprised us is how you've been able to keep SAC as low as you have. What is all these new boxes mean for &#x2013; and functionality mean for SAC next year, how should we think about that?</p>
          <p>And then just a financial question. In terms of cash taxes, you certainly mentioned some benefits this year. What do we think about the overall rate of cash taxes, since you're in the low 20s this year, what's the right way to think about it as we head into 2010? Just broad brush. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On talking about SAC for next year, obviously I guess on both this and the tax question, we're right in the middle of our 2010 planning process. But, yeah, I think we do feel like that we will be making probably a little bit more commitment into the home of products like the broadband connectivity and multi-room viewing which would have a slight upward pressure on SAC but also would help us on the revenue side as we will mainly charge for the installation of those services.</p>
          <p>On taxes, again that one is probably too early. We've certainly benefited from the two stimulus bills that have given us the accelerated depreciation on equipment purchases over the past two years, which we'll pay back next year. So it will be certainly higher than the low 20s, but it's probably too early for us to really have a good range for you there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the ARPU side of the advanced set-tops, do you think you will be getting for the types of features you're adding, do you think you get a significant kind of ongoing ARPU bump from these boxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that there was a couple of things that happened there, we'll probably add a monthly charge for kind of the whole home solution that would include multi-room viewing and broadband connectivity. So, you will get a regular one. And then, we've seen on just kind of the limited basis that we have now on people that are connected to the broadband that they tend to buy more services and produce more revenue.</p>
          <p>And then again on the SAC thing, I guess one thing to remember is we continue to bring down the cost of set-top boxes and then we've also had just a great year on recovering and redeploying set-top boxes and we expect that to continue to grow next year. So, there is certainly countervailing things that help us with keeping kind of SAC where we've seen it lately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak with Hudson Square.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Two questions, do you still feel comfortable you can hit the one plus million net new sub level, add level for full year 2009 given you increased your upfront credit standards and pulled back on retention? That's the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we still think that that is an achievable goal. I mean, obviously we set that target before we tightened up our credit policies, which will have a little bit of damper on gross adds in the fourth quarter, but it's obviously in the best interest of the company and the return that we get. But, again, we're still obviously early into the fourth quarter, but it's potentially still achievable. But like I've said, we've made it a little bit tougher with some of our credit policy changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then can you provide more color on the 2010 limitations on how many shares you can repurchase? I mean, as I understand it you can purchase about 20% of the float, and is that limitation for one year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax considerations associated with the repurchase, we'll be making an announcement after the completion of merger, but I guess in a nutshell that the 20% limitation is a limitation implicit in the representations that we had to make in connection with the revenue ruling. And that would apply with respect to whatever plan we adopt with respect to share repurchases after completion of the merger. So I wouldn't look at that 20% limit as being something that we would necessarily strive to achieve in the first year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. ARPU seems to have been a little bit stronger than expected, any thoughts on longer-term trends and on your guidance for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that in looking at 2010, I think we have said before that we certainly have some things that are working in our favor. We lost a week of the NFL this year that we won't have next year; ad sales has certainly looks like it's kind of come back and rebounded where we're seeing year-over-year improvement; and then we don't have kind of the year-over-year impact of the Telesat lease revenues that we had last year and not this year.</p>
          <p>So, I mean we clearly see ARPU growth better in 2010 than 2009, but again we're kind of right in the middle of looking at a lot of things for 2010 and making decisions on pricing and packaging and other things that will influence it. But we definitely see kind of a more bullish outlook going into 2010 on ARPU.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a question on programming expenses. How are you able to buck the trend in terms of programming expenses, what do you do differently than some of your peers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean again some of it &#x2013; we get asked this a lot &#x2013; I mean I guess the &#x2013; partly is the low programming cost in the quarter. I mean a lot of it honestly is driven by the premiums, which have been kind of a bad news on the revenue, but because their cost is fairly high, it helps us there. We lost a game on the NFL, which had a meaningful impact.</p>
          <p>But we've also done some other things than just the negotiations to really try to slow down the rate of growth. But I think part of it too is we're still growing, and I think some of our competitors are either flat or losing subs, so to the extent they have a percentage of fixed cost in their programming, it's going to hurt them more for us on while we're growing. We receive the benefit of that. And I think it could be that we've &#x2013; some of the cost that others are putting on to their programming now, we've already been through in the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now I know there's a bunch of retransmission consent agreements coming up at the end of this year and into next year, do you think that that will impact programming expenses going forward for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean if you look at where we are in the life cycle of our programming agreements, all of the big broadcasters we have &#x2013; we entered into multi-year agreements. So we don't have any kind of big retrans agreements coming up until clearly after 2010 on many of the kind of the big network guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just two quick questions. The first is just a follow-up on programming cost. Pat, maybe could you give us a sense of what programming cost per sub was excluding premiums and the NFL impact?</p>
          <p>And then secondly I was hoping you could give us a little bit more detail on the subscriber service spending and exactly drove that increase? Was that more call centers, more people on the phones, more training? Any more color would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah. On the programming, I think if you back out some of those it's still if you were to look at the five plus percent that we were last year, we would have still been better than that 5.3% even without these couple of items that have probably the biggest impact.</p>
          <p>On subscriber services, I mean, part of it is again like we' said, we're really focused on the quality metrics, kind of speed to answer, first call resolution, things like that. So again, we're &#x2013; our tendency is to kind of make sure that it's quality first and then kind of try to get the efficiencies out of that &#x2013; out of the call centers as much as we can. Also we've seen some kind of rise in just the service calls and we're attacking all of the root causes of things that would cause us to roll a truck and we've had some great success in things like we've mentioned before like install verification now where all of boxes going into a home have to go through a test to make sure that their quality of signal is where it should be.</p>
          <p>So we're fighting at kind of all angles to try to bring down the volume of service calls and kind of manage the growth in that cost category. But again quality is kind of our number one focus and I guess our view is that the costs will follow as we get better at the quality at all aspects of that area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Two quick ones, first on churn. It looks like churn was obviously a little bit elevated this quarter. Is this a good run rate going forward into 2010 or is it just a situation where you've got to churn through this sort of group of customers out there looking for a fair better deal?</p>
          <p>And then just to clarify on the &#x2013; the Board meeting you referenced earlier in your prepared remarks, does that mean we can get some more clarifications about sort of potentially reloading the buyback going forward? It looks like you're down, you said only about 300 million; after a big buyback in the quarter obviously that's &#x2013; you're going to eat through that pretty quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess on the first, and I'll let Larry answer the second. On the churn side of it, I mean we do, looking into the fourth quarter, we think again the churn in the fourth quarter will be modestly higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. A lot of the things that we're doing I think to kind of control quality also on the front end like this credit screening, changes that we talked about, we're making in the fourth quarter and there is a bunch of other kind of smaller things behind the scenes that we're doing to make sure that we bring on quality customers who are going to stay, I think they'll have an ongoing benefit, but it takes a while to see the impact of those changes of not bringing those customers on. So, we are not ready to kind of talk about 2010 churn, but fourth quarter will be like I said modestly up over the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regards to stock buyback, to be consistent with the revenue ruling and the other guidance we have been &#x2013; the new Board will adopt the stock buyback plan post transaction. We would expect that to happen on the same day or the next day after the merger closes. And again since the Board is the same as our existing Board I'll just reaffirm, we continue to believe that our stock is under priced and that that's a very good use for our cash.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Hi, gentlemen. A few quick ones, what have you seen so far in 4Q regarding competitive behavior relative to what you saw in 3Q? That's the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean again I think we've seen &#x2013; I would say it's been, it's some of the &#x2013; our competitors have backed off slightly in the fourth quarter, but there's still some very, very strong competitive offers, DISH Network has a strong offer that they saw in the third quarter that they've continued into the fourth. And we've seen some video, some pretty strong video only offers out there as well. But kind of if I were to gauge it between third and fourth, I would say slightly less on the kind of the promotional offers in fourth quarter versus third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. You're pretty well into the football seasonal now and based on what you've seen so far, are you still on track do you think for the revised NFL Sunday Ticket contract to remain breakeven or profitable over its life? I think that's what you've indicated at the time of the renewal, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that we had a very good NFL season this year. It was &#x2013; exceeded our expectations on both just overall the subscribers taking Sunday Ticket and those people also signing up for SuperFan. So obviously, got a lot of years left with the four years that we extended the contract, but we are certainly seeing good strong demand for that product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last, what's left for charges in 4Q for Venezuela, and is there a way for you to tell us of the full-year 2009 charges, how much of that was sort of normal ongoing related 2009 cash flow and how much was pulling cash out for prior years that you'd been holding back on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the year we've talked about a number that's around 200 million total. I think we're about at 170, 175 through this year. So it might be a little north of that. I think probably if you look at the run rate in the last couple &#x2013; so let's say in Q3 and in Q4 even is probably a good proxy for what the run rate might be going forward because we're pretty much at the point now where the amount of cash left in Venezuela is really there for working capital purposes, so anything that comes out over the course of the quarter is what's just been generated and needs to be pulled out in order to pay suppliers for boxes, satellite payments that kind of thing.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>They should be less, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little hard to say, I guess, depends on how well the business grows. But I suppose there is certainly &#x2013; there was certainly an element in 2009 of repatriating cash that had been built up. So I guess, but if the business continues to operate at the level that it's been going then I suppose you're right it's going to be &#x2013; and grows, it could well very be at that same level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick questions. Can you just provide a bit more detail on sort of the tactical mechanics that happened between now and hopefully deal close? In other words, you alluded to the shareholder meeting, how long do they have to vote on that and are there any other gating factors after that?</p>
          <p>And then second, I just wanted to clarify your point regarding the 20% limitation, was the point you were trying to convey that you're intent isn't really to bump up against that ceiling within the first year and so it's not really material? Is that the right take-away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the second question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, the process from this point is really just getting the shareholder vote in. I don't know if you noticed RiskMetrics came out with a recommendation of for on all the vote on the DIRECTV side, which we expected. And so far at least the vote is overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction. So we don't see an impediment there. And then the rest of it is just process, just getting paper done and I guess I would be reasonably confident that our lawyers will get that paper done so it would close on the 19th.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions. I guess basically in Venezuela the official rate's 2.15 and the parallel rate I think is over five, so basically I assume you're just washing that through on a normalized basis going forward and it's going to go up just as much as your business grows?</p>
          <p>And then secondly if you could update us on CapEx requirement in Latin America, medium-term, I mean you've really hit an inflection point, are you perhaps inclined to invest capital more there?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just domestically if you could update us on SWM-8 and what's going on there, as popularity of the product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me &#x2013; I think your point is correct on the Venezuela cash, I'm not sure exactly what the question was, but, you're right that the efficient rate is two, that the parallel rate is between running &#x2013; has been running sort of between five and six. So, assuming that there is no change from the SEC in terms of how we have to do our accounting, yes, you will continue to see that we will just pull that cash out sort of at the run rate we've been going next year as we have this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on CapEx, obviously the biggest &#x2013; what tends to really drive our CapEx is the number of gross adds. And I think that combined with the fact that we're having more success in selling advanced products will also tend to drive the CapEx up a bit as well. There is no huge or significantly large non-SAC related CapEx expense in the years ahead, certainly not next year that would materially change the non-SAC CapEx. We do have a new satellite coming in and I think there is a modest payment next year and a payment the year after that. But again, these are not &#x2013; they are not big numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But with regard to the set-top box cost, I mean, you're now getting pricing that's about very close to U.S. pricing because we get the benefit of having moved to technologies so that it's comparable across -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just as Pat spoke earlier about our ability to get cost down over time with a lot of these products, we benefit from all of that in Latin America as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the SWM, we are using the SWM on all of our HD installs starting here in the fourth quarter. Then again we think that they're even though it adds a little bit of cost to the installation that the benefits far outweigh the cost as far as ease of installation and back channel phone line and ability also next year to help us with broadband connection and multi-room viewing. So it's gone very well, and then we also think it helps on reliability as well.</p>
          <p>One other thing on Venezuela, Bruce kind of hinted at it, but the accounting bodies are again looking at this issue in Venezuela about whether companies should report their financial results at the parallel rate or the official rate. I think our preference would be to just report our P&amp;L at the parallel rate which is more is reflective of &#x2013; that's how we're running the business anyway. But I'm not sure how they'll conclude on that discussion, but there certainly is a possibility that we may change next year and start reporting at the parallel rate.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. Two quick things, one, can you talk about where you are with the evolution of your VOD product, and how that's going to be expanding as we head into next year and can you share any usage statistics associated with VOD as well? And then also can you just comment on your confidence and your ability to drive margin expansion next year? Thanks.</p>

          <p>On VOD we have &#x2013; at any given time around five to 600,000 customers that are connected to broadband. We have a much larger population that's more in the three to four million range of those people that would be able to connect to VOD. We do see a lot more usage, and I guess interaction with those that are hooked up to VOD and they do tend to buy more pay-per-view services than those who are not.</p>
          <p>I mean again we continue to work on making that product robust and also to make the user experience the best that we can. That part of what we're talking about as kind of the DIRECTV movies that will get more robust next year. I mean the fact that people are hooked up to broadband that will certainly help to complement that whole process. And then there was a second &#x2013; second question was?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, margin expansion. Yeah, no, again I think we feel very confident about our ability with ARPU, like we said, we do feel like it will be up year-over-year. And we are clearly focused on all of our cash &#x2013; cost categories. Programming, obviously is a tough one, but it's like with our stance with Versus. I mean I think we're going to certainly have to take some tougher stands to slow down the growth of that category.</p>
          <p>We've done a really good job on as we mentioned on keeping SAC and ROM and then kind of all of our other G&amp;A and broadcast ops cost growing at a slower rate than revenue. And then the one category subscriber services that's been growing faster than revenue, again as we mentioned before, we think there is a very good opportunity to slow the growth of that category while still maintaining the quality. So, no, I feel very good our ability to continue to expand margins.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I got a couple. Can you talk about the telco mix in gross adds? I think you mentioned earlier that AT&amp;T had sort of scaled and so what's that sort of running and has that improved or declined?</p>
          <p>And second, if you can talk about TV Everywhere concept, I know you guys are working on it. I haven't heard you guys talk about when you sort of plant to roll that out? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the telco mix, I think we've said before once kind of AT&amp;T launched and kind of got into the mainstream, that the telcos as a percentage of gross adds are usually in the kind of 20 to 25% range, and that's where they were in the third quarter. On TV Everywhere I guess we don't talk about it publicly that much, but we are very active in talking to that content providers and talking about ways to authenticate. So, I think we feel that we're in a very good position along with the other distributors to be ready to start to kind of control the access of programming to people that are pay TV providers next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. Not unless we went back to the IRS and got specific approval for that. I mean again the authorization or the clarification that we got was a customary open market stock repurchases. And again we'd have to go back and get an additional -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think Vijay in all honesty, I mean kind of since this was the first time they'd really addressed this in a ruling, I think they were probably more conservative in their view on this, but we felt like open market purchases gave us ample opportunity to continue to return cash to the shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the marketplace? You know for example Comcast said on this quarter's call that about 50% of the impact to marketplace was the economy and about 50% was competition. Time Warner Cable said it was more &#x2013; kind of more impacted by competition. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about your sense of how those two factors impacted subscriber growth in the quarter. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean again, I think if you look at the quarter from the gross add perspective obviously we were up 8% year-over-year. I mean some of that was AT&amp;T being added, but I think that from our standpoint again we continued to see strong demand for our product. I think as we've said before I think when you look at the economy and its effect on our business, we see it more on just the what people buy and particularly add-on services like pay-per-view movies or the premium channels. So, we do find people that are definitely looking at their monthly bill and trying to make sure that it's right-sized for affordability. But on the demand side, we've again continued to see a strong demand for our product. So, it's hard for us to kind of look at the economy and say it's...</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess looking at it a different way, you saw an increase in churn, would you &#x2013; do you see more of an increase in voluntary churn or in involuntary churn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw a little bit of both, our involuntary churn has been pretty good. It was up just a very small amount in the quarter and voluntary was up, I think we've mentioned partly because we reined in a little bit of just how much where we were willing to spend to keep certain segments of customers. But, yeah, I think we've said before that probably the economy when you look at voluntary churn what we are finding is that people are probably more sensitive and more willing to change service providers and be lured away by promotional offers where they can reduce their monthly bill. So, I think we've said for a while if there's anything it's the economy hasn't really hurt us that much in involuntary, people not being able to pay their bill.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The cable operators talked about improving their two-play offers, potentially to target satellite customers who say, don't take broadband. Any thought on how you may either try to compete with that or work with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I think that we've seen kind of some two-play non-video offers before, and again I think we feel like that that's potentially good opportunity for us. It's &#x2013; a comment that we saw which were &#x2013; we would agree with is that there's a lot of our customers, as Larry said, are certainly very happy with our product and don't have a desire to leave us. And so if our competitors want to try to provide the other services into the home, that's a compliment.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi with Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I do have a couple questions as well. The first one is on the &#x2013; I think you in the prepared remarks I heard some comment about the potential upside on the commercial and MDU market. So can you perhaps help us to size that opportunity as you see it, and what specifically that you're doing right now to the tap into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. On the commercial &#x2013; between kind of commercial and MDU it's probably somewhere around 10% of our gross adds. So it's not a big number for the size of that market. So a couple things, on the commercial side I mean we've seen good growth in that market. We had some pricing and packaging that we changed about a year ago that really was making us hard to compete against our competitors in that area. And that's one where again we haven't put a probably the amount of focus and attention and money behind that segment as we should.</p>
          <p>And so we do think that that's one where particularly with our kind of domination of sports, that that's an area that we should do very well on. And we are confident that we can grow that segment faster than some of the other kind of more mature segments for us.</p>
          <p>On MDU, we've talked about before, I mean, we're moving more to a model where we own &#x2013; where we kind of build out the buildings versus having an agent kind of have control over the building. We've started to do that in the kind of the late summer and are continuing it through the fall. And then I think we'll step back and kind of look at kind of how we can do, I mean it all gets down to kind of the penetration level that you can get into the MDUs. But we're definitely on to a process where we're identifying kind of ideal units and then negotiating to build those out and then test our theories on our ability to really drive much better penetration by controlling the interface with the tenants in those buildings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It sounds like it is still in the relatively early stages. If I can switch gears to a financial question on CapEx. I think in the past that you had said that your expectations was around 500 million excluding set-top boxes for 2009. Can you update us on that outlook, where you stand currently, and it seems like that is looking somewhat conservative, am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No. I mean again, I think we're still kind of for non-set-top box, we still kind of have a target of kind of in the 500 million range, and that's kind of a number I think that we've thrown out kind of sustaining, if you take satellites out of the equation, that we think around 500 million is where we land on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, in Latin America, it seems like &#x2013; how would you assess the opportunities for further consolidation, particularly given the recent trends and the currency movements et cetera? Do you feel like you might be in a sweet spot to kind of make some moves over there in the year ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure what you're getting, consolidation of what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of certain kind of assets or any opportunities to add some scale over there, not necessarily on the satellite side, but maybe on some complementary services related to your core business? I mean how would you assess the overall market right now in Latin America as to the M&amp;A opportunities that might fit your core business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that kind of thing is always very speculative, but I think that you're talking about the opportunity to work with telcos looking to do, for example, broadband bundles. We do do some of that, honestly we've had more success in some places versus others. For example, we're very successful in Colombia at the moment with our local partner ETB in Bogota. But I think the first step in a lot of these area will probably be more in the line of commercial arrangements and commercial partnerships as we have done in the United States than it would be M&amp;A.</p>

          <p>We have time for just one more question. We'll go with Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. It's Ben. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll just ask a question on how you are thinking about ARPU and programming costs over the next couple of years. Pat, if you think that the environment &#x2013; credit environment and what's happening on retrans and you touched on some of this stuff on the call, but do you think your margin just sort of gross margin after programming can be held flat over time or is there going to be pressure on that line and you sort of have to find the leverage in your more fixed operating costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean I think that we do have some good opportunity there, like I said, we haven't kind of settled in on where we think ARPU growth can be in 2010 and beyond. A lot of the things that people seem to be concerned about on programming costs growth because of the fact that we entered into some &#x2013; most of our really big contracts into multi-year agreements that go on for a few more years, we're not going to have to address stuff like rising retrans costs. So, we are &#x2013; probably more than ever are really looking at any of our programming contracts that come up and really looking at it more from a financial perspective of are we getting the value out of that channel that the content owner is asking for.</p>
          <p>And I guess, I've certainly been an advocate that the programming, there &#x2013; I think there should be some rationalization there, I don't know that there will be. But at some point obviously it seems like the value of all of these pieces is adding up to more of the value of the whole of these packages. So I think that there does need to be some better rationalization in there and I think &#x2013; I hope that other distributors do it as well, but I think we need to be very, very conscious of what it is that the customer is willing to pay for and what they are not willing to pay for.</p>
