          <p>[Call Starts Abruptly] ...given the evolution of the business results in more detail. And finally, I will end with our vision and our growth engines for 2009.</p>
          <p>First idea I'd like to put across is that Santander has achieved excellent results. The sharp economic downturn, the extreme volatility of markets and the scarcity of liquidity and capital has affected all banks in varying degrees.</p>
          <p>As I've discussed before, this environment is a major acid test for banks. And it will enable us to distinguish the good and well-managed banks from the rest. And Santander is clearly amongst the former. And I say this for four reasons: the size and the recurrence of our profits; the strength of our balance sheet; the payout to our shareholders through dividends and total return; and lastly, the improved potential and diversification of our business portfolio. And I will examine each of these points.</p>
          <p>We have ended 2008 with fully ordinary attributable profit of &#x20AC;8.8 billion, 9% higher than the attributable profit of 2007, excluding capital gains and extraordinary provisions. These 8.876 billion include the charge of this last quarter for the fund established to the customers affected by Madoff and Lehman.</p>
          <p>We have managed to increase our profit with a contribution of every geographic area. The three major areas have increased their profits at a good rate in their respective currencies. Plus, we had the contribution of the Banco Real. The fourth quarter was good one, it was a good one in Europe, particularly in wholesale banking, also excellent in the U.K. And the situation was slightly weaker in Latin America because of the strong impact of exchange rates, especially versus the dollar, and some write-downs in Mexico. Ordinary EPS also rose by 2.4%, up to &#x20AC;1.22 per share.</p>
          <p>As I've pointed out in the last quarter, we have established a fund for those affected by Madoff and Lehman for a total, net of tax, &#x20AC;450 million. This fund has been charged to the corporate center's gains on financial transactions against ordinary results. As a result, the fourth quarter's profit was below what was the Group's recurrent run rate of around 2.2, 2.3 billion a quarter. In any case, the strength of our P&amp;L account has enabled us to endow this fund and to increase our recurrent profits for the whole of the year by 9%.</p>
          <p>Additionally, or on top of increasing recurrent profit, Santander generated 3.572 billion in extraordinary capital gains after taxes in 2008. Five hundred eighty-six million had already been announced from the sale of the Santander Financial City and the gains corresponding to the distribution and subsequent sales of the ABN liabilities, 741 million; we add the 2.245 billion from the sale of the Italian business, businesses acquired from ABN. So the Group's total profit combining ordinary profit and capital gains was &#x20AC;12.448 billion.</p>
          <p>In the current environment, we have preferred to be conservative and to allocate all of the capital gains to various funds and write-downs: 1.43 billion to record at fair market value the stakes in Fortis and Royal Bank of Scotland; 904 million to amortize Abbey's intangibles, brand and core deposits; 386 million for a fund which includes the restructuring costs that might be needed for the integration of the acquisitions made in 2007 and 2008; 382 million for an early retirement fund; 295 million to amortize Santander Consumer Finance goodwill and portfolios; and finally, 175 million for a fund that anticipates any further deterioration due to the crisis. All of these allocations either strengthen our capital ratios or anticipate future charges which will no longer have an impact on the Group's results in coming years.</p>
          <p>The application of all capital gains means that they will not feed through to the bottom line, unlike what happened in previous years. As a consequence, the total attributable profit for 2008, all of which is ordinary, is 2% lower than the total profits of 2007 where we included 950 million in capital gains net of allocations. This evolution puts us amongst the top three banks in growth and attributable profit and EPS in comparison with our peer group; that is the 20 large international banking groups, which because of their size, characteristics or competitive position, are our reference group for comparisons.</p>
          <p>This enables us to continue to climb up the global ranking in absolute profit in 2008. And based on reported figures or market consensus, we are the fourth bank worldwide in terms of profit, the second if we exclude the Chinese banks. But what's even more important is that of the banks which were in that top ten in 2006, we're one of the only two that remain in that list, and the only one to grow its profit. In my view, this is a good example of the resilience of our banking model to extraordinarily complex environment.</p>
          <p>My second point is the strength of our balance sheet. In a world in which the soundness and the strength of banks' balance sheet are constantly being questioned, Santander has a well-capitalized balance sheet with very low risks and high liquidity. It's a very liquid balance sheet. Our deposits, excluding Repos and capital finance, cover more than 80% of our customers' loans net of securitizations. And we have improved our position during 2008 when our deposits grew without taking into account the exchange rate effect by 119 billion, of which 40 are organic growth distributed almost a third between Spain, the rest of Europe and Latin America, and 79 from acquisitions.</p>
          <p>It's a very plain vanilla balance sheet, and it's all about the retail business. Loans account for 60% of our assets, and 90% of our loans are retail and have high collateral. This is a clear example of a retail banking balance sheet. And it reflects the performance of the Santander and in general of Spanish banks who have spent the last few years making loans instead of investing in financial assets. Which, in practice, has meant lending more to the real economy than in any other European country.</p>
          <p>The NPL ratios and coverage ratios are good, and we ended 2008 with almost &#x20AC;12.9 billion in provisions of which 6.2 billion are generic.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we have high quality capital. Our core capital is at 7.23%, which we combine with a shareholders equity-over-total-assets of 4%.</p>
          <p>Let's look at these last two points in more detail. In a recessionary environment, our NPL rates have increased and will continue to rise. Therefore, our competitive advantage will depend on our starting point and the evolution compared to our competitors. And in both, we're doing very well, both at the Group level and also in the three main areas where we operate. In Spain, our evolution over the last years has clearly been better, especially in the last few quarters in which we have stood out from the rest of the sector. And something similar happens in the U.K. We also compare very favorably in Latin America.</p>
          <p>To conclude speaking about the strength of our balance sheet, I'll say a few words about capital. We ended 2008 with a core capital ratio of 7.23%. It's a very high ratio in relative terms for several reasons, because of the low risk in our balance sheet, and because of our stricter definition of core capital. In the future, I remind you that in the first quarter, we will have the impact from Sovereign's incorporation. In the current growth context, we are capable of generating between 10 and 15 basis points in free capital per quarter. This confirms our objective of maintaining core capital ratios of around 7%.</p>
          <p>The third point which distinguishes Santander from its competitors is its payout. The evolution of our profit in 2008 and our confidence in our ability to generate future recurrent results enables us to suggest to the future AGM, a nominal dividend per share charge to the results of 2008, equal to that of 2007; that is 0.65 per share. To repeat the same nominal dividend means, in practice, to increase the effective dividend paid into the shareholders' current account of 4.2% because of the larger number of shares they now own after the capital increase with rights completed in December without need for disbursement. This is a good example of Santander's commitment towards its shareholders, who in the last 10 years have seen their dividends grow by a cumulative annual rate of 14%.</p>
          <p>If together with the dividend we also take into account share prices, the Santander's total shareholder return, or TSR, was higher than the market's and our peer's average. And we do this both short, medium and long-term, as you can see in these charts.</p>
          <p>The fourth and last point is that we have taken advantage of the opportunities, in order to improve our business portfolio in our markets, in our core markets and businesses. I'm not going to go into detail because these are all operations we've reported already, and which you're all sufficiently familiar with. However, I will summarize by saying that they all give us a great ability to grow our earnings in coming years, both in terms of revenues, but also because of the expected strong synergies.</p>
          <p>Going into the results, I'd like to first clarify something. The Banco Real consolidated in the first quarter for the first time by global integration, which means that the Group's balance sheet incorporated for the first time in December the Banco Real's balance sheet. And the income statement that has been incorporated in the first nine months with the equity accounted method has been consolidated in this last fourth quarter for every line in the P&amp;L account.</p>
          <p>And this consolidation gives us the changes versus 2007, which you see in the first column. The percentage variations, except for profit, cannot be compared easily with P&amp;L lines of other quarters. For that reason, we have included a second column of comparisons based on what the Group would have looked like if Banco Real had been accounted for using the equity method in the fourth quarter as well. In this way, it is easier to make a like-for-like comparison with the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>I will refer to these figures in my analysis, which I can summarize as follows. First: consistent solid commercial revenues, which in a recessionary environment have nevertheless grown by 12%. Second: flexibility in order to adjust the costs, which have only grown by 1.8%. Third: management of our draws or our net operating income, rising by 16%, which has enabled us to absorb the rise in provisions. And fourth: our net operating income minus provisions and profit have grown very strongly supported by the different business areas.</p>
          <p>I will first refer to our solid, more commercial revenues, that is, net interest income without dividend, plus fees, plus insurance; which had risen for 16 straight quarters, and not in the fourth quarter because of the strong impact of exchange rates in Latin America. As you can see in these charts, the bottom of the slide, even in a very stressful scenario like the one in this fourth quarter, Europe and the U.K. have grown. And it's only Latin America which falls, due, as I've explained, to exchange rate impacts. This, as it trends, reflect a very good business performance of our unit and their strong cycle resilience, given our high degree of geographic and business diversification.</p>
          <p>In loans, we're still growing in our major markets. In Spain, lending has grown by 5%, in the U.K. by 10% in sterling without incorporations, in Brazil and Chile by around 20%, and in Mexico by 8%. As far as customer funds, we have focused on deposits. We've increased deposits by 14% organically, to which we can add acquisitions. And we've considerably improved the ratio of loans funded by deposits. We've improved our spreads in the last few quarters, especially for loans. So in summary, spreads and volumes are being successfully managed in the whole Group. And as a result, all the large units have experienced significant growth in their net interest income and their return on assets.</p>
          <p>The second basic pillar for our results is our sustained cost income improvements. In a period when revenues grow more slowly, you need to be stricter managing costs. Our recent cost performance is the best example of that focus. In a year of strong revenue growth like 2007, costs rose by 10.5% through projects and investments. We began 2008 with costs growing at 5.7%, and we've ended the year with costs growing only by 1.8%. This adjustment in our revenue and cost growth has enabled us in 2008 to maintain our "jaws" wide open at around 8 percentage points, and to continue to improve our cost income ratio, which was 2.3 percentage points better. And we are one of the few large banks which improved their cost-income ratio this year.</p>
          <p>Third point referred to our provisions. In the current context, provisions grew by 61% for various reasons. The first and most important, because of a macroeconomic environment which has worsened more quickly than predicted. Another reason is the growth in lending, which in some units, as we have seen, still rising by around 20%. Both effects impact our specific provisions.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile in the fourth quarter, we have begun to recover generic provisions with two components: those derived from business performance for around 300 million for the Group; and those originated by substandard provisioning in Spain, 380 million, which were due to a specific risk classification we have to meet according to the regulator. These risks have to be provisioned with generic provisions by 10%.</p>
          <p>We will now look at the comparison of specific and generic provisions by areas. Starting with the column on the left, specific provisions, there's nothing new in comparison with previous quarters. And growth is still concentrated in Europe, and more specifically in Spain, both in our retail network and in Consumer Finance because of the sharp NPL rises. And in Latin America, in Mexico with cards. Abbey, on the other hand, was a lot more stable.</p>
          <p>As for generic provisions, we've begun to use them up in the fourth quarter, as I've mentioned earlier. We ended the year with a fund of 12.863 billion loan loss allowances, of which 6.181 billion are generic. Of these, almost four billion are in Spain. With the theories we're working on and our consensus scenario, our generic allowances should last us at least two years, 2009 and 2010. Later, we will see why.</p>
          <p>So in summary, revenue management, as well as, cost and provision control should enable us to maintain the quarterly recurring profit in 2009 that we had obtained in 2008 in all of our business areas.</p>
          <p>And I will now give the floor to Jose Antonio Alvarez so he can explain the business areas in more detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As we tend to do every quarter, now that the Chief Executive Officer has discussed the main aspects, I will talk in a little more detail about each of the business units.</p>
          <p>In connection with what the CEO has just explained and as we saw in some of those last slides, I'd like to highlight the sustainability of our revenue generation and the strength of revenue generation in our businesses, which have shown sustained growth throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Second, very strict cost management, which has been mentioned also by the CEO; those 8 or 9 percentage point "jaws" that we've managed to preserve. Which have enabled us to grow our net operating income by almost 20% with sustainable growth throughout the year. And this net operating income is what enables us to absorb the significant growth in provisions throughout the year, and to nevertheless grow our profits by 10% or 7%, if we don't incorporate Banco Real in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Going down to the first geographical area, Continental Europe, you can see that attributable profit was of over &#x20AC;4.9 billion, 11% higher than in 2007. I wanted to basically underscore two ideas: one is the growth of income. Gross operating income grew by 15% (sic) [14%], and also a very significant recovery of our wholesale revenue, which we had announced for the coming quarters, but which has been noticeable already in the fourth quarter. And we'll talk about this when we talk about wholesale banking.</p>
          <p>We've adjusted our costs very sharply. We've ended the year at below 2% growth, and that has enabled us in Continental Europe to finish the year with a record cost-income ratio of 35.5%. Obviously, as mentioned already, this has enabled us to increase our provisions, given the worsening NPL environment.</p>
          <p>If we look at the four main units in Continental Europe, looking first at all of them overall, we see income growing at 15%, net operating income growing at 20%, so profits growing 10% because of increased provisioning. For the Santander and Banesto Branch Network it's good revenue management and cost containment, and both units, as the CEO has explained, have begun at the end of the year to release some generic provisions. And that has enabled them to moderate the growth in provisioning we had experienced in the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>In Santander Consumer Finance, the gross and net operating income grew very strongly. However, this does not feed through to profit because of the significant impact of NPLs, very much due to Spain; where we'll see in more detail by country, later, and you will see that the falling profits in Spain is what has brought about this fall in profits in the whole area.</p>
          <p>Portugal's performance very flat, although in 2007 there was a significant global wholesale banking contribution, which wasn't there in 2008. And Global businesses, as I've mentioned already and as we'll analyze later, Wholesale Banking has had an excellent fourth quarter. The year has had a very positive evolution, and then the final months of the year in comparison with 2007, which was weak.</p>
          <p>Looking at the different units, the Santander Network: moderate rise in lending, good growth in deposits, very good spread management, costs under control and growth in specific provisioning. And in the last quarter, we've released some generic provisions. For 2009, the drivers will not be business volumes. There won't be a significant volume growth in &#x2013; well, there will be in deposits, but not in lending. And the drivers for our revenues will basically depend on our spreads for loans, good cost control and the release of generic provisions, which should enable us to spur our net operating income, both for Santander and the Banesto networks.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to go into detail about Banesto. The trends are very similar to those of our retail networks. The only difference is that in their results, their attributable profit grew by 13%, because their generic fund was those 165 in the extraordinary line, which we haven't applied here. As for the trends, there 's nothing to add in Banesto that's any different to what I've already pointed out for the Santander Retail Network.</p>
          <p>As for Santander Finance, although &#x2013; our consumer finance &#x2013; it's obviously 55% based on automobile sales. And of course times have been difficult with automobiles sales dropping in every country, particularly in Spain where the evolution has been worse because of market conditions. However, Germany, which represents 5% of our profits, generated &#x20AC;380 million net in the year. And so that's going very well with double-digit growth of almost 19%. So good news is that the spreads have started to improve in the last quarter after several, almost two years of falls, have changed direction in the last quarter and have started to improve.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we expect the market to remain stagnant, assumption to stay low, but our competitive position's very good. We are gaining market share. There's lots of our competitors who are no longer in the business in this very difficult environment. And so we feel that we have a bad market ahead, but a very good competitive position. Improved spreads, as I've mentioned already, and our costs will be enhanced by synergies, mostly by integrating the GE businesses in Germany. However, we do expect a big rise in provisions, which will bring us to, I would say, a fairly similar result to what we've seen in 2008 with the same trends we saw in 2008.</p>
          <p>As for Portugal, I mentioned when I was talking about Continental Europe, I mentioned the impact in the difference in Wholesale Banking between 2007, 2008. Our margins in Portugal recovered later than in our asset spreads because of regulatory changes that happened in the last part of 2007 and towards the end of 2008 in terms of how you calculate the rates to be applied. And that's had an impact on the results for 2008. But for 2009, we don't really expect major changes with respect to what we've seen in 2008 in Portugal.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our second geographical area, the U.K. There's a change of perimeter with the incorporation of the Bradford &amp; Bingley results with minus &#xA3;10 million. But we're not incorporated Alliance &amp; Leicester, whose balance sheet was consolidated at the end of 2008, but not the income statement.</p>
          <p>When I speak about the U.K., I should explain what the market is doing. What they call personal financial services is a market which is growing in the U.K. Gross operating income growing by 4%, and profits dropping slightly, minus 2, minus 3%. This is in contrast with our own trend, with gross operating income growing at 18% in sterling, our costs rising at 6%. If we exclude the Bradford &amp; Bingley effect, it would be only 3%, and our net operating income has grown by over 20%. So we've had an excellent quarterly performance, although in the last quarter I should mention, as you can see in the chart on the top right hand side, there is a consistent evolution of Retail banking in the U.K. Wholesale banking has done very well in the last quarter. But profits do not feed through, because there's been generic provisions for &#xA3;50 million in this part of the business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the next point, and I'm sorry because this is a slightly complicated slide to read. But here on the right hand side, we've tried to show Abbey's results, and on the left, business volumes; because there's two changes in perimeter here. The red part is Abbey, which performed excellently. It grew its deposits and mortgages with double-digit growth. Personal loans have dropped. And we see the grey and the white parts, which are the impact on the balance sheet of incorporating A&amp;L. That's the grey part. And the white part, the 20.9 million in deposits from Bradford &amp; Bingley. So in the end, if we look at the numbers: 160 million in mortgages, billion; 120 in deposits; personal loan million, business of seven million. And here it says Corporate Banking, but that's in the English sense of corporate. This is as to me, it's not really corporate in the sense of major corporations. So the idea basically is that we have sufficient critical mass in the U.K. to compete successfully in that market, and the trends are very positive. I'd also like to mention especially the excellent evolution of deposits in the fourth quarter, which I think somehow reflects the confidence in our subsidiaries in the U.K. in difficult market circumstances.</p>
          <p>As for A&amp;L and Bradford &amp; Bingley, I just mention that when we bought Bradford &amp; Bingley's deposits back in September, we said we were buying 20 billion, 19.9. And we expected a potential decline of 20% of those deposits because of the change of ownership. We have a good news there. Actually, deposits have grown by 1 billion. And so we now have 20.9 billion in deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley, which is excellent. And for Alliance &amp; Leicester loans, as you know, the transfer of applications into loans takes three months. And we've had a containment policy. So mortgages have dropped by a billion, but &#x2013; by a million &#x2013; but deposits have grown by 2.3.</p>
          <p>For 2009, of course, we are starting to play in a different league, because we have the impact on our perimeter of A&amp;L and Bradford &amp; Bingley, we'll benefit from the synergies, spreads are helping. However, the economic environment is very difficult, and provisions will undoubtedly grow. Our CEO will tell you a bit more about that at the end.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Latin America, we include Banco Real. We show the figures with and without Banco Real so you can compare the different courses. There's a very significant impact of exchange rates in this quarter. I'll try and elaborate on that. Without Banco Real, net operating income up 27%, attributable profit, 9%. But in terms of results, we've had poor results in Mexico, and in Banesto's part in Brazil with a bad ROS in the quarter. Which, however, does not tarnish the very positive underlying trend for the business. In general, although there is deceleration in Latin America, as well as in the rest of the world, they're not in recession, with perhaps the exception of Mexico. Which I think it was yesterday or the day before, where they were predicting GDP drops of 1.8%, I think, for 2009.</p>
          <p>But going down now to the main units, you can see that revenues are growing well, that our net operating income shows costs under control. And also, our profits are highly impacted by the dollar exchange rate, because these results are all in dollars. In Brazil, up 31% including Real; 4% excluding Real. I've mentioned the unusual fourth quarter because of the low ROS.</p>
          <p>Chile, up 12%, before discontinued operations. In pesos, the growth would have been about 20%. So here we have a strong dollar impact, too. Mexico is the exception, with profits falling by 2%. I'll speak about the effects in the fourth quarter because of exchange rate provisions and increasing generic provisions due to regulatory changes. The Other countries growing very successfully with very good performances in our attributable profit of 37%. And also Private Banking growing at around 20%.</p>
          <p>For Brazil, the <mark type="inaudible" />, I don't know if you can see it in the net operating income, the impact of the exchange rate was very important. However, the corporate center did very well. It was a very volatile quarter in terms of market, and so financial revenues were very low. And we are in a transition period with, immersed in this integration and harmonizing criteria. And that has affected some items in our P&amp;L, especially specific provisions.</p>
          <p>For 2009, Brazil's economy is decelerating, but not going into recession. Or, I think we're still where we were in Investors Day. We expect the GDP to grow at around 2%; lending to slow down, but to continue to grow between 10 and 15%; inflation under control; interest rates on the way down; and the government can promote internal consumption. And we have some positive momentum, which makes us feel rather positive in terms of achieving the targets that we reported in our Investors Day at the beginning of November in Brazil.</p>
          <p>As for Mexico, it's been a bad quarter for Mexico, especially if we look at it in dollars. But we also have the exchange rate effect. But apart from that, there has been losses and trading gains, $75 million the impact of Commercial Mexicana. And there was another impact of 50 million for generic provisions for credit cards. That, together with a few weaknesses in terms of fees and cards, we're talking about an impact of 130 to $140 million, and negative impact.</p>
          <p>As for 2009, the macroeconomic environment is not good. The country is in a recession, growing at minus 1 or 2%. As to lending, we expect to have about 5% growth. The inflation is falling. We will have to carry out cost exercise. And although the CEO will mention this later, in credit cards we don't expect an additional deterioration, although we do expect some deterioration in lending because of the economic circumstances.</p>
          <p>Chile has continued at the same pace as the last quarter: a fall in dollars, but basically because of the exchange rate impact. Growing provisions have been absorbed. We also see that GDP will grow at 1 or 2% as in Brazil, but we think that the loans and deposits business can still grow by 10%. And we think that we have the right policies to carry out a very recurrent business, where revenue will grow. And by managing spreads, while we will be able to absorb those provisions.</p>
          <p>Finally, financial management and equity stakes, significant reduction in the quarter. Zero results for this quarter, and a negative figure in the fourth quarter. And this is due first of all to the use of the equity method, equity accounted method, except from Banco Real and Cepsa &#x2013; which is available for sale. And this has two impact. One, in the equity accounted method. And also a positive contribution to our capital, because they had a goodwill, Cepsa, which has an impact of 15 basics (sic) [basis] points in our core capital. That is from the selling of our stake in Cepsa. Therefore the results are &#x2013; well, it's a double effect. And we have the provision of the Madoff and Lehman fund, &#xA3;650 million gross, 450 net. On the other hand, positive impact from the hedging of exchange rates for &#x20AC;100 million, which offset part of the falls that we've had in the operating areas. Those are the main variations.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the whole year 2007 on the right hand side, positive and negative effects practically cancel each other out. Of course, without taking into account the capital gains and extraordinary allowances in 2007.</p>
          <p>Since we're doing very well for time, let me just say a few remarks on Wholesale banking. I mentioned earlier that it had a good exercise from minus to plus. There's &#x2013; the decrease in competition in certain markets has allowed us to earn profitable market share in this segment. We have strong increase of revenues because of greater business activity and improvement of spreads. The growth of risky assets, we've had no growth of that in Wholesale banking. Therefore, it's based on more activity and the improvement of spreads. And for 2009, we think we're in a very good situation given the strength of our bank, and we can leverage that for this business to become a more important benchmark in the market than we were in the past.</p>
          <p>And finally, Asset Management and Insurance, more of the same. &#x20AC;1 billion is what we get from this business every quarter. And here we have two areas that have evolved differently. Mutual funds, with significant falls in volumes as well as in results, 18%. And Insurance, where not only are we growing very well, but we actually think we have significant opportunities in this business because of specific actions in geographies where we still have not exploited the business at 100%, such as Mexico and Brazil. And we have a positive effect as well from the perimeter and synergies.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to hand over to our CEO who will talk about the drivers for growth for 2009.</p>

          <p>Let me finish the presentation by giving you a summary of 2008. And I would also like to go over our management levers, our management drivers for 2009.</p>
          <p>We have seen why our business is so strong. 2008 is a year where we have differentiated ourselves because of the volume and recurrence of our profits; because of the quality of our assets; and our solvency; for our dividend policy; and the improvement of our business portfolio. All of this is summed up in the numbers that you have on screen. Our CFO has already commented on the performance of the main business units, emphasizing our management drivers for 2009. And I would like to spend this last part of the presentation to talk about the points which we think are the most important ones in our management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>we expect it to be a year, a very demanding year in terms of management because of the global recession; world GDP growth, estimated by the IMF to be 0.5%; because of low interest rates, which means lower spreads on our deposits; for the high cost of wholesale financing. And because of all of this, we're going to see a big rise in provisions.</p>
          <p>We believe that even in such a complex environment, our capabilities and strengths will enable us to weather the storm and maintain strong recurrent profits. And for that, we have a very solid starting point: our management model and differentiated advantages as compared to our competitors, which result from measures and decisions that were taken in previous years.</p>
          <p>Throughout the presentation, we have shown you the solid position of Santander. I won't say much more about it. I would only like to underscore that we have an intact business model with a quality balance sheet, well provisioned and without capital or liquidity restrictions to continue to grow. And to achieve this, we have developed a series of measures that will reinforce the effectiveness of our management in revenues, in costs and in risks.</p>
          <p>Revenue management will adapt to the less favorable conditions of an almost global recession. We expect reduced growth volumes with important difference by countries, nevertheless. In Spain, we see lending growing at the pace of the nominal GDP growth. In the U.K., the business will increase by less than 10%, excluding the new incorporations. Whilst Latin America will grow faster, mainly Brazil, which will be spurred by one of the best macroeconomic scenarios among the world's big economies. Moreover, in the case of Santander, we have a plus of growth that will come from the new units. The focus will remain on actively managing our spreads on loans. And we are confident of maintaining the upward trend of the last few quarters, as you can see on screen.</p>
          <p>In costs, we will keep our "jaws" wide open, thanks to two elements: on the one hand, the flexibility and adaptability of our cost to the revenue performance, and on the other, our proven capacity to obtain synergies and cost savings from the integration of the new units. In both cases, Santander's model of technology and global operations will be decisive. All of this will enable us to continue to achieve a sustained improvement in efficiency. We have improved efficiency by more than 26 percentage points in 10 years, as you can see on the chart.</p>
          <p>Active management of risks is a third driver for 2009. It is probably the most decisive element in the current banking environment. We have put into effect a battery of measures in the Group's various units that, together with the large volume of specific and generic provisions, will be decisive in limiting the impact of the cycle on the income statement.</p>
          <p>And I will now look at those steps taken in those markets or businesses that are more sensitive to the current circumstances. First of all, I'd like to refer to the Retail Network in Spain. According to consensus forecasts, the banking sector in Spain will have an NPL ratio at the end of 2002 (sic) [2009] of 7 to 8%, as compared to 3 to 3.5% at the moment. Santander, which starts with a lower NPL ratio, will also register a lower rise. We think we can reach levels of 4 to 4.5%. In addition to the usual steps, we also have two special initiatives: the creation of a specific area to manage NPLs and recoveries, and the policy to acquire assets, which I will mention on the next slide. These measures, combined with the release of generic provisions envisaged for 2009 from 1 to &#x20AC;1.5 billion for the network in Spain, will ease the impact of the rise in non-performing loans on our results.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of assets is a positive process for the bank and for the economy in general. The Grupo Santander, just as in other strategies that have proven to be successful in time, has also gotten ahead this time. Reasons: first of all, it means an improvement in our guarantees from borrowers in situations of weakness. Number two, it facilitates a viability of companies by injecting liquidity into their activity, which is also transmitted to and benefits the rest of the economy. Number three, it makes available the assets immediately, avoiding the deterioration they suffer during a process of foreclosure via the courts. Fourthly, Santander has networks and teams that are specialized in selling assets. And number five, the potential loss in the sale of properties is limited.</p>
          <p>Even taking the US market as an example, the most flexible in the world, the maximum historic fall in house prices has been one year 18%; or 25% in the accrued figure for two years. Well, based on this rationale, the Santander Branch Network and Banesto have &#x20AC;3.768 billion of acquired properties at an estimated average price of 10% below the market. And at the time of purchase, an initial provision of around 10% was made. Furthermore, this policy enables us to achieve a higher guarantee, as 30% of the cancelled risk did not have a real guarantee. And I also like to mention that given the current situation of these borrowers, only 13% of these acquired properties would be in NPL, about &#x20AC;489 million.</p>
          <p>I also like to talk about the U.K., because there the macroeconomic environment will mean increases in non-performing loans. We believe we will outperform the market and maintain a better run-rate of profits, to which must be added the new incorporations. This is why we have advantages. We have intangible balances in high-risk categories, what in the U.K. is called the buy-to-let or the self-certified. Moreover, the weight of foreclosed assets in the portfolio is less than one-third that of the market. This means much better NPL ratios and coverage in mortgages, but also in UPLs, unsecured personal loans. Our traditional admission criteria will remain the same. And we're working on improving spreads so as to offset the high-risk premium.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="inaudible" /> business that is most affected in this environment is consumer financing. Our estimates obviously point to an increase in NPLs in Santander Consumer Finance in 2009 to around 5.5 to 6%, from 4.2% that we have at present. But the favorable impact of the rise in spreads, the advantages of the synergies and the measures taken to reduce risk in those markets with the worst macroeconomic scenarios and products of greater risk will continue to limit the impact of profits from the higher loan-loss provisions.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I'd like to focus for a minute in the credit card business in Mexico. The NPL ratio in cards reached its peak in 2008 in Santander, and also in the industry, about 10%. We forecast a slight fall in fact in 2009, to 9%. The measures taken by us, by Santander, will contribute to this trend. We have &#x2013; we're no longer selling cards to non-customers. We have cut in the limits in cash availability of customers with the highest risk. We have reduced the portfolio in 2008 more than the market, 6.5%, while the market has only reduced it by 0.2%. And we are already beginning to see the first signs of the improvement in the quality of business. Entries in arrears in different maturities have fallen on a sustained basis since last August. We are also working to lift the return on business with selective price increases that will reflect the greater risk. This is why we do not envisage significant rises in provisions this year.</p>
          <p>Summing up, and as we have just seen, Santander faces 2009 from a solid position and with a very defined management strategy based on business drivers. But that is not all. Our Group also has specific advantages that enable us to start the year ahead of our competitors. We have higher profits by perimeter. Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, these are new consumer business additions. And Sovereign. All of these, we estimate, will give us more than &#x20AC;400 million net of taxes in profit. We have synergies in Brazil, &#x20AC;230 million. We have restructuring costs for the year estimated at &#x20AC;250 million, which will be charged to the fund created with capital gains in 2008. We have the positive impact of the capital increase, an impact of &#x20AC;150 million. And we have a lower impact of the rise in NPLs in generic provisions in Spain, about &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>I'm not exaggerating when I say that no other bank of the world has all these ingredients at the same time. All of them together turn Santander into a bank with a wining business model in order to keep on widening its advantage over its peers, and with a solid base of recurrent profits.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin the questions. As usual, we will respond first to the ones that have come over the Internet, and then any that come in over the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are quite a few questions, or questions from quite a few analysts, asking about variations in our annual and quarterly core capital and the reason for that negative eight billion impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for core capital, both quarterly and annual, we have an annual variation of eight billion, quarterly I think it was four or five. Here basically, the three elements that come into play: the first and most important, representing over 50% of the impact, were the goodwills, which have oscillated quarter after quarter. But to round off, say 20, 22 million. You don't cover that with the exchange rate. And so that 20% currency depreciation represents the 4 or 5 billion difference in the goodwill. Which of course has no impact on the core capital because it's abstract. It's goodwill from the core capital. But then the adjustment happens at this level. And then we have a second element, which is the variation that occurs in capital gains in the portfolios available for sale, which I think are about 1,500 million. And then finally we have the impact of the exchange rates. The book value in all of our subsidiaries to stay similar.</p>
          <p>No, we have non-coverage in some small places. Other places where there is a 5, 7% impact. And then other places with perfect coverage. So that's the reason for those other impacts. 90% of the variation is purely the impact of exchange rates on the goodwill, which I think is 3.8 billion in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nadia Raminghi from VS is asking about the real estate we have bought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that that's been answered already in the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Francisco Rekell from Timbro is saying that he thinks the risk, the cost of risk in the U.K. is low. He says we're talking 20 basis points for Alliance &amp; Leicester. What's the reason? What are the expectations for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's low because as we have said, if you look at our performance in the U.K. &#x2013; and the CEO spoke about this point when he said about, that in 2009 our portfolio we have no buy-to-let. And so in comparison with the market, our NPLs are half the market average of buy-to-let, when in the market it's pretty significant. Our percentage is very low. Self-certified mortgages, we don't have any. So these are the most sensitive segments, and we don't have a problem in those.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you've seen that in our UPL portfolio, basically Abbey, we've had a continuous job. It was a very high-quality UPL portfolio. We closed Cahoot two years ago, first. And then with Abbey, we have been very selective with our UPS risk. And as a result, we have a portfolio in Abbey &#x2013; but that's also applicable to Alliance &amp; Leicester &#x2013; a very low loan-to-value, 50% on average. The front book is coming in at 60, 62 loan-to-value. So our portfolio, as we've said again and again, it is extremely high-quality. So the lower cost of risk is simply the result of that. Plus, we have triple the coverage, as we showed in the presentation. It's at 20-some percent, when the market is single digit. However, as I've said also we expect that in the fourth quarter, provisions will grow, but nothing too dramatic. It's a very high-quality portfolio, and it will perform much better than the sector's average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez from Keefe and Rival Menta from Felentes are both asking about the capital gains from the sale of the Italian businesses. And the question is if initially we expected the cost of acquisition of ABN Banco Real to be lower? Whether reflecting them and P&amp;L meant that Real's goodwill is higher? What's the number? Could we explain that a little better? And the same thing with ABN's liabilities. Can we explain both of those better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regards to the sale of the businesses in Italy, we said that the cost of acquisition would be lower, and that necessarily entailed reducing Banco Real's goodwill by the same amount. In order to bring about this reduction, you obviously had to do an impairment. And that means, as you know, that you need a report stating that the asset purchased is worth less for some reason. If look at ABN Amro result or Banco Real in Brazil, 1.25 billion if you do that impairment, there it wasn't possible. And so what we have done is to charge them to capital gains, to capital in some way and to net them, with charge against capital, against Abbey's intangibles and anticipation of future charges, restructuring and the goodwill; generic sort of capital gains. So we've netted it with other areas so the impact is zero.</p>
          <p>And the other one was about the liabilities. Right. You'll remember that when we bought ABN, we bought a series of businesses. And then there was one thing that we called shared assets, where we held 27.9%, which was our participation in the consortium. Of these shared assets, we had every issue, every ABN issue in the wholesale markets. And then after the acquisition these assets have been distributed. And the ones who have taken over those issues &#x2013; what, they've been assigned to Fortis and Royal B 741 million and the market valuation of those issues on March 31, and our 27.9% of that. So these were, plus 2, plus 15, plus 20 basis points, which is where the market was before the summer of 2007, have been valued in March, 2008 at market value. And that has generated certain gains. And in our case, we don't use those issues, but it's equivalent to &#x20AC;741 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ignacio Cerezo from JP and some other analysts are asking about risk-weighted assets. Basically, what is the contribution of Real and Alliance &amp; Leicester, the evolution of risk-weighted assets in the quarter and why they have grown as they have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as for risk-weighted assets, going back to the exchange rate issue, you're asking about Real. Real is &#x20AC;43 billion. Alliance &amp; Leicester, 25 billion. What happened with the risk-weighted assets? We had risk-weighted assets of 472 billion. At the end of the third quarter, 514. But of course, here, first you have to deflate. We have 100 million risk-weighted assets in Latin America, and 77 in the U.K. at the end of this quarter. So you have to deflate that with the exchange rate impact. So there's a significant drop there. And then there's the 43 billion in Banco Real, which is why Brazil has 70 billion. And then an additional 25 in the U.K. So the main impact is because you have to deflat the, or deflate, the September base with the rates at the end of the quarter. And that's why it's only going 40 when we're adding 68. But that's because you have to take into account the impact of the exchange rate.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Inya Kimmiell is asking whether we're planning to sell any assets. And they're some other analysts asking about M&amp;A and the, acquisitions and sales, and what's our strategy right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, every asset classified as assets for sale could be sold. And so if we have a chance to do it, we will. As for M&amp;A's, we don't actually have anything to say right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Verastein is asking why the rise in provisions in the fourth quarter in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that's basically the impact of Banco Real, which is consolidated with global integration in the fourth quarter. Until the third quarter, it was the equivalence method.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And he's also asking why such a low level of provisioning in Spain in the fourth quarter? The other questions &#x2013; and also says that it explains the strong rise in the net interest income. So two questions. Why low provisioning? And why sharp rise in net interest income? All the rest have been answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As for the net interest income, I think it's been explained in the presentation how we manage our spreads and our assets. And of course, there's been dropping interest rates, a very significant drop. And the combination of both is what's grown our net interest income.</p>
          <p>As for provisions, we've said that we releasing generic provisions, and that's why provisions have grown so little in Spain. In the presentation we said, already, we spoke about the billion that we could use up in generics in 2009. And in the fourth quarter, we've used 340 it was, or 330.</p>

          <p>Quinn from Nomura is asking whether we're maintaining our growth, our revenue forecast, growth or profit, growth, as in 14% increase in our profits in Spain...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we ever said profits.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>for 2009 and 20% in the U.K., and which we've reported in the Brazilian Investors Day? And given worsening economic outlook in Brazil, whether we have changed our target, our growth targets for profits in that area too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we already explained our views on 2009 in that last presentation in Brazil. And right now, we don't want to make any further forecast or mention any different targets to those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And from Fox-Pitt, a technical question &#x2013; which, if you agree, we'll answer later &#x2013; the breakdown of the generic provisions by area, the alphas and betas. The risk weighted assets question's already been answered. The total coverages for, or hedges, for foreign exchange in the year and in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can we update the integration of the banks in Brazil? And can we shed some light on the evolution of Sovereign's loan portfolio? The others have been answered already, or we can answer later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the exchange rate, I think I mentioned that the hedging was &#x20AC;400 million. In previous quarters, I can't remember off the top of my head, it was &#x20AC;100-some million. But the main impact's in the fourth quarter. And that's where we've had a strong shift in the pound sterling and in the Latin American currencies versus the dollar and the euro.</p>
          <p>The integrations of the banks in Brazil, I don't think there is any news. Everything on schedule. We are pleased at the way things are going and we're on schedule as we, or as Fabio explained in detail in that Investors Day in Brazil.</p>
          <p>As for Sovereign's loans, there's not much to add. We just bought the bank, and we're going through the usual audit process. And we have more information than we did initially.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are now involved in that process. And what we're offering our preferred shares, preferred share with the usual characteristics, with the 2% coupon and with a call for 2010 and then successive calls like the rest of the bank's preferred shares.

          <p>Carlos Peixoto [Banco BPI] has a specific question for Portugal. Since forecasts are flat, could we elaborate on where they're going, or why they're flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't really have a lot to say. Just as in Portugal, just like in Spain, we went from a situation of growing at 3 or 4% with extremely low NPL ratios. That was not the case for Portugal. They had had several years &#x2013; first the bank, which, when we acquired it, went through strong restructuring. But Portugal hasn't been growing. And its economy has not been growing over the last few years. So there's no significant change in Portugal that might have grown our NPLs. So that's why we haven't grown our provisions as we have in Spain. Also, remember that the model applied here is the expected losses model, which we've been applying for four or five quarters. So it's based on the model we had in place already.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And John Carevy is asking about the U.K., about our strategy and our vision, in a market in which nationalized banks might be under pressure to implement not very market focused strategies? And do we have any idea what might happen in those markets, what do we think? He's also asking about our foreign exchange hedging for Sovereign and Alliance &amp; Leicester. When did we do that versus the point of the acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first question is rather speculative. What could happen and what might happen or what might we expect to happen in terms of the performance and behavior of British banks in the current context, it would be to speculate facts to facts. And the facts are that U.K. banks are undergoing difficulties right now. We are very solid and very strong, and that's why we're doing and performing as we have. And as we, and we have the vision, we've explained, for 2009, which is to grow successfully, although the economic context is difficult to continue to grow, to carefully select the assets, to invest them. And as Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez has explained that's the key to our better quality of loan portfolio &#x2013; to move away from high-risk products both in mortgages and in consumer finance, you will be a lot more proactive. In the deposit or customer fund business, we're seeing the impact already in how our deposits are growing, both traditional deposit and also investment product. And naturally as far as the situation, everything else, you just have to be alert and see what happens. For now, there's no indication that these behaviors by these banks would significantly shift the rules of the game in the coming year.</p>

          <p>Carlos Peixoto from BPI again asking something that was answered in the presentation, which are the contributions of Banco Real and Alliance &amp; Leicester to the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Banco Real, $1.35 million, billion. Alliance &amp; Leicester integrated December 31, so zero.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Christian Soleil &#x2013; oh, almost there, and Christian Soleil from Dexia is asking why risk weighted assets for Banesto are lower than what they reported by 7 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll look into this in detail, but basically we think it's probably intra-Group transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's a question from Luis Pena and Maya Loyala and a couple of other analysts, just why has the goodwill grown in the balance sheet by 5.5 billion in the 4Q versus 3Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's moving Banco Real from the equivalence method to real integration. That's the effect. It's basically had not grown. It's was there already.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuelle Menendez from Morgan Stanley, question she's asking have all been answered except the last one, which has been answered in the presentation, but maybe you want to elaborate, on how we might use our generic provisions &#x2013; speaking in general, not about Spain &#x2013; but how we might release our generic provisions in 2009. I don't know if you wish to elaborate or if you feel you've already said enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've said enough.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Veon Madron from Fortis asking whether we can update them &#x2013; some other analysts have asked about this &#x2013; can we update them on the potential impact on our core capital of this Sovereign consolidation? And can we elaborate on how we internally or organically generate the kind of capital that we've reported? And can we confirm our commitment to maintain that nine payout versus eight per share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is a question we've answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can we explain the reason for the Abbey intangibles amortization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's already been answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, plus the goodwill that we provisioned, also both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The potential impact of Sovereign, we've spoken about 20 basis points. Of course, there's an audit underway. We'll have to wait to see the final number. But basically, that's what we were talking. In general, capital generation, we're still using the same parameters we've always used. If you look at the results of 2008, our payout on growth risk-weighted assets was as expected. And this time scenario, growing single-digit in various places. So, if you look through the number, we'll be between 10 basis points of generation of free capital in the quarter, which is what I think I mentioned.</p>
          <p>As for the dividend, I've already mentioned that there's no change in this area. And in fact in the previous question about free capital, implicitly, we are using the same parameters for the dividend calculations which we've used in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maria Lobos from Eva Securities is asking about the portfolio of toxic assets in Alliance &amp; Leicester, and how we're evolving that? Can we give any details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We consolidated it. Obviously, we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how is the process evolving? And he's asking about the risk premium for Santander Consumer. And why there is a reduction of the risk premium? And can we elaborate on the NPLs in Santander Consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the risk premium is not going down in the quarter. No, it's going up. And I think in the presentation we said that we expected an NPL rate for 2009 in Consumer Finance to rise. And so the risk premium would evolve in the same direction.</p>
          <p>As for Alliance &amp; Leicester, I wouldn't call them toxic assets. I don't think they were. They were assets whose mark-to-market at some point we said, when we look through the numbers, I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was basically a 12 or 13 billion portfolio. Most were floating rate notes in European financial institutions of good quality. And it was a portfolio of AAA, ABS's with a mark-to-market was negative, and it was reflected. And there were some minor issues where the write-downs were 70, 80, 90%. So, there's really nothing else to say. I don't know whether there was anything else.</p>
          <p>And the second was about the risk premium for Santander Consumer Finance. I've already explained it; in line with the NPL rises we expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Daragh Quinn from Nomura, is asking about the cost of risk in 4Q in Mexico? And whether it's what we expected looking at 2009, in terms of costs and just to elaborate on the Mexican situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would separate this into two parts. The driver for the cost of risk in Mexico was 100% cards in 2008. Two messages about risk in Mexico. First, in Mexico we think we've touched bottom. So, we don't expect the situation to worsen. We don't expect them to improve spectacularly, but the provisions will remain more or less where they are. And as for the economic context, we do expect the economy to worsen, and therefore NPL rates to rise. Otherwise, the portfolio, excluding cards, would remain pretty much as it is.</p>

          <p>Alberto Corrada from ABN is asking, the reserves available for sale, positive by 1.4 billion versus a negative figure in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've put into our P&amp;L our Royal and Fortis stakes. They were in assets available for sale, but no longer, obviously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Garcia from ING, can we update them on the sale of real estate assets which we began, or the ones we acquired?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've only just started. In fact, our marketing structure was set up in January. But I think we've had some interesting signs. I don't have the numbers for yesterday, but I know that we organized the first sales campaign for flats amongst our employees. And we've sold over 200 and some in just two weeks. And we're now going to extend these campaigns to other groups. So it's just a small scale beginning. And it's not significant in terms of the numbers, but we have seen that there is a market if the price is right, and if you have the right sales structure, and the right sale's tools, you can, very successfully, sell in significant amounts. But, we will discuss this quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>We don't have a lot of time. And it's not been a very long time yet, since we've started to give any kind of general conclusion or forecast on how much we might sell. But our goals are fairly ambitious. But we'll see over the next months and quarters we might be more accurate in the figures, and in our assessment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sessia Ramis from Merrill Lynch is asking about how do we expect housing prices to, how much do we expect housing prices to drop in the U.K., or what are our views? And how might that affect us? And are we buying competitors' portfolios in Brazil, or would we be interested in buying any niche operator in that country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are following real estate price drops in the U.K. The drops will be significant, as they have been in other countries. The effect in our case has an initial impact on our loan-to-value. But, as you've heard, our loan-to-value is very comfortable at Abbey. And so those consequences will not be too significant.</p>
          <p>We have seen some impact on our property and positions &#x2013; the houses that we've taken over because of defaults. But not very significant, because our PNPs are not very high in comparison with the rest of the sector. So, it's just another element in this whole process of defaults and provisioning, but it's nothing too significant.</p>
          <p>And as for Brazil, we have a lot of integration work to do, and a lot of consolidation work to do. So, we're not really thinking about buying anything, not even niche businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon Morgan from MS [Morgan Stanley] is asking about risk-weighted assets with the Sovereign acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's not included, December 31. The core capital with Sovereign, question's already been answered.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlo DiGrandi from HSBC is asking our asset spreads are growing in every business although our customer funds spreads are shrinking. What is our expected evolution for our net interest income for the Group for 2009, like-for-like? And can we talk about the top part of the income statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we already said something about this. We could of course elaborate, and it very much depends on each market. The evolution in Spain is very different from that in Latin America. And even in Latin America, the evolution of interest rates is very different. Of course, our forecasts for 2009 take into account a scenario of low and dropping interest rates and their subsequent impact on our spreads for deposits. And of course, we have considered hypotheses and scenarios in which our loan spreads would grow and in spite of lower volumes. Therefore, the impact would be significant and positive.</p>
          <p>And all this overall will probably mean that our margins will grow at one-digit rate, and won't be very high like other years when it was two-digit. But probably 2009 won't be double-digit. It will be single-digit. And to that, we'll have to add some businesses which will continue to grow significantly, like the fee generation, which will not so much grow, but it's just that we have more business that generates fees and commissions. I spoke about Insurance earlier, for example.</p>
          <p>So overall, we think that we will have revenues growing by about double-digit growth overall. But it's very heterogeneous. Depending on the different markets, there will be major differences.</p>

          <p>On the second part, Carlo Degande's question, he's asking what happens if housing prices were to drop below 20% before we sell. Would we have to provision additionally?</p>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>And Andrew Walshman is asking what is our strategy for Sovereign in the US? What is our experience operationally that we are already applying for the 2009 budget? I guess he is basically asking what our vision is for Sovereign in the US, what do we want to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's nothing new about that. We want to turn Sovereign within the time that's required for this kind of process into a full-fledged retail bank with the characteristics and the strengths of this concept, full-fledged retail bank for Santander in every market. So basically, we want to have a bank which will follow very closely our own business model, although of course adapted to the American market, just like we have adapted Abbey to the characteristics of the British market. That's basically our strategy. And that's going to require changes. It will require time and effort.</p>

          <p>Questions from Dominica Santori and Manuel Lee which have already been answered about the evolution of the financial margins and NPL rates. <mark type="inaudible" /> is asking about the possibility of reducing our payout, our dividend policies?

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>More questions from Javier Bernard, but I think they've all been answered. There're some operational questions about customer recruitment, which, if you agree, Javier, we will answer later. Questions about mortgage refinance in Spain and in the U.K., and how do we see the business? Do we see think there's going to be more or less, and have we gained or lost market share? Integration costs, we've already answered. He's talking about reducing our leverage in Sovereign by $10 million. I suppose that's the equivalence method this quarter. I think everything else has been answered. I don't know if you want to elaborate? And that will be the end of it.</p>
