        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Kristin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation Q3 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Daniel Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption forward-looking statements for a discussion of the risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted property EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan. Ladies and gentlemen, I am very excited to report that Las Vegas Sands blew out the third quarter of 2010 with record EBITDA of 645 million on net revenue of 1.9 billion. Our EBITDA results are the highest in our industry since late 2006 when Las Vegas was at the very peak of its profitability. These results are part of a powerful and continuing trend, which can be explained by our company's long-standing strategic direction in combination with prudent new management and the team that Mike Leven and I have assembled and continue to build around us.</p>
          <p>Some of you may recall that at our annual shareholders' meeting in June, I suggested the company might be able to reach $3 billion in EBITDA in 2011. Well, it turns out I might have been wrong. Looking at our results from the first 25 days of October, our annualized run rate is now substantially in excess of $3 billion. It's good to be wrong in that direction.</p>
          <p>So with that important clarification out of the way, let me take a few minutes to discuss highlights of this quarter's historic performance and some of the trends we're seeing moving into the end of October. Adjusted EBITDA reached a record 645 million for the quarter. Our EBITDA climbed by more than 73% from the beginning of June to the end of September. And the trend continues into October where we are on pace to grow an additional 31% from September to October.</p>
          <p>Net revenue reached a record 1.9 billion in the quarter. From June to September, net revenue increased more than 8%, but from September to October we are projecting an increase of 12%. EBITDA margin also reached a record 33.8% up nearly 1,000 basis points from the 23.9% in the quarter last year. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.34 up over 1,100%, that's 11 times, from $0.03 in last year's third quarter and is the highest third quarter EPS in the company's history.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Singapore where Marina Bay Sands in its first full quarter of operations generated a whopping 245 million in EBITDA and an outstanding EBITDA margin of just a tad under 50% at 49.7% for the quarter. Both are records for any property in our company's history. This is in spite of the fact that low hold on Rolling play of 2.65% negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $20 million. These results are particularly impressive considering we're still in a very early stages in Singapore after opening the doors just six short months ago.</p>
          <p>Let me share with you some of the exciting trends we're experiencing at Marina Bay Sands. These figures are based on a full week average comparison. Gross gaming revenue has increased to 126% since May reaching 8.4 million per day in October. That's an annualized run rate of 3.1 billion. Rolling volumes have increased 182% since May to reach 116.3 million per day in October. At that rate, we will roll 42 billion annually approximately.</p>
          <p>Gross gaming revenue from our mass tables and slots increased 49% since May to reach 3.2 million per day in October at an annual run rate of 1.2 billion. Non-rolling drop increased 21% since May to 9.6 million per day in October. That's an annual run rate of 3.5 billion. Slot handle increased 165% to reach 18.3 million per day in October. That is 6.7 billion annually. The slot win per unit per day increased 43% since May to reach $517 per unit per day so far in October. These results reflect the addition of electronic table games, which came in August &#x2013; August and September. The annual run rate for gross slot win is approximately $450 million.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide some quick color on Macau. I'll address the issue of EBITDA versus gross revenue in a minute. But let me first point out that our EBITDA margin in Macau reached a record 31.3%, up 310 basis points from the 28.2% in the same quarter last year. I believe that's a result of having an integrated resort where you have other departments that are contributing to a lot of the fixed &#x2013; to a lot of the fixed, and of course, the variable expenses.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you all know the Golden Week holiday took place earlier this month. It was a strong Golden Week for Sands China as we set two daily records for EBITDA and with a full weekend still ahead of us and despite the prior week's typhoon warning, we're on pace to have a record month in October overall. We're certainly enjoying tailwinds in both Singapore and Macau at the moment.</p>
          <p>Our progress in both the Las Vegas and Bethlehem Sands shouldn't be discounted either. We're optimistic about trends in Las Vegas, including momentum from our recently announced marketing alliance with InterContinental Hotel Group, and at Bethlehem where table games and the completion of our hotel next spring should continue to produce increased growth, revenue and EBITDA. Simply put our business overall has never been healthier. We're growing at a significant rate while generating more cash flow than ever before.</p>
          <p>As a widely-read Macau publication recently said on separate occasions, and I quote, "LVS will one day soon be remembered for the quarter in which it separated from the pack &#x2013; separated from the pack and became the one. It's now the kind of stock you would want to put in your children's trust fund simply because Adelson has pulled away thanks to his huge bets in Asia. The properties he already has are going to provide fantastic cash flow in the coming years for investors."</p>
          <p>Not our words, but we couldn't agree more. The fundamentals of this business and our basic business model have not changed and were always viable, a strong result plus the successful execution of the integrated reserve development strategy that we have aggressively pursued since we founded the company.</p>
          <p>That is the key to our growth story, the solidity of our assets. We can't possibly know how these trends will continue to develop, but we can give you a real-time look at what we're seeing right now. As a starting point for our Q&amp;A discussion, let me share my thoughts on three additional points.</p>
          <p>First, with respect to the granting of credit in Singapore, we had more than 10 years experience granting credit to Asian customers in both Las Vegas and Macau. We've been very judicious about granting credit notwithstanding the ramp-up we've been experiencing. We are managing this very tightly and monitor it on a daily, if not an hourly, basis. We have been measured and prudent about granting credit.</p>
          <p>Second, our strong belief is that the appropriate measure of our financial performance is EBITDA, not market share or gross revenue. For instance, in Macau our Sands has given out tens of sub-licenses, and according to rumors, MGM, Galaxy and Melco have decided to follow suit, and I believe Galaxy and Melco are also doing so. Under these arrangements, the operator may actually receive, and that these are the most recent offers, the operator may actually receive as little as 3% of gross revenue, but they use 100% of the gross revenue to determine their market share.</p>
          <p>I personally think there's an over-exaggeration on the issue of gross revenue per market share when all you're getting is 3% out of it, but you're counting the entire 100% as part of your market share. What's more important 3% of revenue before expenses or EBITDA of more than 30%? I think that the answer is obvious. Anybody who has read The Dummies' Guide to Doing Business knows that what really counts is the cash you're able to put in the bank, so I hope that'll put an end to the market share quotations, the way it's been done.</p>
          <p>While our market share of gross gaming revenues in Macau has remained approximately 20%, our share of EBITDA in the marketplace is significantly higher. We estimate that we are currently generating between 35% and 40% of the total EBITDA in the market. Now that is how we define market share leadership in Macau.</p>
          <p>One final thought, sometimes we yield a little less, sometimes we yield a little more, but we are right where we should be and so will be averages over time. So with that Mike, Rob, and Ken are also here to answer your questions, so let's go to Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. So great quarter, Sheldon. At the beginning you ran through a lot of impressive numbers for October, for me kind of fast, everybody else can't speak up at this moment. So if I missed something, I apologize. But in those numbers, and you were just talking about how important EBITDA was, I was just wondering if you can give us an idea of what EBITDA was trending in October at Marina Bay Sands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The trend of EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I got to tell you, we did, we don't have that &#x2013; do we have that here? As a percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not as a percentage though, your EBITDA in the quarter was about 80 million a month, so I was just wondering how it's turning out in October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I did quote, I did say, what &#x2013; somebody &#x2013; what's the number down here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's over 20%; it's beyond 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the beginning of May, from the end of May to the beginning of October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It grew, okay. Thank you. Just missed that. Sorry it was kind of fast. And then &#x2013; so the margins at the property, very impressive 50%. You definitely got there faster than we expected. Where do margins go from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. You know we're sailing in Marina Bay Sands, Singapore is sailing in uncharted waters, and the amount &#x2013; we don't see any let up in the growth. But the higher the Paiza Club or the high-end gaming the larger the slug of revenue from that segment, the higher the percentage will be. The other day we pulled in 71% of casino departmental profit, so you know, the more of that &#x2013; it's tough to say, but I can't see, I can't see it going much more than 60%. We'd have to have a very high, very consistent high end of the market return every single day to get beyond 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Just getting back to my other question as a follow-up, so it grew 20% from the end of May to October. What was, what's the base that you're using?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, no, no. Much more. What is it, Dan? What's the figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Marina.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, but somebody came along and took my pages here. I can't refer back to the beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got a very, a very strong start to October. We are holding a little heavy, but we've got a very, very strong start to October. So if you look at the months in the quarter, July, August and September EBITDA by property, it goes up every month from June to July, from July to August, from August to September and from September to October. Again, October had a Golden Week in it. It's also got heavier hold even after the Golden Week, so we're really enjoying the wind at our back right now, but the number is much, much higher than the number we had in September. On a percentage basis based on what's happening right now, it's up 40% &#x2013; approximately 40% from September to October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA. And so, you won't tell us what the September EBITDA is &#x2013; was? I mean it's obviously higher than the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you have plenty of color, Felicia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just are the rebates still at 1.2 to 1.3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Final question on Four Seasons Macao, EBITDA margins are also a record. You obviously held well in the mass, but I was just wondering what a run rate was there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have that carved out. The run rate, an annual run rate of EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm just &#x2013; you had a record EBITDA margin in &#x2013; at the Four Seasons, but you held well. Should we look at this as we model forward or is this an anomaly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's an anomaly. I think it's because we had a very &#x2013; we had a much higher percentage of high end gaming, of high end win. But I see the Four Seasons, the Plaza at the Four Seasons not equaling but starting to approach within a striking range the numbers we're experiencing at Sands Macao.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's picking up, and we expect it to pick up more. We anticipate doing some property improvements and adding a couple of amenities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome, Felicia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Janet Brashear with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the topic of Singapore, could you give us a little preview of what you see coming in the next quarter relative to the moving parts? You've had a lot of moving parts as new parts of the resort open like with retail ramping up, with changing the electronic games or adding the electronic games and increasing your occupancy. Could you talk a little bit about where you think the occupancy can go if you have more changes to the game mix and how the retail might ramp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, this is Mike, Janet. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our occupancy has been building pretty favorably. Our tour operator business is up to close to 600 rooms a night. Our MICE business is building. We expect the occupancies to go significantly higher towards the end of the year. On the retail, we're still not completely open. All the retail with a possible exception of Louis Vuitton will be open by the end of the year, and it's starting to ramp not as well as we would have thought in the early going because the construction is going on, but it'll basically be finished so that will be a contributor in 2011 that we think significantly.</p>
          <p>Our room rate is holding and actually heading north. It's going up. So that's working. I think all the signs, our call center, all the signs of business beyond the casino situation is starting to move forward now pretty rapidly. And I think you'll see some very significant contributions to that. The theaters open the end of the year, and the museum will open the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So we're pretty much done with everything there, except the light and water show, which will probably open in February. And now we just have Celebrity Chefs open the end of this month. The rooftop restaurant opens the end of this month. And the only significant delay in anything is the health club and the spa, and that'll take place sometime in the early part of '11. So all of these income generating areas will pretty much be done by the time we head into '11, and some of them will have already ramped. So we expect a bigger contribution in 2011 from the rest of the property.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks. Could you also give us a little update on lots 5 &amp; 6 in Macau on things like have you been able to resolve all the prior contracts from when you shut down and restarted? And how's the labor situation coming along? What sorts of expenses are you incurring as you're, as an additive expense now that the work's not going quite at the pace you'd like? And maybe a little bit about when you expect Galaxy to open and the impact on the whole market, not necessarily the Venetian but maybe the Peninsula as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The latest commentary on Galaxy is June, what we're hearing, we have no definitive word out about that. As far as we're concerned, we're still on our target. Our budget has remained the same. Yes, there'll be a couple of months delay. We're still looking at the end of the last quarter of '11 to open Phase 1. However, in the next 30 days we should know pretty well whether we can make that particular situation, depending upon the amount of available employees. We have gotten indications that we're going to get the numbers we need, but until we actually see them we can't give a definitive answer as to the exact date that we'll open.</p>
          <p>All the contract situations have been basically resolved. The contracts are out to the sub-contractors. Everything's ready to go. All the design work is pretty much done. Material is being ordered, and as soon as we get the &#x2013; move our construction workforce from where it is to where it has to be to get everything done, we'll be able to give you that definitive date, but I would say by the time, by the end of this year, we will have a much more definitive date on five and six. The &#x2013; every indication in the press and from the government says that the problem should be solved, but until it is solved we're just kind of plugging along with our plans and, but the contracts that you asked about are all taken care of. There should be no surprises there at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and finally, could you just comment a little on Sands Macao? If there's any property that didn't perhaps hit the ball quite as far out of the park as every other one, it would be Sands Macao. Where do you see that property trending now? And when Sheldon mentioned earlier some improvements, was he talking about Sands Macao?</p>

          <p>They've been very good for that particular casino, and we've also done some more junket work in the Four Seasons and the Palazzo Casino, so those things are starting to ramp up. In the Sands, as many of you know, we're doing the Playboy situation in the rooftop area. We put some private gaming rooms in there with that. I think the Sands Macao, we really sort of look at as the cash cow in Macau. Remember that the most amount of competition that's there in Macau really, really affects the Sands, which is located on the peninsula, so we work very hard with our business mix there, and we're not looking for enormous, enormous hops in growth. We're looking for really stability, and I think that's what you saw happen in this quarter.</p>

          <p>But I want to comment. We are still growing. I'm looking at the numbers. We're still growing. Not as dramatically as our other properties, but we are still growing. And bear in mind that most of the competition is on the peninsula, and just holding our own when there's more capacity dropped into the market periodically &#x2013; just holding our own is an accomplishment, but we're actually increasing. Also, another point I want to bear in mind, back in 2005, we announced that we paid off the entire cost of the property, so we're providing an infinite return, so every nickel we make there is a nickel without an investment. Well, let me talk about billion. Every billion we make is without an investment. Next question?</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Mark Strawn with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just one quick question on Singapore, as you look at your customers today, do you have a rough breakdown of the customer mix between locals and foreign markets, and which maybe foreign markets you could target more heavily going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I tell you, that foreign market is a moving target. I'll tell you that I watch that every single day, but I only have access to the top 20 &#x2013; what we call the hit sheet. The top 10 winners, top 10 losers. And the average number of countries that are represented in those 20 customers are eight to nine different countries. We get countries from all over the Pacific &#x2013; from Laos and Cambodia and Myanmar.</p>
          <p>Let me get back to the beginning and say that our primary markets are Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. We are building up a steady stream of business from Korea, from Japan, and outside of the area, Hong Kong is our biggest contributor. China is, let me say, equally as strong, so we get a lot of business from China, but we're very cautious about granting credit only to people that we know. So it's just a whole potpourri of countries that are represented.</p>
          <p>I've ordered a percentage of total business breakdown by country, so we'll see what kind of a &#x2013; some sort of an analysis. But I got to tell you as far as the top 10 or 10 winners or losers, it comes from a wide variety, and I personally am curious about it. I watch this every single day. And I could look at it and sometimes we have a total of four people from Singapore, sometimes as many as 12 or 14 out of the 20. One day last week I saw mid-week only four countries represented, but it's going out, we get from Bangladesh, we get from India, from Thailand, from the Indo-Chinese countries, Vietnam. We get from Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, some from, couple from the U.S.A., but we're going to do analysis of that.</p>
          <p>We'll probably publish that, but it is, I personally see it as a very promising sign, because when you penetrate the level of the haves as opposed to the have-nots in a place like Bangladesh where all haves know each other, and people say they enjoy their stay and their trip, we're going to get a lot more people from, let's say, Bangladesh, and so we'll have a steady, solid stream of business from each of those countries, and there's an awful lot of them.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. That's very helpful, and one follow-up if I may. Perhaps a question for Mike. As you look at operating expenses in Marina Bay Sands, would you say you're pretty much fully staffed at this point without a lot of incremental labor coming on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually have been understaffed, Mark, from the original target. Our original target was about 8,400 people. We ran below that for the first number of months, just in terms of on-boarding people. We couldn't find enough of them, so our present payroll levels will probably increase closer to that 8,400 level, and then we have additional employees coming on with the theaters and the retail stores and the museum, et cetera, all of which will come according to plan. So we don't expect that there will be any enormity in the payroll increases compared to what we expected from the beginning, but you'll have some slight increases to what we've been running now.</p>
          <p>And we watch that very carefully, and continue to watch that very carefully. We also get requests from the Casino Regulatory Commission for certain audits and things like that that keep coming in that require additional people, and we're working, we do that as well, but I don't think you'll see any enormous surprise in terms of payroll costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sorry. I wanted to ask about Singapore, if I may. Noticing that the occupancy in the hotel is still what I guess we should consider at the formative stages. How should we think about a fuller or a higher occupancy and how that translates into casino revenue once you get there in the context that what we've seen so far appears to be clearly stronger than what we had and my guess is stronger than what many people had been forecasting so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I think you'll see that in the growth in the mass market play. The numbers that we talked about before on the per day actualities for the mass market. We expect that those numbers will increase as the participation in the hotel increases. Eventually, we'll get a tracking for the out of town or the foreign visitors from the hotel and what they're doing if they get carded. In other words, if they get monitored in the casino, but we haven't done that yet. But that's your metric that you'll watch because there's only so much mass market that can come from the Singapore environment itself. And so, as the hotel fills and gets more interesting &#x2013; more interesting business from MICE, et cetera, things like we have a big Indian promotion going on in January to open that market more viably for us. I think that's the measure that you'll see. Slot play and mass drop will be the ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can ask one more? Thank you. On Las Vegas, one of the things I observe is a potential I believe expansion of McCarran at some point out in the future. And I admit to not knowing a heck of a lot about how those expansions get filled up with air capacity. And looking at that as a potential driver of some recovery in Las Vegas, what can you help us with in terms of how that rolls and what you might know about an expansion at the airport &#x2013; increased capacity at the airport? And just thinking about a Las Vegas recovery longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the airport is expanding with an additional runway, but it doesn't really do us much good because unless you get more lift into Las Vegas, U.S. Air and Southwest and whatever have cut back some of their lift into Vegas, which has caused, I believe it's something like 800,000 less passengers this year coming into the airport. That drop is really because no seats are available. Most of the planes that have come in here have very high load factors, and they're very profitable for the airlines, but they've sort of left us out in the cold.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of things that are happening that I see. Korean Air is coming in here now. There's a couple of other foreign carriers that have come in, BA and Virgin and what have you, that are dropping some people in here, but at the end of the day, to have a significant recovery for Vegas in terms of the totality of the market, we need more lift in here, because the drive traffic is pretty stable as well. And California does siphon off a little bit of that drive traffic with their own entertainment and casino facilities, so it's lift is the single most important thing in terms of that. McCarran can handle more traffic. It's just a question of getting more planes in.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At Marina Bay Sands, do you have any more or space to add more slot or table game capacity? And do you feel that you're capacity constrained at all right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have capacity. We could find more room, but we do have capacity. We're ready to do something. There's a possibility of some additional GFA [Gaming Framework Agreement] to be connected to the hotel, but I really can't say much about that now. If we're going to expand, right now with what we have, we're doing an analysis of the availability of the number of gaming, the private gaming rooms, so we're looking ahead, and we do have some space to put that.</p>
          <p>I think we're okay in the mass market, and I think we have enough capacity, but I think in the high end, as it grows, it's already close to, it's pushing 60% of total gaming income. It's from like 57% to 60% of the gaming income, and that keeps improving, keeps increasing, so I think that what we're going to focus on first is more private gaming. Just one private gaming room, one bet can equal all the bets that are on the table in the mass gaming floor for that minute, so there's a lot of upside potential at the high end. We're going to focus on making sure we have enough private gaming rooms.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The status of the Japan &#x2013; well, as I mentioned before, there is an inter-party gambling study group put together. It appears to me, and we've been told there is a draft of legislation. We've contributed to that. We've commented on that, and it's moving forward. They say that it should come through by the end of the six-month session starting I think in either January or February coming up. That within six months the legislation and all the companion legislation, you know, they have to modify other laws, such as an anti-gaming law, to make it legal to allow gambling, so there are a number of companion measures that have to be done. They say that it should be done by the end of September &#x2013; I'm sorry, by the end of June, and if it's done by the end of June, they're talking about going into July, going into the next session of the legislature will be the first half of '12, during which it will have already been put over to the, transferred to the prefectures, and the prefectures will set up their own procedures, and selection of operators should be made sometime. It could happen sooner, but they're talking more conservatively about first half of '12.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wonder if you could give us some color around receivables and if that as a percent of &#x2013; specifically casino receivables in both Singapore and Macau?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. It's Ken. I think we've, as Sheldon mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been very careful with regard to the extension of credit in Singapore. And as with the rest of our operations, when we establish reserves against receivable balances, we go account by account and work with all the marketing people, the collection people, and the finance people to determine the appropriate balances. So as a just overall statement, I think we're very conservatively stated relative to our receivable balances. And if you look at, at least Macau, we've got a reserve or allowance for collection of about 42% against the gross casino accounts receivable in total. And if you take a look at that after kind of the immediate collections that come right after the end of the quarter, it's almost 48%.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, obviously we're just getting started with regard to kind of the extension of credit and balances. We've got about a couple hundred million dollars of receivables outstanding, and we've got about a 12% reserve against that and no significant issues to really report. So we've gone through the vast majority of the accounts and feel that they're all adequately stated with the modest amount of reserves that we have. And actually, interestingly enough, we've had some kind of long outstanding balances that we're starting to see collections come in on those in the fourth quarter &#x2013; on accounts that hadn't paid for some time, and so we're doing actually better than what we expected.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, my position hasn't changed. We will seriously consider doing business with junket reps, but I'm still of the opinion that either they are not going to fully apply or that they're not going to be, if they fully apply, only the ones where they, I would think that only the ones with no track record would pass. And if they did pass, they won't have enough business to really add a lot of value to the junket rep mainstream of customers coming in.</p>
          <p>We keep finding little things that happen. One guy will send in a lot of money for the benefit of several other people, and we cut that off as soon as we see that. But junket &#x2013; we're not going to take any steps whatsoever that can be directly, indirectly, remotely, or overtly through junket reps because it's disallowed.</p>
          <p>We are erring on the side of following the casino regulatory authority rules. We're not sure that our competitor is doing this. I read an article yesterday about there seems to be the best &#x2013; the worst kept secret that Genting is doing business with junket reps. Now they've been doing business with junket reps for decades, and I'm not sure that they know, they have any experience with the credit markets. And they certainly want to &#x2013; they find it a lot easier to deal directly with the junket reps, but as I said before, and I'll say it again, I don't believe they're going to provide the information that the government will require, and if they do, they will either not be the kind of junket reps that the Macau style junket reps that provide and collect credit. They'll just be referring for limited commission or a cap on this commission. So I don't think the junket reps are going to be a major factor. They want very much to be there, and if they're going to be there, we'll seriously consider doing business with them, but so far we're doing quite well without them.</p>

          <p>Groups is strong. The men trends are good for the group segment. Unfortunately, the NADRs are lagging. We're probably in the 180/190 range, so we're not getting the 200 bucks back, so it's not happening. Demand is there. Unfortunately, there's a lot of competition in that segment and every segment in Las Vegas, so we expect that we'll hit our numbers as far as our dispensing but presentation, but I don't think rates will be &#x2013; they will not reach 200 bucks, no.</p>

          <p>The InterContinental, Larry, the InterContinental deal with 102 million customers take a thousand of your sales people out in the field, and the biggest venue that they're being asked for is Las Vegas with no property here to fill it. So we signed a deal with them, we just announced it a couple of days ago. I think it's difficult to add a lot of numbers to it, but I am quite convinced, and so is Mike, that this will be the difference between a lower occupancy and a full occupancy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; you know, they don't go after &#x2013; no hotel company goes after the big groups we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They don't chase 5,000 to 10,000 person, 15,000 person rooms. We can almost handle that in-house, you know, without leaving the building when other properties need a whole city full of hotels to accommodate that. So InterContinental is going to be a big push upwards for us, and I think it's going to have a positive effect on rate.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's not get too emotional about Las Vegas. It's still a struggle, and I think when group segment rates are still stopped at 200 bucks, and there's lots of talk moving up, and the numbers are numbers, and they haven't been all that compelling, have they?</p>

          <p>I know this sounds contradictory considering the reputation of my relationship with Steve Wynn, but I'm hoping that Steve Wynn, who's great at creating a mystique about an opening. I hope he opens up a new property. That will give Las Vegas a push.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that everything we read, we're helped right now by the weaker dollar and the stronger Singapore dollar. And as far as the China currency is concerned, we're also helped there as well. So I don't think anybody really knows. You can read every day. You're more into it than we are in terms of currency management. But right now we're in a very favorable situation with the money that comes in in Singapore dollars and the money in the Chinese currency. So I don't expect any negative surprises in there. It should be all positive for us in '11.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rachael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you &#x2013; how are you? I think you guys were talking a bit about the Las Vegas environment. Can you talk a little bit about the promotional environment on the casino side and whether or not you expect to see or how you would characterize the change in the market that you would expect to see from the opening of Cosmopolitan? And maybe any changes in your marketing or promotional strategy around that as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously a very intense promotional market in Las Vegas for the last 24 months due to the downturn in the cash demand segment. More people are giving away more things to pursue customers to our table, and that continues as we speak today. In addition, obviously, the cash segment's very competitive, as you tell with EBITDA. So I think no surprise that Las Vegas is competitive on the cash rate side and due to lack of demand that makes it more competitive on the comp rate side in additional offers. We've cut back. We continue to rethink our offers and how aggressive we want to be in field marketing.</p>
          <p>The town is still aggressive. I don't know how Cosmo, I have no idea how that will play out, but it can't be helpful, obviously. With more capacity in an already difficult market, can't be a positive for the market. How big a negative, I just don't know. But I think that you're going to see in '11 a continued promotional landscape in the Casino segment because the cash side has been holding up strong, so more people turned to spot and field marketing as a way to fill rooms.</p>
          <p>We try to cut back and we try to play to our peer group, which we think is Wynn and Bellagio and the better hotel casinos then we can offer an all-suite product. But it's getting competitive, by anyone's definition, a lot more so than it was in 2008. And I don't know how that gets any better with additional capacity. It's going to get worse in my opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gaming side, is it getting more promotional or more commercial? Are chips being offered or is it just predominantly on the room rate side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's on the gaming side as well because of lack of demand from the cash segment. People sold their rooms though, right so they're going to look to the gaming side and drop the requirements for complimentary rooms and discounted rooms and promotional giveaways, the tournaments, et cetera. There's a lot of promotions out there at all segments on the Casino side as an alternative to the weak cash market. So I think if anything it's gotten worse, and this time was a difficult time with promotions and the competition is fierce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But as we think about modeling next year in gaming revenues, would the pace of promotions have an impact on what we should think as the theoretical hold and would it be lower than it had been historically because of the increased promotional environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably in total, I wouldn't call it impactful the way, the amount. On the table games side, it's not a hold issue nor slot machines as far as promotional giveaways. We're just going to cut back on offers and be more judicious in our thinking and hope that we can grow more business on the group and the cash segment. We're hoping InterContinental deal. We're hoping better OTA approach and also strong group business that offset some of the promotional side. As Sheldon alluded to the, earlier in the call, he alluded to the difficulties of just chasing market share, and I think that's part of the problem, as you chase market share, the margins slip, and this adds more competitive pressure. So at this property we'll probably reduce our gaming offers and keep our revenues there. On the table games side, honestly it's driven by, primarily by the Asian business anyway. Our high-end business gets more important every day to us, as a mix, percentage mix on the table games side. On the slot side, we're going to reduce our offer somewhat and be more judicious and hope to fill more from the cash side.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to &#x2013; I'd like to add a little bit, just emphasize what Rob said. We are, I personally am averse to this kind of promotion, and I think that this is the time that we can convert that into other paying customers rather than giving too many of these giveaway packages. I think it diminishes our brand, and I don't think it does much for us, except put people in rooms. I remember Steve Wynn, our friend, said that he decided to try to fill up his rooms. So he said but every time people who stayed in his room, they went down to the bars and to the restaurants, and they got sticker shock. So they went over to other places where they'd previously been, the lower end place, the budget places and bought their food and did their playing over there. So I unusually so agree with him, and I think it doesn't really do us that much good. I've cut it down to 15%, and I'm now probably today or tomorrow going to cut it down to a maximum of 10%, and there's got to be certain high limit. There's got to be certain higher thresholds for anybody to qualify.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In Japan, what the market structure might look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In what respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of number of concessionaires, whether a partner would be required, tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a two &#x2013; right now they're talking about, they were talking about three, but now they're focusing on two, Tokyo and Osaka. And we believe that we've got a leg up because number one I know that everybody was talking about another competitor of ours had 1.2 million of free cash. I'd like to say we have 3.2 billion in cash and access for up to 6 billion. So we could do almost anything. Buy any company. Go develop any properties. We are considered the leading contender because of the integrated resort model in both Macau and Singapore in that part of the world, and we're very, very excited about Japan. I keep going there every few weeks and meeting with the decision makers.</p>
          <p>And we're also focusing on Korea. I might say that while we're talking right now, one of our development people has just finished a few days in Korea, and he's flying to a gaming investment meeting in Japan, in Tokyo. So it's &#x2013; we're very optimistic. You know they have pachinko parlors there, but they don't want to recognize that those are really casinos, and they have other forms of gaming like boat racing, horse racing, I believe football betting, or soccer betting, and lotteries. So it's not as though they're unfamiliar with wagering; they're quite familiar with wagering. They still have about 12,000 or 13,000 pachinko parlors, and most of those are what we would call slot parlors.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You have an additional six more months of data points in Singapore. Could you share with us what's your renewed expectations on the market side? And also I guess for argument's sake as well, what is your view on your revenue share going forward? I know your focus is on EBITDA, but just for argument's sake, what do you think &#x2013; where do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Opportunity in gross revenue? Or money we could put in the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's tough to say, but I think our market share will be at least equal. We are focusing on the high-end of the market, I believe more so than what Genting is. Genting is doing a very good job at the mass end, by the way, but they're just not experienced in granting credit, and they really want junket reps, and they're sponsoring a number of them. As I said earlier, it's difficult to say, I don't want to put my foot in my mouth and get into trouble about the future. It is true that I am seeing the upside potential for us for more than 3 billion, and that was only in '11. So when we get to '12, I see that with a major contribution from Singapore, we could be hitting 2 billion in '12 in Singapore. Singapore.</p>
          <p>So it's very difficult to say. As I said earlier, we're sailing in uncharted waters. I personally believe that we have little baskets of the whole cornucopia of prospective players coming from many, many different countries, and we're not going to be affected like somebody mentioned currency effect before. There's dealing in so many currencies that I don't think if China really loosens up their currency or tightens up their currency that they allow it to float. I don't think it's going to have that much meaning. It'll have a big meaning in Macau, and of course we're all in favor of that, but I don't think it's going to have much meaning in Singapore because the business comes from too many countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my other question was on jump on your rebate and commissions. I noticed that for the third quarter it worked out to be about 1.3%. Have we seen any trends at least in October? And again what are your expectations going forward on that? Do you see that going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No.  We hope so, we want to try to get it down. That includes the comps and a lot of those comps have to be spent with us. So it, we get part of it back. It's one-tenth of 1% comps. But I don't think it's an average of 1.3. I think it's somewhat substantially less than that. Frankly, I haven't, Rob, have you focused on that?</p>

          <p>38%, and we're averaging about 22,000 to 24,000 people a day. Am I correct there, Dan?</p>

          <p>Dan, put some bar charts in front of me and took my attention away. But I recollect we're under 25, oh, here it is. Most recent moving, most recent moving four week period is 25,000 people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What about percentage of revenue coming from the local market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me, 38%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It did not, the percentage of revenue buy first that we don't &#x2013; we don't have at this time between Singapore and the non-Singaporian in the mass &#x2013; in the mass piece. That may be something we can get in the future, but today we don't have that information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's interesting. We're getting two-thirds of the attendance that are non-Singaporian. So they're coming from somewhere. I would suspect that we're getting their 36,000 or 38,000 rooms &#x2013; hotels rooms. And they're all pretty good hotels in &#x2013; there are no flop houses that I know of in Singapore. They're all pretty good and a lot of brand names, international brand names. They named &#x2013; some of them have multiple hotels. I think that we get a lot of those people that come over by cab or any other way from these other properties because almost two-thirds of the attendants are coming &#x2013; are foreign, and we're not bringing in a lot of the foreign from Malaysia. Now they could be coming to us. Be we still don't have a lot of the, but we have some buses, but not that many up and running. So I think we're getting a lot, and we will be getting more and more churn travel.</p>
          <p>In January, I believe, we have the Zee Oscar Awards &#x2013; Oscar equivalent awards from India January 14th. And if we have that, it really &#x2013; when we had the IAFA, the Indian International &#x2013; IIFA, whatever, the equivalent &#x2013; another equivalent &#x2013; they have three or four Oscar type award programs. Zee is one of them. We're getting Zee, we'll get tremendous publicity all over India. I think that'll give us a big boost in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess just a final one. Thinking ahead, how should I be thinking about what you're going to be doing with the cash that you'll be generating out of Singapore? It seems like at the rate that EBITDA is chalking up, it's going to be very good. Will you be looking to speed up the debt repayment? Or would you be looking at potentially say paying a special dividend at some point back to the parent company? Could you share with us maybe looking forward, what would you do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll do one from each column. We'll look to pay off our debt. Bear in mind, that our retail is ramping up and as that ramps up, we'll be able to &#x2013; if and when it ramps to the point &#x2013; I'd say when really, it ramps to the point we expect it to, we could sell that and get enough &#x2013; get more money than what we need to pay off all the financing. So as far as I'm concerned in my own mind, we're all but paid off. It's not all about the shouting, about having the capacity to pay it off and add a billion plus in EBITDA. There's a lot of cash flow that could pay off in just a very short period of time, 3.5 billion U.S. By the way, we always talk in U.S. dollars. We're not talking in local currency.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick one. I don't think anyone asked about the margins at Venetian in Macau. And is there any kind of notional limit there, or authority you have? You set another record this quarter. Just kind of thinking going forward what are some of the expense issues? And where can that go with similar levels of gaming growth? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. As I said earlier, the higher the &#x2013; listen, we've resigned ourselves to dealing with the chunk of reps. We have good relationship with them. I had lunch with several of them. It's okay, they're doing a good job in Macau, and that's where we're at. The problem that we have is that SJM now it's rumored that MGM is going to do it. They're going to start leasing out just to get the high-end &#x2013; the top line market share. They're going to give out 3% of gross income for the sub-licenses. Well, that's amazing, just amazing, and people are talking about, whether conjecturally or factually or whatever, they're talking about gross income. What the heck does gross income mean when all you're taking is 3% out of the gross income? We &#x2013; I don't know how proud we could get.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind they're still talking about the possibility of the government lowering the tax rate in Macau, and as Singapore goes up, I could say there is business coming &#x2013; a lot of business coming from Hong Kong and China. They're not the dominant countries, Malaysia and Indonesia are the dominant countries in Singapore, but as Singapore does more and more business, and somebody had suggest it's all over the clippings that it is projected now by 2012 that we will pass the Las Vegas strip in terms of gross income, in terms of with revenue. So in Macau, because of the tax rate, I don't know how much higher we can get. But just take a seat of the pants estimate, I don't think we can surpass 40%, 38% or 40%. Do you, Rob?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I mean, it's &#x2013; we have to really, really, really &#x2013; although we've set several records in October, Golden Week. Golden Week, our moving average is about where it should be. Some months we'll have a higher number, sometimes a higher whole number, some months a lower whole number, but a moving average just where it should be. So I don't know where we're going to go on EBITDA margin. Listen, we're doing the best we can, we're trying to reduce expenses not only employed number of employees, we're trying to reduce outside expenses. We're just about to hire a new general counsel over there, extraordinarily so we can keep some of our Hong Kong legal expenses down. We're taking every step we can to get our customers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. On Singapore, can you give us a sense as to what percentage of room nights in '11 and '12 may be MICE. And if you could also, maybe an idea of week-day occupancy versus weekend at MBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll be in the high 90s or mid to high 90s on weekends at MBS. Right, we're lining those occupancies now. Hopefully mid-week occupancy would get into the 80s, at least in '11, better than that perhaps in '12 because of MICE ramp-up. I don't have the MICE room night &#x2013; room night situation for '11 and '12 in front of me at the moment, but our expectation is that we should be building up to roughly 300,000 room nights a year on MICE business as we get ramped up. Probably '12 we'll get that. Probably we'll be lower than that in '11. The forward bookings, we're really starting to really get the credibility now. And so that would be &#x2013; if you split the building up into various segments you can &#x2013; tour business should be in the 700s, MICE business in the 1,000s, and then you've got 400 or 500 casino business, and the rest is transient. I mean that's basically an overall look at it. And that's our target to get to an occupancy that runs in the 90s.</p>
          <p>'12 will be a very interesting year because I think '12 is where the retail business will really start to move dramatically because the subway system will open that runs right into the retail area. We're working on some other transportation mechanisms now to get people in there to drive that up as well. So I think by the time '12 we should be in a situation where we're getting the maximum out of the total facility, not counting the casino, of course, which will continue to grow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just two more. One on the metrics in October, given very strong for Singapore obviously. I know there's no official Golden Week in Singapore, but did you see an unusual increase in VIP volume, maybe from Mainland China? And has there been any fall-off since the holiday ended?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we did get significantly more play in the Golden Week period. I can't tell you for sure whether it was from Mainland China or, but it was a better play. But October has been very strong all the way through, not quite as strong as those two or three days. Those two or three days &#x2013; the same days in Macau were sort of off the chart in terms of roll as well as mass, but we've had very steady play all the way through October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just last one on &#x2013; we saw kind of the visitation volume and percentage year-over-year in Macau, it dipped in September. I know the revenue was good, so the quality of customer must have been good, but I'm just trying to figure that out. I mean I know Moon Festival fell into September versus last year it didn't. Maybe that's a family holiday, I know it's back-to-school season, but is there anything that you guys have seen or something to look out for going forward in visitation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know I saw that number yesterday about the September drop in visitation. If it dropped, we didn't really feel it. I mean we had a very good September, and I don't remember what last September really was about. I think often times there is a drop before Golden Week, people don't come in. They wait for the Golden Week period to come in, which is in October obviously. But I looked at it. It was a strange number to me. I hadn't heard anything from our people over there, nor have we discussed it here because frankly the business was so good, we didn't really pay much attention to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then I'm sure just looking at where you guys were in terms of room rate, October visitation looks like it goes back to normal form in a way.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, Ken. And then next thing on depreciation, I noticed that the Marina Bay Sands depreciation in the quarter was about $45 million. That was well below what I thought it would be given the size of the project. Is that a fair number going forward? Or is there going to be some adjustments by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean &#x2013; that should be reflective of a full quarter of depreciation, and I would think as the continued construction spend takes place, and we've got probably another $250 million to spend through the end of this year and about $600 million of kind of retainage payment that'll go through next year. You'll see that number creep up based upon the total capitalized cost.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also, Rob, on the second quarter call you mentioned that retail failed. I think the canal shops in June were up 56% above June of '09. Can you give us an idea of how that business was in the third quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Macau. Yeah. Retail requirements in Macau are up. In fact we're basically pretty close to signing an increase in our retail space from DSS for &#x2013; in the Four Seasons Mall for another, I think, it's 15,000 to 20,000 feet.</p>

          <p>50,000 feet, yeah. And because sales are very brisk. They're up considerably in Macau. We did change some of our rental percentages and rental situations during the drop in Macau a year or two ago, but now it's starting to come back pretty strongly for us.</p>

          <p>In the third quarter, just quarter-over-quarter basis the annualized sales per square foot are up about 25%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Phenomenal. And then what about the direct VIP business in Macau? What percentage of your role is from direct play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about a quarter, a third. What is it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about a quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around the same as last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That &#x2013; which is about 25...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we're not the &#x2013; this is a process that a former CEO did, that's Steve Jacobs. We are not in agreement with that. We believe that the junket reps own the market in Macau. It diminishes our relationship or the value of our relationship with the junket reps. So we are not out proactively looking for direct business. And we still don't know how much it costs us in credit defaults, et cetera, et cetera. Clearly there's a lot more Chinese business in Macau from China, from mainland China than there is in Singapore. So it's more precarious for us to issue credit to China, an unlimited amount of credit to China. So I think we're going to keep, we're hoping to keep the direct business where it is. I think it's somewhere between &#x2013; I've been following it &#x2013; about 25% to 30%. And we're going to try to keep it even at that point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, the win percentage in Las Vegas, was it pretty similar between the Venetian and the Palazzo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can't answer that question. Cumulatively you see numbers was 17.1 and cost was like $19 million. I &#x2013; probably &#x2013; do we have a number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we don't present them together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We present them unified, and obviously if you look at the volume in play in Las Vegas, we're the recipient of a lot of help from a lot of casinos in Asia. Unfortunately, they play them lucky about four points &#x2013; 4.5 points against norm. So cost was up $19 million. It doesn't really matter to us, either way we're stable or playing in the Venetian plots. We treat them equally.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>And, Dennis, the capitalized interest number is around 32 million for this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is it going up, Ken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will go up some because of the construction in Macau.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it will go up probably right through the fourth quarter of next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>At this time, we would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Leven, President of Las Vegas Sands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator. And thanks to all of you again for your questions and your interest today. Just a couple of quick comments from me before I turn it back to Sheldon for final thoughts. First, I want to mention that the focus on our cost control and efficiency that we emphasized over the last two years continues in the future. You can be certain we will continue to watch our costs as we go forward even as we turn attention increasingly towards revenue growth in all of our outlets. Secondly, I want all to know that we have been working very hard over the last two years to broaden and deepen the management team and to build the right management infrastructure that will allow the company to make prudent management decisions and to achieve even greater levels of performance in the years ahead. We want to prepare ourselves to repeat our current successes in additional, emerging gaming jurisdictions. Now let me turn it over to Sheldon for final thoughts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. We just completed another outstanding quarter, generating record revenues and EBITDA in Macau, an outstanding first full quarter of operations from Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and record revenues and EBITDA for the company overall. From my perspective our operations are in outstanding shape, and we have clearly, as the Macau publication stated, separated ourselves from the pack.</p>
          <p>We have never in the history of our company been better positioned to deliver strong growth in the future. We have also significantly reduced our debt levels, and our balance sheet has over three billion of cash. I think it's 3.2 billion, providing significant financial flexibility and enabling us to continue our industry-leading growth strategy. We would have up to 6 billion if we included our unused revolvers, I believe. Am I correct on that, Ken?</p>

      <speaker id="20">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a hair under that, but yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>A hair under 6 billion, but who's counting? We couldn't be more enthused about our business today and about our strong positioning for the future with the quality of the assets that we have that have seen a bump in casino trust upward, particularly the uncovering of the new untouched market in Southeast Asia and Singapore.</p>
          <p>I want to thank all of you for joining us. We sincerely appreciate your interest and the support of our shareholders. That's the end of our call. Thank you very much.  Goodbye.</p>
