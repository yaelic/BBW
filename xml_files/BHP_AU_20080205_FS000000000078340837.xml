        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Marius Kloppers, Chief Executive of BHP Billiton. I'm here to welcome you to today's presentation for the half-year results for financial year 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm speaking to you from Melbourne &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; Sydney, that is. Early, early start, guys. Early start. Alex Vanselow is in London. And we've got a number of other members of my executive committee here. See, they're awake in London already.</p>
          <p>So let me start off on a more serious note about safety. There is no more important issue for us. We've had 10 fatalities during this financial year, and this has deeply concerned me, the board, and the rest of our management team.</p>
          <p>Although our injury &#x2013; our statistical rates on injuries and other events continued to show very good progress from already industry-leading levels, the fact is that low injury rates will not prevent fatalities. And the reality is that we've lost 10 of our colleagues. Their families and friends have lost so much more.</p>
          <p>We clearly need to continue to focus on safety. And we will never be successful, if we can't achieve our goal of zero harm. There is no single answer. But I do believe that zero harm, which is our stated objective, is the only way to go about this.</p>
          <p>In the six months that have passed, we have continued to focus on our core business and our core strategy, despite some of the matters, which I'm sure you're interested in and which we've been contemplating during the last six months.</p>
          <p>And these core areas for us are, in addition to safety, which I've already stated is the absolute overriding and number one commitment, is operating reliably and efficiently, getting our assets to perform at 100% of their capacity, 100% of the time, and to execute our growth projects on budget, on time and safely. And, of course, in addition to that, absolute iron control of costs in what is a very inflationary environment.</p>
          <p>Now, our set of results &#x2013; and Alex will give you more details from London &#x2013; demonstrates our core focus. We achieved record production across the breadth of our business and earnings records for key commodities. Our cost performance has been nothing short of exceptional.</p>
          <p>We continued our track record of successful project execution, achieving first production in seven main projects across five commodities. We also approved four new projects. Our cash flow generation has continued to be strong, which apart from reinvesting in our business, has allowed us to complete $8.8 billion of our $13 billion share buyback program. And today, we declared a $0.29 interim dividend and this is 45% uplift on the comparable period last year.</p>
          <p>Well, we need to be cognizant of the fluidity in the shorter term macro environment and I'll say few words more about that in just a while. We remain absolutely convinced of the long-term growth fundamentals of those emerging economies driving demand for our product.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand over to Alex to take through the details of our financial results, and then I'll talk to you a little bit after that again. Alex?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Marius. And welcome to everyone. It is my pleasure to take your through our results in more detail and show how the basic fundamentals of the solid production performance, cost control and growth delivery as outlined by Marius. I translate into another strong set of financial results.</p>
          <p>We generated 25.5 billion in revenue, up 15%. Our EBIT was 9.6 billion up 6 &#x2013; 5%. Attributable profit of 6 billion was slightly lower than previous period. Mainly because benefits from prior US tax losses were fully utilized for the cost of last year. However, earnings per share benefited from recent share buybacks and at US$106.8 was 2.8% higher than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>We had net operating cash flow of 7.9 billion, which was an increase of 11%. Despite softening in commodity prices and a weak US dollar, our EBIT margin remain a healthy 44%, demonstrating once again the value of diversification, scale and quality.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains very strong. We've underlined gearing of 28%. This was achieved by continued substantial capital investment, share buybacks and recently rebased progressive dividend policy. Before taking you for the results of CSGs, I would like to draw our attention to the overall strong financial performance of our business.</p>
          <p>These results were driven by excellent production performance, outstanding cost containment and higher prices. Offsetting this was the impact of a weakening US dollar in our business. In this environment, three of our CSGs iron ore, manganese and petroleum had record EBIT.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at these results in more detail, starting with petroleum. With strong oil prices and increased production, petroleum achieved record EBIT of almost 2 billion, up 22%. This reflects the change in average realized price of oil per barrel from $64 to $81.</p>
          <p>Total production was a record mostly due to start ups of Atlantis and Genghis Khan in the US and Stybarrow in Australia. Petroleum's production profile will continue to increase in the second half as this operations ramp-up and Neptune and Zamzama expansion our commissioned.</p>
          <p>Gross exploration, expenditure in petroleum was 295 million and this was high as a result of increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia. To support the capture of further opportunities in these areas, we have increased petroleum exploration budget for fiscal year 2008 to 600 million.</p>
          <p>Aluminum delivered record alumina and metal production. However, EBIT of 680 million was down 19% largely due to lower average prices. The power situation in South Africa had deteriorated and while we continue to manage this closely it will impact volumes in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>Base metals EBIT rose 17% to 3.4 billion. This was driven by record copper concentrate production and significant higher production of silver, lead and zinc. Spencer together with Escondida Sulphide Leach in Chile and Pinto Valley in United States provided 96,000 tons of additional copper production. Olympic Dam achieved an all time high in total material milled and hoist and the pre-feasibility study is also progressing well.</p>
          <p>The stainless steel materials EBIT was down 44% to 799 million. This is a &#x2013; this result was impacted by soft demand that led to some build-up of inventories. And plant shutdowns at the Kalgoorlie Nickels smelter and Yabulu. Also start-up cost of Ravensthorpe and Yabulu of 132 million had a negative impact on EBIT. Market conditions improved in the second quarter. And the outlook for production is positive. The ramp-up of Ravensthorpe is underway and the commission of Yabulu expenses is on target for this current quarter.</p>
          <p>Iron ore delivered another record result driven by higher prices and volumes and increase spot sales. EBIT was up 19% to a record 1.7 billion. Production was again, a record for &#x2013; with a benefit of the additional capacity of RGP2, and some early gains coming from the commissioning of RGP3. Samarco also achieved record production.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of foreign exchange costs were flat half-on-half. Business excellence initiatives help to mitigate the impact of higher energy prices and the US dollar weakness. We will continue to add production volume as RGP3 is fully ramped up and the Samarco third pellet plant comes on stream.</p>
          <p>Higher sales and all time record ore and alloy production and higher prices for the half year have driven manganese EBIT up 311% to 431 million for the period. The Groote Eylandt expansion of an additional one million tons per annum of concentrate was approved during this period. This will take production to 4.2 million tons per annum by 2010.</p>
          <p>In metallurgical coal EBIT was 523 million down 20%, mainly attributable to lower prices. Production for the half year was higher than the comparative period and was achieved despite a season of wet weather in Queensland. Both Illawarra and Queensland Coal achieved record half year shipments with the latter benefiting from the expanded Hay Point Terminal. Recent heavy flooding in Queensland, will constrain production in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>EBIT for Energy Coal increased 15% to 277 million. Higher production was achieved at Hunter Valley Coal in Australia and Cerr&#xE9;jon in Columbia. The Klipspruit project in South Africa and the new export terminal Newcastle in Australia have now been approved.</p>
          <p>In Diamonds and Specialty products EBIT was 72 million a decrease of 8%, compared to last year mainly due to the increased exploration activity in Angola of 34 million, and continued exploration activity on perspective potash acreage in Canada. Now, the Koala underground project was delivered ahead of schedule and on the budget.</p>
          <p>This concludes the highlights for each of the CSGs. But before I hand you back to Marius, I would like to go over some key &#x2013; two key areas of focus. And one of them, as Marius mentioned, is the cost side.</p>
          <p>Our cost performance and our cost management initiatives again delivered outstanding results. The half and half-year increase was just 1.7%. Our cash cost increase was less than 200 million. This is the lowest rate of increase since cost pressures began more than four years ago.</p>
          <p>We have now achieved a declining rate for four consecutive half years. This was achieved in an environment where energy costs are at all-time highs, and where labor and the resources sector continued to be in short supply. In fact, 77% of our cost increase have come from fuel and energy, raw materials and labor.</p>
          <p>Fuel and energy cost increases are more than offset by our long energy portfolio position. The raw materials have a strong price correlation to our products. And the higher mining numbers reflect the newly commissioned expansions. Savings from operational improvements, cost mitigation exercises, and revenue enhancements totaled 414 million for the half year.</p>
          <p>Now, the second key focus area that I want to touch is the delivery of value to our shareholders. Our priorities for cash remain unchanged. First is to reinvest in value accretive opportunities in the business. And assuming that our capital structure is supported, we then return funds to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Today, we announced an interim dividend of US$0.29 per share, which is up 45%. This is our 12th consecutive dividend increase, and our compound dividend growth rate over the last six years is 27%.</p>
          <p>The 13 billion capital management initiative announced last year was suspended on 14 December 2007, with $4.2 billion balance outstanding. During the first half of this financial year, we've purchased &#x2013; we repurchased 97 million shares by our own market buybacks and we have canceled 71 million of these shares.</p>
          <p>Going back, since our first buyback in 2004, we have repurchased 680 million shares representing approximately 11% of the total shares on issue. So, to conclude, we operated our assets well, with strong production and excellent cost containment. We delivered new projects and continue to invest in the business at record levels. We continue to reward our shareholders for significantly increase dividends and value accretive capital management. In summary this was another outstanding result. And with that I'll hand you back to Marius.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. For a number of years, we have spoken a lot about the industrialization taking place in China and in India. How this has impacted our business and how we see the strong long-term growth fundamentals. As I stand here today, as I've stated earlier, I don't see any change to this long-term outlook. And we continue to plan and execute our strategy on that basis. The chart here on the left hand side shows that GDP for China and India is growing strongly and we expect this to continue.</p>
          <p>However, recent events cannot be ignored. Sentiment is changed and the shorter term has become more fluid. And while I don't want to deviate from the words of my predecessor Chip Goodyear, who always used to say that we don't make crystal bowls around here. I thought that I would give a few perspectives of what we can expect in the shorter term. China's growth is driven by domestic demand. It's driven by investment and private consumption. Trade is an important activity, reflecting China's ever-increasing integration into the global economy. Net exports have risen in recent years as you can see on the chart, but growth continues to be dominated by domestic demand.</p>
          <p>Now a lot has been said about the impact of the US consumer and Chinese growth. A US recession is likely to have an impact, but how much? We have couple of important factors, which would determine the extent of impact on China's growth. Firstly, China's export markets are remarkably diversified, as you can see on the chart, and the US is no longer the most important destination for mainland goods. This is illustrated by the chart on the left hand side. The real question is: can additional Chinese consumption offset the shorter term slow down in the US?</p>
          <p>Now on many of our key commodities, China and India together, just as a rule of thumb on average, consume or are approaching the same consumption as the US and the EU together. About the same size on average, and we show that on this chart. But worthwhile noting here on the right hand side is also how much of incremental demand is accounted for by China. And it is in this context that we need to consider the shorter term impact of US issues. Each unit of consumption that you lose in the equally sized European and American market needs to be made up by an incremental unit of consumption in China and the US.</p>
          <p>Now it's not a 1 to 1 ratio just simply looking at GDP percentages, because each unit of GDP in China, just to make it more complex, is about five times as metal intensive as a unit of GDP in the US. And this just reflects the stage of development, the fact that urbanization, manufacturing, and so on is causing investment.</p>
          <p>A further variable to add to the mix is that supply side has been constrained and indeed by and large it's been supply-side lag where the supply side has continued to underperform estimates of analysts over many years now, that has kept, or have kept prices buoyant. And it is the supply side, which will codetermine prices going forward. So, again, no crystal ball, but putting all of these factors together, although we expect that commodity markets will display resilience in the short-term, in this period where there has been some change, we are a bit more reserved about the short-term than we were 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>But back to the long-term fundamentals. Many people are now more comfortable with the infrastructure build that is required to develop, for example, new cities, as whole populations urbanize.</p>
          <p>Even the most developed of cities, and for example, China, will still require substantial infrastructure development, creating the baseline demand for our products. And what we've shown here is Beijing subway system and just compared that to Paris and Tokyo. The second phase of infrastructure development is just beginning.</p>
          <p>In summary, our outlook for long-term demand is absolutely unchanged. So, what are we doing about meeting this demand? You'll have seen this chart many times over the last half year or so, and what I want to reinforce that we have a fantastic portfolio of projects totaling now about $85 billion.</p>
          <p>These projects are underpinned by the definitive set of assets, which will provide us with a high-quality, lower-risk options to continue to grow our output, to meet the demand that we've just shown you in the long term. As many of these expansions are of existing operations, they can be brought to market relatively cheaply and quickly.</p>
          <p>And at our last results presentation, we talked about the significant volume growth that we were expecting in FY 2008, in the same way that we had volume growth of all of the years since we started the DLC from this high quality pipeline. Now, we delivered seven new projects, including Genghis Khan, Atlantis South and Stybarrow. Along with an additional four projects which we expect to commission in the next six months we are well on our way to achieving that 8% volume growth that we flagged when this year started. The board has also approved construction of four new projects and earlier this week we announced pre-approval funding for RGP5 the expansion of our Western Australian iron ore assets and this will enable growth in volume to continue.</p>
          <p>Our business was and continues to be and will be a long-term one. We cannot underestimate how critical it is to continue to identify new growth opportunities as we proceed through time. And in this context we've added another 12 projects to our suite of options and to that jellybean chart. Additionally, we are targeting those investments to the right areas. Our disciplined approach to capital investment is evident when you look at the projects that are currently in development.</p>
          <p>In calendar year 2007, our petroleum business achieved EBITDA margins of 75%, iron ore 50% and aluminum close to 40%. And I want to highlight in the next couple of slides how this quality, how this unique balance; this unique diversification in our portfolio makes us perform. Now, not only do we have a broad diversification across the carbon steel materials products and I'll talk about that in a little while. But we also have that in non ferrous products and in energy. We therefore, diversified within each of these categories. The carbon steel materials business is a good example. Demand for each of iron ore metallurgical coal and manganese is ultimately driven by the demand for carbon steel or crude steel.</p>
          <p>Real steel consumption is growing strongly at about 7% per annum. China continues to perform strongly with 72 million tons of production added in calendar year 2007 for a total output of almost $0.5 billion &#x2013; 0.5 billion tons. India, the Middle East, CIS, and south America also showed strong steel production.</p>
          <p>Over the last couple of months in particular, we heard a lot about iron ore consumption in China, and our view is not likely to be vastly different from yours. The fundamentals for iron ore, driven by steel, provide strong continued support for several years. We love their model &#x2013; we love our iron ore business. But steel making is not only about iron ore, it's also about metallurgical coal and to the extent the steel makers are increasing capacity the majority of growth being in large capacity blast furnace &#x2013; furnaces where high quality coal control is an absolutely essential ingredient for retaining maximum hot metal productivity. And the demand growth in metallurgical coal is being driven by the strong growth in the integrated steel making capacity in China, Brazil and India. And China while they have their own domestic coking coal reserves, they're starting to experience quality and supply issues. And they've started importing additional supply.</p>
          <p>In India and Brazil, in particular, there is very little domestic supply, so that all of the steel growth that is happening there has got a direct impact on metallurgical coal demand. And steel making is also about manganese, where we are the world's largest producer. The majority of manganese ore is used in primary steel making to promote strength and resilience. So, our exposure to steel making products is more than just iron ore. If anything, the fundamentals for manganese and coking coal look even better than that for iron ore. For the current half year alone, EBIT generated from our coking coal business and manganese business was a bit &#x2013; about $1 billion, or close to 60% of the EBIT generated by our iron ore business. And historically, I should point out that over time manganese, coking coal and iron ore prices are correlated. One goes up, the other one goes up.</p>
          <p>Now, before finishing up on the results part of our presentation today, I want to talk about energy. Now, like carbon steel materials, energy is another broad commodity group where we have wide diversification. You might have seen this slide when it is presented by another industry player. It shows the US dollar per capita expenditure on various materials as GDP grows. And I think I drew the conclusion that there is a great market for aluminum out there. But let me show you the complete picture.</p>
          <p>Primary energy consumption is strongly correlated to economic development. World primary energy demand is predicted to grow by almost 50% by 2030, primarily driven by developing economies like China and India, which are short on domestic energy reserves.</p>
          <p>On this chart, you can clearly see that the dollar value of just crude oil, for example, on a per capita basis is an order of magnitude higher than that of non-ferrous metals. And it grows at a far quicker pace at lower levels of GDP per capita.</p>
          <p>So we know that energy demand is expected to grow strongly over time. And as a supplier of natural resources, we have an important role in meeting the world's growing energy and resources needs.</p>
          <p>Environmental issues will have an increasing impact on the fuel mix for power generation. And it is in particular, worthwhile noting that the perceptions around the nuclear industry are changing rapidly.</p>
          <p>We cannot predict what fuel choices will be ultimately made, but our diversified energy portfolio is exceptionally well positioned to meet the growing demand across the full suite of fuels. So, let me just recap for you. Given these fundamentals, why would you not want diversified energy exposure?</p>
          <p>So in summary, our diversified portfolio has once again delivered excellent and operating financial results through a relentless focus on the base elements of our strategy. We are on track to deliver significant volume growth in 2008 from our newly commissioned projects and the additional projects, which are expected to come on time online in this half.</p>
          <p>Our significant project pipeline provides great growth opportunities for the future. The long-term fundamentals of our businesses continue to support strong demand growth. In the shorter-term, although we expect the commodity markets to be resilient in this period of uncertainty we are a bit more reserved about the short-term than we were 12 months ago and this concludes the results part of our presentation. Now, today we announced our decision to make formal offers for Rio Tinto PLC and Rio Tinto Limited.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through what I believe is a compelling offer for the Rio Tinto shareholders, but most importantly, delivers value to our BHP Billiton shareholders. As usual I must refer you to the disclaimer statement, it's very important that you read and understand this statement. Perhaps as start, it's important to recount the events that have brought us today, early in 2007 we approach Rio Tinto on a private basis to raise the concept of a no premium merger, this is prior to the Alcan acquisition, this was rejected by Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>On November 1 we made a confidential proposal to Rio Tinto to combine the two parties. Rio Tinto rejected the proposal and refused to enter into any discussions on the matter, following intense market speculation, on November 8 last year, BHP Billiton announced that it had previously and recently approached the Rio Tinto board, with a proposal and subsequently on November 12, we made public the key dimensions of that proposal. So, what's happened subsequently?</p>
          <p>In the global roadshows following our announcement, many shareholders told us that they clearly understood the compelling industrial logic of this combination, irrefutable is what I would call it. However, despite that proactive approach and initiative to unlock value for the Rio Tinto shareholders, Rio Tinto continued to refuse to engage with us on our proposal; although, I read in the press just when I walked in that they were considering our proposal and on December 21, following Rio Tinto's application to the takeovers panel, BHP Billiton was given notice that despite wanting to engage for as long as possible and wanting to be as patient as possible to explore avenues for value creation, we had to make our intentions clear by today. So, today, we are announcing offers for all of the outstanding shares of both Rio Tinto PLC and Rio Tinto Limited. Given Rio Tinto's continued refusal to engage and the deadline set by the UK takeover panel, we have had no choice despite our preference for engagement to put our offer directly to the Rio Tinto shareholders.</p>
          <p>And of course, Chinalco's acquisition of 12% in Rio Tinto PLC is an interesting development in the process. That said, it doesn't change our view on value. It doesn't change our view and the market's view about the compelling nature and the value unlock that can be had when these two great portfolios are put together. I'll make some further comments on this in just a minute.</p>
          <p>Now, due to the Rio Tinto DLC structure, we must make separate offers in order to acquire all of the shares in Rio Tinto. We are offering Rio Tinto PLC shareholder 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for every Rio Tinto PLC share held. The 3.4 shares are made up of 80% BHP Billiton PLC shares and 20% BHP Billiton Limited shares and with a mix and match facility.</p>
          <p>The offer to the Rio Tinto Limited shareholders is 3.4 BHP Billiton Limited shares for every Rio Tinto Limited share held. I refer all Rio Tinto shareholders to the formal announcements that we have made with further detail on our offers.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that the two offers that we've made for Rio Tinto PLC and Rio Tinto Limited are inter-conditional. The DLC structure of Rio Tinto means that we must succeed in both legs of the DLC and there are several important matters to note.</p>
          <p>The offers are subject to a number of preconditions pertaining to anti-trust clearances in the EU, US, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and of course, in Australia firm approval. The offer documents will be posted to shareholders after these approvals have been obtained.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have decided to structure the offers such that they are conditional upon more than 50% acceptances in each of the legs of the DLC. Important are the publicly held shares in each of the DLC. Importantly, we believe that starting this process with a 50% minimum acceptance condition gives Rio Tinto shareholders greater comfort that they will able to realize the compelling benefits offered by this combination.</p>
          <p>That said, I want to be very clear. The offer that we are announcing today delivers a very major value uplift for Rio Tinto shareholders, compared to any real and feasible alternative that can possibly be envisaged for Rio Tinto on a standalone basis. We strongly believe that our offer will receive the necessary support to complete this transaction successfully and merge these two companies into the premium mining and energy diversified resources company in the world.</p>
          <p>Finally, we've arranged a committed bank facility of $55 billion. This facility together with the cash flows from the operations of the two companies and asset disposal proceeds will provide us with all of the funding necessary to fund the proposed initial share buyback of approximately $30 billion, and any refinancing of Rio Tinto borrowings that may be required.</p>
          <p>Let us recall the rationale for this combination. Why are we offering to combine these two companies? Because the combination would facilitate our ability to deliver more product, more quickly. The product would &#x2013; delivery would not only be faster and at a lower cost, but at the same time, it would enable us to remove the unnecessary duplication of activities between the two companies. And we believe that quantified synergies are on the order of $3.7 billion per annum by year seven. I want to stress that these synergies are unique to this combination, they don't belong to anybody else, you don't get them if you don't put these two companies together.</p>
          <p>They are ready to be captured for the benefit of both sets of shareholders, which by our old script proposal will have an ongoing role in the combined company. We would create a diversified resources industry super merger, with an unparalleled portfolio of Tier 1 assets and strong growth portfolio. It would be uniquely positioned to service the extraordinary China urbanization event that both BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto believe in, and that we believe will transform the global economy over the next decades.</p>
          <p>The combined entity would be a core investment holding on a global basis and importantly, it will deliver value to a broader set of stakeholders. For our customers, more product. For the communities in which we operate, genuine benefits.</p>
          <p>Now, let us turn to the offer and perspectives on value. During the first half of 2007, Rio Tinto traded an average exchange ratio of about 2.7 to BHP Billiton, with the exception of periods where rumors of a possible BHP Billiton offer were in the market.</p>
          <p>Following Rio Tinto's acquisition of Alcan, the share exchange ratio almost immediately dropped to 2.4 and stayed there until BHP Billiton made its proposal. These are two of the most heavily researched companies in their respective markets. We have a very substantial shareholder overlap, a large body of shareholders that are in a perfect place to relatively value these two companies and it's against this backdrop that both companies presented their results and Rio Tinto had made very comprehensive presentations to the market in regards to Alcan.</p>
          <p>It's very hard to argue that the market did not have all of the information to give a view on the relative value of these two companies, and to establish a fair relative trading value. That fair relative trading value was 2.4, and in a no-premium merger, that means that the Rio Tinto shareholders in a combined entity would have owned 36% of the company.</p>
          <p>Now for some guidance on the value impact following Rio Tinto's flurry of announcements and presentations, and so on, and so on. Since our proposal, I suggest we turn to evidence from the market and what's been plotted here is the movement in market cap of Rio Tinto relative to an index of mining company peers and plotted since the announcement of our proposal. The index includes Western mining companies with a market value over 20 billion other than BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata for obvious reasons. So, we are plotting the Rio Tinto performance against the index of peers.</p>
          <p>Flat means there's been no change. This index has historically been highly correlated to BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto's stocks. So, by looking at the relative market capitalization relative to the peer group, we should be able to see the events that have created additional and extra value. And what this shows is that there's been only one event that has affected the market's perception of how much Rio Tinto was worth. That event was our proposal, the rest of the time it's been as flat as a table.</p>
          <p>After that initial spike on the announcement of our proposal and the couple of little movements based on rumors, Rio Tinto has traded in line with its peers. Let me be clear, the acquisition of Chinalco an array 12% overnight full cash at on the day a 3.5 exchange ratio does not constitute a price. There is one offer on the table, that's our bid, it's the only one that is capable of being accepted after the preconditions have been cleared for all the shareholders of Rio Tinto, both PLC and Limited.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn to the value of the offer itself, there are additional background points that I want to make. I want to emphasize again that this is an old share transaction. Rio Tinto shareholders are being offered the chance to exchange their shares in a global diversified company for even more diversified company and a better company. They're receiving an instantaneous premium, a pro-rata share of the combined synergies, and an opportunity to participate in the long-term growth of our industry on a more diversified basis. Remember, the only thing that matters here is the relative value of the two companies. And we're not talking about nil premium merger. This is a takeover offer. And we're comfortable with paying a premium for a change of control over the fair value, provided that the resulting deal still delivers value to our existing BHP Billiton shareholders, which it does.</p>
          <p>In our presentation to the market on December, I set out the superior relative total shareholder performance of BHP from the date of the formation of our DLC to the date of approach. If anything, the BHP Billiton team would argue that it was the undervalued party. In addition, the evidence of the market is that since our proposal was made public, our market is ascribed no new value to all of the communication, to all of the information released by Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>However, in deciding the terms of our offer, we have taken a course that is responsible. We've talked to and listened to a major set of cross shareholders from both companies. Now, we are putting to Rio Tinto an offer that is very compelling for Rio Tinto shareholders because it delivers to them a material value uplift, one not available on a stand-alone basis. While compelling for Rio Tinto shareholders the offer is also responsible in the context of the existing BHP Billiton shareholders.</p>
          <p>We've had three months to decide how we should take this matter forward in a manner that works for all shareholders. Today was the last day on which we could make this decision. We have been patient. We have taken all events, all information into account into what we believe is a compelling and a rational proposal to both sets of shareholders. From here the offer process will take many months, but I am convinced that this compelling offer ensures that BHP Billiton will unlock the value that is unique to the combination of these two portfolios.</p>
          <p>Now, the offer that we've announced is 3.4 shares, as I've said, to compelling uplift. Fair value established by the market would have given the Rio Tinto shareholders 36% of the company. Our offer delivers 44% of the combined company, a very material uplift from this 36%.</p>
          <p>Again, this value uplift is not alone &#x2013; not available on a standalone basis. The same time, BHP Billiton can be confident that the transaction delivers value to them &#x2013; value, again, that is not available if we don't put these two portfolios together.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the premium implied by our offer. Our offer delivers a 45% premium to the combined average fair value market capitalization of Rio Tinto. On this slide, we have plotted the relevant precedents in comparable sector. These are all stock mega mergers and takeovers in the resources and materials sector.</p>
          <p>And against these precedents, we are offering a very substantial premium indeed, as can be seen on the slide. Again, without sounding like a broken record, this value uplift is not available to the Rio Tinto shareholders on a standalone basis.</p>
          <p>If it were not for BHP Billiton's offer and the value uplift that is unique to this combination, it is our strong view that the underlying fundamentals of Rio Tinto simply do not support anything like the current share price.</p>
          <p>Secondly, they're being offered not only this premium but a pro-rata share of future value. I think this is a good point to make some further comments on the Chinalco stake. We've regarded this as an interesting, although not entirely unforeseen set of events.</p>
          <p>We note that there has been much speculation on motive. Chinalco's described the investment is strategic in character. What is however, clear is that it implies a very positive long-term view on the sector.</p>
          <p>Now as I've said, the offer terms must deliver value for the BHP Billiton shareholders. It will deliver our shareholders 56% of the enlarged company with a materially enhanced even more diversified asset portfolio and superior future growth options. Additionally, they will secure a pro rata share in the unique and material value unlocked by this combination alone.</p>
          <p>Let me show BHP Billiton shareholders that we are very, very focused on the value impact on you. This transaction will be accretive to earnings and share and cash flow per share in the first full-year following completion of the transaction.</p>
          <p>The value accretion for BHP Billiton shareholders as materials and I remind them of the total &#x2013; of the outstanding growth in total shareholder return delivered by BHP Billiton after the 2001 DLC merger. Outstanding in both an absolute sense and relative to Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>Turning now to process, as I've mentioned earlier the posting of offer documentation is subject to the preconditions obtaining antitrust clearances in the EU, Australia, the United States, South Africa and firm approval in Australia.</p>
          <p>We expect the necessary clearances to be obtained in the second half of 2008. We've already progressed pre-notification discussions with the European commission and we expect that we will file formal notification in the first quarter of 2008, with clearances anticipated in the second half.</p>
          <p>We expect that formal notifications will be filed with regulators in other jurisdictions in due course. We are prepared for a detailed and thorough regulatory review and following detailed analysis, we believe that any regulatory concerns can be addressed with that meaningfully impacting the benefits of the combination.</p>
          <p>Before concluding, let me turn again to BHP Billiton's track record since our merger in &#x2013; our own merger in 2001, one of delivering superior volume growth 8% for us versus 4% for Rio Tinto, and superior value 37% growth in value per annum versus 29% of value per annum in the case of Rio.</p>
          <p>Both BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto shareholders should consider this as an example of the potential benefits of corporate renewal as they consider the implications of our offer.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we privately approached BH &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; Rio Tinto on 1 November. We believe that in the pre-approach, the relative market capitalizations of the two companies implied fair value on the order of 2.4 as a share exchange ratio. That would have given Rio Tinto 36%.</p>
          <p>A letter delivered to the Rio Tinto Board sought discussions on all of the terms &#x2013; and I repeat &#x2013; sought discussions on all of the terms outlined in our proposal. Rio Tinto refused to engage. We announced the proposal on November 12, allowing both sets of shareholders and others to contemplate the proposal terms and its logic.</p>
          <p>Since that date, we've continued to seek discussions, and we've concurrently spoken to the majority of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton's major shareholders. And we've sought their input and observations.</p>
          <p>We've now tabled a pre-conditional offer of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share. This delivers Rio Tinto shareholders 44% of the combined entity and an implied premium of control of 45%, while still delivering value for the BHP Billiton shareholders.</p>
          <p>It is a unique opportunity to unlock value. BHP Billiton is putting this compelling, realistic and responsible offer to all of the Rio Tinto shareholders. On that note, I'd like to finish and take questions.</p>
          <p>We'll take questions from various locations in turn, starting here in Sydney. And if I could please ask that you address the questions to me in the first instance and I will pass them around to other colleagues that are present here today as required.</p>
          <p>Can I have the first question in Sydney, please?</p>

          <p>Glenn Wolcott with UBS. Good morning, Marius. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the comments in your offer document that relate to the potential for a scheme and your comment in there that says you would be prepared to alter the turns of the offer. I'm just wondering if you could expand a bit what you mean by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what it tries to say in sort of legalese is that it is possible to convert the 50.1 minimum acceptance condition &#x2013; pre-conditional bid that we've got on the table to a scheme. Now, obviously, any scheme would require the approval of the Rio Tinto shareholders and you should absolutely not read anything more into that other than the fact that we can alter this into a scheme should we get Rio Tinto board support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second half of your comment in the release says you would be prepared to alter &#x2013; you may alter the terms subject to approval from UK takeover panel and Australian Corporation or ASIC. Does that mean you are prepared to enter discussions to get an agreeable outcome that may or may not be different to the current proposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a firm bid. It's the only bid that has been made and it's a compelling bid. I think the language in that document is just around the change because the &#x2013; as you know, a scheme follows recommendation and it merely leaves open the possibility for the avoidance of doubt that you could not convert what is a 50% acceptance condition to a scheme where you need a 75% vote on the day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marius. It's Vicky Binns from Merrill Lynch. I wanted to ask again around the aspect of the bid. Obviously, dropping the acceptances from compulsory 90% to a scheme of 75%, now to 50%, could you clarify if any parties, either singular or together, were to get a blocking stake if they would actually need more than the 49.9? And also, can you clarify if a company wanted to block this, at what level if they bought the PLC stock would they need to be going to FRB in Australia to actually be getting approval for moving here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Vicky, I lost my train of thought there on the first one. Sorry. On the 50% minimum acceptance condition, I should just reiterate that this is our first bid. We've made one proposal which was based on a scheme because at the time we were seeking the recommendation of the Rio board. We've never put a bid on the table with a 90% acceptance condition. This is the first bid and it's the only bid that we've made. In terms of the specific conditions around FRB approval, Vicky, I'm not a legal expert but I think that if I recall correctly &#x2013; but please don't take this as gospel &#x2013; it is a 15% threshold. And I think that, last time I looked, the London register was about twice the size of the &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; about three quarters of the total register. So, I guess it depends a little bit on what you take in both registers that gets you up to that 15% threshold in the combined entity. But that, my legal people will probably tell me that that's an overly simplistic explanation. So, it's not complete.</p>

          <p>Hello, Marius. It's Brendan Harris here, at Macquarie. Forgive me for asking an operational question. But I'm just interested in the Bowen Basin, just looking for some clarity around performance up there following the floods. How long do you think you'll be disrupted for? What sort of impact in terms of volumes do you think you'll see from your net coal business, obviously, in this period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brendan, I think that operational questions are the most important ones that we can answer, because we focus on that above anything else. We have not released any data on potential losses of coal production there into the market. I can tell you that the impact has been large. We were very concerned about the safety of our employees. But I think Marcus here is probably the best person to give us better insight. Marcus if you want to add a few words to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just for people that didn't &#x2013; that aren't very familiar with us, it was actually reported in one of the newspapers that the volume that was in one of the mining pits, not ours, was 20% of the volume of the water in the Sydney Harbor. So, there was a lot of water that hit the Bowen Basin. And it did take out &#x2013; there were a number of companies that declared force majeure, including ourselves.</p>
          <p>Our volume impact, I would guess that we will lose something more than two weeks in terms what we're able to take out into the market, and it hit the market at a time that it was very tight. I can't really comment on what's happened in the other companies, but note that we were &#x2013; most of them actually, the major producers, did ultimately declare force majeure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is  Tomori Takasa, a Nikkei Japanese newspaper senior correspondent. I think what I am understanding is that the Japanese and European steel makers are formally opposed to the combination of you and Rio Tinto, as consumers and they ask the European or the other regulators not to approve the &#x2013; your combinations because it's typically anti-monopolistic or something.</p>
          <p>So, how do you pressure those consumers that it could be some merit for them also? And also, you always mentioned the Chinese growth about this &#x2013; the combination and have you ever get any implicit approval from Chinese authorities about the combination with Rio Tinto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the &#x2013; a couple of questions embedded in there. The best way that we can serve our customers is to produce more, the absolute best way. I think that we are very committed to growing the output from all of our volumes, for all of our products. We've shown that over the last seven years, we've grown at twice the rate as Rio Tinto &#x2013; as Rio Tinto has. You will have seen that we've just pre-approved &#x2013; what about a $1 billion or so, Marcus? &#x2013; of capital to continue to accelerate our iron ore production. The only way that our customers are going to get the products that they need is if we make more, and we have been the more aggressive company in terms of deploying capital.</p>
          <p>And what we are saying is if we put these two companies together, we will produce even more product. That is pro-competitive. And ultimately, because the Australian iron ore resource base is most close to the Asian markets that are growing most rapidly, the combination of this company growing more quickly ensures that the Asian customers will get product from the lowest cost supply region.</p>
          <p>All we want to do is grow production and take prices. We don't set prices. The marginal producers on all of our products set prices. As one can clearly see in the existing iron ore market where there is a shortfall and the marginal producers in China are the ones setting the high-end of the cost curve. We believe that this is a compelling argument and for the avoidance of that, I can state that our only desire is to continue to grow our output to serve our customers better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Grant Thomson, just asking your question a bit, clearly this process has to take some time and will be a considerable distraction for management, both for BHP Billiton and for Rio. So, what steps are you taking to both retain management, particularly at the operational levels that you talked about and to retain their focus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's why I commented on Brendan's comment that operational issues are the most important. We have outperformed, our cost control is better, our volume growth is better, and it's because we operate our businesses on the operational side, not in anticipation of what could or should happen from the operations perspective, they are asked every day to execute our baseline strategy safely 100% of the time at 100% of capacity.</p>
          <p>And I think that it's very exciting times for the BHP Billiton people to be part of a winning team. We have outperformed by every measure and I think it is on that basis that we make a very compelling proposition to employees and that they want to be part of this team. I think that will continue to be the case as we go forward. Marcus, any comments on this? This is your bread and butter every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's actually &#x2013; you asked two questions one, how do we motivate and how do we gain, how do we keep them focused? The motivation side isn't a problem I mean, this is exciting stuff. Our people are very interested in it, they want to be part of it and they like &#x2013; they like being part of an industry leading company like BHP Billiton.</p>
          <p>On the other side, it's actually a question of quarantining them. The issue for us is that we have a transaction team that is very focused on the transaction and that's what they do. We have an operating team that's very focused on the operating results and that's what they do. And in keeping us two activities separate is actually the best way to keep focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good. Thank you, Marcus.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the significant increase that your offer has made to the Rio share price when your offer was three for one &#x2013; how and why did you come up with the 3.4 number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in any offer, you have to take into account the value for your own shareholders first and foremost. We hope to accrue value to our existing shareholders through the combination. That means that we have to take into account all of the views that we've heard from the market, from the joint shareholders, and other sources and we have to place our offer at a level that we can succeed, that we feel confident of succeeding, so that we can deliver value to our shareholders. So, that's the decision-making process that has been followed here.</p>
          <p>Okay, let me step over to London, perhaps. I will come back to Sydney. I nearly said Melbourne again. Alex, I have actually lost you off the screen there, but I don't know if there are any questions from London.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, to you, Marius. Marius, firstly, with regard to Rio Tinto, there is a cross-holding of PLC into Limited. Have you heard advice if that can be used as a blocking mechanism, or do you think you'll get clear passage with regard to that? And then, secondly, what level of asset sales are envisaged? Rio Tinto obviously has an asset sale program going forward. Do you expect to increase that or maintain it? And then, finally, with regard to antitrust, if one individual jurisdiction were to give a negative ruling, would that unravel the deal or would you be able to proceed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the cross-holding, our offer is for 100% of these companies. Alberto, perhaps in London, I don't know, if you can give any additional insight, I mean, you're probably the person that has got the most knowledge around this topic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's obviously been considered, and I would give the same answer, it's not fully 100% which we are making the offer, it won't make any difference. And again, in Australia, it's the free float which is the crucial one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, that's &#x2013; and my apologies. I did lose track of your second and third part of your question just repeat them, to just remind me please quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Marius. Second question was regarding asset sales &#x2013; do you envisage increasing asset sales or maintaining that level? And then the third question was regarding regulatory jurisdictions, if one gave a negative ruling, would it unravel the whole deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first one, we have had a program of asset sales in the past. We've noted in prior communication that we note with interest the Rio Tinto asset sale program that has so far unsuccessfully been undertaken. And we noted that, the sale of things like packaging, and so on wouldn't impact our strategy. So, I take it &#x2013; you can take from that that our general approach around that is supportive.</p>
          <p>I think, as you put companies together, it's very important that you keep them as simple as possible. And last time I pointed out, how we have progressively sold assets from our portfolio in order to make them as large and as simple and as easy to manage as possible. I think you should take it as read &#x2013; that when we put these two portfolios together, we're going to take a combined look at what is core and non-core and on balance the company being larger, the threshold for what we would consider core and non-core probably on balance moves up. That's basically in line with what I've said before.</p>
          <p>Now, on the regulatory issues, there are some slight differences in the various regimes. I wouldn't like to go into exact detail of how that works. You can take a look at the documentation that has been posted as well to get more detail, but again, Alberto probably you are the person that has most across that fine detail of that, you might just want to make an additional comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just the pre conditional &#x2013; by definition &#x2013; it's conditions specifically it is very clear for the UK takeover panel here that is pre-conditional and you &#x2013; reaching an agreement with the EU regulatory body. So, that's &#x2013; let's say that would be the single most important pre-condition.</p>

          <p>On all of the other jurisdictions, just to make that precise, on the EU, it's reaching agreement on all of the others it's sort of &#x2013; I don't know what the exact word is &#x2013; material or so &#x2013; Alberto, would that be correct?</p>

          <p>Material but some of them like to do Japan is after the closure. So, they all vary but &#x2013; it would have to be a material and that's subject to more &#x2013; some more subjective definition but the very objective one is on the EU.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes straight from the line of  Susan Gaid from Lehman Capital Management in New Jersey. Please go ahead with your question... Ms.Gaid, your line is open if you would like to ask your question.</p>
          <p>Okay. So, we seemed to have lost that question. Our next question comes through from the line of [ Derrick Francis from UBS in Sydney. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Marius, I was just wondering with the offer in particular, of the UK shareholders with the 80/20, and of the mix and match approach whether you might consider offering what I'd call, full script flexibility or enhanced script flexibility, where you offered them if they wanted. Could you get a 100% limited share, so you'd have a 100% available. Obviously, it would be subject to them taking a minimum of 20%, so you could maintain majority listing of the Indian and Australia but offer them sort of a full script flexibility where if they wanted 100%, everyone could take that if they wanted.</p>
          <p>And that might &#x2013; but they'd actually be trading sort of about a 14% higher in Australia than London, it's sort of effective way bumping the offer that the London shareholders without actually having to increase the script price here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that the bid is what it is. It is what it is after considering all of those elements. And we believe at the end of the day, it's one that is so attractive that it is highly capable of being accepted. So, it's no longer a proposal and open for discussion, and so on. It's now just a bid, which is firm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just wondering is there sort of any barrier to you offering more limited shares, let's say, 60/40 or 50/50, if necessary, to sort of get a Rio board approval? Will that offer extra flexibility and is there any particular barrier to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that this is an offer that is compelling to all of the shareholders. We think the terms have been very, very carefully considered. All aspects have been taken into account, and this is the one that has been tabled. So, thank you. Can I have the next question on the phones, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes to you from the line of  Serge Day from JPMorgan in Sydney. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've just got a couple of questions. The first one is, in the offer document, it states that BHP shareholders would need to approve the transaction. What is the voting threshold for that approval process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been a little long since I examined UK Class 1 transaction thresholds. But Alberto, I'm going to refer to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a majority of the combined, of the PLC and Limited, and it's a majority of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. My apologies. I misinterpreted the question. Obviously, you need a majority of the shareholders to vote for the transaction. I thought you meant the transaction size limit when voting under UK laws. Obviously, we need to take both legs &#x2013; both legs of our company need to vote on a majority basis. So, there is a interconditionality there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And my second question is, you state in the offer documents that the bidder's statement won't be coming out until the pre-conditions have been satisfied, can you give us a rough idea on how long it will take to satisfy those pre-conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't think we've got any updated guidance today on the timeframe of nine to 12 months. It's very difficult to give you an exact date on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, does that mean that it would take nine to 12 months for the pre-conditions to be satisfied and therefore, it will be another nine to 12 months before and official bidder's statement gets released to the market. Is that what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be a little bit more precise &#x2013; to go into the exact timing of the UK timetable that basically drives this transaction is a little complex here. But in the UK you effectively have an 80-day timetable, 81 day timetable. And the bidding statements would be posted somewhere at the start of that &#x2013; at the start of that 80 day timetable. So, take that off the total time that we've indicated here and you've got more or less &#x2013; although a very imprecise indication of when bidders documents will be posted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Ross Collingwood, just a question about Chinalco and Alcoa. Would BHP Billiton be prepared to negotiate with Chinalco and Alcoa with assets of the combined group in order to win the support of their 12% shareholder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I wouldn't like to speculate on something, which we've not considered. Obviously, we must abide by all of the regulations and laws surrounding how bids are made.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So far the Rio Tinto board hasn't met with you over this offer, when do you expect to meet with them, if at all, following your offer today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was heartened by the announcement that they put out that they were considering the offer, and &#x2013; but it would be very difficult for me to speculate whether that actually leads to any interaction.</p>
          <p>Vicky, I think you had another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius. I would like to ask a marketing question. Obviously, some of your customers are concerned, particularly about the strengths of iron ore marketing, so could you please update us on the intentions to move to an independently managed iron ore index basis? And could you please also talk to us about the great longer term deal you've just done with Baosteel last week, which I understand is not a benchmark linked deal, and then compare that to industry speculation of Rio Tinto's deal, that they've just done with Hyundai last week which I believe is a benchmark linked deal. Which is going to offer most of the upside to shareholders in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vicky, I think we have got to think about customers' interest first and our view has long been that if you allow the market to set prices, you get the production to follow in the right regimes. That has been the basis of all of our market interaction.</p>
          <p>In the iron ore market, there have been some substantial changes in the benchmark pricing system. It's difficult to estimate, but my personal estimate would be that there are now more tons traded on a non-benchmark basis than on a benchmark basis. Most of these tons come from India, and then obviously the domestic Chinese iron ore production, and it is the high cost of production of these marginal tons that is setting the iron ore price in the market. My job, ironically enough, us to compete this high cost producers off the cost curve by low cost expansions, and that's the value to the customer.</p>
          <p>But in the meantime, our believe is that in a considered manner, the market clearing price is the correct price for any product, and its on &#x2013; and on that basis that it's not us driving the market, the market change ironically has been driven by domestic Chinese producers and Indian producers that have driven this market. Now, I think the wording that we put out in our press release clearly states that Baosteel and ourselves see that these changes are happening. And that in a very pragmatic basis we decided to annually discover that price for ourselves. And that's basically what the statement says. I am really not privy to the contract details of the competitor, so any speculation about the Hyundai contract would be speculation on my part. I can, however, say that I think that in good faith given the strength of the relationship between Baosteel and ourselves we will discover a market price every year. Sometimes it might be good. Sometimes we &#x2013; it might be not such a good price, but it will reflect the supply demand fundamentals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a second, could you comment on recent industry, advise on Mount Gibson for example, who supposedly has organized to contract that is benchmark linked, then a 50/50 sharing of the difference between the benchmark settlement and the stock price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's difficult once again for me to comment on contract terms that I have no insight into. Vicky, I think the thing that you should take away is that the market has changed and customers actually realized that market price is delivered and supply in the long-run. Okay. We're, sort of, almost reaching the end of our timing, but Glen, if you want to go ahead, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks. If you'd only get 50.1% &#x2013; you talk about the synergies being 1.7 billion plus another 2 or 3, whatever it is, in years to come, and it's accretive. Is that based on full acquisition, so what happens if you don't get, if you don't, so it could be &#x2013; does it still accrete if you don't get full acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't put any analysis out on a non-fully acquired basis. Our objective here is to acquire the whole company and we believe that the bid is absolutely capable of delivering that to us. Okay. I think one last question from the telephones please, and then I'm going wrap that up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>

          <p>Marius, good morning. I thought you've forgotten me. Marius, is the bid last and final?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a bid that has been very carefully considered taking into account all information up to the last possible moment before the put up or shut up, was expired. It's a &#x2013; uplift from 36 to 44% for the economic ownership of Rio Tinto and it gives them a 45% premium on an undisturbed basis. We think that this bid is compelling, while at the same time, also being rational from a BHP Billiton perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And at that note, I'd love to talk more to you, Peter, but we have to close here. Unfortunately, got other commitments, I want to thank in particular, the people that have stayed up to participate. Obviously, for all of you here in Sydney, that have come here this morning. It's been a pleasure talking to you and count on your continued support. Thank you very much.</p>
