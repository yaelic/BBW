      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon for our annual results presentation. Ren&#xE9; and I will take you through the highlights of our results as ever. And we will have some commercials to make the presentation lighter.</p>
          <p>In 2011, I think we geared our efforts much more to the top line and we devoted a lot of attention and also more resources for innovation, brand building and that has resulted in good results, what concerns the top line, because we could grow our revenue by 3.6%</p>
          <p>On the back of consolidated beer volumes went up 3.2%. And that explains why we could increase our revenue per hectoliter on beer by 1.5%, which we think it's a good result. And the higher marketing expenditures that we did last year, but we started already in 2010, started to give results in terms of market share increase in more and more markets.</p>
          <p>Again, the Heineken brand accelerated its growth. It was one of the best years we had since 2007 for growth of the Heineken brand. And we think this is by and large to, thank to a more consistent approach to global management of the brand across the world.</p>
          <p>Our operational programs delivered according to our expectation and even a little bit above our expectation. We completed the TCM program, which delivered &#x20AC;614 million cumulative savings over the three year program. That was combined with the second turn for cash program that delivered &#x20AC;5.8 billion free operating cash flow. Over the last three years, it has been very instrumental every time and again also to get our balance sheet right again and having the leverage under the 2.5 times EBITDA as we wish to have it going forward.</p>
          <p>Also last year we have expanded our footprint in emerging markets. We did acquisitions of five breweries in the beginning of the year in Nigeria to extend our capacity over there. We entered Ethiopia, a very large country in Africa for the first time. That's new territory for us. And we finished the year with the completion of a small acquisition in Haiti, 10 million inhabitants, but a lot of also potential for growth for beer.</p>
          <p>We have also dedicated a lot of attention during the year to leverage our global scale. We did that through investments in commercial capability building, I will give you more details about that during my presentation. We have established a global business service organization and it's up and running. You will have also more details about it. And we have launched, at last but not least, a new TCM program called very originally TCM2. And with the aim over the next three years to deliver &#x20AC;500 million of cost savings and I will also provide you for more detail about that.</p>
          <p>Taking you through our results in a more detailed way, if you take the right column from the group beer volume up 3.6%, Heineken brand up 5.4%, yet again outperforming our portfolio. The revenue up, as I told you, 3.6% resulting in an EBIT (beia) up of 1.4%.</p>
          <p>One has to realize that this has been, for us, a year of investment in infrastructure. We built a lot of commercial capabilities in the center and we also built the first important legs of the global business services, which were costs that we made upfront to the benefits and they went all in our operating results. And so these three factors, higher expenditures and capability building explains why the EBIT (beia) is perhaps a little bit more modest in relationship with the revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The net profit (beia) was at healthy 9.2%. The difference is of course explainable by a much lower indebtment. We maintained our EBITDA ratio at 2.2 all over the year. So we have kind of captured the lower debt level that we reached at the end of 2010, but then over the whole year and with better financing conditions as well a slightly better taxation condition, but Ren&#xE9; will explain you that in more detailed way.</p>
          <p>The net profit (beia) came higher than the guidance that we have been giving in August. And I will give here as the main explanation that we enjoyed a strong fourth quarter of the year and that has kind of lifted the results a bit towards the end of the year. And we are very happy with that.</p>
          <p>When we then go into a regional approach, as you can see from this chart, Africa, the Middle East and Asia are the high growth regions with high growth in terms of group beer volume, the Heineken brand, the revenue and the operating results, all the like. Africa and the Middle East still a very strong performance despite the shortfall of Egypt, which is of course due to the Arab Spring there which has dented our Egyptian business quite a bit. Nevertheless, these two regions are posting, again, a sterling performance.</p>
          <p>The second region is Europe, our two Europes. Western Europe has had perhaps for the first time a positive development in its volume, which is good news. It's a region where we had in a lot of markets market share gains over the year, which is also positive news. The Heineken brand grew a healthy 3.5%. The revenue grew slightly despite a difficult, quite a depressing environment as you all know and we could grow the results by 2.6%, so all in all a very good performance of Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Central and Eastern Europe had very good development of its volumes. This is largely due to Russia, which rebounded quite a bit after a disastrous year 2010. You will remember we kind of regained our shares. Our sales were up 24% in Russia on the backdrop of a market which was down something like 2%. So an excellent performance. It came at a price of our margins, but since the last quarter of last year we kind of rebuilt into profits in the Russian operation.</p>
          <p>The Heineken volume is a bit down, but that's entirely due to Greece. Greece has had the very lackluster performance. One has to realize volume is down 12.5% in Greece year-on-year. This is a market which faces high difficulties. Despite that, it remains a profitable operation, but it had to give in over the last two years quite a bit and that explains by and large the decline of the Heineken brand, it's 20% of the market in Greece. It's a very strong position that we have with the brand in Greece. And finally also it dented the EBIT. It's essentially due to the counter performance of the Greece and Russia for the reasons I explained.</p>
          <p>And I finish with the Americas where you have kind of a mixed bag of operations, because you have in the United States, and you have in Cerveza, you have big joint ventures with CCU and then Central America and the Caribbean which is a nice string of pearls where we have yet again made good results this year.</p>
          <p>The U.S., on the backdrop of a market which was in decline, we were even more in decline over the whole year. We see at the end of the year some green shoots for the Heineken brands. It's early days. We have invested a lot in our Heineken brand in the U.S over the past year and we will continue to do so. The global brands, the global campaign for the brand was also introduced there and we see it's gaining some traction and momentum. But in the U.S we will never surrender. So we will continue to make progress over there. We had again strong performance of the Dos Equis brand in the U.S. growing again 15% over last year.</p>
          <p>Now, I think it's good that I take you through our FEMSA acquisition because since it is a recent acquisition, I would rather give it some attention. So I take out of the Americas, the FEMSA Cerveza. So this is the whole operation that we bought from FEMSA. It is the Mexican national operation, the export operation, it's Brazil and also the packaging division that we have been taking over as a whole acquisition.</p>
          <p>Just to show you the results on a pro forma basis from all these business units combined, what they delivered over a period of two years 2010, 2011 under our management, we grew revenue by 10%, and that's on a compounded annual growth rate base and the EBIT (beia) by 23%. So we are doing the job of restoring profitability and boosting profitability of that operation and that is going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>The integration was successful. We have to change management, you will remember in the middle of the year that was successfully completed. We are up and running again. We said we would deliver &#x20AC;150 million of cost synergies over a period of three years, now the ticker is standing now at under &#x20AC;36 million at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>If I focus into Brazil, we have been and that's not new to you, we have been concentrating essentially on the growth of the Heineken brand in the premium segment. We have more of a segment leadership approach than a broad leadership approach. We know what the quality of the footprint is there and our distribution possibility, so we really focus on the Heineken brand, which boosts the higher margins and we have had really strong results. We can't even follow the demand. We have to import Heineken and we grew the brands arguably from a low base that we grew the brand at a healthy 87%. This year it's not even about the last 3%, but we are on our way to reach soon our first million of hectoliter in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we have been favoring a policy of going for value. And the first step we have been working on our cost synergies, that's the first thing that you do when you arrive and you have taken over a company. We have been restructuring quite a bit the distribution. But also our focus, our regional focus, you will remember that we focus on our strongholds in the north and in the south. This year, we have been investing much more against our brands. We have been taking year-after-year pricing in Mexico, quite healthy pricing. We delve back as little as possible and delve back more into the brand building.</p>
          <p>And what we did, we have been executing brand relaunches for Tecate, in particular Tecate Light, which is growing double digit in Mexico, which is one of our star performers. We have also been totally relaunching Carta Blanca as a regional brand in the northwest. It's the icon brand of Monterrey. We have been investing in brand new packaging. It's returnable packaging in Mexico for last part. So those are quite sizeable investments.  And the new advertising campaign and a new &#xE9;lan, a new spirit behind the brand over there. We have been doing the same with the Dos Equis brand, which is growing 12% year-on-year in Mexico also. And Heineken has been launched into the key cities in Mexico. Heineken has been launched somewhere in April in Mexico. It's an early start, but it's a promise for future growth.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, we have been and I will talk to you that through later. We have been investing quite a bit of money in positioning Sol as a real international brand going forward and we have plans to take that forward in more markets than we do currently. This is a bit to give you an account of what we are doing in Mexico and Brazil so far.</p>
          <p>Let me now switch gear and talk to you about our strategic business priorities. Every three years we kind of reset the goals for our organization. And you will understand that I will not share the goals with you, but we kind of gather the whole top management yearly. And every three years we reset and we say, well, this is where we want to go, this is our ambition. That is what we have to realize.</p>
          <p>Underlying are some strategic business actions, which if we execute correctly on them will bring us to these goals. And what I'd like to share with you is those five goals which are displayed here and take them one by one and give you a little bit an insight in where we devote our attention and gear our priorities to.</p>
          <p>The first one will come as no surprise for you. It is to grow the Heineken brand and grow the Heineken brand disproportionally. The business case is quite clear. The beer market is increasing by 3%, the international premium segment by 4%, and then the Heineken brand by 5%, you see the scale.</p>
          <p>For us, the Heineken brand is perhaps, it's the largest single brand in our portfolio and it's also the largest single profit contributor in the portfolio if that were independent business unit, by far the biggest business unit we have in the group. So, hence, going forward, that brand which makes us particular will continue to command the lion share of a pension and investment.</p>
          <p>The results over the last six years are depicted below and you see that we grew our share and that's measured by Plato. We have grown our share slowly but surely above the 20% in the number of years. It's standing now at 20.5%. Definitely the results will be, I think, projected somewhere in June, but we grow our share year by year in that segment. To remind you, we are the number one in that segment. And we are about twice the size as our immediate followers. Obviously, this segment attracts a lot of competition, because of the higher margins. But still, we have and we try to continue to increase our share in that lucrative part of the market.</p>
          <p>The right part of this chart you see the interest of the business case going forward, and where the growth is deemed to come from. And you see that in all geographies you still have growth for that international premium segment, so still in Europe, in the Americas, but of course a lion share in Asia Pacific and Africa and the Middle East. And that is why it is so important for us that Heineken will remain priority number one.</p>
          <p>Now, how we do that, it is explained at a lot of times, but what we changed in the past 18 month was manage the Heineken brand as a world brand with a lot of flexibility and adaptation on the local level. We have been gearing that totally towards a global brand and also global activation program starting with the advertising. So, I can say proudly that even in the Netherlands, we have the global advertising now, which is, I'll tell you, quite an achievement to have it there.</p>
          <p>So, all countries in the world run the global advertising campaigns. Most of you are familiar with that. These campaigns, we use a lot the worldwide available media, digital media as a leverage to introduce our campaign. They always appear first on YouTube or on Facebook before you will see them on TV. They are much more interactive than they ever used to be. We really changed totally our way of approaching communication around the brand.</p>
          <p>Today, the Heineken Facebook page is the largest in the world for a beer brand, followed only by Dos Equis, another of our brands. So we invest a lot of attention, money, but also people to go after that. And it's ultimately the content that you give to it which makes it interesting or not. It's nothing you can cheat with nor you can lie with, because you have an instant reaction and we think it's a very good way to progress.</p>
          <p>That we do alongside more traditional activation platforms as our sponsorship. The Champions League is an old one, the Rugby World Cup is another one. We do a lot with local music festivals. We do it in Poland, in Rio and in the U.K., in Italy. We do it in a number of countries. And we will also sponsor in this country, the London Olympics where we are dying to come in the summer. So, if we can paint London in green like we did for the Champions League last year, I think it will be for us again a kind of good leverage to grow the brand further in this country.</p>
          <p>We are busy for the, I think six consecutive times sponsoring the James Bond, so the next James Bond movie will be again be sponsored in one way and or the other and in a surprising way because we have every time to do better.</p>
          <p>We are looking forward. I am myself a big fan of Bond. It is my personal hobby, if you allow me. Some pour money in golf sponsorings, I do that in Bond films. I tell you, it pays off. And I'd like to close this old clock of global activation programs where all our OpCos have always latitude to add local topspin, we call it, they can take the global theme and add a tweak to it. And that kind of way works very well for us.</p>
          <p>I'd like to share with you what we just edited for based on the latest movie or commercial debate, the serenade where through Facebook you can address to somebody you would like to date, literally a little serenade. And it was done for the occasion of Valentine and I think yesterday Valentine, I think more than 500,000 people already used the thing. So I'm asking our technical people behind to launch the film.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement] (20:26) (21:28)</p>
          <p>So for those who are on Facebook have a look, you have 650 ways of declaring you and in 20 languages. So there is a lot of work went into it. I've seen how they did it. It is quite amazing. This is really great stuff because behind that there is lot of acting and then you can click and paste whatever you want to make out of it. It's quite amazing even I find that's quite entertaining, even if I have only one person to date.</p>
          <p>The second leg of our priorities is being a consumer inspired customer oriented and brand-led company. Now this seems the obvious because there are two parts to our business. On the one hand, brands are do not carry a lot of functional benefits in our industry. It's a lot about emotions. And our capacity to mobilize the emotion is what will create the pull. On the other side, when you talk to a customer, he is a fairly unemotional guy, okay. He wants to see a thing that sells growth and good margins.</p>
          <p>And so when you speak about winning in the marketplace, you have to do both well and you have to win on both places, with the customer and with the consumer. But it all starts with having strong brands. And therefore the top priority of our company that people understand that it all starts there with the consumers, with a strong brand and with our customers.</p>
          <p>Now, I just take you through a few elements of our program, which is richer than what I show you here, but a few things which are new. The first one is the expansion of other priority global brands. I've shown you HEINEKEN, next to HEINEKEN traditionally we always have Amstel, which is depicted here, which has been used in a more tactical and strategic way around the world as a second premium lager beer from Dutch origin. And we will continue exploiting the potential of that brand going forward, but we have added three other brands to our global portfolio and our ambition to make these brands global.</p>
          <p>First one is Desperados, which is a tequila-flavored beer, which was invented not in Mexico, but in France at the Fischer Brewery in Alsace, which is quite a counterintuitive place to invent such a product. It has been a huge success in France and then Germany and then Poland. And last year we rolled it out in another ten countries in Europe and it posted a healthy 26% increase.</p>
          <p>This is a premium proposition, it's even a super-premium proposition because its command even a higher premium than HEINEKEN brand. So it's also what you call in your jargon immediately accretive and value enhancing. So this is something that we believe can be taken further in other countries. And we have been doing that successfully last year, we will continue to do that in the future.</p>
          <p>The second one is Strongbow Gold. We have taken Strongbow Gold to Italy, to South Africa, to the Netherlands. It's still early days, we believe that the cider category has mileage to go. It's a longer-term project than let's say Desperados. I have told you many times through cider, but there are many markets where we think we can develop cider. And we have chosen Strongbow as our global brand to do that and step by step, market after market with a view on the long term in the long alcoholic drinks market.</p>
          <p>And the last one is the Sol brand, which we bought from Mexico. Sol is already sold in 120 countries. We have been doing a lot of work in the second half of last year to give it a kind of a own face and a global campaign behind it where people can rally and identify themselves to sustain these export operations. We go in 120 markets today and where we will lift the most interesting possibilities in order to take it to the next level. Just want to share the commercial of Sol, which was issued or released at the end of last year with you.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement] (25:51) (26:54)</p>
          <p>So this one is not about sun and sea, this one will be about authenticity and free mind. That is a bit how we want to take it. This is a fresh campaign you can expect more of these in the year to come.</p>
          <p>Another important and when we speak about consumer inspired customer, it's winning with the local brands. We have 235 local brands in our portfolio across the world. And as much as we dedicate attention to the global brands in markets and that totally also delegated to the local market, we are also there to build blockbuster brand to win in the marketplace, tangentially with price indexes which are north of the index 100, because there is how you can make a little bit more profits. Those are four examples. I spoke already about Dos Equis in the U.S. but also in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In France, we have a brand like Pelforth, which is growing 8% year-on-year, which is quite nice on the back also of a lot of innovation like the draft keg or line extension on the brand. Gulder in Nigeria grew a healthy 11%. Gulder is a premium beer. It's even positioned above Star in Nigeria or Moretti in Italy, which grew another close to 4%. Those are just examples of how we want to continue to devote attention. And of course in the 235 brands we prioritize them. And it's not all of them that require the same level of attention. But for each and every market we identified those ones which are important for value growth and market share growth in the future and there is where we put our money.</p>
          <p>The last highlight on the consumer inspired, custom oriented and brand led is creating value for our customers. On the right side, we have been leveraging our European footprint with the key retailers. So that in the previous meeting, we have been creating at the end of 2010 a platform of key account managers who work with the key retailers like Tesco or Carrefour or Metro or Lidl in the Pan-European way. Who else can do it than HEINEKEN since the HEINEKEN brand is present in all countries of the European Union and that we are there to invest in more global proposals like Desperados or Strongbow Gold. So this is a natural domain for us. And I have to say that for the first year that we have been operating that we grew our business disproportionately with practically all our clients that we built relationship within. And so a lot of the market share growth that we could have in European countries came out of that renewed approach with our key retailers.</p>
          <p>On the left page I speak about innovation. Innovation is exciting for consumers, but it's also exciting for our customers, so we can set a crossroads of both. We have declared our ambition to grow our innovation rate into 6%. We came from 3% last year in 2010.</p>
          <p>We ended up, we posted a result of 4.1% last year, which is really a very good results. Innovations are like line extensions, Foster's Gold, which was launched here in the U.K. or a 4-liter PET keg, which was launched in the Netherlands or the new flavors for cider Bulmers 17, alcohol-free beer, which a lot of beers local blockbuster brands declining in alcohol-free version. And also a new product called Radler, it's not so new because it was quite popular in Austria. It is a lemon flavored beer, but much lighter in alcohol, opens up also a new consumption occasion. It's very much a seasonal product, but ever since we launched it in 2010, we sold 100,000 hectoliters. In 2011, we sold 500,000 hectoliters, we have it in six countries. We will add some countries in going future and commands of course a superior margin. Those are kind of local innovations, but when you put them together, they represent share and value. And just to share you a pretty functional this time advertising from Croatia how that is advertised but that little advertising makes for a big success.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement] (31:34) (32:04)</p>
          <p>When you go on holidays in Croatia, you know what to order. It was all in Croatian.</p>
          <p>The next priority is to capture growth in emerging markets. Obviously we have been, and I told you the story many times, we have been re-directing our footprint much more to emerging markets than before. In the last five years, we came up from 44% of our group volume to 65%. Two-thirds of our volumes now come from these so called emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Once more emerging markets is there where you have population growth, economic growth, political stability and the beer category has still potential to grow. And the part of the EBIT coming of the emerging market is now 50%. So we really shifted the needle. And going forward, obviously, it is just I would say mechanical that part of that only grow over time. We have two areas where we'd like to concentrate on, two areas of excellence.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, first of all, Africa. Africa is the highest population growth with 2.2%, which is, it's quite stunning. And if you look at the age pyramid a lot of consumers yet to come in most of the countries of Africa, it is with rising incomes. People don't realize but the GDP of Africa as a whole is rising with a healthy 5% per year, so it's one of the highest rises in terms of GDP in the world, admittedly from a lower base.</p>
          <p>And then another one is, okay, there is growing political stability in Africa. It might not be evident, but I have worked in Africa 15 years ago, I can tell you we made progress. We still have a lot of progress to make. But it is getting better and I made the point a lot of times that two things could change Africa outside of the generational change of the leaders themselves. It's technology and access to the world if you will through Internet and mobile telephones. And the whole Diaspora which migrated in the 80s out of Africa and settled down in Europe and in the U.S. and who created kind of bridge head between these continents and it boosts something which is positive.</p>
          <p>The urban development is spectacular in Africa, the urbanization rate is stunning. And you have already 52 countries, which boast over 1 million inhabitants and so there is a lot of growth to come there.</p>
          <p>Our position is depicted here on the map and one has to realize that we are the number one in the most populous country, Nigeria, 160 million inhabitants. We just entered Ethiopia, which is the second largest country in terms inhabitants, much smaller beer market, it's much more on the beginning of the curve, 81 million inhabitants. Third market is Egypt, 77 million inhabitants, the potential is limited for religious region, obviously, so you could also consider that as a smaller country for our industry.</p>
          <p>The DRC is then the fourth country, where we commanded share of 65% and South Africa would be then the fifth country, where we are commanding the lion share of the premium market over there, not to name a flurry of other countries where we operate, just to say our position is good and the track record is good.</p>
          <p>The chart below indicates in 2006, we were doing &#x20AC;223 million EBIT and &#x20AC;570 million in 2011, a compounded growth rate of 23%, which is quite spectacular and I am always saying that Africa and the Middle East have been the highest single engine of growth of the HEINEKEN Group. We have an expertise how to operate there. And we also intend to continue to use that as a spearhead for future development. First of so you can also expect that the lion share of our investments, we have announced that we would invest intentionally more into CapEx. The lion share is going obviously to Africa.</p>
          <p>Next to Africa, we have Asia. And Asia is slightly different because it's much more skewed for us towards the premium markets, where in Africa we operate the premium market is something reactively new and still in its infancy.</p>
          <p>In Asia, the premium market or the market for international beers if you will, was in 2010 at 20 million hectoliters. Now out of that HEINEKEN commands 25% of that market. So we have a disproportionally higher market share than our average market share which stands at 20 points, it was 20% in 2010. So it's just north of that at 25% in that continent. It's also there that you will see the highest growth rate going forward in the coming next 10 years.</p>
          <p>And that is why Asia will also attract a big attention for us and was a particular attention also to the HEINEKEN brand in that continent as you can see. We operate through license in the exports positioned as well as Asia-Pacific and United Breweries. Noteworthy that we launched locally produced HEINEKEN in India in December of this year.</p>
          <p>And again we are wheeling the beginning of the curve, but I said many times that is going to be a long way. But with 1.5 liter per capita, India can only grow for beer but also for premium beers.</p>
          <p>The fourth pillar then is to leverage the scale. Since we operate as a global company we have many operations, we have big ones and small ones. What is important is that we bundle and we are the group is more than the sum of the parts and so leverage in the scale for a group like ours, which operates through four different business model virtually all over the world. It's very important that we do that in a very organized and precise way.</p>
          <p>It is not all about IT systems. Those are things like running a global brand and I explained to you everything about the global brand and leveraging that global social media doing that but you can also think in the commercial bundling that the media buying in the more global way as we do today that is something which is higher margin that to do in the coming months.</p>
          <p>The supply organization has been traditionally an organization which has been pretty bundled together. They work alongside a fairly centralized model in terms of quality control, productivity norms, training methods, everything. I think, if I look back over the last 15 to 20 years it's there where we also have had the largest cost savings in our organization. We are a huge industrial operation, half of our revenue is still supply chain driven activity. So excelling in that is key to our profitability and we leverage absolutely our global scale there since a long time.</p>
          <p>Other examples could be how we optimize our tax situation, we do that. That's also done on a global scale as well as treasury, cash pooling is done on the central way too. Those are just example that leveraging global scale, those can be fairly different things. But you have to be very clear in organization what is done globally and what is done locally. Whenever people understand that's that and that's my turf and how it works together, then it works indeed for you.</p>
          <p>What is new going forward is the right part of the chart, it is the introduction of the global business services. Ren&#xE9; will give more details and more flavor to it, but basically it's about setting up a Global Shared Service Center in Krak&#xF3;w, Poland and Global Procurement Company in the Netherlands, but I leave to Ren&#xE9; to give more flavor in detail. It will be at the hearts, the creation of that will be at the heart how we will leverage the lion share of our &#x20AC;500 million cost savings in the next three years.</p>
          <p>And the investments that we make to do will be of course one-off investments. They will be taken not as exceptional, but directly into costs. And the savings of the &#x20AC;500 million or they have to stay obviously, they have to be, like in the previous programs, absolutely structural. That is how we built this program. But once more Ren&#xE9; will drill more into details.</p>
          <p>And I end with the fifth one, it's not the least important one, it's our people. Since we operate in so many countries we sell HEINEKEN in 179 countries, it's everywhere. So we travel the world around, but we have 71 operating companies, 70,000 employees. And in that this is driven by 635 senior leaders. These people come from 46 different nationalities. When I started 25 years ago in the company, the non-Dutch were a fraction of the Dutch. Of course, we were not 635, we were a much smaller group. But in percentage wise, we were very small.</p>
          <p>Today, the Dutch are still the most important group with a third of that population, but we have, as we acquired and went through the world by acquisitions and greenfields, we took on international talent and that is what you need for a group like ours. If you are a rainbow company, you better have people coming from all the colors of the rainbow and a strong company culture. Those are the two ingredients. And I think that is one of the strong point of HEINEKEN, it's to build something which is really multicultural, multinational but having one HEINEKEN culture.</p>
          <p>To do that, we first cultivate diversity. That's the first thing. And one has to note that over the past years, big acquisitions a lot of time bring in a net inflow of management capabilities. Scottish &amp; Newcastle brought in a net capabilities so i.e. HEINEKEN has to sent less people out through the U.K. let's say than the U.K. send it to the world of HEINEKEN. And the same thing again happened with FEMSA. So those are acquisitions would kind of enrich the group at large in a very positive way. And we know how to nurture that.</p>
          <p>We invest a lot in capability. This is the training of your people after you have selected them, of course, you have to retain them, and to be a good employer, offering career opportunities all that stuff we do. But the training is also important. And so, to foster a one HEINEKEN and a one approach it is to have a very strong training system built around the Global Commerce University, the Finance Academy, which Ren&#xE9; has set up a few years ago for the finance discipline. The supply chain has its own knowledge transfer systems. They are less poetic about their names but very effective in what they do. And in addition to that, we invest a lot into leadership programs which are tailor made for HEINEKEN. And where we gather our people together because when you operate in some many countries you have to regularly bond the people together around business teams that informal part that you have next in the conferences are also extremely important to build a company culture.</p>
          <p>The culture is based on a personal accountability, leadership and interdependence. One has to realize this is a company which sell brands and the brand is more important than the people. But the people are the service of the brands and the customers. So this is not a company about prima donnas and egos and what have you, soloists. It's about team work and people dedicated behind these brands. And that is what is important in the cultures of people have to be responsible, take accountability of hiding themselves behind trees. When you make mistake please admit, apologize and repair. This is a very simple thing. If you got these ingredients of the strong culture together, you have a group running for you.</p>
          <p>Now that is closing my five priorities for action. I realize I'm a bit long this year, but I thought it was because every three years also was my own people we make the kind of a reset of a what are the priorities in this business I thought it was worthwhile doing that with you too, that you understand what are we doing behind the numbers.</p>
          <p>Brewing a better future is about sustainability. Sustainability is not a hobby, it's not lip service, it's the way we do business with HEINEKEN. Sustainability is a very simple definition: if you do it on an unsustainable way you're going to be dead tomorrow, it's just not sustainable.</p>
          <p>So the whole concept of sustainability has to be deeply embedded in how we operate our business across the world. We have launched a new 10-year program last year, in April 2010, we have set out objectives, our sustainability report will be published in April, measured against the objectives that we set. The highlights for this year is that we again consistently delivered on our energy and water targets and that we increased our local raw material sourcing in Africa to 48%. We have the ambition to go to 60% and itself is the object of a conference what we do for that. But we really do believe that is the right thing to do also because it creates the necessary economic activity to continue to develop the country where you operate.</p>
          <p>One particular I would like to highlight to close this section is our new approach to communication around the issue of alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is very high on the regulators' agenda, will be the theme of the speech of Prime Minister Cameron at 4.00 PM today. It's high on the World Health Organization agenda and it's high on our agenda too. We do not want to be part of the problem, we want to participate to the solution. We have no any advantage for our business out of alcohol abuse. And everywhere where we can contribute to the solution, we will invest and we will collaborate with the regulators, with the World Health Organization, in partnership with all kind of civil society initiatives that work on the topic.</p>
          <p>It's very important for us. It's a long-haul route. It's different and it takes different dimensions because it's a lot of times about to rebound. There again, it's the object of a conference in itself. What I wanted to share with you is a movie that we released for HEINEKEN, which makes the ultimate point that it is cool not to drink too much. Ultimately it's the guy who doesn't drink who gets the girl.</p>
          <p>The thing is if you want to get out of the educational thing that you can do in a university that you can do on a website, it's for a brand to communicate the point that it is absolutely not done, it's not cool to abuse the brand. This is when we get into that phase to communicate that was the brand then we would get there. It's a journey, this is a first tentative of getting there and I just wanted to share that with you now.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement] (48:09) (49:11)</p>
          <p>That's what we tried to do. Wrapping up, I'd like to wrap up what the things that we did over the past years are also a proxy to what we will continue to do in 2012. That is what is on the sheet is that our revenue grew ahead of our volume, that the top line was positive in all regions, that HEINEKEN continued to outperform, that we posted still strong earnings in an investment year. Remind you we were investing into capabilities that will yield cost advantages just after. That new TCM program will deliver the &#x20AC;500 million, I will not dwell and repeat myself. And that we will continue to gear perhaps more capital investments than the year before in 2012 to the high growth markets.</p>
          <p>With that wrap up, I thank you for your attention and I'd like now to hand over to Ren&#xE9;. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean. It's extremely hot here, I get the feeling. Is it only here on stage? Warm, hot, beer weather; that's for after the presentation. Yeah, okay, that's it. And what I will do I take you through the figures and I take you through the main programs TCM 1, now TCM 2 and the hunt for cash.</p>
          <p>First and small reminder, we restated the 2010 numbers and as well as group as regional level and we published in the half year exactly what we did but you have to bear that in mind. Now looking at the figures, but you can see as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois told it already, we achieved very healthy gross and as well in volume as in revenues, and that reflects the success of the marketing investments and the revenue initiatives we deployed in 2011, but started already in 2010.</p>
          <p>We had a 3.6% organic revenue increase and that was driven by as well volume as higher revenue per hectoliter. The total consolidated volume, so that includes wholesale that includes other categories as beer, grew 2.1% and the growth of the consolidated beer volume was 3.2%, because that was partly offset by lower third party volumes in our wholesale operation.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue grew faster than organic EBIT, which was 1.4% and that reflects the effect of higher input cost and the plant investments and we will come back on that the plant investments in marketing and global business capabilities. Higher net profit contribution of joint venture operations also positively impacted EBIT. Reported net profit was slightly lower than last year or the year before and that is the result of a shift in exceptional items. As you may remember, in 2010 we had the &#x20AC;199 million exceptional gain linked to the transfer of our Indonesian business and the business in New Caledonia to APB.</p>
          <p>Looking at earnings per share, they were 4.7% higher relative to net profit grew by 8.8%. And the difference has to do obviously with the increase in the weighted average number of shares, 562 million in 2010 and the average in 2011 was 585 million. And as of today, the number for 2012 will be 576 million as we have finalized the purchase of the shares and the delivery of the shares, which were related to the ASDI, which we used to pay for the beer operations in FEMSA.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at revenue and EBIT and you see them here side by side. And as I said and you can see it clearly here on the slide, organic revenue grew ahead of organic EBIT 3.6% versus the 1.4%. That has been in 2011 a deliberate choice to increase our marketing spend and to increase our investments to leverage our scale via the setup of global business services, but also in the investment in global capabilities in commerce and in supply chain.</p>
          <p>Revenue grew 6.1% to &#x20AC;17.1 billion and 3.6% of that was organic. And that is built up of a volume effect of 2.1% and the revenue per hectoliter of 1.5%. And that 1.5% revenue per hectoliter includes a 0.7% negative country mix effect, which we now include in the revenue per hectoliter.</p>
          <p>And you're happy, so we are out of the discussion every year, what's in the price mix. So we do know straight revenue per hectoliter, but we can tell you what the country mix in that was and that was for 2011 0.7% negative. And that's logic because the third of the volume growth was coming out of Russia, which obviously has lower revenue per hectoliter than the average of HEINEKEN.</p>
          <p>Looking at the currencies, they reduced revenues by 2.2%, &#x20AC;351 million. And that was mainly the Nigerian naira, which lost on average 8% and the Mexican peso, which lost 3% versus the euro. And at EBIT level that effect is &#x20AC;50 million or a decrease of 1.9%.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we continue to expect quite some volatility in currencies. We just have seen in January that's the naira lost 3% in January alone. First time consolidations added &#x20AC;753 million to revenue or 4.7% and &#x20AC;89 million to EBIT, 3.4%. And that is driven by the four months we still have as consolidation change of Mexico and Brazil, the new acquisitions in Nigeria and Ethiopia and that was partly offset by the deconsolidation of Waverley in the U.K. and the deconsolidation of Indonesia and New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>Our share of profit from joint ventures and associates grew by 22% organically, but as you have seen in the press release that includes a gain on the sale of the 21% in Kingway of &#x20AC;19 million and that is included in that figure.</p>
          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois highlighted already that 2011 was a year where we put a lot of emphasis on the topline and where we put a lot of emphasis on the activation of our key brands. And that's clearly resulted in a visible improvement of the performance of our brands. And we saw market share gains in many of our key markets, including France, the U.K., Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa. The Heineken brands increased its worldwide volume in the premium segment by 5.4% and it was the strongest in four years' time.</p>
          <p>In volumes terms, the strongest contributor to the growth of the Heineken brand were Brazil, Vietnam, France, Nigeria and Taiwan. Total marketing and selling cost in 2011 increased 9% to &#x20AC;2.2 billion. The organic increase was 4.1% or &#x20AC;82 million. What is more important is that that increase is fully concentrated on the so-called consumer facing expenses.</p>
          <p>So it is really things which are seen by consumers like advertising, like sponsoring, like POS materials and not market research, studies, development, projects, which are in-house. Know this has really been having an impact on consumers. As a percentage of revenue, marketing and sales increased 40 basis points to 12.8%. That is an increase compared to its recent history, and therefore this slide, if you look at a little bit longer time perspective, in fact, you see we are back where we were coming from.</p>
          <p>From a geographical point of view, these investments were mainly focused on Europe, Mexico, U.S.A. and Nigeria. And for 2012, we will continue to focus on winning value and volume market share. We will continue to invest behind our brands and we expect the level of marketing sales as a percentage of revenue to stay on this level.</p>
          <p>Looking at the geographic splits, Asia showed, in percentage wise, the highest improvements in 2011. And even if you deduct the &#x20AC;90 million of Kingway, then still it would be the highest growth percentage. For those who were in Singapore at the financial market conference that should not come as a surprise. APB was doing very well, Vietnam and Indonesia, and they're specifically boosted the performance of our own operations, direct operations. Korea and Taiwan showed double-digit volume growth and that's apprising in these markets.</p>
          <p>Africa had again a very strong operating performance, led by Nigeria, but also Congo and South Africa contributed to the EBIT growth, obviously offset by Egypt, where we have the big impact from the social unrest. And we had double-digit volume declines in the Egyptian markets.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, EBIT and the operating margin grew based on stable volumes, but better revenue per hectoliter and the impact of TCM and within Europe, particularly the U.K., France and Italy, where the operating companies who were driving the regional performance. As Jean already alluded to Central and Eastern Europe, EBIT was lower. Obviously, Greece played a major role there, but also the higher input cost and higher marketing cost, we were faced within Russia and an unfavorable channel and packaging brand mix in Poland.</p>
          <p>Last thing important on this slide is the development at head office. Results there decreased organically by &#x20AC;64 million. While that reflects the higher costs related to the global marketing initiatives and related to the set-up of global business services. That last initiative took &#x20AC;32 million out of that decline.</p>
          <p>The organic net profits growth was 9.2% and the net profit beia grew 8.8% to &#x20AC;1.584 billion. And the difference between the &#x20AC;1.4 billion EBIT growth and the 9.2% organic net profit growth is driven by two elements. First, net interest expenses and other financing costs decreased organically by 26%. That's the effect of lower average amount of debt organically and declining interest rates. We have an average interest rate in 2011 of 5.2% versus 6% the year before.</p>
          <p>Second element, which plays a role, is the slightly lower effective tax rate, which improved from the 27.3% in 2010 to 26.8% or 50 basis points last year. And you see also the effect of the currency fluctuations, which was &#x20AC;28 million negative, while first-time consolidations contributed &#x20AC;22 million or 1.5%.</p>
          <p>Look at the input costs, obviously, very important for us in 2011. Total raw and packaging materials accounted for over &#x20AC;3.6 billion and we had in 2011 a 2.5% increase on an per hectoliter basis, which was in line with the guidance we gave you at the beginning of last year.</p>
          <p>You can see on the graph on the left side, the high volatility of the last couple of years. And if you would have put the spot prices on there, the volatility would have been even much higher. But we managed to reduce and control this volatility through longer-term contracts through a forward-buying that we do that with barley, with glass, with cans. But obviously you cannot escape the real fluctuations.</p>
          <p>With the establishments of the global procurement company and the implementation of that company during the course of this year, we will further leverage our buying skill to drive cost efficiencies. But we also be in a much better position to hedge certain positions, because you all put it in one basket and you can really start managing that in a better way.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we are covered for around 85% of our needs and the overall expected impact on a per hectoliter basis is 6% and that is mainly driven by malted barley. As you know, the weather conditions as well as the time of the seeding, as at the time of harvest has not been very favorable in many of the European markets. So prices were pushed up. Russia has much better crops, but lower quality. And also in the Americas or in Mexico, particularly, it's not looking too good.</p>
          <p>At the same time, with the 2.5% we have last year, we had quite a positive position, so the comparables for this year are much more challenging than for some of the other players.</p>
          <p>Then TCM, it's good to look at it on a slightly longer timeframe. Since 2006, we got &#x20AC;1.1 billion out of the cost and the last or the second program of the Fit 2 Fight TCM, we finalized that at the end of last year and we achieved &#x20AC;614 million savings. And in the year itself, we added &#x20AC;178 million. And more than half of the savings were generated by the supply chain in the beginning of the program, still driven by brewery closures, but towards the end of the program very much by just productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>Our TPM program helps us to improve productivity in the breweries, which we operate and that gives also confidence going forward, because that is a continuous program. When you look at a regional basis, you see that Europe takes over 80% of the total savings. If you look at the full program in 2011, it was slightly less, because especially Central and Eastern Europe had less savings in 2011. They took 24% versus the 34% they had in the whole program. Exceptional cost last year, &#x20AC;81 million and the total for the program was &#x20AC;290 million.</p>
          <p>And then after TCM and Fit 2 Fight, cost savings never stops. So we announced a new program and we have been debating how long will we play the game of you guessing and we not answering, but finally we said let's focus on other things in our discussions. So we gave you the targets. Certainly also in view of the fact that our upfront cost involved, certainly was GBS and it would be a bit strange to give one half of the equation and not the other half.</p>
          <p>The target of &#x20AC;500 million is significant, certainly if you see that in the context of already &#x20AC;1.1 billion taken out of the cost.</p>
          <p>TCM2 is, again, focused on driving the operational efficiencies and to leverage our global skill following the formation of Global Business Services in 2010. So it's not different from TCM1 and Fit 2 Fight, it will be implemented across the supply chain, commerce, wholesale and other functions and that is also how we will report on it.</p>
          <p>Probably slightly different is that we'll have a stronger focus on the management and control of the variable cost that has to do with the global procurement company, but it has also to do that TPM is not only addressing the fixed cost, it is certainly also addressing the variable cost, the losses you make in the breweries, et cetera.</p>
          <p>The whole program will be enabled by standard practices like the sales and operations planning project, where we renew our planning systems to get that even sharper by, as I said, total for the management TPM by benchmarking exercises and by Global Business Services.</p>
          <p>Global Business Services has two main initiatives. It's the global shared service center and it's a global procurement company. As mentioned, we will incur &#x20AC;200 million upfront cost, of which &#x20AC;32 million has already been spent in 2011. So we still have &#x20AC;168 million to go in the coming three years. We will treat them as ongoing organic cost. That global shared service center will be focused initially on transactional finance for the European OpCos and has been established in Krak&#xF3;w.</p>
          <p>The first wave of OpCos are now in the phase of being rolled in. Romania and U.K. will be the first two and in April, they will have moved for a part of their transactional finance into this center in Krak&#xF3;w. And then there will be a second wave in Q3 of the year and then so we get wave planning over a couple of years until the 24 companies are absorbed by that center.</p>
          <p>And then the global procurement company will obviously obtain operational cost savings through leveraging our scale and they will do that on the variable parts, or the product related costs, but also as strongly in the normal products related cost. And these two initiatives obviously you need the systems to support it, the processors to support it and so that will underpinning these initiatives. And we're investing in that, but overall GBS has a very attractive business case and a very good payback.</p>
          <p>Talking about cost. One word on the FEMSA Cerveza cost synergies, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois already talked about how the strategy of the businesses and what we realized in overall terms. I would like to say a few words on the cost synergies, but first of all, these cost synergies are not in TCM, they are reported separately and it's a separate bucket and we don't mix the two together.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we had &#x20AC;94 million of savings, bringing the total up to &#x20AC;136 million. The original target for three-year timeframe was &#x20AC;150 million. Obviously, we will reach that in the course of this year ahead of time. What do we do after that? We won't stop driving further efficiencies and so we continue doing that, but then it will be part of TCM2.</p>
          <p>So as soon as we have reached the &#x20AC;150 million, all further activities will be part of the new TCM program. But when you look at the, we have saved three quarters not surprisingly comes out of Mexico and the rest from Brazil. And in Mexico, very much driven by the commercial area, restructuring the route-to-market, restructuring the sales structure. In addition to that obviously purchasing benefits, IT benefits, using our hosting systems, et cetera, benefits in the supply chain and quite some savings in general overheads.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, last year of Hunt for Cash, in total, we generated &#x20AC;5.8 billion free operating cash flow, of which &#x20AC;2.1 billion in last year. And the overall cash conversion rate over the period was around 130%. CapEx, &#x20AC;800 million in 2011 or 4.7% of revenue. Main working capital went down to slightly over 1% of revenue. Since 2008, since we started this program, we have slashed or we have reduced working capital by over &#x20AC;1 billion. Over &#x20AC;1 billion has been added to the cash flow in this three year time period.</p>
          <p>As a result of the cash generation, net debt to EBITDA decreased from a pro forma 3.3 times when we started the program to 2.2 times now. And in the meantime, we did some acquisitions. But we drove it to down and it is below or it is at target. You know our target is that we want to be below the 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased a little bit to &#x20AC;8.355 billion. And that increase is the result despite the very strong cash flow as the result of the acquisitions we did in the U.K., in Nigeria, in Ethiopia and the quick repayments of the ASDI towards the share we purchased for FEMSA.</p>
          <p>Jean hinted already for 2012, we have a significant increase in CapEx, &#x20AC;1.250 billion and that is not because we invested too little in the years before, but it is because the business is growing in the emerging part of the world.  And we need the capacity, we need to cater further growth in returnable packaging and that is why that CapEx is increasing in a significant way.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence, our cash conversion will drop below the 100%. In the mature markets it will stay above the 100%, you can be assured of that. But in the emerging markets it will be certainly below.</p>
          <p>In summary, so solid results for 2011, very happy with the top line growth in not always very easy markets. Now looking forward, we continue to see positive growth momentum in the emerging economies and we will remain focused on revenue enhancing initiatives in the developed markets.</p>
          <p>In order to support that momentum in the emerging markets, we will invest and we will expand capacity hence that our CapEx will raise to the &#x20AC;1,250 million. We will continue to further invest in marketing. We will continue to invest in business capabilities to leverage our global skill. Marketing and selling as a percentage of revenue will broadly be in line with 2011.</p>
          <p>Input cost per hectoliter up 6%. Our new program, TCM2, will further drive down cost, will drive operational efficiencies, will leverage the GBS organization and is expected to deliver &#x20AC;500 million within three years. And so, overall if you look at the strengths of our brand, if you look at our diversified geographic footprint, if you look at our commitment to exploit the skill within the company that gives us confidence in our ability to drive the continued growth of the company and of our business in the future.</p>

          <p>I have the TCM version, so you get one. But it is also a very nice brand, it's my favorite brand although I am absolutely not the target group and I don't say it for beer, but it's the brand with the highest margin almost in the company as Desperados sold at twice the price of mainstream beer. So you can imagine how I like it. Let's see how we market that across the countries grew 27%, 10 new countries where it is launched, let's see how we did that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Trevor Stirling, Sanford Bernstein. The inevitable three questions. First thing Africa margins were down a little bit this year, Ren&#xE9;? Is that all to do with Egypt or was it something else going on there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Egypt, it's the new operations Sona and Ethiopia and there is a currency effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, maybe you could give us some color on market share dynamics in Mexico at the moment. In the first half, you were losing a little more share than you had planned. Third quarter, I think that it stabilized a bit. A little bit of color on what's happening at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we have been losing some share in Mexico as you know. Part of it is planned for, that is that part of share which came for us at too low a margin. We couldn't have post two times 23% or a compounded, more than 40% operating profit increase if we would not have kind of hold to the margins that we created by, not only the cost savings, but also pricing.</p>
          <p>So one has to realize that it comes at the cost of market share. There is a limit to where we want to go obviously and hence, and then I alluded to that we have been investing in a brand like Carta Blanca, which is losing share in its own core region. And that for us is not something that we want to continue going further.</p>
          <p>So this has required from our side, the investments, the Sol brand is also rather weakish part of it was due to our retreat from central west Mexico more to our southern heartlands. So part of it is self-inflicted obviously. And going forward, there is of course a limit to what we can accept as share losses, that you will understand. But that starts to be very competitive.</p>
          <p>We lost around a percent of market share, 1.3% in volume, I think in value perhaps 0.9% something like that. I look at <mark type="ph" /> George (01:22:10). If I don't, I used to have a good memory, but I check from time to time. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And final question in the head office cost is &#x20AC;38 million, I think, the commercial capability expense. Is that something that's going to drop out, Ren&#xE9; or is that something we should expect to continue on going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That is continue ongoing. That is really cost, which benefits the businesses, but there is also a part of global production and sponsorships in it. So that is ongoing where with GBS that is something which will fade away once it is setup. Obviously, there is this organization cost that really the setup cost will fade away. So the big, the &#x20AC;200 million you will lose after a couple of years, but the commercial investments and structure will stay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Ren&#xE9;.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at least give somebody the mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrea Pistacchi from Citigroup. Two questions please. One on TCM2, I mean, recently I think you suggested that the savings will be reasonably backend loaded. Is that, I mean, is that still the case? And then if you could give us a sense please about the phasing of the upfront costs that you've talked about, the &#x20AC;200 million. And the second question on pricing in 2012, you're guiding to 6% input cost inflation. And in the press release, you refer to revenue growth measures to offset this. But you don't specifically mentioned pricing. So could you comment about the pricing in Europe in particular in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The first TCM. If you look at parts, which is driven by GBS that is a bit more back end loaded because then you get to full benefits. But there are many other initiatives in it, which are much more equally spread or even more frontend loaded. So overall, if you take the full program, you will see a slight skew to year two and year three, but it is not significant.</p>
          <p>Then when you look at cost, these costs obviously are a part of all the set up cost and working out in the consultants left and right, that part will be stronger in this year. And we started that and we're half last year and that will be this year. But you also there will see ongoing cost because we are rolling in countries one after the other, you have redundancy costs there, you have project teams and consultants to help a country to roll in. So also there does not, like you say, it's all in 2012 and then it's done. It's also fairly spread with a slight skew to 2012. But don't overestimate that you say, this is really big differences from year-to-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing, we never comment on how we're going to take price, you can imagine that is a competitive feature here. But obviously when you are faced with such price increase you have to take price. So it's high on the agenda of all our managing directors across Europe and it's not an easy context to do. But I've said many times, you cannot beat structural inflation on raw and pack input cost.</p>
          <p>A bad crop or a bumper crop can have an effect positive or negative. There is a natural hedge over the years between that, but if you observe for the long-term whole, you see that raw materials are on the rise because of the higher speed of the demand towards the offer and that comes mainly from Asia.</p>
          <p>So do not expect these things to go really structurally down despite the economic crisis. And so go for pricing and of course, it's different by channel, by client, by SKU, but everybody is instructed to go after the recuperation of the impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Olivier Nicolai from UBS. I just got two questions actually. Could you comment about the market dynamics in Poland and Romania? Do you expect more down trading in 2012 because in your press release you comment about the Tatra brand and the Bucegi in Romania which is as well below our premium, it's below mainstream? And second question is on your performance in the U.S. minus 3.1% volumes. Could you break it down between your Dutch portfolio and the Mexican brands? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first part Poland, Romania. Poland, very clearly we come from a much higher base. So the down trading or the mix deterioration in the Polish market is a general phenomenon. Yes, it is due to competitive pressure from the single smaller player, who has been more aggressive on price. Mind you, Poland had kind of 10 euro per hectoliter higher kind of average price than let's say Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, the Polish market enjoyed the higher prices and we have seen over the last two years already development of that spiraling down. It has been fueled by the I will say the market aggressor that takes the price level down since the two other players and we also, we operate a broad portfolio, where we have the highest Heineken, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:27:56) Warka, Tatra to name only these ones that skews automatically the whole demand to the lower end of the portfolio. That is what is going on. And that is not a good news. It's very difficult to resist. You better go where the market is. But at the same time we keep on investing in our higher margin brands.</p>
          <p>And whenever we could return to a more healthier situation, we would do that. But Central Eastern Europe is very competitive. And where in Western Europe the dynamics is much more with the trade, in Central Europe it's still a lot also between the players if you will.</p>
          <p>Romania, the problem is not so acute, because you work on an average lower level, so differences are not so big and our operation was able to and increase its market share, but also substantially its contribution. So there the things is really going in a positive way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the U.S., yes, it's a mixed bag, obviously between the Dutch and the rest of the portfolio, the Dutch portfolio was minus 5%. And within that you saw that the light beers were really...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hard hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...hard hit. Heineken much more in line over the Heineken brands, much more inline with our overall portfolio around the 3% was an improvement versus the end of the year, but that's too early to cry victory and that's certainly not what we want to do.</p>
          <p>At the same time, you see Dos Equis growing at 15% year-on-year, growing very fast. The Tecate brands, which is much more a mainstream position in its pricing on the West Coast is a bit down as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I add one dimension on the light to bring in perspective. We ask basically for the same price for the light beer as for the regular beer. There's a 1.5% difference of alcohol degree, you've got less for the bucks. And in times where people are really looking into down trading, treating themselves, well, lesser than before, that's definitely plays a role.</p>
          <p>A lot of people have asked me, yeah, but why don't you decrease the price to boost your volumes? Now that's exactly what we want to avoid. Heineken Light was to address different drinking occasion, it's a premium product. So we prefer accepting that higher decrease in our sales than going for margin diminution just because we have to address temporary crisis. So that is where we stand. But it's very logical in the actual context that you see the light version declining more, it's quite logical.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have two questions from the audio line. Our first question comes from Gerard Rijk from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've two questions. First about Eastern Europe and the profitability and the market share gains that you have booked in several countries. Do you think that we are at the start of that momentum of gaining market share or what's your market share or were your market share gains mainly based on more faithful pricing based on more faithful input cost in 2011 versus your competitors?</p>
          <p>Second question is on Russia, I just understood that Russia is rebuilding profits at the end of the year or in the fourth quarter. Can you elaborate on that why that is happening? And has there been, is that due to the loading effects, pre-excise?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on Nigeria, 10% up organically in volumes in 2011. In January something happened in that country. What has been the impact of the January events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me start in the reverse order by Nigeria. If something would have happened, we would have informed you. So we never give trading updates outside of the quarters. But take it from us that if something really nasty would have happened, we would have informed you. This is not a case.</p>
          <p>Your second question is about Russia. Now I was in Russia just the last week. I think what we have been, it's a very phased exercise where you have to go back in time, when we have that enormous excise duty increase, we pushed our price increases too early and too high.</p>
          <p>We lost tremendous market share. The volume base at which we were then operating was totally unsustainable going forward. It was a year where we made very decent profits. But once more, this is a heavy operation in Russia, with a very large industrial and distribution base. And going forward that diminished volume share was just not acceptable going forward.</p>
          <p>So what we have been doing, it is to, of course going to a long movement of dealing back the price increases to the market. So you regain your share, but at the same time you lose disproportionally your profitability because you take a kind of a double hit in this kind of thing. Now we have been regaining share in an incredible way, we grew our business volume wise 24% last year on a market which was down around 2%.</p>
          <p>So that is in itself a sterling performance. But it is out of the past we took the lesson to be a price follower. We are not a market leader, we have to be very clever here and not apply the traditional kind of broad leadership approach that we take. We have to observe and take the niches into market. We operate in a lot of regions in Russia and a lot of times also these price increases they go region-by-region even brand-by-brand and SKU-by-SKU.</p>
          <p>So, what the Russian organization has been doing is to really boost its capacity of understanding how you can take price in the market, in a competitive dynamic. And also the second half of last year, they started again to price up slowly and slowly and slowly.</p>
          <p>And this is bringing us, again, territories where we have more and more acceptable margins going forward. Now again now in January, you have again an exercise duty increase and we take a very cautious view. We might have again a little dip, but we will take it up.</p>
          <p>Russia is a very difficult market, make no mistake. There is high pressure from the authorities on it to operate. It is a difficult market. I'm not so sure about the growth potential of next year that it might be minute or less likely decreasing, but what we concentrate on in Russia is on the one hand we are in, I would say, value plus proposals. We concentrate on much less brands than we did before, but we do it more thoughtfully and reaping economies of scale doing that. And on the other hand, we keep on investing in the top end portfolio. You have a very laddered market with a lot of price points in direction market. That makes it still a very attractive market and so we invest disproportionately in the higher end of the markets. And our key brands, Heineken and Amstel have been increasing in Russia, a big thanks, we're very satisfied the way we go. And that also increases your mix, if you want. That is the policy that we follow in Russia going forward. Hope that gives some clarity.</p>
          <p>And finally, if the gains of share and CE are price driven, I would tend to say no, though, I cannot exclude that marginally it can happen, if we gain some share in Poland. In the context of the competition that we face in Poland, yes, it is at this, but we are not the aggressors in that context. But I would say that in the countries where we perform well, I would not make the statement that we gain our share on the back of diminishing prices in our portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, you've left very little uncovered with a thorough explanation, great results. But Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, I wondered if you could take the Vietnam example, and look out say the next three or five years. You've grown the capacity at Danang and Ho Chi Minh, but I understand that it's now your second largest worldwide market for Heineken brand. And something that grows well from this level is going to require I suspect more capacity. Tell us how you look at Vietnam, say, going out for the next three to five years, scale it up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Vietnam, we have master plans in place to continue to expand capacity on existing locations. So, we didn't announce any Greenfield. We have space enough to increase capacity as demand goes. And those plans are in place in Vietnam, Tom, to follow the growth that we continue, whether we expect to continue structurally.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can the growth accelerate from here now that it passed into that number two status for Heineken worldwide, how fast is the brand growing?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ren&#xE9;, for you. I look at the very low borrowing costs and I see that Heineken has close to &#x20AC;5 billion of fixed liabilities coming due over the next four years. You'll probably want to stick to the healthy dose of leverage for the future. What can you do to extend the terms even before the 2013 and 2014 maturities come due to prepare yourself for an environment where doing so later might be very disadvantageous in terms of the then existing market rates of interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you have seen it right, we have close to &#x20AC;2 billion to refinance in 2013. And conservative as we are, we will go to the markets obviously, largely before that to cover the needs. And if you look how bond markets are at the moment that looks a pretty good time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, very good. And then, Ren&#xE9;, do you take any lessons from your balance sheet liability management and then look across to the pension liabilities in this extraordinary low rate environment, what steps does it drive you to towards the pension and health liabilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so in the pension, in fact, we have two big pension funds, one in the U.K., one in the Netherlands. They are a bit differenced liabilities in the Netherlands are limited, because we are only obliged to a maximum premium to be paid. So officially the liability is limited. That is different for the U.K., where part of the pensioners have to write to an obligatory indexation. What we have done in the U.K., we have closed the pension fund for the new people sort of people who are entering the company come in on a different scheme and in that way we try to manage the deficits, which is clearly there in the U.K. fund.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have obviously with the trustees a program to refund what we will contribute increases with the profitability of the company, but we make major efforts to close the gap.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Two questions on the marketing spend. I remember when you did the Paris presentation in the 2010, I seem to takeaway feeling that this was a multiyear focus in increasing marketing. And we seem to get a slightly different message today that we've closed the gap. Are you happy that we're marketing the net sales somewhere in the 12% to 13% range? You really have closed that gap with big FMCG or is there still a further leg to come in at some stage?</p>
          <p>And the other question really looking at slide 23 that Ren&#xE9; showed us. It looks quite dramatic to have gone through 11.3% to 12.8% of revenues. But it does strike you had some quite big changes in scope in that period that probably helped with the sale of the wave, they don't see FEMSA coming with probably higher number. I mean what was the true organic number of those two years in terms of marketing increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, well, what we set organically we increased marketing by about 4%, but what is much more important and because this &#x20AC;2.2 billion is quite a big back of activities, things which are seen by consumers, not seen by consumers and one of things Alexis is doing is making sure that we get much more money out of the marketing we spend.</p>
          <p>And he is rationalizing on things like market research, not in the sense that you don't do market research, but much more combining, that's getting learnings out of more markets, getting contracts over markets. So, the increase which the consumer-facing spend has is much higher, is more than double of the 4% increase you have seen, that is around 9%, 10% is the real increase which touches the consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you like to go back to, Ren&#xE9; showed a table where you saw that our marketing and sales expenditures they dropped quite a bit with the financial crisis to 2008 or 2009. It came back to levels which we historically had before with 2007 being a very high year, because of the introduction of Heineken Light 2006, 2007 were those years.</p>
          <p>So, one has to realize that at the level that we have reached now, we feel pretty comfortable that we can carry out the programs, it's multi year programs. Building brands is nothing you're doing one year and then you stop. This is a way of life. It's really what Ren&#xE9; has pointed about is the consumer facing. That is what is the most important in putting our money in priority there.</p>
          <p>So, building the pull rather than the push. Of course you have to do both, but we were perhaps in the past a little bit more skewed to the push and not enough to the pull. And so, under the guidance of Alexis Nasard, we are really rebuilding our capabilities in creating the pull. This is all at the core of being brand led and consumer centric, it's about that. And hence it's not only about the level of money you spent, it's about what you do with the money.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to be clear, medium-term we should expect marketing over net sales to stay somewhere around with the 13% type level, but within that the quality is probably improving over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is what you can take and you should certainly not draw the conclusion that you say you come back on things you have said in the past. The company we are growing, where we had three years of an exclusive focus on cost and cash, because it was so urgent in the company. We turned the ship towards top line growth, winning in the marketplace, winning volume and value share, investing behind our brands and that's what we are doing and you see a lot about what has happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris Pitcher from Redburn. Following on from that point, you mentioned consumer facing spend was up 9% and total sales and marketing was up 4%. Is it broadly a 50-50 split at the current level? Because I'd imagine the businesses that you acquired are probably more skewed towards the push than the pull side. Is that broadly the split to spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, no, I mean I won't enter even in the beginning of response on that. Look, your question is very valid, don't misunderstand me, because these are really very competitive things. You are right, some markets are much more skewed to push and others much more to pull. Obviously, the United States is entirely skewed to pull. If you don't have a pull, I mean the push is only the margin you give to the distributor, that's a given. All the rest is about pull. If you go to Mexico, obviously it's much more the push when you have 260,000 distribution points that you weekly reach. The power of your push is of course much bigger and you can leverage that in another way, that's absolutely true.</p>
          <p>But tangentially what we're trying to bring across here that also in Mexico it's not because you go with your lorry to every single point of sale in Mexico that you're going to sell and create excitement for your brands. In Mexico in our operation of CM we clearly have to leverage the pull, it's not good enough. And this is where much more attention goes than in the past in an operation like CM in Mexico. It's in the mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow-on from that. If we look at the development, the business that you bought from FEMSA, you've obviously extracted costs, improved profitability very well and we have another six months of specific savings to come out. Do you think there's enough within ongoing savings to keep growing that margin? Or are we in a period now perhaps of greater investment for those assets to grow that brand pull?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we have invested more in marketing sales in Mexico to bring the brands to a higher level and that is not something you do six months and that is...</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we started this year, so indeed in 2010 we were much more geared into the cost thing and taking stock and reorganize and what have you. In 2011, we really started to invest in the brand, that's going to be a long haul program. We'll make that equation work for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one follow-up question. On your fifth pillar, which is about leadership and people, has there anything changed that you can tell us about executive remuneration, that 625 people, are they going to become bigger equity owners in the business? Is their targets becoming longer reaching, I'm trying to get a feel whether you've had some real tangible changes in the remuneration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All these 635 or 53 people are on that long-term and short-term incentive programs. Those have been designed years ago. The long-term program is paid in stock of the company that we purchase in the market, obviously. And there was our three years rolling programs, which give an attention to the top line growth and the cost in that balance, but perhaps a bit more skewed lately to the revenue growth, so we're very consistent in that.</p>
          <p>We have also been introduced, that's more recent, more a forced calibration, because if you want to have an excellent company, you have to a little bit mandate a calibration of your talent. I think it has something competitive, it's a little bit challenging. But I think it bring in good results. We have the first year where we did that. And then, we did touch very clearly business objectives from personal development objectives, so we give attention to both of that.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, you got rewards on what you deliver, on the other hand there are skills that you need to develop. And that's skills but also personality traits that you have to work on to make you a better, more performing person. And we devote attention to both of that. And that latter one is also something which is new and we do that consistently across the 600 people in the 71 operations around the world, which you saw here on the chart here.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. Yeah, Matthew Webb from JPMorgan. Two questions please. First on the CapEx, obviously it's a big step up plan for 2012. I just wondered which markets are going to be the recipients of the additional productive capacity. Obviously, Vietnam has already been mentioned as one. And also whether this is the new normal level of CapEx or whether 2012 is an unusually high year? And also just finally on the CapEx whether there's much in there for TCM2 in the CapEx to get the benefits from that?</p>
          <p>And then the second question on input costs, you said that malted barley is the main driver of that. I just wonder whether you'd be willing to disclose roughly the rate of inflation you are expecting on malting barley and also whether that is predominately a European issue or whether it's wider than that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe on the CapEx, the increase is absolutely geared towards developing markets, not Vietnam, because it is not consolidated. So that is not in the free operating cash flow. Therefore it is Africa and it is Latin America. And in Africa, it shouldn't extend its capacity extension, but it is also, for instance, in Nigeria we just bought five breweries with capacity. So there we don't extend capacity. We need to upgrade some of the capacity, but there the investments will be on returnable packaging, because with the growth of the market and the growth of our business, you need bottles and crates and that is under CapEx as well.</p>
          <p>When you look at Mexico, there we have a number of big packaging projects and the Carta Blanca brand mentioned by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, which we fully relaunched in new packaging. Obviously that takes a lot of CapEx. The split between capacity extension and packaging in the extension of the CapEx is around three quarters, one quarter 70-30, three quarters to one quarter. And longer term, I hope that we need as much CapEx as we spend now because that's good news for the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your question on the input cost, I don't think we give the split between raw and pack. So we leave it at the 6%, which is a complexion obviously that the raw material has been much more than the pack as you can imagine. And it's true that the barley market is tied to the general grain market, be it that people or farmers grow malting barley for brewing. So the only alternative use is to give it as pick as animal feed, as I always say.</p>
          <p>The problem is when the whole crop market is going up, the prices are going up. But there is a lot of individual contracting, because we require from specific varieties that we put on the field. So it not a kind of an open market, but the price is a derivative of that open market. So, there is not a lot of room to maneuver except from long-term contracting and smart spot buying. That is, therefore we don't kind of publish more in detail what the results of that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But broadly by geography, the pressure on barley price is higher in Europe and Western Europe?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were, because that is of course related to the, and brewing barley, the big market, it's North America and Europe. The rest is much more and you have a bit in Australia too. But we derive the bulk of our purchases come from malt come from Europe. Africa is supplied from Europe, Europe is supplied from Europe. Obviously, the Americas are supplied from Americas. That's a bit how it works and Asia is a mixed bag between Europe and Australia, roughly.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. When you said that growth in Russia may be slightly down, were you referring to the market or to your Russian business? And related to that, can we still expect some recovery related to both market growth from Heineken in 2012 in Russia?</p>
          <p>Second question, excluding country mix, you mentioned that revenue per hectoliter was up 2.2% in 2011. Is it fair to assume that this will be higher in 2012? And thirdly, can you also say a few words on the regional split of the TCM costs and savings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Russia, no the comment was made on the market, slightly down, certainly not on our business. So, we will continue to go for market share in Russia. The 2.2% price mix with result in geographic thing was in 2011. We will work hard to get a price mix again in 2012. It's too early to give a figure on that, because we are in certain markets still negotiating and seeing what we can do.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it is also your build up of your portfolio as we have said, more Desperados more Heineken, and more Zywiec and that will help you in your overall price mix. So, it's not only pricing towards the retailers or the wholesalers, it's also the developments in the markets.</p>
          <p>Then for TCM, as with the previous programs, Europe will continue to take the lion share of the program, but with initiatives like the global procurement company obviously that gets more a global skill. That take for the coming years that it will be still very much huge to Europe, the financial shared service center is for the first coming years catering for the European companies, it's the idea to enlarge it afterwards to other geographies. But first, we're all in Europe. Europe will have the biggest part of the program as it has done before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then is it possible that you can comment on what you're seeing happening currently in your European market especially, are you seeing any inflection points, inflection in the trading? France has been very strong, Netherlands is your big market. Can you see austerity measures having a greater impact this year? I know that's not the peak consumption period, but any comments would be welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest risk that you face, it's besides the self-inflicted price rises because of the input costs, but it's those who can be in addition inflicted by governments and they can be painful. Those are things that are difficult to mitigate because at the end of the day, it's the sovereign state who decides that. As far as we can see and up so far, we have been able to manage that. And a lot of governments have also made a tradeoff of not killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, if you will. But if you take a specific case like Greece and I would take two examples, one is Greece where you know in the past two, three years they have been causing, doubling the excise duties over a period of 18 months and that has of course, had its effect on demand.</p>
          <p>That's bringing the whole equation into a negative spiral. Opposed to that was the reaction of the government of Ireland who lowered the excise duties in an attempt to alleviate not us, but the pub industry, because you have a lot of independent pub owners. And that worked very well for them and for us as an industry. So, you have both extremes in front of stressed situations. But I would guess that these are the kind of risk that we face. You cannot build them in. You know what can happen, but that is what it is. I guess if I would look at the whole of Europe, it's obvious that a country like Greece is in a very bad state and that will remain so for quite a bit of time. Volumes are down, were down 12% last year.</p>
          <p>We still have a profitable operation with good margins. We command a high market share, which is kind of a saving therein. But on the other hand, Greece is not representing, we are very much diversified. So, this is bearable for a group like Heineken. It's very difficult for me to make what could happen this on the other country, but we all feel that Europe is in a recession. And it's not going to be a pretty place, but that is not a reason to step away from the programs that we have engaged on, which are long-term programs aimed at two things, continue to improve our cost base in Europe.</p>
          <p>We are busy with that since 10 years in a row. Mind you, we closed 46 plants malting and brewing over the last 10 years here in Europe. So, the productivity and cost-savings measures are really deeply embedded in our European organization and we are convinced that you have to continue to invest in your top line even if the market shrinks, go for share and value share.</p>
          <p>And it's that constant re-adaptation of going for share, but re-tailor your base that makes that in the majority of our countries. Despite all the havoc, we are making progress in terms of return. Yes, it's a heavy work, but still Europe is a very large cash flow source for us and has been historically fueling all our expansion overseas, making us able to transform the profile of our group to a European company and towards a much more worldwide company and skewed towards emerging markets, which we hope will bring mechanically with the demographic growth and the economic growth.</p>
          <p>And if that continues, we'll bring us in to better territory of over time in a higher growth profile over time. And of course, in those economies you can speak for hours about the interdependence of the growth in the emerging markets and what's happening in the developed world because it's still quite interdependent. But we are part of the larger world and we have to do what it takes to make our position stronger.</p>

          <p>4.1% last year. That is Amstel, Heineken and Windhoek. And we have a stellar performance of Windhoek, a very good performance of Heineken, and a somewhat mediocre performance of Amstel. But when I say mediocre it was not growth, it's kind of mid-single digit decrease on the Amstel brand. I want to say that because I know that some numbers are flying around, around that, but those were the results that we acted in 2011.</p>
          <p>So, we still see that for our portfolio as a reasonable good year of growth. We kind of grew perhaps a little bit ahead of the market, at least with the market. So, that it is a competitive market, that's for sure. I mean, make no mistake. We know how determined the competitor is, but as we are. But once more, we compete in the premium end of the market and this is really where we want to focus our efforts and attention. And again, it's building the pool, which is that gets the lion's share of our attention.</p>

          <p>One last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:05:20) three questions. I understand you don't want to give guidance, no guidance on EBITDA, I understand that, but when I look at the EBIT margin performance in 2011, if I extract Asia, right, and a lot of that clearly like suppose goes to APB, most of your divisions were down in terms of margins. So, would you want to care to give some color in terms of how margins, where could they be up in 2012, in what regions? So that's one question.</p>
          <p>The second one, how concerned should we be about Americas being a drag on EBIT margin expansion? The reason I say that is because I estimated margins in the U.S. and Brazil are probably single-digits for you. And I wondered if the Mexican margins given the share loss to Modelo are sustainable.</p>
          <p>And then the third and last question regarding OXXO, what color can you give us there and what percentage of the sales of FEMSA Cerveza in Mexico go through OXXO if the FEMSA people once they are out of the shares, could also open up the doors to Modelo. Can you comment on that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe let me go round to EBIT margin, we explained already the EBIT margin in Africa, the effect of the new acquisitions in Egypt, Western Europe. Margin was up and that was based on cost and price mix. If we look at Central and Eastern Europe, there you see the effect of Greece on your margins and because obviously in that region, Greece has by far the highest margins. If you look at the Americas, there you see a slight decline, but that is the effect of the first four months of Brazil and Mexico.</p>
          <p>Overall, the margins in Mexico are in line with what we have in the Americas, but there is a seasonality and it's so the first four months having relatively low operating margin and these are consolidated in. And as you said Asia had a strong increase in the margins. So that is a bit, the picture.</p>

But just to give you a thought, when we did the acquisition, we have been contemplating to say "Why going for exclusivity in the OXXO stores, why not opening it up?" That means that you have to pay less margin because obviously you pay for the exclusivity. There is a benefit for both. And then OXXO could sell more beer, we have to pay less margin. Ultimately, we have chosen for the exclusivity and we are very happy, because it's a good way to build our brands. And that is exactly what Mexico is needing. And in 8.5 years, we are not too worried if that exclusivity would go away if that will go with the proper margin structures accompanying that or linked to it.</p>

          <p>Again, sorry, just to follow-up on the America. So the margins for the U.S. business you are saying are similar to what have in the rest of that region?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Not of the U.S. business, the U.S. business has higher margins is in the imports business. And Mexico is overall not having a big impact on the region as a whole, but the first four months had a bit that downwards had effect on the margins overall, I'm sure you won't to see that next year back.</p>
